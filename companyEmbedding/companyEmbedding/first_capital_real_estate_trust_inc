Risk Considerations
An investment in First Capital Real Estate Trust Incorporated involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the information set forth in the "Risk Factors" section of the Prospectus for a discussion of material risk factors relevant to an investment in our Common Shares, including, but not limited to, the following:

There is currently no public trading market for our Common Shares, and there may never be one. This is a blind pool offering, so you will not have the opportunity to evaluate our investments before we make them.
If we are unable to raise substantial funds, we will be limited in the number of investments we may make, and the value of your investments in our Common Shares will fluctuate with the performance of the specific investments we make.
We and our advisor have a limited operating history. We have no established financing sources and the performance of our sponsor's prior real estate investment programs may not be indicative of our future results. Our sponsor has limited experience in managing a public REIT or any other kind of public investment program.
Following the NAV pricing start date, the purchase of Common Shares under our DRIP and the repurchase of Common Shares under our share repurchase program will be at a price equal to our NAV per Common Share, which will be based upon subjective judgments, and may not reflect the amount that you might receive for your Common Shares in a market transaction.
Our advisor and its affiliates, including all of our executive officers and some of our directors, will face conflicts of interest caused by their compensation arrangements with us. We will pay our advisor and its affiliates substantial fees for their services, including, among other things, the selection, financing and acquisition of our investments; the management and leasing of our properties; the servicing of our mortgage, bridge, mezzanine or other loans; the administration of our other investments and the disposition of our assets. These fees will reduce the amount of cash available for investment or distributions to shareholders.
You are limited in your ability to sell your Common Shares pursuant to our share repurchase program.
We will make some of or all of our distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, including the proceeds of our public offering, cash advanced to us by our advisor, cash resulting from a waiver of asset management fees or property management fees or from borrowings (including borrowings secured by our assets). This may reduce the amount of capital we invest and negatively impact the value of your investment.
There can be no assurance that any distributions will be made, and distributions are not guaranteed.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve expected cash flows necessary to continue to pay initially established distributions or maintain distributions at any particular level, or that distributions will increase over time.
We have broad authority to incur debt, and high debt levels could hinder our ability to make distributions and could decrease the value of your investment.
First Capital Real Estate Trust Incorporated has qualified as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for the tax year 2013, and we intend to make a REIT election for Federal income tax purposes, commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2013.
The share ownership restrictions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for REITs and the 9.8% share ownership limit in our charter may inhibit market activity in our Common Shares.
Real estate-related investments are subject to numerous risks, including risks relating to leverage, tenant nonrenewal, vacancies, inability to sell or refinance on favorable terms or at all, adverse regulatory changes, uninsured losses, adverse market conditions, and environmental hazards, any of which, if realized, could adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our Common Shares.
No offering is made to New York residents except by a Prospectus filed with the Department of Law of the State of New York. The Attorney General of the State of New York has not passed on or endorsed the merits of this offering.


Cabot Lodge Securities LLC (Member FINRA / SIPC) is the dealer manager for First Capital Real Estate Trust Incorporated.

All information contained in this material is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the prospectus.
The achievement of any or all goals is not guaranteed. There is no assurance that the value of the real estate will be sufficient to return any portion of the investors' original capital. These securities are being offered on a best efforts basis. No public market currently exists, and one may never exist, for shares of our stocks. We have a limited operating history as a REIT, and our sponsor has no experience operating a REIT or public programs.

Ron Cobb
President
Mr. Cobb began his professional career in real estate as a construction Project Manager with a major regional construction company. His most notable project included managing the construction of the $50MM Tonopalo luxury timeshare project in Lake Tahoe, CA. In that capacity, he was responsible for all phases of development from securing pre-development entitlements through owner acceptance of individual units. Tonopalo has since become a model for best practices used in the development of beach front property in the Lake Tahoe Basin by the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency. Also in the Lake Tahoe Basin, Mr. Cobb oversaw the construction of the successful retail component of the Heavenly Village in Stateline, NV. Prior to these projects, he oversaw the remodel of a 40 year old motel into what is now the $100MM Siena Hotel Spa Casino in downtown Reno, NV. The remodel added luxury suites, a spa ranked in the top five of all spas in the West. In addition to his duties as a commercial real estate broker and partner with Commercial Partners of Nevada, Mr. Cobb serves as Managing Partner of New Mexico’s preeminent active adult community, Jubilee Los Lunas where he oversees the development of this 422 unit subdivision.

Managing Director
Mr. Fields has over 20 years of experience in the securities and investment field with extensive experience in financial analysis, private equity transactions and raising capital.

He assembled the requisite Executive Team, Board of Directors and developed distribution channels with both private and public corporations. In creating a new asset class, a significant amount of legal compliance and enforceability issues required resolutions. In the 2013 legislature, he led the effort to enact California legislation (AB905) by meeting with lobbyists, policy advisors and legislatures from both political parties. Mr. Fields raised capital from a wide-range of international and domestic investors and led the A round, subsequent funding rounds and acquired and negotiated a funding partner to provide over $100,000,000 of project capital.

The Opportunity
In these trying times we believe that we all need to find a way to generate current income. Most smaller investors either do not allocate a portion of their portfolios to real estate, or if they do, typically it's by directly investing in a small rental property, with all of the headaches of operating a small property. First Capital Real Estate Trust Incorporated provides you with the opportunity to invest in large commercial real estate through a pooled REIT that is managed by highly experienced real estate professionals - letting them and your money work for you, without any of the headaches of operating your own real estate assets.
Our Investment Objectives
  
  Our primary investment objectives are:
  
  
    To provide you with stable cash distributions; 
    
To preserve and protect your capital contribution; 
    
To provide you with portfolio diversification; 
    
To realize growth in the value of our assets upon the sale of such assets; 
    
To provide you with the potential for future liquidity through the sale of our assets, a sale or merger of our company or a listing of our Common Shares on a national securities exchange.
    

In order to meet our investment objectives we employ a dual strategy intended to generate current cash flow and capital appreciation. There is no assurance that these investment objectives will be met. 
    


Our Dual Strategy

          When you invest with First Capital Real Estate Trust Incorporated you join those investors who expect to benefit from our dual strategy.
          







We focus on acquiring existing stabilized cashflowing assets to support stable, consistent distributions to our shareholders and 




We focus on acquiring opportunistic assets which we can reposition, redevelop or remarket to create value-enhancement and capital appreciation.










          By pursuing both strategies simultaneously we believe we can most effectively achieve our desired investment objectives.

Highlights

												Serenity Bay is a beachfront development site situated on the southwestern coast of Antigua.
												Nearly 400 luxury condo and villa units are expected to be built, which will be sold through a Citizenship by Investment Program (CIP) or separately as whole or fractional unit sales.
												The CIP allows for the acquisition of Antiguan citizenship under certain investment conditions.

This visa-free travel privilege is a very attractive opportunity for Chinese, Eastern European, and Middle Eastern nationals.
												The luxury resort is planned to have several pools, tennis courts, private beach access, restaurants and bars, retail shops, and a spa.
										

											  Upon completion, First Capital will generate a positive income stream by leasing the land and improvements to an operator who will provide rental and management services for the unit owners as well as operate ancillary departments including spa, food & beverage operations, parking, retail, and more.
												Gross unit sales are estimated at $224 million, while total project build-out costs are estimated at $180 million. Expected timeline to complete construction is approximately 24 months after breaking ground.

NEW YORK, March 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- First Capital Real Estate Trust Incorporated ("First Capital"), a Maryland real estate investment trust ("REIT"), today announced that on March 31, 2017 it entered into an Interest Contribution Agreement ("Agreement") with PhotoMedex, Inc. a Nevada corporation (NASDAQ:   CM and TASE: PHMD), and with a wholly owned subsidiary of PhotoMedex, pursuant to which First Capital is obligated or has an option to contribute its interests in certain properties (or the entities having or which expect to acquire rights to such properties) in a series of installments by no later than December 31, 2017, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Agreement, in exchange for these interests, PhotoMedex is obligated to issue shares of its common stock ("Common Stock") and newly designated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock  ("Preferred Stock"), as described below.  








"We are pleased to further advance our core strategy, which is intended to create value for our investors," said Suneet Singal, Chief Executive Officer of First Capital. 
"We are highly supportive of the transaction with First Capital for our shareholder base.  We made the decision to shift our business strategy into this sector in view of the opportunities we believe this portfolio of assets will provide," said Dennis McGrath, Chief Financial Officer of PhotoMedex.
First Contribution
In the first contribution installment, which is expected to close on or about May 17, 2017, First Capital has agreed to transfer to PhotoMedex its interests in four vacant land sites located in Atwater and Merced, California intended for development into gas stations, and its interests in a single family residential development located in Los Lunas, New Mexico. 
In consideration for such transfers, First Capital will receive Common Stock and Preferred Stock of PhotoMedex having a value of $10 million, based upon a 7.5% premium above a volume-weighted average price ("VWAP") of PhotoMedex's Common Stock (the "Per Share Value"). First Capital will receive a number of shares of Common Stock equal to up to 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of PhotoMedex immediately prior to the initial closing.  The balance of the shares will be paid in PhotoMedex's Preferred Stock, which will be convertible into Common Stock subject to a vote of PhotoMedex stockholders in accordance with the applicable rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
Subsequent Contributions 
Pursuant to the Agreement, First Capital has also agreed to contribute to PhotoMedex its interests in properties located in Texas and in Antigua, provided that certain conditions set forth in the Agreement are satisfied by December 31, 2017.  These interests include First Capital's interest in a hotel located in Amarillo, Texas and rights it expects to obtain in two development properties in Antigua which are planned for resort development. In exchange for these interests, and provided that the conditions for the contributions have been satisfied, PhotoMedex will issue shares of its stock to First Capital.  Assuming that both the Texas and the Antigua interests are contributed to PhotoMedex, the number of shares to be issued will be determined by dividing $20 million by the Per Share Value. The contributions of the foregoing interests are not interdependent; the interests may be transferred at different times on or prior to December 31, 2017.
Optional Contribution
First Capital has the option, at its discretion, to contribute its interests in two additional properties to PhotoMedex if certain conditions as set forth in the Agreement are satisfied by December 31, 2017. These properties consist of development properties in South Carolina and in Baja California, Mexico.  First Capital does not currently have rights to either of these properties. Subject to First Capital obtaining such rights, and to the satisfaction of the other conditions set forth in the Agreement, including the commitment by First Capital to pay $66,500,000 in connection with the development of these properties, PhotoMedex will issue to First Capital a number of shares of PhotoMedex determined by dividing $86,450,000 by the Per Share Value.  In addition, PhotoMedex will issue to First Capital a five year warrant (the "Warrant") to purchase up to 25,000,000 shares of PhotoMedex's Common Stock at an exercise price of $3.00 per share, which would vest upon the achievement of various milestones specified in the Agreement. The number of warrant shares and the exercise price will be equitably adjusted in the event of a stock split, stock combination, recapitalization or similar transaction.
Voting Agreement
On March 31, 2017, in connection with its entry into the Agreement, First Capital entered into a Shareholder Voting Support and Confidentiality Agreement with certain PhotoMedex stockholders, pursuant to which such stockholders  agreed, among other things, to vote in favor of the adoption of the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
Other Matters
The Agreement is subject to the usual pre- and post-closing representations, warranties and covenants, and restricts First Capital's conduct in certain respects that may affect the conduct of its affairs between the signing and December 31, 2017.
Following the closings, First Capital expects to consider the distribution of certain of the shares of PhotoMedex Common Stock it receives to its partners and stockholders, subject to appropriate corporate and other approvals and to compliance with all applicable federal and state securities laws and other applicable laws and regulations. 
Following the Initial Closing, Suneet Singal, the Chief Executive Officer of First Capital, is expected to be designated as Chief Executive Officer of PhotoMedex.  Mr. Singal will continue to serve as Chief Executive Officer of First Capital following the Initial Closing.  
Maxim Group LLC acted as sole financial advisor to First Capital Real Estate Trust Incorporated in connection with the proposed transaction.
There can be no assurance that any or all of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement will be consummated, or that the transactions will be consummated in the form currently set forth in the Agreement, which may be amended by the parties or terminated on certain conditions.
PhotoMedex is not a real estate investment trust, or "REIT".
Neither First Capital nor any of its officers or directors has any material relationship with PhotoMedex or any of its subsidiaries, or with any director or officer thereof.
There can be no assurance that any or all of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement will be consummated, or that the transactions will be consummated in the form currently set forth in the Agreement, which may be amended by the parties or terminated on certain conditions.
For additional information about the transaction, please see First Capital's Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC and which will be available at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.  The Agreement will be filed as an exhibit to its Current Report on Form 8-K.

Real estate investment trust First Capital Real Estate Trust Inc. has agreed to acquire interest and contract rights to more than 2,000 residential lots, most of them in the Sacramento region, for about $82 million.




New York-based First Capital entered into the agreement with Roseville-based Evergreen Communities Inc. and La Jolla Pacific Investments LLC. Evergreen president Mike Stettner said the deal covers different conditions for each of the eight properties in the portfolio, and the properties will be put into the REIT separately. The transaction is set to close this quarter, subject to approval from First Capital’s board and the landowners.

                            First Capital CEO and Sacramento native Suneet Singal said the deal will allow him to put… more 










 


Stettner said the lots are at various stages of development, from ready to build to awaiting final approvals. The master agreement with First Capital will allow Evergreen to move ahead on lot development, he said, at a time when the Sacramento region is running notably short on lots ready to build on.
“We viewed this as an opportunity,” he said. “We can acquire dollars to acquire more land and do the needed infrastructure.”
Sacramento native Suneet Singal, the CEO of First Capital, said the agreement allows him to put his firm’s faith in the Sacramento home market into action. “We just think the fit as a whole is really good,” he said.
Of the total of 2,026 lots, 2,000 are in planned developments in Sacramento, Placer and El Dorado counties, Stettner said. The remaining 26 are in two finished-lot projects in Fresno County. He said a speculated deal figure of $82 million is in the ballpark of the actual price.




 


Singal and Stettner said attorneys from Downey Brand LLP and Stoel Rives LLP provided significant assistance in the deal.
About 1,000 of the local lots are in the Placer Vineyards project, in an unincorporated part of the county near Roseville. Guy Spitzer, a land specialist who helped broker the agreement for those lots, said the deal is a sign of the pending crunch for homebuilders.

In 2016 and ‘15, the Sacramento region has seen 30 percent annual gains in new home sales, he said, constituting about 8,000 homes. But while there are approved master plans for more new homes, he said, most lots still need significantly more work.
“Where the market is now, someone has to invest in the infrastructure,” he said. Placer Vineyards is on the verge of final approvals before infrastructure construction can begin, he said.
First Capital’s purchase includes both residential and commercial lots in Placer Vineyards, Spitzer said.

 Please read carefully the legends and summary risk factors set forth below, and acknowledge your receipt thereof by clicking the button below

THIS SALES AND ADVERTISING LITERATURE MUST BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PROSPECTUS IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND FULLY ALL OF THE IMPLICATIONS AND RISKS OF THE OFFERING OF SECURITIES TO WHICH IT RELATES. A COPY OF THE PROSPECTUS MUST BE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THIS OFFERING. 
  
An investment in First Capital Real Estate Trust Incorporated   involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the information set forth in the "Risk Factors" section of the Prospectus for a discussion of material risk factors relevant to an investment in our Common Shares, including, but not limited to, the following:
    

There is currently no public trading market for our Common Shares, and there may never be one.
    


This is a blind pool offering, so you will not have the opportunity to evaluate our investments before we make them.
      


If we are unable to raise substantial funds, we will be limited in the number of investments we may make, and the value of your investments in our Common Shares will fluctuate with the performance of the specific investments we make.
    


We and our advisor have a limited operating history. We have no established financing sources and the performance of our sponsor's prior real estate investment programs may not be indicative of our future results. Our sponsor has no experience in managing a public REIT or any other kind of public investment program.
    


Following the NAV pricing start date, the purchase of Common Shares under our DRIP and the repurchase of Common Shares under our share repurchase program will be at a price equal to our NAV per Common Share, which will be based upon subjective judgments, and may not reflect the amount that you might receive for your Common Shares in a market transaction.
    


Our advisor and its affiliates, including all of our executive officers and some of our directors, will face conflicts of interest caused by their compensation arrangements with us. We will pay our advisor and its affiliates substantial fees for their services, including, among other things, the selection, financing and acquisition of our investments; the management and leasing of our properties; the servicing of our mortgage, bridge, mezzanine or other loans; the administration of our other investments and the disposition of our assets. These fees will reduce the amount of cash available for investment or distributions to shareholders.
    


You are limited in your ability to sell your Common Shares pursuant to our share repurchase program.
    


We will make some of or all of our distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations, including the proceeds of our public offering, cash advanced to us by our advisor, cash resulting from a waiver of asset management fees or property management fees or from borrowings (including borrowings secured by our assets). This may reduce the amount of capital we invest and negatively impact the value of your investment.
    


There can be no assurance that any distributions will be made, and distributions are not guaranteed. 
    


There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve expected cash flows necessary to continue to pay initially established distributions or maintain distributions at any particular level, or that distributions will increase over time.
    


We have broad authority to incur debt, and high debt levels could hinder our ability to make distributions and could decrease the value of your investment.
    


We intend to qualify as a REIT for the tax year ending December 31, 2012. Our failure to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT would subject us to U.S. federal income tax and potentially state and local taxes, and would adversely affect our operations and the market price of our Common Shares.
    


The share ownership restrictions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for REITs and the 9.8% share ownership limit in our charter may inhibit market activity in our Common Shares.
    


Real estate-related investments are subject to numerous risks, including risks relating to leverage, tenant nonrenewal, vacancies, inability to sell or refinance on favorable terms or at all, adverse regulatory changes, uninsured losses, adverse market conditions, and environmental hazards, any of which, if realized, could adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our Common Shares.
    


No offering is made to New York residents except by a Prospectus filed with the Department of Law of the State of New York. The Attorney General of the State of New York has not passed on or endorsed the merits of this offering.
    
This is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy the securities described herein. An offering is made only by the prospectus. This material must be preceded or accompanied by a prospectus. You should read the prospectus in order to understand fully all of the implications and risks of the offering of securities to which it relates. An investment in First Capital Real Estate Trust Incorporated   should be made only after careful review of the prospectus. All information contained in this material is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the prospectus.
    


The achievement of any or all goals is not guaranteed. There is no assurance that the value of the real estate will be sufficient to return any portion of the investors' original capital. These securities are being offered on a best efforts basis. No public market currently exists, and one may never exist, for shares of our stocks. We have a limited operating history as a REIT, and our sponsor has no experience operating a REIT or public programs. An investment in this offering is subject to substantial fees as detailed in the prospectus.

At its core DNA, First Capital Real Estate Investments LLC (First Capital), is comprised of an entrepreneurial spirit and investor centric investment strategy. These qualities paired with the leadership of Suneet Singal have led First Capital from humble beginnings to becoming an authority in the alternative asset management industry. Opening its doors in 2003, First Capital is a privately held commercial and residential real estate finance firm.

First Capital has three strategic components to its business. First Capital sponsors a public, nontraded Real Estate Investment Trust, and owns the external advisor to that REIT, and has private holdings including development projects, and retail and operating companies.



Executive Team



Suneet Singal
Chairman & CEO
Mr. Singal is the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of First Capital Real Estate Trust Inc LLC, and founding principal of its predecessor company First Capital Real Estate Investments.

Ron Cobb
President
Mr. Cobb began his professional career in real estate as a construction Project Manager with a major regional construction company. His most notable project included managing the construction of the $50MM Tonopalo luxury timeshare project in Lake Tahoe, CA. In that capacity, he was responsible for all phases of development from securing pre-development entitlements through owner acceptance of individual units. Tonopalo has since become a model for best practices used in the development of beach front property in the Lake Tahoe Basin by the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency. Also in the Lake Tahoe Basin, Mr. Cobb oversaw the construction of the successful retail component of the Heavenly Village in Stateline, NV. Prior to these projects, he oversaw the remodel of a 40 year old motel into what is now the $100MM Siena Hotel Spa Casino in downtown Reno, NV. The remodel added luxury suites, a spa ranked in the top five of all spas in the West. In addition to his duties as a commercial real estate broker and partner with Commercial Partners of Nevada, Mr. Cobb serves as Managing Partner of New Mexico’s preeminent active adult community, Jubilee Los Lunas where he oversees the development of this 422 unit subdivision. Mr. Cobb is a distinguished public servant. He spent four years on both the Airport Authority Advisory Board and the Home Consortium Advisory Board. He spent three and a half years with the Washoe County Planning Commission and served one year as its Chairman. Most recently, Mr. Cobb completed nearly eight years on the City of Reno Planning Commission with three years as its Chairman. In these roles, he has helped shape the future of Reno by advising the City of Reno Council on a myriad of issues, including natural resources, economics, housing, population, land use and zoning. Furthermore, he has reviewed and advised on all major development projects proposed within the City.

John G. Fields
Managing Director
Mr. Fields has over 20 years of experience in the securities and investment field with extensive experience in financial analysis, private equity transactions and raising capital. Mr. Fields leads strategy for all of the First Capital verticals and is utilized when special complex projections arise. Prior to joining the First Capital team, Mr. Fields was the Managing Director of The Transfinity Group founded in 2010. The company specialized in implementing a creative and revolutionary funding strategy for commercial real estate sustainability upgrades. The strategy is expected to have a significant impact in reducing carbon consumption while providing outsized returns for institutional investors. Mr. Fields invented a new asset class by developing a straightforward and consumer-friendly proprietary funding mechanism that is ideally suited for the critically underserved small business owner. He assembled the requisite Executive Team, Board of Directors and developed distribution channels with both private and public corporations. In creating a new asset class, a significant amount of legal compliance and enforceability issues required resolutions. In the 2013 legislature, he led the effort to enact California legislation (AB905) by meeting with lobbyists, policy advisors and legislatures from both political parties. Mr. Fields raised capital from a wide-range of international and domestic investors and led the A round, subsequent funding rounds and acquired and negotiated a funding partner to provide over $100,000,000 of project capital. He is recognized as an innovator, who excels at achieving desired results and bringing goals to realization. Mr. Fields began his career on the Pacific Options Exchange where he executed and managed derivative trading strategies. He further solidified my expertise with tenures at CSI Capital Management (Suntrust), Barclays Global Investors (BlackRock), Integrated Capital Markets and SunGard Data Systems. He's held positions at The White House, OPIC Fellowship (Overseas Private Investment Corporation) and Deloitte & Touché, all located in Washington D.C.; the United Nations in New York City; and the Indiana Governor's Fellowship for Senator Evan Bayh III in Indianapolis. Mr. Fields attended American University and Wabash College with honors.
