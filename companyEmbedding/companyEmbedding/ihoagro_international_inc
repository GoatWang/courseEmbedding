		The Solution	
 





The overuse of chemical fertilizers has left our soil deficient and our plants deprived. By over-saturating plants with a select few macronutrients, they have starved plants of the balanced nutrient diet they need for sustainable growth. Moreover, chemical fertilizers suppress plant’s natural resistance to pestilence and disease, making them not only vulnerable to infection but utterly dependent on pesticides, which only perpetuates the cycle.
IHO-Agro allows plants to flourish in their own right, while reducing their dependence on pesticides and chemical fertilizers. 
IHO-Agro MINERAL products are a powerful catalyst when used with normal fertilization resulting in healthier plants and significant production increase. 
IHO-Agro BIO products, a game changer in fertilization, offers significant advantages beyond productivity increase:
Fertilization with natural combination of ingredients, not a mixture of individual elements
Economical, less expensive, reduces or eliminates classic fertilization needs
Increased resistance to diseases and pathogens, healthier and stronger plants, thus naturally fight diseases
Improved tasting fruits and vegetables.
Up to 70% faster and higher seed germination rate.
Reduce time of the harvest by 25%, faster time to market better fruit conservation for longer shelf life
Better resistance to extreme weather, floods, heat cold.
Proven stimulant for the plants to retain all necessary minerals needed for animal or human consumption

		Our Vision	
 






We are an emerging growth company, providing a safe and healthy alternative to help in the global production of food.

IHO Agro prides itself on marketing truly all-natural fertilizers that will change the way plants are grown around the world. We are setting a standard by which all fertilizers will measured by producing superior plants and dramatically increasing crop yields in an ecologically friendly way.
Our products are far superior to chemical fertilizers, bringing significant savings to both industrial agricultural enterprises and independent farmers alike. Since our products pricing is not vulnerable to variations in oil prices, we ensure price stability for the years to come, contributing to sustainable agricultural practices.

After over seven years of field tests, on a variety of soils and climates, we have developed two nutritious plant supplements IHo-Mineral and IHO-Bio. Both have proven to increase crop production by an average of 30-50%, and sometimes more than 300%, thus eliminating the need for chemical fertilizers. Independent tests and production usage have yield positive results across the board.
Our products are extremely efficient via foliar applications of water dilution of the concentrated products. The concentration and quantity are product and crop specific and can be mixed with other substances, does not necessarily require additional applications if incorporated into the crop’s spray rotation. For certain crops we recommend soaking the seeds in the dilution right before seeding to further increase productivity.
IHO-MINERAL

IHO Mineral is a proprietary formula of extracts from various minerals found across the globe. It is a NATURAL mineral supplement with more than 70 elements delivered in a highly concentration solution. 
IHO-Mineral benefits are proven through thorough scientific research, validating the results. Beyond the increasing productivity,  IHO-Mineral yields  higher germination rates and growth, foliage, flowering, yields, leaf size, fruit size, plant size, overall plant health, and many other desirable qualities.

		The Science	
 







Chemical fertilizers focus on a handful of “macronutrients” such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K).  While these are important for plant growth and increase base productivity, chemical fertilizers also over-saturate both plants and the soil. Too much of a good thing can have devastating effects. Over using chemical fertilizers and pairing them with pesticides mineralize the soil and degenerates the water table. Long term use can even render once fertile land, barren. 
IHO-Agro believes in a different approach to fertilizers. Our products are naturally derived to contain a large variety of minerals and nutrients in balanced proportions to promote plant growth. Our products focus on a balance of micronutrients so that every plant need is consider. These are the elements crops need in smaller quantities, such as boron (B), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), chloride (Cl), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo),  zinc (Zn) and the list goes on. By focusing on micronutrients, our products create a soil culture that promotes healthy crop growth and development. 
FiBL, the German Research Institute for Organic Agriculture has recognized IHO-Bio (marketed as IHO-Agro in Europe) as being suitable for ecological agriculture. 

 Research on IHO Bio: The reputable National Institute for Research and Development for Pedology (soil studies) Agrochemical and Environment Protection – ICPA Bucharest  performed a two year scientific research on IHO-Bio. Summary of results is available here:  IHO-Bio Research English Summary

(IHO-Agro) an innovative international fertilizer company announced today it has received product testing and product results from IHO-Agro Distribution, Inc. (IHOD).A brief history from IHOD – Bobby Lindsey began using the IHO-Bio product in the fall of 2014 on a 5 acre navel orange block that was under heavy stress from citrus greening – HLB. Mr. Lindsey was in the process of pushing, piling and burning the grove when he became aware of the IHO-Bio product and try it on the remaining 5 acres that had not yet been pushed.  His initial interest was due to the possible efficacy in enhancing the immune system of citrus trees and possibly combating the effects of citrus greening. Changes in growth patterns were noticed following the second application, with substantial results and improvement seen in October 2015. At that time the last two flushes of growth did not show symptoms of greening and leaf samples from those latter flushes showed lower levels of HLB infection than earlier tests conducted by the USDA. Lindsey expanded the treated acreage in the Spring of 2015 to include pineapple and hamlin oranges in the St. John's Improvement District. Due to the success of the product and its effect on HLB there are 10 growers that are now applying the product in test blocks of their own. There is great potential for the expanded use of IHO fertilizer over the significant amount of crops to these growers.On April 14, 2016, IHOD received a Fertilizer License from the Georgia Department of Agriculture. IHOD has since provided sample product to several growers of cotton and peanuts in Georgia. In addition, Triangle Chemical Company, which does business in Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and North Carolina, has agreed to become a dealer for the IHO-Bio product in Florida, with other states to be considered pending grower testing in those states.Mr. Ioan Hossu - President and CEO of IHO Agro International commented, "We are delighted with these results. Mr. Lindsey's experience in the citrus industry coupled with the superior products of IHO-Agro will benefit farmers and the industry immediately. The results we see on plant health, growth, yield and tolerance of the HLB bacteria are in line with our research and confirm the important value our products will add to the citrus industry and to the broader agricultural community."About IHO-Agro Distribution and Mr. Lindsey: IHO-Agro Distribution is a newly formed company that will distribute IHO-Agro products for distribution in the United States. Mr. Lindsey will represent the products with his team and is based out of Vero Beach, Florida. Mr. Lindsey is a 5th generation Florida citrus grower with long standing ties and many years of service to the Florida Citrus industry. He also grows cotton, peanuts and timber in Colquitt County, Georgia, and has cattle in Vero Beach. He was born and raised in Vero Beach, Florida. He holds a B.S. in Chemistry and Biology from Mercer University and a Master of Science in Agriculture from the University of Florida.About IHO-Agro: IHO-Agro is an international fertilizer company with its head office in Florida, and regional offices in Canada and Panama. IHO-Agro sells and markets its product in various regions around the world. IHO-Agro prides itself on marketing truly all-natural fertilizers that will change the way plants are grown around the world. IHO-Bio, an IHO-Agro product, is FiBL approved as being suitable for use in ecological agriculture in the European Union.For more information on IHO-Agro please visit:  www.ihoagro.comAbout HLB (Citrus Greening): Huanglongbing (HLB), also known as citrus greening or yellow dragon disease, is one of the most serious citrus diseases in the world. It is widespread in Asia, Africa, and the Saudi Arabian Peninsula. In July 2004 it was reported in Brazil, and in August 2005 it was found for the first time in the U.S. in south Miami-Dade County. Huanglongbing is a bacterial disease that attacks the vascular system of plants. Once infected, there is no cure for the disease, and in areas where the disease is endemic, citrus trees decline and die within a few years. There are three known forms: Asian, African and Brazilian. The HLB bacteria is transmitted primarily by insect vectors (citrus psyllids), but can also be spread through plant grafting and movement of infected plant material. Even though the pathogens are bacteria, the disease does not spread by casual contamination of personnel and tools or by wind and rain. Though citrus is the primary plant host for HLB, other citrus relatives can also get the disease. Common HLB host plants include the Chinese box orange (Severinia buxifolia) and the curry leaf (Murraya koenigii). While HLB disease and the Asian psyllid share many of the same host plants, some host plants are specific to the disease and others to the psyllid.
