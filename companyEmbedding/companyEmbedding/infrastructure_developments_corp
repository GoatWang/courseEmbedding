Infrastructure Developments Corp. Enters into Joint Venture with EverForce Energy for African Markets


SALT LAKE CITY, UT / ACCESSWIRE / November 5, 2015 / Infrastructure Developments Corp. (OTC: IDVC and "the Company") announced today that is has entered into a joint venture with EverForce Energy, Inc. to market and distribute magnetic transducer generators ("MTG"s) and other Everforce products in Nigeria, South Africa, and other countries in Africa and the Middle East.
Ontario, Canada based EverForce Energy is focused on creating zero-emissions, high-efficiency, and scalable energy solutions through advanced innovations in engineering. EverForce holds patents on MTG-related technology and solar panel efficiency enhancement technology, amongst others.

"Our contacts in the region will result in increased exposure to this brilliant technology owned by EverForce."
Terms of the joint venture include sharing in sales revenue, license sales revenue, and an option for a future minority equity exchange between IDVC and EverForce. IDVC will also have the opportunity to commission Everforce power plants in the region.
"EverForce has engineering technologies that have been under research and development process for more than 15 years," said EverForce CEO Brooke Askin. "Our product has been tested and proven by institutional users, and we are now in position to sell large output MTG units to the public and private sectors around the world where demand is highest. IDVC has the knowledge of these high demand regions and contacts that can help us accelerate sales."
