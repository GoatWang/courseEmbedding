The following is a brief description of our historical roots, core values, and a brief description of our facilities. For more detailed descriptions of our various program areas, we encourage you to visit the pages for the species and(or) disciplines of interest to you. Thanks again for visiting!
The Department of Animal Sciences and Industry has a long and rich heritage. From the down-to-earth animal husbandry group that emerged from the Farming Department in 1901, to its current form as one of the largest Animal Science departments in the United States, K-State animal science has held fast to its commitment to excellence in teaching, research, and extension.
Moreover, we are fully engaged in embracing the challenges of the future in order to continue providing the objective information and training needed by the citizens of Kansas and elsewhere to thrive in the midst of change. The Animal Science program at Kansas State University ascribes to and seeks to model the core values articulated by the College of Agriculture and K-State Research and Extension.
Those core values include:
Integrity (displaying the characteristics of honesty, trust, credibility, responsibility, stewardship and accountability)Communication (exhibiting excellence in listening, speaking, writing, and working together)Scholarship (striving for excellence in the discovery, integration, dissemination and application of knowledge)Leadership (clearly displaying vision, teamwork, customer-focused service, and innovation)Inclusion (showing respect and appreciation for all clientele, co-workers and others with whom we interact)

Faculty in Animal Sciences and Industry are housed in two buildings on the K-State campus (Weber Hall and Call Hall). The buildings contain well-equipped laboratories, teaching facilities, a dairy processing plant and a meat processing facility.
Field research facilities for beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, poultry, horses, and sheep are located in close proximity to campus. The department manages about 6,500 acres of land for research purposes. In a typical year, departmental research and teaching facilities accommodate about 2000 to 3000 cattle, 3500 swine, 1500 laying hens, 250 sheep and 45 horses.

Unfortunately, it's something many people will need, and the costs can really add up. That's where long-term care insurance may prove beneficial, by helping cover the costs of in-home care by a medical professional or care in a nursing home. I know this can be a difficult decision, but long-term care may be worth thinking about. Let's sit down and talk through whether long-term care insurance makes sense for you.Learn More Liability Insurance for Your BusinessPart of owning a business is staying one-step ahead and managing risks before they happen. But no amount of planning can keep accidents from happening, and it's good to have some backup. That's where liability insurance comes in - it may help protect your business in the event of a work-related accident or mistake that damages a third party. I'm here to answer any questions you may have, but keep these questions in mind when you're choosing liability coverage for your business.Learn More Is a Wedding Covered by Event Insurance?Considerable investments of time and money can go into planning a wedding.

But the truth is that paying less now could mean paying more out of pocket for repairs and medical bills down the road. It's important to have the right coverage, and a cheap motorcycle insurance may not offer you the best protection. Consider these tips and ways to save as your shopping for motorcycle coverage.Learn More Motorhome Insurance BasicsIf you own a motorhome or are thinking about purchasing one, here are some things you may want to consider when it comes to protecting your home on wheels.Learn More Water Damage In Your CondoOne of the great perks to living in a condo is that it's fairly low-maintenance. You likely don't have to worry about lawn care or replacing the roof. But what about water damage? Whether your washer overflows or a bathroom pipe bursts, water damage can wreak havoc. If you have condo insurance, though, you'll generally have coverage for accidental damage caused by your plumbing or appliances. While I hope your home stays dry and cozy, it's a good idea to know what your condo policy may cover just in case.Learn More Insurance Premiums, Deductibles, LimitsWhen it comes to buying an insurance policy, there is no one-size-fits-all. Instead, it's important to choose the amount of coverage (known as limits) that is right for you. The same holds true when it comes to selecting a deductible (that's the amount you'll have to pay before your policy kicks in after a covered loss) and premium, which is your cost to maintain your policy. Understanding limits, premiums and deductibles is key when you’re buying or renewing insurance policies.Learn More Quiz: How Much Do You Know About Personal Umbrella Policies?You may know that a personal umbrella policy (PUP) may help protect you if the limits of an underlying policy (homeowners or auto, for instance) are exhausted. But how much do you know about how PUPs work? Test your knowledge with these five questions.Learn More Show moreShow lessInsurance Products & ServicesInsurance is unlike any other product out there - you pay for it and hope you never have to use it.
