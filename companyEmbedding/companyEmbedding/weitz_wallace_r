Weitz & Co. in 1983, just 13 years after graduating from Carleton College with his BA in Economics. Weitz uses a value investing philosophy which has evolved over the years. Weitz characterizes it as a mix between Graham's price sensitivity and insistence on a margin of safety. He also has a conviction that qualitative factors allow companies to have some control over their destinies, and, to a degree, can be more important that statistical measures, like reported earnings. Specifically, Weitz looks for companies that are suffering fromtemporary woes and are likely to return 12-15% over time. He likes to base his investing moves on common sense more so than trying to exploit event-oriented changes in share prices.Wally Weitz has been called Omaha's Other Oracle, for insistence on value investing and his consistently high returns - and the fact he moved to Omaha, of course.Weitz says the move was because he didn't want to raise his kids in New York City and he chose Omaha because that's where his wife is from. That's not to say Buffett wasn't influential in Weitz's life. Buffett was an important early influence. "I started going to Berkshire Hathaway annual meetings when they were in the National Indemnity lunch room and there were maybe six outsiders," says Weitz. "I don't know that I learned anything then that others who have followed Warren have caught on to 20 or 30 years later, but I was fortunate to have caught on to it early." One of the ways that manifested was when Weitz bought shares in Berkshire at $300 per share. "I sold a few at $600, thinking I could get back in at $400, but generally I've been long since about 1975 or so," he says. Berkshire remains his firm's largest holding. He owned 1,499,160 shares in the company at the end of the third quarter, 2011.

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Our People




The people who make up our firm are the core of who we are, and the reason we can do what we do so well. Many have been with us for more than a decade, and they know how to give our shareholders what they need. Meet the team who’s responsible for introducing investors to the Weitz Way.









              Wallace Weitz, CFA
              Co-Chief Investment Officer, Portfolio Manager


As founder
and co-chief investment officer of Weitz Investments, Wally has spent over
three decades putting his instinct for opportunity to work for shareholders.
Influenced by the value investing model of Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett,
Wally has steadily produced outstanding results on the funds that he’s managed.
He manages Partners III Opportunity Fund and co-manages Partners Value Fund and
Hickory Fund.

Wally discovered Benjamin Graham’s concept of value investing in high school.
Already an investor (he made his first stock buy at the age of 12), he
recognized a common-sense approach when he saw it. After earning a BA in
economics at Carleton College in 1970, Wally spent three years in New York
doing security analysis before coming to Omaha and joining Chiles, Heider &
Co. in 1973. There, he spent 10 years as an analyst and portfolio manager until
he started Wallace R. Weitz & Company in 1983. 

Wally has made a career out of his favorite hobby, investing. When he’s not
doing that, he loves to golf, travel, read and work with charitable and
educational foundations. Wally is on the Board of Trustees for Carleton College
and serves on various other non-profit boards.







              Ken Stoll
              President


As far as Ken is concerned, his sole focus at Weitz Investments is to help clients achieve their goals. And when he sees everyone on staff working together to make that happen, it’s a very satisfying experience for him. 

Ken came to the company in 2004 as chief financial officer and became president at the end of 2014. Before that, he spent more than 20 years working as a certified public accountant in the investment management industry. Ken had the honor of serving on the AICPA Investment Companies Committee for two years, contributing to a major update to the organization’s Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies. He holds a bachelor’s degree from Saint John’s University.


Ken spends his free time golfing and coaching a high school lacrosse team.







              Bradley P. Hinton, CFA
              Co-Chief Investment Officer, Portfolio Manager


Brad may be co-chief investment officer, but
he’s the type of leader who values collaboration. His focus is encouraging the
investment team to work together to make a meaningful difference in our
clients’ lives.

Brad joined the company in 2001 as a research analyst and was appointed co-CIO
in April 2017. His experience in equity analysis, fixed income credit research
and portfolio management enables him to see opportunities from multiple angles.
He became sole manager of the Balanced Fund in August 2005 and also co-manages
Value Fund and Partners Value Fund. Brad holds a bachelor’s degree from the
University of Nebraska and a master’s from Dartmouth, but he never stops
learning. Brad enjoys the intellectual stimulation of working with other
talented, passionate colleagues at Weitz Investments. 

Brad serves the community by volunteering for youth baseball and other sports.
The parents of three great kids, Brad and his wife Christie are also big
College World Series fans. Their attendance streak of at least one game per
season is at 23 years and counting.







              Andrew S. Weitz
              Director of Equity Research, Portfolio Manager


A naturally curious person, in his role as
director of equity research, Drew thrives in learning about many different
businesses, how they fit into a very dynamic world and into our equity
portfolios. 

Drew first came to Weitz Investment Management, Inc. in 1998, while a student
at Carleton College, working in various departments including client services,
operations and research. After graduating in 2002 with a bachelor’s degree in
computer science, he moved to Chicago in 2004 where he worked as a research
associate and research analyst for Ariel Investments. In 2008, Drew returned to
Omaha and Weitz Investments as an equity research analyst. He became co-manager
of Hickory Fund in December 2011 and was appointed director of equity research
in April 2017.

Drew volunteers on the advisors group for
OneWorld Community Health Centers and serves on the boards of The UNION for
Contemporary Art and Carleton College’s Alumni Annual Fund. On his own time, he
golfs, plays guitar and runs, but his favorite hobby is whatever his kids are
interested in.







              Nolan P. Anderson
              Research Analyst, Portfolio Manager

Nolan joined the company in November 2011 and co-manages the Core Plus Income Fund and Ultra Short Government Fund. He has found that the friendly Weitz atmosphere makes his job more fun and enjoyable.

From 2004-2007 he worked as a commercial real estate research analyst for Woodmen of the World Life Insurance Society in Omaha. He holds a bachelor’s degree in real estate and land use economics and a master’s in business administration from the University of Nebraska at Omaha.

He holds a bachelor’s degree in accounting and computer applications from the University of Notre Dame. Above all, he appreciates the “license to learn” that Weitz employees are granted.

Jon enjoys spending time with friends, traveling and golf.  







              Mary Bickels
              Client Service Manager


Mary exemplifies customer service in every way. Our client services department wouldn’t be the same without her. In fact, Wally Weitz himself has said this company couldn’t do what it does without her.

Mary has been part of Weitz Investments since 1993. She previously worked with Wally Weitz at a different brokerage firm for almost 10 years. She believes there’s no better place to work than where she is today.
