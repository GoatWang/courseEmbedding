In fact, the company is now expected to achieve break-even non-GAAP operating income and earnings per share in the current quarter, which is two quarters ahead of what the analyst was expecting.Robison continued that Aerohive's era of burning "significant" (5/4/2017)
3. William Blair analysts commented, "Aerohive delivered a mixed fiscal fourth quarter, beating expectations on the bottom line while missing on total revenue. Management attributed the revenue declines (down 10% year-over-year) to ongoing operational issues related to administration of the 2016 E-rate program(roughly two-thirds of funding letters were approved by year-end, versus a nearly 90% approval rate a year ago), although the rest of the business performed largely as expected. On a positive note, Aerohive continues to see early traction from wave 2 access points (33% of access point revenue in the quarter), as well as steady momentum from recent industry and channel alliances (Dell was 10% of revenue in the fourth quarter). Record gross margin was another highlight in the quarter, driven by strong service gross margin (highest in seven quarters). In addition, Aerohive announced the hiring of Ron Gill as its new vice president of Americas sales (previously vice president'Americas enterprise sales at Ruckus)." (2/15/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Aerohive Networks (NYSE:HIVE) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Hold Ratings, 4 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.57)Consensus Price Target: $6.29 (32.70% upside)
