That's why we created the CLEANSOLAR FAQs - to ensure that you have all the facts when it comes to rooftop solar. 


Answer:

There is very little maintenance required for photovoltaic solar installations on your roof. Seasonal rain rinses dust off of Bay Area roofs and many homeowners will hose down their panels once in the summer.

Best brands of solar panels
To find the best brands of solar panels you can use America's most trusterd solar panel comparison and reviews website, SolarReviews.
However, reviews of solar panels can be a bit meaningless because most consumer owners have not had any issues and so whilst solar company reviews are very important when choosing solar installers they are of less use when choosing solar panels.
For more information to help you make an informed decision about this topic, I would recommend this article about buying solar panels.

How much electricity will solar panels produce in California
Solar panels produce different amounts of energy in different locations.
Around the Sacramento area solar panels installed on a south facing 29 degree pitch roof will typically produce:
1,550 kWh per year per 1kw of peak DC (direct current) capacity
For more information about how your location, roof direction and roof tilt affects solar power production use the solar panels calculator and enter your address below.









What rebates, solar tax credits and other solar incentives are available in California
What solar incentives and tax credits are available in California?
The main incentives to install solar in California is the 30% federal solar tax credit and the net metering law.
The upfront utility based incentives from each of the main publically owned utilities are now exhausted for residential customers and almost exhausted for commercial customers.
However, the investment case for buying solar panels for your home has never been stronger because reductions in the price of solar systems has more than compensated for the loss of some upfront rebates.
 

 
Net Metering in California
The California Public Utility Commission voted by a narrow majority of 3 to 2 to extend the ability of residential energy customers in California to be credited with full retail rates for excess solar power that they generate and feed back into the grid at times when the electrical loads in their house are less than their solar production.
Whilst this didn't affect people that had already had installed solar panels on their homes in California it was a massive win for the millions of Californian homeowners who are yet to install the solar panels.
The reason net metering law is so important is that solar systems by their nature produce most power in the middle of the day when most homeowners are at work and using little power.
This is a very generous incentive and should not be taken for granted.
It means you can now install solar panels and sign a contract with your utility (known as a net metering agreement) where the utility guarantees to pay you a retail rate for exported solar power, usually for 10 or 15 years.
Each of the major utilities may offer slightly different net metering contracts but they are similar in nature.
To see more visit www.cpuc.ca.gov/General.aspx?id=3800
 

 
Is a purchase, lease or PPA agreement best?
Generally speaking you will make the largest savings over time if you purchase your solar panels outright yourself (whether you use cash you have at hand or finance secured against your home).
 However this is not always the case.
If you are in a position where you do not have a federal income tax liability then you will not be able to take advantage of the 30% federal solar tax credit.
In this case you may be better off with a third party owned solar lease where the solar company retains the right to this tax credit.
 

 
What is the payback period from installing solar panels in California?
The payback period from installing solar panels in California is usually between 4 and 8 years depending on the size of the system, the brand of solar panels you buy, the amount you were previously paying for power and whether you lease or buy your system.
This represents an excellent low risk investment.
 

 
Why analysis of solar savings and payback periods can be difficult in California
As California has net metering then the value of a solar power system is simply the annual production multiplied by the rate for power.
However, working this out can be difficult for two reasons.
Firstly for people on time of use metering the value power value changes with the time of day that the solar power is generated.
The second issue relates to the tiered rates of power prices.
With most utilities the amount you are charged for power increases as your usage increases.

First Solar, Inc. is an American photovoltaic (PV) manufacturer of rigid thin film modules, or solar panels, and a provider of utility-scale PV power plants and supporting services that include finance, construction, maintenance and end-of-life panel recycling. First Solar uses cadmium telluride (CdTe) as a semiconductor to produce CdTe-panels, that are competing successfully with conventional crystalline silicon technology.[2] In 2009, First Solar became the first solar panel manufacturing company to lower its manufacturing cost to $1 per watt[3] and produced CdTe-panels with an efficiency of about 14 percent at a reported cost of 59 cents per watt in 2013.[4]
The company was founded in 1990 by inventor Harold McMaster as Solar Cells, Inc. and the Florida Corporation in 1993 with JD Polk. In 1999 it was purchased by True North Partners, LLC, who rebranded it as First Solar, Inc. The company went public in 2006, trading on the NASDAQ. Its current chief executive is Mark Widmar, who succeeded the previous CEO James Hughes July 1, 2016.[5] First Solar is based in Tempe, Arizona. As of 2010, First Solar was considered the second-largest maker of PV modules worldwide[6] and ranked sixth in Fast Company’s list of the world's 50 most innovative companies.[7] In 2011, it ranked first on Forbes’s list of America’s 25 fastest-growing technology companies.[8] It is listed on the Photovoltaik Global 30 Index since the beginning of this stock index in 2009. The company was also listed as No. 1 in Solar Power World magazine’s 2012 and 2013 rankings of solar contractors.[9]

Technology[edit]
First Solar manufactures cadmium telluride (CdTe)-based photovoltaic (PV) modules, which produce electricity with a thin CdTe film on glass.[10] First Solar created a world record-breaking cell with 21.5% efficiency in the laboratory, confirmed by NREL,[11] in January, 2015 and a world record-breaking Thin-Film PV module with 18.6% efficiency, confirmed by NREL,[12] in June, 2015.
Their distribution network for solar panels covers over 39 distributors and wholesalers, across over 12 different countries.[13]
Corporate history[edit]
In 1984, inventor and entrepreneur Harold McMaster founded Glasstech Solar. McMaster foresaw the opportunity to manufacture low-cost, thin film cells on a large scale. After trying amorphous silicon, he shifted to CdTe at the urging of Jim Nolan and founded Solar Cells, Inc., (SCI) in 1990 [14] and the Florida Corporation in 1993 with JD Polk. In February 1999, McMaster sold the company to True North Partners, an investment arm of the Walton family, owners of Wal-Mart.[15] John T. Walton joined the Board of the new company, and Michael J. Ahearn of True North became the CEO of the newly minted First Solar. In its early years, First Solar module efficiencies were modest, about 7 percent.
First Solar launched production of commercial products in 2002 and reached an annual production of 25 megawatts (MW) in 2005.[16] At the end of 2009, First Solar had surpassed an annual production rate of one gigawatt (GW)[17] and was the largest PV module manufacturer in the world.[18]
The company is headquartered in Tempe, Arizona and has manufacturing facilities in Perrysburg, Ohio and Kulim, Malaysia.[19] Additionally, First Solar partnered with natural gas provider Enbridge to build the largest PV solar energy farm in the world,[20] located in Sarnia, Ontario, near the Canada–US border.
In July 2010, First Solar formed a utility systems business group to address the large-scale PV systems solutions market. Utility systems are now the company's core business focus, with a strategy to focus on markets that do not require subsidies to support the solar generation business.[21]
On April 17, 2012, First Solar announced it would restructure operations worldwide. This restructuring process included phasing out operations in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany and idling four production lines in Kulim, Malaysia.[22] 30% of First Solar's workforce was laid off as a result of these actions, which were blamed on market volatility and reduced demand.[23] Mark Widmar, the CFO of First Solar, said, "We need to resize our business to a level of demand that is highly reliable and predictable."[24]
On July 1, 2016 Mark Widmar was appointed CEO of First Solar. Previously he had been Chief Financial Officer. Company founder and former CEO Mike Ahearn remains Chairman of the Board.[5]
Market history[edit]
Historically, First Solar sold its products to solar project developers, system integrators, and independent power producers. Early sales were primarily in Germany because of strong incentives for solar enacted in the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) of 2000 (cp. Solar power in Germany).[citation needed] Declines and uncertainty in feed-in-tariff subsidies for solar power in European markets, including Germany, France, Italy and Spain,[25] prompted major PV manufacturers, such as First Solar, to accelerate their expansion into other markets, including the U.S., India and China.[26]
Beginning in December 2011, First Solar has shifted away from existing markets that are heavily dependent on government subsidies and toward providing utility-scale PV systems in sustainable markets with immediate need.[27] As a result, it now competes against conventional power generators,[28] and has reduced its focus on the rooftop market.[21]
On February 24, 2009, First Solar's cost per watt broke the $1 barrier, reaching $0.98. Production cost has continued to fall and in February 2013, reached $0.68 per watt.[29]
Production history[edit]
In 2011, the company had 36 production lines with 2,376 megawatts of annual manufacturing capacity. Each line had a 66-megawatt capacity. The first factory was built in Ohio, followed by a four-line manufacturing plant in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany. In April 2007, the firm announced the construction of a plant in Kulim Hi-Tech Park, Malaysia, which was expanded to six plants in 2010. In October 2008, the firm began an expansion of its facility in Perrysburg, Ohio, completed in 2010,[30] which brought First Solar's global annual production capacity to 1,228 MW.
In the summer of 2009, the company announced plans to build its fourth production plant in France. In October 2010, First Solar announced it would build two new four-line manufacturing plants, one each in Vietnam and the United States. In November 2011 it postponed commissioning the Vietnam plant.[31] In February 2012, it postponed commissioning of a new U.S. plant in Mesa, AZ until demand develops. In May 2012, four lines in Malaysia were shut down indefinitely and plans to shutter the facility in Germany were announced.

(Source: First Solar Financial Report for Quarter 1 2012 Earnings Call; "First Solar to Boost Production as Profit, Sales Climb," Wall Street Journal, August 1, 2012)

First Solar increased its estimate for 2012 production to between 1,800 and 1,900 MWs in its Financial Report for Quarter 2.[33]

Market performance[edit]
While First Solar witnessed record sales of over $3.37 billion in 2012, its restructuring efforts impacted the bottom line, leading to a net loss of $96.3 million – or $1.11 per share – for the year.[34]
Historically, the low cost of First Solar’s modules has been the key to its market performance. The use of cadmium telluride instead of silicon allowed it to achieve a significantly lower module cost ($0.67 per watt),[35] compared to crystalline-silicon PV, which averaged $1.85 per watt in 2010.[36]
As the company shifts its focus away from module sales to utility-scale projects, it will need to become price competitive with non-solar power sources, a move which its executives say will require the company to reduce manufacturing costs and optimize efficiency.[37]

In November 2012, First Solar announced that its manufacturing cost had fallen to 67 cents per watt, a 6-cent decrease from February 2012.[38] By 2015, it expects to drive down cost per watt to make solar modules to between 52 and 54 cents. The biggest driver of the lower costs is better efficiency.[37]
In a December 2012 RenewEconomy interview with First Solar CEO James Hughes,[39] he made the following comments regarding Grid parity:
"Everyone wants to talk about “grid parity” – I’ve banned that phrase from the lexicon of First Solar. Electricity has value only at a point in time and a geographic place . There is no magic number that describes the true economic cost of electricity. You may have a tariff structure that describes it that way, but that is not the reality, and frankly, sophisticated power markets don’t operate like that. So you have to look at time of day, season and location to determine the true cost of power, and there are lots of times of day, seasons and locations where solar is economic today without subsidy. So our focus is to find those places, find those times of day, and find those market structures where we can apply ourselves."
Installations[edit]
First Solar had installed 1,505 MW of solar capacity as of 2012.[9] Below are some of First Solar’s solar installations and development projects:
North America[edit]

290 MW Agua Caliente Solar Project in Yuma County, AZ, constructed for NRG Energy and MidAmerican Renewables.[40]

First Solar, Inc. is an American photovoltaic (PV) manufacturer of rigid thin film modules, or solar panels, and a provider of utility-scale PV power plants and supporting services that include finance, construction, maintenance and end-of-life panel recycling. First Solar uses cadmium telluride (CdTe) as a semiconductor to produce CdTe-panels, that are competing successfully with conventional crystalline silicon technology.[2] In 2009, First Solar became the first solar panel manufacturing company to lower its manufacturing cost to $1 per watt[3] and produced CdTe-panels with an efficiency of about 14 percent at a reported cost of 59 cents per watt in 2013.[4]
The company was founded in 1990 by inventor Harold McMaster as Solar Cells, Inc. and the Florida Corporation in 1993 with JD Polk. In 1999 it was purchased by True North Partners, LLC, who rebranded it as First Solar, Inc. The company went public in 2006, trading on the NASDAQ. Its current chief executive is Mark Widmar, who succeeded the previous CEO James Hughes July 1, 2016.[5] First Solar is based in Tempe, Arizona. As of 2010, First Solar was considered the second-largest maker of PV modules worldwide[6] and ranked sixth in Fast Company’s list of the world's 50 most innovative companies.[7] In 2011, it ranked first on Forbes’s list of America’s 25 fastest-growing technology companies.[8] It is listed on the Photovoltaik Global 30 Index since the beginning of this stock index in 2009. The company was also listed as No. 1 in Solar Power World magazine’s 2012 and 2013 rankings of solar contractors.[9]

Technology[edit]
First Solar manufactures cadmium telluride (CdTe)-based photovoltaic (PV) modules, which produce electricity with a thin CdTe film on glass.[10] First Solar created a world record-breaking cell with 21.5% efficiency in the laboratory, confirmed by NREL,[11] in January, 2015 and a world record-breaking Thin-Film PV module with 18.6% efficiency, confirmed by NREL,[12] in June, 2015.
Their distribution network for solar panels covers over 39 distributors and wholesalers, across over 12 different countries.[13]
Corporate history[edit]
In 1984, inventor and entrepreneur Harold McMaster founded Glasstech Solar. McMaster foresaw the opportunity to manufacture low-cost, thin film cells on a large scale. After trying amorphous silicon, he shifted to CdTe at the urging of Jim Nolan and founded Solar Cells, Inc., (SCI) in 1990 [14] and the Florida Corporation in 1993 with JD Polk. In February 1999, McMaster sold the company to True North Partners, an investment arm of the Walton family, owners of Wal-Mart.[15] John T. Walton joined the Board of the new company, and Michael J. Ahearn of True North became the CEO of the newly minted First Solar. In its early years, First Solar module efficiencies were modest, about 7 percent.
First Solar launched production of commercial products in 2002 and reached an annual production of 25 megawatts (MW) in 2005.[16] At the end of 2009, First Solar had surpassed an annual production rate of one gigawatt (GW)[17] and was the largest PV module manufacturer in the world.[18]
The company is headquartered in Tempe, Arizona and has manufacturing facilities in Perrysburg, Ohio and Kulim, Malaysia.[19] Additionally, First Solar partnered with natural gas provider Enbridge to build the largest PV solar energy farm in the world,[20] located in Sarnia, Ontario, near the Canada–US border.
In July 2010, First Solar formed a utility systems business group to address the large-scale PV systems solutions market. Utility systems are now the company's core business focus, with a strategy to focus on markets that do not require subsidies to support the solar generation business.[21]
On April 17, 2012, First Solar announced it would restructure operations worldwide. This restructuring process included phasing out operations in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany and idling four production lines in Kulim, Malaysia.[22] 30% of First Solar's workforce was laid off as a result of these actions, which were blamed on market volatility and reduced demand.[23] Mark Widmar, the CFO of First Solar, said, "We need to resize our business to a level of demand that is highly reliable and predictable."[24]
On July 1, 2016 Mark Widmar was appointed CEO of First Solar. Previously he had been Chief Financial Officer. Company founder and former CEO Mike Ahearn remains Chairman of the Board.[5]
Market history[edit]
Historically, First Solar sold its products to solar project developers, system integrators, and independent power producers. Early sales were primarily in Germany because of strong incentives for solar enacted in the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) of 2000 (cp. Solar power in Germany).[citation needed] Declines and uncertainty in feed-in-tariff subsidies for solar power in European markets, including Germany, France, Italy and Spain,[25] prompted major PV manufacturers, such as First Solar, to accelerate their expansion into other markets, including the U.S., India and China.[26]
Beginning in December 2011, First Solar has shifted away from existing markets that are heavily dependent on government subsidies and toward providing utility-scale PV systems in sustainable markets with immediate need.[27] As a result, it now competes against conventional power generators,[28] and has reduced its focus on the rooftop market.[21]
On February 24, 2009, First Solar's cost per watt broke the $1 barrier, reaching $0.98. Production cost has continued to fall and in February 2013, reached $0.68 per watt.[29]
Production history[edit]
In 2011, the company had 36 production lines with 2,376 megawatts of annual manufacturing capacity. Each line had a 66-megawatt capacity. The first factory was built in Ohio, followed by a four-line manufacturing plant in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany. In April 2007, the firm announced the construction of a plant in Kulim Hi-Tech Park, Malaysia, which was expanded to six plants in 2010. In October 2008, the firm began an expansion of its facility in Perrysburg, Ohio, completed in 2010,[30] which brought First Solar's global annual production capacity to 1,228 MW.
In the summer of 2009, the company announced plans to build its fourth production plant in France. In October 2010, First Solar announced it would build two new four-line manufacturing plants, one each in Vietnam and the United States. In November 2011 it postponed commissioning the Vietnam plant.[31] In February 2012, it postponed commissioning of a new U.S. plant in Mesa, AZ until demand develops. In May 2012, four lines in Malaysia were shut down indefinitely and plans to shutter the facility in Germany were announced.

(Source: First Solar Financial Report for Quarter 1 2012 Earnings Call; "First Solar to Boost Production as Profit, Sales Climb," Wall Street Journal, August 1, 2012)

First Solar increased its estimate for 2012 production to between 1,800 and 1,900 MWs in its Financial Report for Quarter 2.[33]

Market performance[edit]
While First Solar witnessed record sales of over $3.37 billion in 2012, its restructuring efforts impacted the bottom line, leading to a net loss of $96.3 million – or $1.11 per share – for the year.[34]
Historically, the low cost of First Solar’s modules has been the key to its market performance. The use of cadmium telluride instead of silicon allowed it to achieve a significantly lower module cost ($0.67 per watt),[35] compared to crystalline-silicon PV, which averaged $1.85 per watt in 2010.[36]
As the company shifts its focus away from module sales to utility-scale projects, it will need to become price competitive with non-solar power sources, a move which its executives say will require the company to reduce manufacturing costs and optimize efficiency.[37]
Grid parity[edit]
Main article: Grid parity
In November 2012, First Solar announced that its manufacturing cost had fallen to 67 cents per watt, a 6-cent decrease from February 2012.[38] By 2015, it expects to drive down cost per watt to make solar modules to between 52 and 54 cents. The biggest driver of the lower costs is better efficiency.[37]
In a December 2012 RenewEconomy interview with First Solar CEO James Hughes,[39] he made the following comments regarding Grid parity:
"Everyone wants to talk about “grid parity” – I’ve banned that phrase from the lexicon of First Solar. Electricity has value only at a point in time and a geographic place . There is no magic number that describes the true economic cost of electricity. You may have a tariff structure that describes it that way, but that is not the reality, and frankly, sophisticated power markets don’t operate like that. So you have to look at time of day, season and location to determine the true cost of power, and there are lots of times of day, seasons and locations where solar is economic today without subsidy. So our focus is to find those places, find those times of day, and find those market structures where we can apply ourselves."

First Solar, Inc. is an American photovoltaic (PV) manufacturer of rigid thin film modules, or solar panels, and a provider of utility-scale PV power plants and supporting services that include finance, construction, maintenance and end-of-life panel recycling. First Solar uses cadmium telluride (CdTe) as a semiconductor to produce CdTe-panels, that are competing successfully with conventional crystalline silicon technology.[2] In 2009, First Solar became the first solar panel manufacturing company to lower its manufacturing cost to $1 per watt[3] and produced CdTe-panels with an efficiency of about 14 percent at a reported cost of 59 cents per watt in 2013.[4]
The company was founded in 1990 by inventor Harold McMaster as Solar Cells, Inc. and the Florida Corporation in 1993 with JD Polk. In 1999 it was purchased by True North Partners, LLC, who rebranded it as First Solar, Inc. The company went public in 2006, trading on the NASDAQ. Its current chief executive is Mark Widmar, who succeeded the previous CEO James Hughes July 1, 2016.[5] First Solar is based in Tempe, Arizona. As of 2010, First Solar was considered the second-largest maker of PV modules worldwide[6] and ranked sixth in Fast Company’s list of the world's 50 most innovative companies.[7] In 2011, it ranked first on Forbes’s list of America’s 25 fastest-growing technology companies.[8] It is listed on the Photovoltaik Global 30 Index since the beginning of this stock index in 2009. The company was also listed as No. 1 in Solar Power World magazine’s 2012 and 2013 rankings of solar contractors.[9]

Technology[edit]
First Solar manufactures cadmium telluride (CdTe)-based photovoltaic (PV) modules, which produce electricity with a thin CdTe film on glass.[10] First Solar created a world record-breaking cell with 21.5% efficiency in the laboratory, confirmed by NREL,[11] in January, 2015 and a world record-breaking Thin-Film PV module with 18.6% efficiency, confirmed by NREL,[12] in June, 2015.
Their distribution network for solar panels covers over 39 distributors and wholesalers, across over 12 different countries.[13]
Corporate history[edit]
In 1984, inventor and entrepreneur Harold McMaster founded Glasstech Solar. McMaster foresaw the opportunity to manufacture low-cost, thin film cells on a large scale. After trying amorphous silicon, he shifted to CdTe at the urging of Jim Nolan and founded Solar Cells, Inc., (SCI) in 1990 [14] and the Florida Corporation in 1993 with JD Polk. In February 1999, McMaster sold the company to True North Partners, an investment arm of the Walton family, owners of Wal-Mart.[15] John T. Walton joined the Board of the new company, and Michael J. Ahearn of True North became the CEO of the newly minted First Solar. In its early years, First Solar module efficiencies were modest, about 7 percent.
First Solar launched production of commercial products in 2002 and reached an annual production of 25 megawatts (MW) in 2005.[16] At the end of 2009, First Solar had surpassed an annual production rate of one gigawatt (GW)[17] and was the largest PV module manufacturer in the world.[18]
The company is headquartered in Tempe, Arizona and has manufacturing facilities in Perrysburg, Ohio and Kulim, Malaysia.[19] Additionally, First Solar partnered with natural gas provider Enbridge to build the largest PV solar energy farm in the world,[20] located in Sarnia, Ontario, near the Canada–US border.
In July 2010, First Solar formed a utility systems business group to address the large-scale PV systems solutions market. Utility systems are now the company's core business focus, with a strategy to focus on markets that do not require subsidies to support the solar generation business.[21]
On April 17, 2012, First Solar announced it would restructure operations worldwide. This restructuring process included phasing out operations in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany and idling four production lines in Kulim, Malaysia.[22] 30% of First Solar's workforce was laid off as a result of these actions, which were blamed on market volatility and reduced demand.[23] Mark Widmar, the CFO of First Solar, said, "We need to resize our business to a level of demand that is highly reliable and predictable."[24]
On July 1, 2016 Mark Widmar was appointed CEO of First Solar. Previously he had been Chief Financial Officer. Company founder and former CEO Mike Ahearn remains Chairman of the Board.[5]
Market history[edit]
Historically, First Solar sold its products to solar project developers, system integrators, and independent power producers. Early sales were primarily in Germany because of strong incentives for solar enacted in the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) of 2000 (cp. Solar power in Germany).[citation needed] Declines and uncertainty in feed-in-tariff subsidies for solar power in European markets, including Germany, France, Italy and Spain,[25] prompted major PV manufacturers, such as First Solar, to accelerate their expansion into other markets, including the U.S., India and China.[26]
Beginning in December 2011, First Solar has shifted away from existing markets that are heavily dependent on government subsidies and toward providing utility-scale PV systems in sustainable markets with immediate need.[27] As a result, it now competes against conventional power generators,[28] and has reduced its focus on the rooftop market.[21]
On February 24, 2009, First Solar's cost per watt broke the $1 barrier, reaching $0.98. Production cost has continued to fall and in February 2013, reached $0.68 per watt.[29]
Production history[edit]
In 2011, the company had 36 production lines with 2,376 megawatts of annual manufacturing capacity. Each line had a 66-megawatt capacity. The first factory was built in Ohio, followed by a four-line manufacturing plant in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany. In April 2007, the firm announced the construction of a plant in Kulim Hi-Tech Park, Malaysia, which was expanded to six plants in 2010. In October 2008, the firm began an expansion of its facility in Perrysburg, Ohio, completed in 2010,[30] which brought First Solar's global annual production capacity to 1,228 MW.
In the summer of 2009, the company announced plans to build its fourth production plant in France. In October 2010, First Solar announced it would build two new four-line manufacturing plants, one each in Vietnam and the United States. In November 2011 it postponed commissioning the Vietnam plant.[31] In February 2012, it postponed commissioning of a new U.S. plant in Mesa, AZ until demand develops. In May 2012, four lines in Malaysia were shut down indefinitely and plans to shutter the facility in Germany were announced.

(Source: First Solar Financial Report for Quarter 1 2012 Earnings Call; "First Solar to Boost Production as Profit, Sales Climb," Wall Street Journal, August 1, 2012)

First Solar increased its estimate for 2012 production to between 1,800 and 1,900 MWs in its Financial Report for Quarter 2.[33]

Market performance[edit]
While First Solar witnessed record sales of over $3.37 billion in 2012, its restructuring efforts impacted the bottom line, leading to a net loss of $96.3 million – or $1.11 per share – for the year.[34]
Historically, the low cost of First Solar’s modules has been the key to its market performance. The use of cadmium telluride instead of silicon allowed it to achieve a significantly lower module cost ($0.67 per watt),[35] compared to crystalline-silicon PV, which averaged $1.85 per watt in 2010.[36]
As the company shifts its focus away from module sales to utility-scale projects, it will need to become price competitive with non-solar power sources, a move which its executives say will require the company to reduce manufacturing costs and optimize efficiency.[37]
Grid parity[edit]
Main article: Grid parity
In November 2012, First Solar announced that its manufacturing cost had fallen to 67 cents per watt, a 6-cent decrease from February 2012.[38] By 2015, it expects to drive down cost per watt to make solar modules to between 52 and 54 cents. The biggest driver of the lower costs is better efficiency.[37]
In a December 2012 RenewEconomy interview with First Solar CEO James Hughes,[39] he made the following comments regarding Grid parity:
"Everyone wants to talk about “grid parity” – I’ve banned that phrase from the lexicon of First Solar. Electricity has value only at a point in time and a geographic place . There is no magic number that describes the true economic cost of electricity. You may have a tariff structure that describes it that way, but that is not the reality, and frankly, sophisticated power markets don’t operate like that. So you have to look at time of day, season and location to determine the true cost of power, and there are lots of times of day, seasons and locations where solar is economic today without subsidy. So our focus is to find those places, find those times of day, and find those market structures where we can apply ourselves."
Installations[edit]
First Solar had installed 1,505 MW of solar capacity as of 2012.[9] Below are some of First Solar’s solar installations and development projects:
North America[edit]

290 MW Agua Caliente Solar Project in Yuma County, AZ, constructed for NRG Energy and MidAmerican Renewables.[40]

First Solar, Inc. is an American photovoltaic (PV) manufacturer of rigid thin film modules, or solar panels, and a provider of utility-scale PV power plants and supporting services that include finance, construction, maintenance and end-of-life panel recycling. First Solar uses cadmium telluride (CdTe) as a semiconductor to produce CdTe-panels, that are competing successfully with conventional crystalline silicon technology.[2] In 2009, First Solar became the first solar panel manufacturing company to lower its manufacturing cost to $1 per watt[3] and produced CdTe-panels with an efficiency of about 14 percent at a reported cost of 59 cents per watt in 2013.[4]
The company was founded in 1990 by inventor Harold McMaster as Solar Cells, Inc. and the Florida Corporation in 1993 with JD Polk. In 1999 it was purchased by True North Partners, LLC, who rebranded it as First Solar, Inc. The company went public in 2006, trading on the NASDAQ. Its current chief executive is Mark Widmar, who succeeded the previous CEO James Hughes July 1, 2016.[5] First Solar is based in Tempe, Arizona. As of 2010, First Solar was considered the second-largest maker of PV modules worldwide[6] and ranked sixth in Fast Company’s list of the world's 50 most innovative companies.[7] In 2011, it ranked first on Forbes’s list of America’s 25 fastest-growing technology companies.[8] It is listed on the Photovoltaik Global 30 Index since the beginning of this stock index in 2009. The company was also listed as No. 1 in Solar Power World magazine’s 2012 and 2013 rankings of solar contractors.[9]

Technology[edit]
First Solar manufactures cadmium telluride (CdTe)-based photovoltaic (PV) modules, which produce electricity with a thin CdTe film on glass.[10] First Solar created a world record-breaking cell with 21.5% efficiency in the laboratory, confirmed by NREL,[11] in January, 2015 and a world record-breaking Thin-Film PV module with 18.6% efficiency, confirmed by NREL,[12] in June, 2015.
Their distribution network for solar panels covers over 39 distributors and wholesalers, across over 12 different countries.[13]
Corporate history[edit]
In 1984, inventor and entrepreneur Harold McMaster founded Glasstech Solar. McMaster foresaw the opportunity to manufacture low-cost, thin film cells on a large scale. After trying amorphous silicon, he shifted to CdTe at the urging of Jim Nolan and founded Solar Cells, Inc., (SCI) in 1990 [14] and the Florida Corporation in 1993 with JD Polk. In February 1999, McMaster sold the company to True North Partners, an investment arm of the Walton family, owners of Wal-Mart.[15] John T. Walton joined the Board of the new company, and Michael J. Ahearn of True North became the CEO of the newly minted First Solar. In its early years, First Solar module efficiencies were modest, about 7 percent.
First Solar launched production of commercial products in 2002 and reached an annual production of 25 megawatts (MW) in 2005.[16] At the end of 2009, First Solar had surpassed an annual production rate of one gigawatt (GW)[17] and was the largest PV module manufacturer in the world.[18]
The company is headquartered in Tempe, Arizona and has manufacturing facilities in Perrysburg, Ohio and Kulim, Malaysia.[19] Additionally, First Solar partnered with natural gas provider Enbridge to build the largest PV solar energy farm in the world,[20] located in Sarnia, Ontario, near the Canada–US border.
In July 2010, First Solar formed a utility systems business group to address the large-scale PV systems solutions market. Utility systems are now the company's core business focus, with a strategy to focus on markets that do not require subsidies to support the solar generation business.[21]
On April 17, 2012, First Solar announced it would restructure operations worldwide. This restructuring process included phasing out operations in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany and idling four production lines in Kulim, Malaysia.[22] 30% of First Solar's workforce was laid off as a result of these actions, which were blamed on market volatility and reduced demand.[23] Mark Widmar, the CFO of First Solar, said, "We need to resize our business to a level of demand that is highly reliable and predictable."[24]
On July 1, 2016 Mark Widmar was appointed CEO of First Solar. Previously he had been Chief Financial Officer. Company founder and former CEO Mike Ahearn remains Chairman of the Board.[5]
Market history[edit]
Historically, First Solar sold its products to solar project developers, system integrators, and independent power producers. Early sales were primarily in Germany because of strong incentives for solar enacted in the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) of 2000 (cp. Solar power in Germany).[citation needed] Declines and uncertainty in feed-in-tariff subsidies for solar power in European markets, including Germany, France, Italy and Spain,[25] prompted major PV manufacturers, such as First Solar, to accelerate their expansion into other markets, including the U.S., India and China.[26]
Beginning in December 2011, First Solar has shifted away from existing markets that are heavily dependent on government subsidies and toward providing utility-scale PV systems in sustainable markets with immediate need.[27] As a result, it now competes against conventional power generators,[28] and has reduced its focus on the rooftop market.[21]
On February 24, 2009, First Solar's cost per watt broke the $1 barrier, reaching $0.98. Production cost has continued to fall and in February 2013, reached $0.68 per watt.[29]
Production history[edit]
In 2011, the company had 36 production lines with 2,376 megawatts of annual manufacturing capacity. Each line had a 66-megawatt capacity. The first factory was built in Ohio, followed by a four-line manufacturing plant in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany. In April 2007, the firm announced the construction of a plant in Kulim Hi-Tech Park, Malaysia, which was expanded to six plants in 2010. In October 2008, the firm began an expansion of its facility in Perrysburg, Ohio, completed in 2010,[30] which brought First Solar's global annual production capacity to 1,228 MW.
In the summer of 2009, the company announced plans to build its fourth production plant in France. In October 2010, First Solar announced it would build two new four-line manufacturing plants, one each in Vietnam and the United States. In November 2011 it postponed commissioning the Vietnam plant.[31] In February 2012, it postponed commissioning of a new U.S. plant in Mesa, AZ until demand develops. In May 2012, four lines in Malaysia were shut down indefinitely and plans to shutter the facility in Germany were announced.

(Source: First Solar Financial Report for Quarter 1 2012 Earnings Call; "First Solar to Boost Production as Profit, Sales Climb," Wall Street Journal, August 1, 2012)

First Solar increased its estimate for 2012 production to between 1,800 and 1,900 MWs in its Financial Report for Quarter 2.[33]

Market performance[edit]
While First Solar witnessed record sales of over $3.37 billion in 2012, its restructuring efforts impacted the bottom line, leading to a net loss of $96.3 million – or $1.11 per share – for the year.[34]
Historically, the low cost of First Solar’s modules has been the key to its market performance. The use of cadmium telluride instead of silicon allowed it to achieve a significantly lower module cost ($0.67 per watt),[35] compared to crystalline-silicon PV, which averaged $1.85 per watt in 2010.[36]
As the company shifts its focus away from module sales to utility-scale projects, it will need to become price competitive with non-solar power sources, a move which its executives say will require the company to reduce manufacturing costs and optimize efficiency.[37]
Grid parity[edit]
Main article: Grid parity
In November 2012, First Solar announced that its manufacturing cost had fallen to 67 cents per watt, a 6-cent decrease from February 2012.[38] By 2015, it expects to drive down cost per watt to make solar modules to between 52 and 54 cents. The biggest driver of the lower costs is better efficiency.[37]
In a December 2012 RenewEconomy interview with First Solar CEO James Hughes,[39] he made the following comments regarding Grid parity:
"Everyone wants to talk about “grid parity” – I’ve banned that phrase from the lexicon of First Solar. Electricity has value only at a point in time and a geographic place . There is no magic number that describes the true economic cost of electricity. You may have a tariff structure that describes it that way, but that is not the reality, and frankly, sophisticated power markets don’t operate like that. So you have to look at time of day, season and location to determine the true cost of power, and there are lots of times of day, seasons and locations where solar is economic today without subsidy. So our focus is to find those places, find those times of day, and find those market structures where we can apply ourselves."
Installations[edit]
First Solar had installed 1,505 MW of solar capacity as of 2012.[9] Below are some of First Solar’s solar installations and development projects:
North America[edit]

290 MW Agua Caliente Solar Project in Yuma County, AZ, constructed for NRG Energy and MidAmerican Renewables.[40]

Early sales were primarily in Germany because of strong incentives for solar enacted in the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) of 2000 (cp. Solar power in Germany).[citation needed] Declines and uncertainty in feed-in-tariff subsidies for solar power in European markets, including Germany, France, Italy and Spain,[25] prompted major PV manufacturers, such as First Solar, to accelerate their expansion into other markets, including the U.S., India and China.[26]
Beginning in December 2011, First Solar has shifted away from existing markets that are heavily dependent on government subsidies and toward providing utility-scale PV systems in sustainable markets with immediate need.[27] As a result, it now competes against conventional power generators,[28] and has reduced its focus on the rooftop market.[21]
On February 24, 2009, First Solar's cost per watt broke the $1 barrier, reaching $0.98. Production cost has continued to fall and in February 2013, reached $0.68 per watt.[29]
Production history[edit]
In 2011, the company had 36 production lines with 2,376 megawatts of annual manufacturing capacity. Each line had a 66-megawatt capacity. The first factory was built in Ohio, followed by a four-line manufacturing plant in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany. In April 2007, the firm announced the construction of a plant in Kulim Hi-Tech Park, Malaysia, which was expanded to six plants in 2010. In October 2008, the firm began an expansion of its facility in Perrysburg, Ohio, completed in 2010,[30] which brought First Solar's global annual production capacity to 1,228 MW.
In the summer of 2009, the company announced plans to build its fourth production plant in France. In October 2010, First Solar announced it would build two new four-line manufacturing plants, one each in Vietnam and the United States. In November 2011 it postponed commissioning the Vietnam plant.[31] In February 2012, it postponed commissioning of a new U.S. plant in Mesa, AZ until demand develops. In May 2012, four lines in Malaysia were shut down indefinitely and plans to shutter the facility in Germany were announced.

(Source: First Solar Financial Report for Quarter 1 2012 Earnings Call; "First Solar to Boost Production as Profit, Sales Climb," Wall Street Journal, August 1, 2012)

First Solar increased its estimate for 2012 production to between 1,800 and 1,900 MWs in its Financial Report for Quarter 2.[33]

Market performance[edit]
While First Solar witnessed record sales of over $3.37 billion in 2012, its restructuring efforts impacted the bottom line, leading to a net loss of $96.3 million – or $1.11 per share – for the year.[34]
Historically, the low cost of First Solar’s modules has been the key to its market performance. The use of cadmium telluride instead of silicon allowed it to achieve a significantly lower module cost ($0.67 per watt),[35] compared to crystalline-silicon PV, which averaged $1.85 per watt in 2010.[36]
As the company shifts its focus away from module sales to utility-scale projects, it will need to become price competitive with non-solar power sources, a move which its executives say will require the company to reduce manufacturing costs and optimize efficiency.[37]
Grid parity[edit]
Main article: Grid parity
In November 2012, First Solar announced that its manufacturing cost had fallen to 67 cents per watt, a 6-cent decrease from February 2012.[38] By 2015, it expects to drive down cost per watt to make solar modules to between 52 and 54 cents. The biggest driver of the lower costs is better efficiency.[37]
In a December 2012 RenewEconomy interview with First Solar CEO James Hughes,[39] he made the following comments regarding Grid parity:
"Everyone wants to talk about “grid parity” – I’ve banned that phrase from the lexicon of First Solar. Electricity has value only at a point in time and a geographic place . There is no magic number that describes the true economic cost of electricity. You may have a tariff structure that describes it that way, but that is not the reality, and frankly, sophisticated power markets don’t operate like that. So you have to look at time of day, season and location to determine the true cost of power, and there are lots of times of day, seasons and locations where solar is economic today without subsidy. So our focus is to find those places, find those times of day, and find those market structures where we can apply ourselves."
Installations[edit]
First Solar had installed 1,505 MW of solar capacity as of 2012.[9] Below are some of First Solar’s solar installations and development projects:
North America[edit]

290 MW Agua Caliente Solar Project in Yuma County, AZ, constructed for NRG Energy and MidAmerican Renewables.[40]
550 MW Topaz Solar Farm in San Luis Obispo County, CA, acquired by MidAmerican Energy Holdings.[41]
550 MW Desert Sunlight Solar Farm in Riverside County, CA, acquired by NextEra Energy and GE Energy Financial Services.[42]
230 MW AV Solar Ranch One in Los Angeles, CA, under construction and acquired by Exelon Corp.[43]
80 MW Sarnia Solar Farm in Ontario, Canada, completed, owned by Enbridge.[44]
50 MW Silver State North, in Boulder County, NV, completed, acquired by Enbridge.[45]

Europe, Middle East and North Africa[edit]

Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Seih Al-Dahal, UAE, includes a 13 MWDC solar power plant built by First Solar for the Dubai Electricity & Water Authority (DEWA).[46]
Stadtwerke Trier (SWT) in Trier, Germany, is one of the world’s largest thin-film solar plants. As of February 2009, it was estimated the facility would produce over 9 GWh per year, which would supply power to more than 2,400 homes each year. Additionally, it is estimated the facility will conserve 100,000 tons of CO2 over 20 years.[47]
The Ramat Hovav solar field is the largest PV power plant built so far in Israel's solar power sector. Constructed by Belectric over a previous evaporation pond, it has a nominal capacity of 37.5 MW. The facility became fully operational in December 2014.[48]
Waldpolenz Solar Park near Leipzig, Germany, is the largest thin-film PV power system in the world. Built and developed by Juwi Group, it has a capacity of 40 MW. The facility became fully operational in 2008.
In December 2009, the Lieberose Photovoltaic Park, Germany’s biggest conversion land project (126 hectares) on a former military training area, was opened with an output of 53 MW. The solar park uses 700,000 solar modules.[49]
For the Sports Stadium Bentegodi in Verona, Italy, First Solar supplied more than 13,000 thin film modules for a rooftop installation.[50]

Asia and Australia[edit]

10 MW Greenough River Solar Farm in Western Australia, completed for Verve Energy and GE Energy Financial Services.[51]
159 MW AGL Energy projects, to be constructed in Nyngan and Broken Hill, New South Wales.[52]

2017 Operating Cash Guidance of $550 to $650 million; Ending Net

        Cash of $1.4 to $1.6 Billion


 TEMPE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) today announced an acceleration of

      Series 6 production into 2018, with approximately 3 Gigawatts of

      production expected in 2019. Over the course of 2017 and 2018 the

      Company's existing production facilities will be converted to Series 6

      production and the current Series 4 product will be phased out. As a

      result of the change in roadmap the Company will cancel its Series 5

      product.

    


      "The acceleration of the Series 6 roadmap is an important development

      for First Solar," said Mark Widmar, CEO of First Solar. "Following the

      completion of an internal review process to evaluate the best

      competitive response to address the current challenging market

      conditions, we have developed plans that will enable us to more quickly

      begin production of our Series 6 module. Although the decision to

      accelerate our Series 6 roadmap requires a restructuring of our current

      operations, we expect the transition to Series 6 will enable us to

      maximize the intrinsic cost advantage of CdTe thin-film technology

      versus crystalline silicon. Recent steep module pricing declines require

      us to evaluate all components of our cost structure and streamline our

      business model to best position the Company for long-term success."

    


      The Company will reduce its workforce at its manufacturing facilities

      both domestically and internationally as a result of the transition from

      Series 4 to Series 6 production. Additional reductions in administrative

      and other staff are also planned.

    


      Resulting from the transition to Series 6 from Series 4 and other

      competitive factors, the Company expects to incur restructuring and

      asset impairment charges of $500 to $700 million, which includes a cash

      impact of $70 to $100 million. The charges are anticipated primarily in

      2016 and are comprised of the following:

    


$475 to $585 million, including asset impairments related to Series 4,

        Series 5 and stored manufacturing equipment, and charges for

        cancellation of open purchase orders. The cash impact is anticipated

        to range from $50 to $70 million.

      


        Up to $80 million for a non-cash impairment of goodwill

      

$10 to $15 million in cash severance charges, expected primarily in

        2016

      

$15 to $20 million of other charges, expected primarily in 2017

      



      These pre-tax restructuring and asset impairment charges are expected to

      have an offsetting tax benefit of $50 to $100 million.

    


      In addition to the restructuring and asset impairment charges, the

      Company also expects to incur $220 to $250 million of tax expense in

      2016 associated with the distribution of between $700 and $750 million

      of cash to the United States from a foreign subsidiary. This

      distribution will provide liquidity for the restructuring of U.S.

      operations and Series 6 investment. The cash tax impact related to this

      transfer is expected to be between $8 and $10 million.

    


      As a result of the restructuring and other related charges, the Company

      has updated 2016 GAAP guidance in the table below. 2016 non-GAAP

      guidance has also been updated to reflect the sale of the entire

      remaining interest in the Stateline project and excludes the impact of

      the current or previously announced restructuring actions.

      forecasted to be between ($0.10) and $0.45, with non-GAAP EPS of

      breakeven to $0.50 per share. The ending net cash balance is projected

      in the range of $1.4 to $1.6 billion. Capital expenditures of $525 to

For First Solar Investors



      This release contains forward-looking statements which are made pursuant

      to safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform

      Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include statements, among

      other things, concerning: effects on our financial statements and

      guidance resulting from certain module manufacturing changes and

      associated restructuring activities; our business strategy, including

      anticipated trends and developments in and management plans for our

      business and the markets in which we operate; future financial results,

      operating results, revenues, gross margin, operating expenses, products,

      projected costs (including estimated future module collection and

      recycling costs), warranties, solar module efficiency and balance of

      systems cost reduction roadmaps, restructuring, product reliability,

      investments in unconsolidated affiliates and capital expenditures; our

      ability to continue to reduce the cost per watt of our solar modules;

      our ability to reduce the costs to construct PV solar power systems;

      research and development programs and our ability to improve the

      conversion efficiency of our solar modules; our ability to expand

      manufacturing capacity worldwide; sales and marketing initiatives; and

      competition. These forward-looking statements are often characterized by

      the use of words such as "estimate," "expect," "anticipate," "project,"

      "plan," "intend," "seek," "believe," "forecast," "foresee," "likely,"

      "may," "should," "goal," "target," "might," "will," "could," "predict,"

      "continue" and the negative or plural of these words and other

      comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements are only predictions

      based on our current expectations and our projections about future

      events. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking

      statements. We undertake no obligation to update any of these

      forward-looking statements for any reason. These forward-looking

      statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other

      factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity,

      performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or

      implied by these statements. These factors include, but are not limited

      to, the matters discussed in Item 1A: "Risk Factors," of our most recent

      Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and other

      filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

    

Non-GAAP Financial Measures



      In the press release above, we provided non-GAAP guidance for our

      operating expenses, operating income, effective tax rate and earnings

      per share for the year ending December 31, 2016 as of the date of this

      press release ("current non-GAAP 2016 guidance") and as of the date of

      the press release announcing our earnings for the quarter ended

      September 30, 2016 ("prior non-GAAP 2016 guidance"), as well as non-GAAP

      guidance for our operating expenses, operating income and earnings per

      share for the year ending December 31, 2017 as of the date of this press

      release ("non-GAAP 2017 guidance"). We have included these

      forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to adjust our GAAP

      projections of such financial measures for, as applicable (i)

      restructuring, asset impairment and related charges primarily associated

      with the transition from Series 4 to Series 6 production and the end of

      our crystalline silicon operations, (ii) additional restructuring

      activities expected during the remainder of the year, (iii) the reversal

      of a liability associated with an uncertain tax position related to the

      income of a foreign subsidiary and (iv) the tax expense associated with

      the distribution of cash to the United States from a foreign subsidiary.

      Other GAAP charges, including those related to asset impairments,

      restructuring programs or litigation, that would be excluded from

      non-GAAP earnings per share are possible for the periods presented, but

      such amounts are dependent on numerous factors that we currently cannot

      ascertain with sufficient certainty or are presently unknown. These GAAP

      charges are also dependent upon future events and valuations that have

      not yet occurred or been performed. We believe these forward-looking

      non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with our corresponding

      financial guidance based on GAAP, to be relevant and useful information

      to our investors because they provide them with additional information

      in assessing our financial operating results. Our management also uses

      such non-GAAP guidance in evaluating our operating performance. However,

      such measures have limitations, including that they exclude the effect

      of certain changes to our assets and liabilities, certain amounts that

      we may ultimately have to pay in cash and certain tax impacts.

      Accordingly, these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures that

      exclude the aforementioned items should be considered in addition to,

      and not as substitutes for or superior to, financial guidance based on

      GAAP. The following are the reconciliations of our current non-GAAP 2016

      guidance, our prior non-GAAP 2016 guidance and our non-GAAP 2017

      guidance to the corresponding GAAP guidance as of the applicable date

      (in millions, except per share amounts):

CLEANSOLAR is all about transparency. 

That's why we created the CLEANSOLAR FAQs - to ensure that you have all the facts when it comes to rooftop solar. 


Answer:

There is very little maintenance required for photovoltaic solar installations on your roof. Seasonal rain rinses dust off of Bay Area roofs and many homeowners will hose down their panels once in the summer. If any debris should fall onto the panels, it should be removed, but that’s about it. Solar panels (modules) are made of durable materials and don’t have any moving parts, so they can...

Warranty
 
Clean Solar believes that long term relationships are the cornerstone of our business and we work hard to exceed our customer’s expectations. We go to great lengths to prevent problems from occurring with your solar power system.

The Longest Full Solar Warranty in the Industry

Clean Solar guarantees all workmanship and installation for 15 years – 5 years more than most other companies in the industry.
The 15 year full warranty includes parts and labor associated with replacing or repairing your system as well as all penetrations that we make to your roof. The 15 year term begins on the date of installation listed on the signed contract.
This 15 year warranty includes the entire portion of your roof that we cover with solar panels. Clean Solar installs extra flashings and the recommended urethane caulking to guarantee a clean and leak free installation.  Our competitors offer a limited one year warranty on your roof.
Leased solar systems are for the term of the lease agreement.

Solar Panel 25 Year Warranty
Clean Solar only uses the highest quality solar panels from the world’s leading solar panel manufacturers. Most of our photovoltaic panel manufacturers offer warranties of a very similar nature, guaranteeing energy production from their panels for 25 years . This is standard in the solar industry. If your solar panels malfunction or degrade past the normal variance, Clean Solar will replace the panel(s) for you.

First Solar, Inc. is an American photovoltaic (PV) manufacturer of rigid thin film modules, or solar panels, and a provider of utility-scale PV power plants and supporting services that include finance, construction, maintenance and end-of-life panel recycling. First Solar uses cadmium telluride (CdTe) as a semiconductor to produce CdTe-panels, that are competing successfully with conventional crystalline silicon technology.[2] In 2009, First Solar became the first solar panel manufacturing company to lower its manufacturing cost to $1 per watt[3] and produced CdTe-panels with an efficiency of about 14 percent at a reported cost of 59 cents per watt in 2013.[4]
The company was founded in 1990 by inventor Harold McMaster as Solar Cells, Inc. and the Florida Corporation in 1993 with JD Polk. In 1999 it was purchased by True North Partners, LLC, who rebranded it as First Solar, Inc. The company went public in 2006, trading on the NASDAQ. Its current chief executive is Mark Widmar, who succeeded the previous CEO James Hughes July 1, 2016.[5] First Solar is based in Tempe, Arizona. As of 2010, First Solar was considered the second-largest maker of PV modules worldwide[6] and ranked sixth in Fast Company’s list of the world's 50 most innovative companies.[7] In 2011, it ranked first on Forbes’s list of America’s 25 fastest-growing technology companies.[8] It is listed on the Photovoltaik Global 30 Index since the beginning of this stock index in 2009. The company was also listed as No. 1 in Solar Power World magazine’s 2012 and 2013 rankings of solar contractors.[9]

Technology[edit]
First Solar manufactures cadmium telluride (CdTe)-based photovoltaic (PV) modules, which produce electricity with a thin CdTe film on glass.[10] First Solar created a world record-breaking cell with 21.5% efficiency in the laboratory, confirmed by NREL,[11] in January, 2015 and a world record-breaking Thin-Film PV module with 18.6% efficiency, confirmed by NREL,[12] in June, 2015.
Their distribution network for solar panels covers over 39 distributors and wholesalers, across over 12 different countries.[13]
Corporate history[edit]
In 1984, inventor and entrepreneur Harold McMaster founded Glasstech Solar. McMaster foresaw the opportunity to manufacture low-cost, thin film cells on a large scale. After trying amorphous silicon, he shifted to CdTe at the urging of Jim Nolan and founded Solar Cells, Inc., (SCI) in 1990 [14] and the Florida Corporation in 1993 with JD Polk. In February 1999, McMaster sold the company to True North Partners, an investment arm of the Walton family, owners of Wal-Mart.[15] John T. Walton joined the Board of the new company, and Michael J. Ahearn of True North became the CEO of the newly minted First Solar. In its early years, First Solar module efficiencies were modest, about 7 percent.
First Solar launched production of commercial products in 2002 and reached an annual production of 25 megawatts (MW) in 2005.[16] At the end of 2009, First Solar had surpassed an annual production rate of one gigawatt (GW)[17] and was the largest PV module manufacturer in the world.[18]
The company is headquartered in Tempe, Arizona and has manufacturing facilities in Perrysburg, Ohio and Kulim, Malaysia.[19] Additionally, First Solar partnered with natural gas provider Enbridge to build the largest PV solar energy farm in the world,[20] located in Sarnia, Ontario, near the Canada–US border.
In July 2010, First Solar formed a utility systems business group to address the large-scale PV systems solutions market. Utility systems are now the company's core business focus, with a strategy to focus on markets that do not require subsidies to support the solar generation business.[21]
On April 17, 2012, First Solar announced it would restructure operations worldwide. This restructuring process included phasing out operations in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany and idling four production lines in Kulim, Malaysia.[22] 30% of First Solar's workforce was laid off as a result of these actions, which were blamed on market volatility and reduced demand.[23] Mark Widmar, the CFO of First Solar, said, "We need to resize our business to a level of demand that is highly reliable and predictable."[24]
On July 1, 2016 Mark Widmar was appointed CEO of First Solar. Previously he had been Chief Financial Officer. Company founder and former CEO Mike Ahearn remains Chairman of the Board.[5]
Market history[edit]
Historically, First Solar sold its products to solar project developers, system integrators, and independent power producers. Early sales were primarily in Germany because of strong incentives for solar enacted in the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) of 2000 (cp. Solar power in Germany).[citation needed] Declines and uncertainty in feed-in-tariff subsidies for solar power in European markets, including Germany, France, Italy and Spain,[25] prompted major PV manufacturers, such as First Solar, to accelerate their expansion into other markets, including the U.S., India and China.[26]
Beginning in December 2011, First Solar has shifted away from existing markets that are heavily dependent on government subsidies and toward providing utility-scale PV systems in sustainable markets with immediate need.[27] As a result, it now competes against conventional power generators,[28] and has reduced its focus on the rooftop market.[21]
On February 24, 2009, First Solar's cost per watt broke the $1 barrier, reaching $0.98. Production cost has continued to fall and in February 2013, reached $0.68 per watt.[29]
Production history[edit]
In 2011, the company had 36 production lines with 2,376 megawatts of annual manufacturing capacity. Each line had a 66-megawatt capacity. The first factory was built in Ohio, followed by a four-line manufacturing plant in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany. In April 2007, the firm announced the construction of a plant in Kulim Hi-Tech Park, Malaysia, which was expanded to six plants in 2010. In October 2008, the firm began an expansion of its facility in Perrysburg, Ohio, completed in 2010,[30] which brought First Solar's global annual production capacity to 1,228 MW.
In the summer of 2009, the company announced plans to build its fourth production plant in France. In October 2010, First Solar announced it would build two new four-line manufacturing plants, one each in Vietnam and the United States. In November 2011 it postponed commissioning the Vietnam plant.[31] In February 2012, it postponed commissioning of a new U.S. plant in Mesa, AZ until demand develops. In May 2012, four lines in Malaysia were shut down indefinitely and plans to shutter the facility in Germany were announced.

(Source: First Solar Financial Report for Quarter 1 2012 Earnings Call; "First Solar to Boost Production as Profit, Sales Climb," Wall Street Journal, August 1, 2012)

First Solar increased its estimate for 2012 production to between 1,800 and 1,900 MWs in its Financial Report for Quarter 2.[33]

Market performance[edit]
While First Solar witnessed record sales of over $3.37 billion in 2012, its restructuring efforts impacted the bottom line, leading to a net loss of $96.3 million – or $1.11 per share – for the year.[34]
Historically, the low cost of First Solar’s modules has been the key to its market performance. The use of cadmium telluride instead of silicon allowed it to achieve a significantly lower module cost ($0.67 per watt),[35] compared to crystalline-silicon PV, which averaged $1.85 per watt in 2010.[36]
As the company shifts its focus away from module sales to utility-scale projects, it will need to become price competitive with non-solar power sources, a move which its executives say will require the company to reduce manufacturing costs and optimize efficiency.[37]
Grid parity[edit]
Main article: Grid parity
In November 2012, First Solar announced that its manufacturing cost had fallen to 67 cents per watt, a 6-cent decrease from February 2012.[38] By 2015, it expects to drive down cost per watt to make solar modules to between 52 and 54 cents. The biggest driver of the lower costs is better efficiency.[37]
In a December 2012 RenewEconomy interview with First Solar CEO James Hughes,[39] he made the following comments regarding Grid parity:
"Everyone wants to talk about “grid parity” – I’ve banned that phrase from the lexicon of First Solar. Electricity has value only at a point in time and a geographic place . There is no magic number that describes the true economic cost of electricity. You may have a tariff structure that describes it that way, but that is not the reality, and frankly, sophisticated power markets don’t operate like that. So you have to look at time of day, season and location to determine the true cost of power, and there are lots of times of day, seasons and locations where solar is economic today without subsidy. So our focus is to find those places, find those times of day, and find those market structures where we can apply ourselves."
Installations[edit]
First Solar had installed 1,505 MW of solar capacity as of 2012.[9] Below are some of First Solar’s solar installations and development projects:
North America[edit]

Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Seih Al-Dahal, UAE, includes a 13 MWDC solar power plant built by First Solar for the Dubai Electricity & Water Authority (DEWA).[46]
Stadtwerke Trier (SWT) in Trier, Germany, is one of the world’s largest thin-film solar plants. As of February 2009, it was estimated the facility would produce over 9 GWh per year, which would supply power to more than 2,400 homes each year. Additionally, it is estimated the facility will conserve 100,000 tons of CO2 over 20 years.[47]
The Ramat Hovav solar field is the largest PV power plant built so far in Israel's solar power sector. Constructed by Belectric over a previous evaporation pond, it has a nominal capacity of 37.5 MW. The facility became fully operational in December 2014.[48]
Waldpolenz Solar Park near Leipzig, Germany, is the largest thin-film PV power system in the world. Built and developed by Juwi Group, it has a capacity of 40 MW. The facility became fully operational in 2008.
In December 2009, the Lieberose Photovoltaic Park, Germany’s biggest conversion land project (126 hectares) on a former military training area, was opened with an output of 53 MW. The solar park uses 700,000 solar modules.[49]
For the Sports Stadium Bentegodi in Verona, Italy, First Solar supplied more than 13,000 thin film modules for a rooftop installation.[50]

First Solar, Inc. is an American photovoltaic (PV) manufacturer of rigid thin film modules, or solar panels, and a provider of utility-scale PV power plants and supporting services that include finance, construction, maintenance and end-of-life panel recycling. First Solar uses cadmium telluride (CdTe) as a semiconductor to produce CdTe-panels, that are competing successfully with conventional crystalline silicon technology.[2] In 2009, First Solar became the first solar panel manufacturing company to lower its manufacturing cost to $1 per watt[3] and produced CdTe-panels with an efficiency of about 14 percent at a reported cost of 59 cents per watt in 2013.[4]
The company was founded in 1990 by inventor Harold McMaster as Solar Cells, Inc. and the Florida Corporation in 1993 with JD Polk. In 1999 it was purchased by True North Partners, LLC, who rebranded it as First Solar, Inc. The company went public in 2006, trading on the NASDAQ. Its current chief executive is Mark Widmar, who succeeded the previous CEO James Hughes July 1, 2016.[5] First Solar is based in Tempe, Arizona. As of 2010, First Solar was considered the second-largest maker of PV modules worldwide[6] and ranked sixth in Fast Company’s list of the world's 50 most innovative companies.[7] In 2011, it ranked first on Forbes’s list of America’s 25 fastest-growing technology companies.[8] It is listed on the Photovoltaik Global 30 Index since the beginning of this stock index in 2009. The company was also listed as No. 1 in Solar Power World magazine’s 2012 and 2013 rankings of solar contractors.[9]

Technology[edit]
First Solar manufactures cadmium telluride (CdTe)-based photovoltaic (PV) modules, which produce electricity with a thin CdTe film on glass.[10] First Solar created a world record-breaking cell with 21.5% efficiency in the laboratory, confirmed by NREL,[11] in January, 2015 and a world record-breaking Thin-Film PV module with 18.6% efficiency, confirmed by NREL,[12] in June, 2015.
Their distribution network for solar panels covers over 39 distributors and wholesalers, across over 12 different countries.[13]
Corporate history[edit]
In 1984, inventor and entrepreneur Harold McMaster founded Glasstech Solar. McMaster foresaw the opportunity to manufacture low-cost, thin film cells on a large scale. After trying amorphous silicon, he shifted to CdTe at the urging of Jim Nolan and founded Solar Cells, Inc., (SCI) in 1990 [14] and the Florida Corporation in 1993 with JD Polk. In February 1999, McMaster sold the company to True North Partners, an investment arm of the Walton family, owners of Wal-Mart.[15] John T. Walton joined the Board of the new company, and Michael J. Ahearn of True North became the CEO of the newly minted First Solar. In its early years, First Solar module efficiencies were modest, about 7 percent.
First Solar launched production of commercial products in 2002 and reached an annual production of 25 megawatts (MW) in 2005.[16] At the end of 2009, First Solar had surpassed an annual production rate of one gigawatt (GW)[17] and was the largest PV module manufacturer in the world.[18]
The company is headquartered in Tempe, Arizona and has manufacturing facilities in Perrysburg, Ohio and Kulim, Malaysia.[19] Additionally, First Solar partnered with natural gas provider Enbridge to build the largest PV solar energy farm in the world,[20] located in Sarnia, Ontario, near the Canada–US border.
In July 2010, First Solar formed a utility systems business group to address the large-scale PV systems solutions market. Utility systems are now the company's core business focus, with a strategy to focus on markets that do not require subsidies to support the solar generation business.[21]
On April 17, 2012, First Solar announced it would restructure operations worldwide. This restructuring process included phasing out operations in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany and idling four production lines in Kulim, Malaysia.[22] 30% of First Solar's workforce was laid off as a result of these actions, which were blamed on market volatility and reduced demand.[23] Mark Widmar, the CFO of First Solar, said, "We need to resize our business to a level of demand that is highly reliable and predictable."[24]
On July 1, 2016 Mark Widmar was appointed CEO of First Solar. Previously he had been Chief Financial Officer. Company founder and former CEO Mike Ahearn remains Chairman of the Board.[5]
Market history[edit]
Historically, First Solar sold its products to solar project developers, system integrators, and independent power producers. Early sales were primarily in Germany because of strong incentives for solar enacted in the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) of 2000 (cp. Solar power in Germany).[citation needed] Declines and uncertainty in feed-in-tariff subsidies for solar power in European markets, including Germany, France, Italy and Spain,[25] prompted major PV manufacturers, such as First Solar, to accelerate their expansion into other markets, including the U.S., India and China.[26]
Beginning in December 2011, First Solar has shifted away from existing markets that are heavily dependent on government subsidies and toward providing utility-scale PV systems in sustainable markets with immediate need.[27] As a result, it now competes against conventional power generators,[28] and has reduced its focus on the rooftop market.[21]
On February 24, 2009, First Solar's cost per watt broke the $1 barrier, reaching $0.98. Production cost has continued to fall and in February 2013, reached $0.68 per watt.[29]
Production history[edit]
In 2011, the company had 36 production lines with 2,376 megawatts of annual manufacturing capacity. Each line had a 66-megawatt capacity. The first factory was built in Ohio, followed by a four-line manufacturing plant in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany. In April 2007, the firm announced the construction of a plant in Kulim Hi-Tech Park, Malaysia, which was expanded to six plants in 2010. In October 2008, the firm began an expansion of its facility in Perrysburg, Ohio, completed in 2010,[30] which brought First Solar's global annual production capacity to 1,228 MW.
In the summer of 2009, the company announced plans to build its fourth production plant in France. In October 2010, First Solar announced it would build two new four-line manufacturing plants, one each in Vietnam and the United States. In November 2011 it postponed commissioning the Vietnam plant.[31] In February 2012, it postponed commissioning of a new U.S. plant in Mesa, AZ until demand develops. In May 2012, four lines in Malaysia were shut down indefinitely and plans to shutter the facility in Germany were announced.

(Source: First Solar Financial Report for Quarter 1 2012 Earnings Call; "First Solar to Boost Production as Profit, Sales Climb," Wall Street Journal, August 1, 2012)

First Solar increased its estimate for 2012 production to between 1,800 and 1,900 MWs in its Financial Report for Quarter 2.[33]

Market performance[edit]
While First Solar witnessed record sales of over $3.37 billion in 2012, its restructuring efforts impacted the bottom line, leading to a net loss of $96.3 million – or $1.11 per share – for the year.[34]
Historically, the low cost of First Solar’s modules has been the key to its market performance. The use of cadmium telluride instead of silicon allowed it to achieve a significantly lower module cost ($0.67 per watt),[35] compared to crystalline-silicon PV, which averaged $1.85 per watt in 2010.[36]
As the company shifts its focus away from module sales to utility-scale projects, it will need to become price competitive with non-solar power sources, a move which its executives say will require the company to reduce manufacturing costs and optimize efficiency.[37]
Grid parity[edit]
Main article: Grid parity
In November 2012, First Solar announced that its manufacturing cost had fallen to 67 cents per watt, a 6-cent decrease from February 2012.[38] By 2015, it expects to drive down cost per watt to make solar modules to between 52 and 54 cents. The biggest driver of the lower costs is better efficiency.[37]
In a December 2012 RenewEconomy interview with First Solar CEO James Hughes,[39] he made the following comments regarding Grid parity:
"Everyone wants to talk about “grid parity” – I’ve banned that phrase from the lexicon of First Solar. Electricity has value only at a point in time and a geographic place . There is no magic number that describes the true economic cost of electricity. You may have a tariff structure that describes it that way, but that is not the reality, and frankly, sophisticated power markets don’t operate like that. So you have to look at time of day, season and location to determine the true cost of power, and there are lots of times of day, seasons and locations where solar is economic today without subsidy. So our focus is to find those places, find those times of day, and find those market structures where we can apply ourselves."
Installations[edit]
First Solar had installed 1,505 MW of solar capacity as of 2012.[9] Below are some of First Solar’s solar installations and development projects:

As of February 2009, it was estimated the facility would produce over 9 GWh per year, which would supply power to more than 2,400 homes each year. Additionally, it is estimated the facility will conserve 100,000 tons of CO2 over 20 years.[47]
The Ramat Hovav solar field is the largest PV power plant built so far in Israel's solar power sector. Constructed by Belectric over a previous evaporation pond, it has a nominal capacity of 37.5 MW. The facility became fully operational in December 2014.[48]
Waldpolenz Solar Park near Leipzig, Germany, is the largest thin-film PV power system in the world. Built and developed by Juwi Group, it has a capacity of 40 MW. The facility became fully operational in 2008.
In December 2009, the Lieberose Photovoltaic Park, Germany’s biggest conversion land project (126 hectares) on a former military training area, was opened with an output of 53 MW. The solar park uses 700,000 solar modules.[49]
For the Sports Stadium Bentegodi in Verona, Italy, First Solar supplied more than 13,000 thin film modules for a rooftop installation.[50]

First Solar, Inc. is an American photovoltaic (PV) manufacturer of rigid thin film modules, or solar panels, and a provider of utility-scale PV power plants and supporting services that include finance, construction, maintenance and end-of-life panel recycling. First Solar uses cadmium telluride (CdTe) as a semiconductor to produce CdTe-panels, that are competing successfully with conventional crystalline silicon technology.[2] In 2009, First Solar became the first solar panel manufacturing company to lower its manufacturing cost to $1 per watt[3] and produced CdTe-panels with an efficiency of about 14 percent at a reported cost of 59 cents per watt in 2013.[4]
The company was founded in 1990 by inventor Harold McMaster as Solar Cells, Inc. and the Florida Corporation in 1993 with JD Polk. In 1999 it was purchased by True North Partners, LLC, who rebranded it as First Solar, Inc. The company went public in 2006, trading on the NASDAQ. Its current chief executive is Mark Widmar, who succeeded the previous CEO James Hughes July 1, 2016.[5] First Solar is based in Tempe, Arizona. As of 2010, First Solar was considered the second-largest maker of PV modules worldwide[6] and ranked sixth in Fast Company’s list of the world's 50 most innovative companies.[7] In 2011, it ranked first on Forbes’s list of America’s 25 fastest-growing technology companies.[8] It is listed on the Photovoltaik Global 30 Index since the beginning of this stock index in 2009. The company was also listed as No. 1 in Solar Power World magazine’s 2012 and 2013 rankings of solar contractors.[9]

Technology[edit]
First Solar manufactures cadmium telluride (CdTe)-based photovoltaic (PV) modules, which produce electricity with a thin CdTe film on glass.[10] First Solar created a world record-breaking cell with 21.5% efficiency in the laboratory, confirmed by NREL,[11] in January, 2015 and a world record-breaking Thin-Film PV module with 18.6% efficiency, confirmed by NREL,[12] in June, 2015.
Their distribution network for solar panels covers over 39 distributors and wholesalers, across over 12 different countries.[13]
Corporate history[edit]
In 1984, inventor and entrepreneur Harold McMaster founded Glasstech Solar. McMaster foresaw the opportunity to manufacture low-cost, thin film cells on a large scale. After trying amorphous silicon, he shifted to CdTe at the urging of Jim Nolan and founded Solar Cells, Inc., (SCI) in 1990 [14] and the Florida Corporation in 1993 with JD Polk. In February 1999, McMaster sold the company to True North Partners, an investment arm of the Walton family, owners of Wal-Mart.[15] John T. Walton joined the Board of the new company, and Michael J. Ahearn of True North became the CEO of the newly minted First Solar. In its early years, First Solar module efficiencies were modest, about 7 percent.
First Solar launched production of commercial products in 2002 and reached an annual production of 25 megawatts (MW) in 2005.[16] At the end of 2009, First Solar had surpassed an annual production rate of one gigawatt (GW)[17] and was the largest PV module manufacturer in the world.[18]
The company is headquartered in Tempe, Arizona and has manufacturing facilities in Perrysburg, Ohio and Kulim, Malaysia.[19] Additionally, First Solar partnered with natural gas provider Enbridge to build the largest PV solar energy farm in the world,[20] located in Sarnia, Ontario, near the Canada–US border.
In July 2010, First Solar formed a utility systems business group to address the large-scale PV systems solutions market. Utility systems are now the company's core business focus, with a strategy to focus on markets that do not require subsidies to support the solar generation business.[21]
On April 17, 2012, First Solar announced it would restructure operations worldwide. This restructuring process included phasing out operations in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany and idling four production lines in Kulim, Malaysia.[22] 30% of First Solar's workforce was laid off as a result of these actions, which were blamed on market volatility and reduced demand.[23] Mark Widmar, the CFO of First Solar, said, "We need to resize our business to a level of demand that is highly reliable and predictable."[24]
On July 1, 2016 Mark Widmar was appointed CEO of First Solar. Previously he had been Chief Financial Officer. Company founder and former CEO Mike Ahearn remains Chairman of the Board.[5]
Market history[edit]
Historically, First Solar sold its products to solar project developers, system integrators, and independent power producers. Early sales were primarily in Germany because of strong incentives for solar enacted in the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) of 2000 (cp. Solar power in Germany).[citation needed] Declines and uncertainty in feed-in-tariff subsidies for solar power in European markets, including Germany, France, Italy and Spain,[25] prompted major PV manufacturers, such as First Solar, to accelerate their expansion into other markets, including the U.S., India and China.[26]
Beginning in December 2011, First Solar has shifted away from existing markets that are heavily dependent on government subsidies and toward providing utility-scale PV systems in sustainable markets with immediate need.[27] As a result, it now competes against conventional power generators,[28] and has reduced its focus on the rooftop market.[21]
On February 24, 2009, First Solar's cost per watt broke the $1 barrier, reaching $0.98. Production cost has continued to fall and in February 2013, reached $0.68 per watt.[29]
Production history[edit]
In 2011, the company had 36 production lines with 2,376 megawatts of annual manufacturing capacity. Each line had a 66-megawatt capacity. The first factory was built in Ohio, followed by a four-line manufacturing plant in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany. In April 2007, the firm announced the construction of a plant in Kulim Hi-Tech Park, Malaysia, which was expanded to six plants in 2010. In October 2008, the firm began an expansion of its facility in Perrysburg, Ohio, completed in 2010,[30] which brought First Solar's global annual production capacity to 1,228 MW.
In the summer of 2009, the company announced plans to build its fourth production plant in France. In October 2010, First Solar announced it would build two new four-line manufacturing plants, one each in Vietnam and the United States. In November 2011 it postponed commissioning the Vietnam plant.[31] In February 2012, it postponed commissioning of a new U.S. plant in Mesa, AZ until demand develops. In May 2012, four lines in Malaysia were shut down indefinitely and plans to shutter the facility in Germany were announced.

(Source: First Solar Financial Report for Quarter 1 2012 Earnings Call; "First Solar to Boost Production as Profit, Sales Climb," Wall Street Journal, August 1, 2012)

First Solar increased its estimate for 2012 production to between 1,800 and 1,900 MWs in its Financial Report for Quarter 2.[33]

Market performance[edit]
While First Solar witnessed record sales of over $3.37 billion in 2012, its restructuring efforts impacted the bottom line, leading to a net loss of $96.3 million – or $1.11 per share – for the year.[34]
Historically, the low cost of First Solar’s modules has been the key to its market performance. The use of cadmium telluride instead of silicon allowed it to achieve a significantly lower module cost ($0.67 per watt),[35] compared to crystalline-silicon PV, which averaged $1.85 per watt in 2010.[36]
As the company shifts its focus away from module sales to utility-scale projects, it will need to become price competitive with non-solar power sources, a move which its executives say will require the company to reduce manufacturing costs and optimize efficiency.[37]
Grid parity[edit]
Main article: Grid parity
In November 2012, First Solar announced that its manufacturing cost had fallen to 67 cents per watt, a 6-cent decrease from February 2012.[38] By 2015, it expects to drive down cost per watt to make solar modules to between 52 and 54 cents. The biggest driver of the lower costs is better efficiency.[37]
In a December 2012 RenewEconomy interview with First Solar CEO James Hughes,[39] he made the following comments regarding Grid parity:
"Everyone wants to talk about “grid parity” – I’ve banned that phrase from the lexicon of First Solar. Electricity has value only at a point in time and a geographic place . There is no magic number that describes the true economic cost of electricity. You may have a tariff structure that describes it that way, but that is not the reality, and frankly, sophisticated power markets don’t operate like that. So you have to look at time of day, season and location to determine the true cost of power, and there are lots of times of day, seasons and locations where solar is economic today without subsidy. So our focus is to find those places, find those times of day, and find those market structures where we can apply ourselves."
Installations[edit]
First Solar had installed 1,505 MW of solar capacity as of 2012.[9] Below are some of First Solar’s solar installations and development projects:
North America[edit]

290 MW Agua Caliente Solar Project in Yuma County, AZ, constructed for NRG Energy and MidAmerican Renewables.[40]
550 MW Topaz Solar Farm in San Luis Obispo County, CA, acquired by MidAmerican Energy Holdings.[41]
550 MW Desert Sunlight Solar Farm in Riverside County, CA, acquired by NextEra Energy and GE Energy Financial Services.[42]

Europe, Middle East and North Africa[edit]

Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Seih Al-Dahal, UAE, includes a 13 MWDC solar power plant built by First Solar for the Dubai Electricity & Water Authority (DEWA).[46]
Stadtwerke Trier (SWT) in Trier, Germany, is one of the world’s largest thin-film solar plants. As of February 2009, it was estimated the facility would produce over 9 GWh per year, which would supply power to more than 2,400 homes each year. Additionally, it is estimated the facility will conserve 100,000 tons of CO2 over 20 years.[47]
The Ramat Hovav solar field is the largest PV power plant built so far in Israel's solar power sector. Constructed by Belectric over a previous evaporation pond, it has a nominal capacity of 37.5 MW. The facility became fully operational in December 2014.[48]
Waldpolenz Solar Park near Leipzig, Germany, is the largest thin-film PV power system in the world. Built and developed by Juwi Group, it has a capacity of 40 MW. The facility became fully operational in 2008.
In December 2009, the Lieberose Photovoltaic Park, Germany’s biggest conversion land project (126 hectares) on a former military training area, was opened with an output of 53 MW. The solar park uses 700,000 solar modules.[49]
For the Sports Stadium Bentegodi in Verona, Italy, First Solar supplied more than 13,000 thin film modules for a rooftop installation.[50]

Asia and Australia[edit]

10 MW Greenough River Solar Farm in Western Australia, completed for Verve Energy and GE Energy Financial Services.[51]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
