History[edit]
The company was founded in Düsseldorf, Germany in January 2005. Seeing an opportunity in the hotel search space, the founding team developed Germany’s first hotel search engine. Shortly after launch, Stubner resigned as Managing Director, but the three other founders remain.[4]
Initially, Trivago received €1 million from investors, including the Samwer brothers, Florian Heinemann and Christian Vollmann. [4] In 2008, Trivago received $1.14 million in Series B funding from the British company HOWZAT media LLP. [5] In December 2010, Trivago sold a quarter of the company for $52.86M to a US investment fund, Insight Venture Partners.[6]
In December 2012, Expedia, an American travel company, announced that it would acquire a 61.6% stake in Trivago for US$632 million.[7][4] The deal was completed in 2013.
In December 2014, Trivago acquired mobile app product and development company Rheinfabrik. After the acquisition, Rheinfabrik remains independent from Trivago in its work.[8]
In 2015, Andrej Lehnert[9] and Johannes Thomas (Hotel Sales, Business) joined Trivago's Managing Director team.[10] In 2015, Trivago reported more than $500 million in revenue,[11] and said its revenue had doubled every year from 2008 to 2015. [3]
In March 2016, Trivago announced it had acquired 52.3% of Cloud-PMS company Base7booking, after taking majority control of the Switzerland-based company in the third quarter of 2015. Trivago integrated Base7booking's property management system, which enables small and independent hoteliers to manage daily operations, run reports, send invoices and manage digital and email marketing.[12]
In April 2016, Trivago reached 1000 employees and began building a new campus in Düsseldorf.[13]
On December, 16, 2016, Trivago became publicly traded on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol TRVG.[14][15] Expedia retains 64.7% of voting rights and 59.7% of economic rights.[16]
Operations[edit]
Trivago is headquartered in Düsseldorf, where the international operations are conducted and 90% of the company’s employees work.[4] In 2014, Trivago opened new offices in Leipzig and Palma de Mallorca. [4]
Business model[edit]
As a hotel price comparison website, Trivago makes money from advertising partners primarily using a cost-per-click (CPC) business model. Booking platforms, hoteliers and other providers list rates and advertise on the Trivago site, paying for the clicks received from Trivago users.[17][4]
Trivago also offers free and fee-based versions[10] of its Hotel Manager product, which allows hoteliers to manage their online presence and visibility on the Trivago site.[18] Trivago claims to be the world's largest online hotel search site, comparing rates from over 1 million hotels and more than 250 booking sites worldwide. The site includes over 190 million hotel ratings and 14 million photos, and reports over 120 million visitors per month. Since their majority shareholder is Expedia the effort is to direct bookings to their sites by way of various "adjustments" to how other sites rates are perceived. They also offer rates through many sites reselling for travel wholesalers where rooms may or may not be available at time of booking. No effort is made to ensure the credibility of these sites.

Hotel search[edit]
Trivago's hotel search engine was the first of its kind in Germany[1] and has websites in 50+ countries.[4] trivago claims to be the world's largest online hotel search site, comparing rates from over 1 million hotels and more than 250 booking sites worldwide. The site includes over 190 million hotel ratings and 14 million photos, and reports over 120 million visitors per month.[11]
Trivago's search tool scans hotel booking sites for prices, availability, images and reviews within seconds.[19] When users choose a hotel, they are redirected to a partner website to complete the booking.[20]
Trivago app[edit]
Trivago offers a free app for its Hotel Search product on both iOS and Android.[21] In addition to the hotel search feature, the app provides interactive maps and displays accommodations in close proximity to the user's current location.[22]
The Trivago App has been listed in Mashable's 25 Apps to save you money,[21] USA Today's 10 best apps for booking your stay,[23] the Independent in Ireland as an app to save you time and money[24] and Australia's News.com.au as one of the top apps to take on holiday.[25]
Trivago Hotel Manager[edit]
Hotel Manager is Trivago’s B2B platform that allows hoteliers to manage their presence on the Trivago site. The platform gives hotels and chains customer data to attempt to secure more bookings and increase business.[26] Hoteliers can monitor their performance, for example seeing the amount of profile views, clicks and bookings they receive.
Hotel Manager Pro[edit]
Hotel Manager Pro is the fee-based version of Trivago's Hotel Manager platform. The Pro version enables hoteliers to update and customize their own listings, as well as access analytics about competitor rates. Trivago states that up-to-date listings, including images and amenity information, help properties increase their rankings on the site.[10]
Rate Connect[edit]
Rate Connect is a feature that allows individual hotels to update their current rates and availability directly via the Trivago Hotel Manager tool.[27]
Indexes and rankings[edit]
Trivago Rating Index (TRI)[edit]
The TRI aggregates all ratings for destinations listed on Trivago and ranks them between 0 and 100.[28] The index includes criteria such as location, price, food, internet, room and facilities,[29] and is used to create annual Trivago rankings and awards such as the Reputation Ranking,[30] Island Ranking,[31] Ski Ranking,[32] the Top Hotel Awards,[33] and the Best Value Destinations (based on an algorithm combining the tRI with price).[34]
Trivago Hotel Price Index (tHPI)[edit]
The tHPI displays the average overnight accommodation prices for the most popular cities worldwide. Prices are based on the cost of a standard double room, taken from over 2 million daily price inquiries over the past month.[11]
Travel Advice Calendars[edit]
Trivago's Travel Advice Calendars show the most affordable and most expensive months to visit top destinations. The calendars feature 45 cities across six continenPI to provide average monthly hotel prices.[35]
Marketing[edit]
Trivago focuses on online marketing (SEM and display advertising), public relations and brand marketing (TV).[36] The company has historically entered new countries using predominantly television advertising.[37]
When Facebook expanded its Dynamic Ads product to cover travel brands, Trivago was one of its two initial launch participants.[38]
The "Trivago Guy"[edit]
When the company aired its first U.S. TV advertisement in 2012, the ad’s spokesman inspired a trending Twitter hashtag, #trivagoguy, based on his unusual look.[39] According to Rolling Stone, trivago “wanted someone real, approachable and genuine” when it chose actor Tim Williams to star in the ad. The Trivago guy became an unexpected celebrity, with some people noting his unbuttoned shirt and creepy vibe, while others found his scruffy appearance and deep voice "inexplicably sexy.”[40]
Trivago responded to the comments by launching a contest that invited people to give Trivago Guy a makeover.[41] The Trivago Guy inspired parodies, fan fiction and a large gay following.[42] Many commenters asked why Trivago chose not to have the actor wear a belt. According to the actor, that was an accident. "Unfortunately none of the belts fit the belt loops that I had on," Williams said. "I think that was probably the best break we could have gotten."[39] Following the large response for the U.S. Trivago Guy, the company decided to create French and Spanish Trivago Guys.[39]
Work environment[edit]
Trivago states that it attempts to recruit tech and business employees that are "willing to cross borders".[1] Trivago's first employees were hired via Skype interview from Spain, Italy and Canada, and today 90 percent of its staff is recruited internationally.[4]
The company operates with virtually no hierarchies or titles,[1] instead using a model called swarm intelligence. It also does not have fixed working hours, and offers employees a four-day surprise holiday each year and one month working in Mallorca.[43] Trivago states that it receives around 50,000 applicants per year.[1]
Employees[edit]
The average age of a Trivago employee is 28 years old [1] and it has 63 nationalities working out of its main office. The office space has flags lining the desks representing where each employee originates from.[44]
New campus[edit]
On February 2, 2016, Trivago announced its plans to build a global campus in Düsseldorf, designed to accommodate over 2000 people and be ready by 2018.[11] The six-story building is being designed by SOP Architekten in Düsseldorf. The new campus will be built on the docks of Kesselstraße in the Düsseldorf Media Harbour, close to the famous Neuer Zollhof buildings designed by Frank Gehry. The campus will be accessible by public transportation as well as by bike.[11]
Lawsuits[edit]
In August 2016, Buckeye Tree Lodge and Sequoia Village Inn, LLC filed a class-action lawsuit in California, accusing the company and its partners of "brazen deceit" by coordinating with internet search engines and social media institutions to return false results on lodging entities in favor of those affiliated with their websites, in violation of the Lanham Act. The case is pending.[45][46]

History[edit]
The company was founded in Düsseldorf, Germany in January 2005. Seeing an opportunity in the hotel search space, the founding team developed Germany’s first hotel search engine. Shortly after launch, Stubner resigned as Managing Director, but the three other founders remain.[4]
Initially, Trivago received €1 million from investors, including the Samwer brothers, Florian Heinemann and Christian Vollmann. [4] In 2008, Trivago received $1.14 million in Series B funding from the British company HOWZAT media LLP. [5] In December 2010, Trivago sold a quarter of the company for $52.86M to a US investment fund, Insight Venture Partners.[6]
In December 2012, Expedia, an American travel company, announced that it would acquire a 61.6% stake in Trivago for US$632 million.[7][4] The deal was completed in 2013.
In December 2014, Trivago acquired mobile app product and development company Rheinfabrik. After the acquisition, Rheinfabrik remains independent from Trivago in its work.[8]
In 2015, Andrej Lehnert[9] and Johannes Thomas (Hotel Sales, Business) joined Trivago's Managing Director team.[10] In 2015, Trivago reported more than $500 million in revenue,[11] and said its revenue had doubled every year from 2008 to 2015. [3]
In March 2016, Trivago announced it had acquired 52.3% of Cloud-PMS company Base7booking, after taking majority control of the Switzerland-based company in the third quarter of 2015. Trivago integrated Base7booking's property management system, which enables small and independent hoteliers to manage daily operations, run reports, send invoices and manage digital and email marketing.[12]
In April 2016, Trivago reached 1000 employees and began building a new campus in Düsseldorf.[13]
On December, 16, 2016, Trivago became publicly traded on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol TRVG.[14][15] Expedia retains 64.7% of voting rights and 59.7% of economic rights.[16]
Operations[edit]
Trivago is headquartered in Düsseldorf, where the international operations are conducted and 90% of the company’s employees work.[4] In 2014, Trivago opened new offices in Leipzig and Palma de Mallorca. [4]
Business model[edit]
As a hotel price comparison website, Trivago makes money from advertising partners primarily using a cost-per-click (CPC) business model. Booking platforms, hoteliers and other providers list rates and advertise on the Trivago site, paying for the clicks received from Trivago users.[17][4]
Trivago also offers free and fee-based versions[10] of its Hotel Manager product, which allows hoteliers to manage their online presence and visibility on the Trivago site.[18] Trivago claims to be the world's largest online hotel search site, comparing rates from over 1 million hotels and more than 250 booking sites worldwide. The site includes over 190 million hotel ratings and 14 million photos, and reports over 120 million visitors per month. Since their majority shareholder is Expedia the effort is to direct bookings to their sites by way of various "adjustments" to how other sites rates are perceived. They also offer rates through many sites reselling for travel wholesalers where rooms may or may not be available at time of booking. No effort is made to ensure the credibility of these sites.
Products and features[edit]
Hotel search[edit]
Trivago's hotel search engine was the first of its kind in Germany[1] and has websites in 50+ countries.[4] trivago claims to be the world's largest online hotel search site, comparing rates from over 1 million hotels and more than 250 booking sites worldwide. The site includes over 190 million hotel ratings and 14 million photos, and reports over 120 million visitors per month.[11]
Trivago's search tool scans hotel booking sites for prices, availability, images and reviews within seconds.[19] When users choose a hotel, they are redirected to a partner website to complete the booking.[20]
Trivago app[edit]
Trivago offers a free app for its Hotel Search product on both iOS and Android.[21] In addition to the hotel search feature, the app provides interactive maps and displays accommodations in close proximity to the user's current location.[22]
The Trivago App has been listed in Mashable's 25 Apps to save you money,[21] USA Today's 10 best apps for booking your stay,[23] the Independent in Ireland as an app to save you time and money[24] and Australia's News.com.au as one of the top apps to take on holiday.[25]
Trivago Hotel Manager[edit]
Hotel Manager is Trivago’s B2B platform that allows hoteliers to manage their presence on the Trivago site. The platform gives hotels and chains customer data to attempt to secure more bookings and increase business.[26] Hoteliers can monitor their performance, for example seeing the amount of profile views, clicks and bookings they receive.
Hotel Manager Pro[edit]
Hotel Manager Pro is the fee-based version of Trivago's Hotel Manager platform. The Pro version enables hoteliers to update and customize their own listings, as well as access analytics about competitor rates. Trivago states that up-to-date listings, including images and amenity information, help properties increase their rankings on the site.[10]
Rate Connect[edit]
Rate Connect is a feature that allows individual hotels to update their current rates and availability directly via the Trivago Hotel Manager tool.[27]
Indexes and rankings[edit]
Trivago Rating Index (TRI)[edit]
The TRI aggregates all ratings for destinations listed on Trivago and ranks them between 0 and 100.[28] The index includes criteria such as location, price, food, internet, room and facilities,[29] and is used to create annual Trivago rankings and awards such as the Reputation Ranking,[30] Island Ranking,[31] Ski Ranking,[32] the Top Hotel Awards,[33] and the Best Value Destinations (based on an algorithm combining the tRI with price).[34]
Trivago Hotel Price Index (tHPI)[edit]
The tHPI displays the average overnight accommodation prices for the most popular cities worldwide. Prices are based on the cost of a standard double room, taken from over 2 million daily price inquiries over the past month.[11]
Travel Advice Calendars[edit]
Trivago's Travel Advice Calendars show the most affordable and most expensive months to visit top destinations. The calendars feature 45 cities across six continenPI to provide average monthly hotel prices.[35]
Marketing[edit]
Trivago focuses on online marketing (SEM and display advertising), public relations and brand marketing (TV).[36] The company has historically entered new countries using predominantly television advertising.[37]
When Facebook expanded its Dynamic Ads product to cover travel brands, Trivago was one of its two initial launch participants.[38]
The "Trivago Guy"[edit]
When the company aired its first U.S. TV advertisement in 2012, the ad’s spokesman inspired a trending Twitter hashtag, #trivagoguy, based on his unusual look.[39] According to Rolling Stone, trivago “wanted someone real, approachable and genuine” when it chose actor Tim Williams to star in the ad. The Trivago guy became an unexpected celebrity, with some people noting his unbuttoned shirt and creepy vibe, while others found his scruffy appearance and deep voice "inexplicably sexy.”[40]
Trivago responded to the comments by launching a contest that invited people to give Trivago Guy a makeover.[41] The Trivago Guy inspired parodies, fan fiction and a large gay following.[42] Many commenters asked why Trivago chose not to have the actor wear a belt. According to the actor, that was an accident. "Unfortunately none of the belts fit the belt loops that I had on," Williams said. "I think that was probably the best break we could have gotten."[39] Following the large response for the U.S. Trivago Guy, the company decided to create French and Spanish Trivago Guys.[39]
Work environment[edit]
Trivago states that it attempts to recruit tech and business employees that are "willing to cross borders".[1] Trivago's first employees were hired via Skype interview from Spain, Italy and Canada, and today 90 percent of its staff is recruited internationally.[4]
The company operates with virtually no hierarchies or titles,[1] instead using a model called swarm intelligence. It also does not have fixed working hours, and offers employees a four-day surprise holiday each year and one month working in Mallorca.[43] Trivago states that it receives around 50,000 applicants per year.[1]
Employees[edit]
The average age of a Trivago employee is 28 years old [1] and it has 63 nationalities working out of its main office. The office space has flags lining the desks representing where each employee originates from.[44]
New campus[edit]
On February 2, 2016, Trivago announced its plans to build a global campus in Düsseldorf, designed to accommodate over 2000 people and be ready by 2018.[11] The six-story building is being designed by SOP Architekten in Düsseldorf. The new campus will be built on the docks of Kesselstraße in the Düsseldorf Media Harbour, close to the famous Neuer Zollhof buildings designed by Frank Gehry. The campus will be accessible by public transportation as well as by bike.[11]
Lawsuits[edit]
In August 2016, Buckeye Tree Lodge and Sequoia Village Inn, LLC filed a class-action lawsuit in California, accusing the company and its partners of "brazen deceit" by coordinating with internet search engines and social media institutions to return false results on lodging entities in favor of those affiliated with their websites, in violation of the Lanham Act. The case is pending.[45][46]

History[edit]
The company was founded in Düsseldorf, Germany in January 2005. Seeing an opportunity in the hotel search space, the founding team developed Germany’s first hotel search engine. Shortly after launch, Stubner resigned as Managing Director, but the three other founders remain.[4]
Initially, Trivago received €1 million from investors, including the Samwer brothers, Florian Heinemann and Christian Vollmann. [4] In 2008, Trivago received $1.14 million in Series B funding from the British company HOWZAT media LLP. [5] In December 2010, Trivago sold a quarter of the company for $52.86M to a US investment fund, Insight Venture Partners.[6]
In December 2012, Expedia, an American travel company, announced that it would acquire a 61.6% stake in Trivago for US$632 million.[7][4] The deal was completed in 2013.
In December 2014, Trivago acquired mobile app product and development company Rheinfabrik. After the acquisition, Rheinfabrik remains independent from Trivago in its work.[8]
In 2015, Andrej Lehnert[9] and Johannes Thomas (Hotel Sales, Business) joined Trivago's Managing Director team.[10] In 2015, Trivago reported more than $500 million in revenue,[11] and said its revenue had doubled every year from 2008 to 2015. [3]
In March 2016, Trivago announced it had acquired 52.3% of Cloud-PMS company Base7booking, after taking majority control of the Switzerland-based company in the third quarter of 2015. Trivago integrated Base7booking's property management system, which enables small and independent hoteliers to manage daily operations, run reports, send invoices and manage digital and email marketing.[12]
In April 2016, Trivago reached 1000 employees and began building a new campus in Düsseldorf.[13]
On December, 16, 2016, Trivago became publicly traded on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol TRVG.[14][15] Expedia retains 64.7% of voting rights and 59.7% of economic rights.[16]

Trivago also offers free and fee-based versions[10] of its Hotel Manager product, which allows hoteliers to manage their online presence and visibility on the Trivago site.[18] Trivago claims to be the world's largest online hotel search site, comparing rates from over 1 million hotels and more than 250 booking sites worldwide. The site includes over 190 million hotel ratings and 14 million photos, and reports over 120 million visitors per month. Since their majority shareholder is Expedia the effort is to direct bookings to their sites by way of various "adjustments" to how other sites rates are perceived. They also offer rates through many sites reselling for travel wholesalers where rooms may or may not be available at time of booking. No effort is made to ensure the credibility of these sites.

Trivago states that up-to-date listings, including images and amenity information, help properties increase their rankings on the site.[10]
Rate Connect[edit]
Rate Connect is a feature that allows individual hotels to update their current rates and availability directly via the Trivago Hotel Manager tool.[27]
Indexes and rankings[edit]
Trivago Rating Index (TRI)[edit]
The TRI aggregates all ratings for destinations listed on Trivago and ranks them between 0 and 100.[28] The index includes criteria such as location, price, food, internet, room and facilities,[29] and is used to create annual Trivago rankings and awards such as the Reputation Ranking,[30] Island Ranking,[31] Ski Ranking,[32] the Top Hotel Awards,[33] and the Best Value Destinations (based on an algorithm combining the tRI with price).[34]
Trivago Hotel Price Index (tHPI)[edit]
The tHPI displays the average overnight accommodation prices for the most popular cities worldwide. Prices are based on the cost of a standard double room, taken from over 2 million daily price inquiries over the past month.[11]
Travel Advice Calendars[edit]
Trivago's Travel Advice Calendars show the most affordable and most expensive months to visit top destinations. The calendars feature 45 cities across six continenPI to provide average monthly hotel prices.[35]
Marketing[edit]
Trivago focuses on online marketing (SEM and display advertising), public relations and brand marketing (TV).[36] The company has historically entered new countries using predominantly television advertising.[37]
When Facebook expanded its Dynamic Ads product to cover travel brands, Trivago was one of its two initial launch participants.[38]
The "Trivago Guy"[edit]
When the company aired its first U.S. TV advertisement in 2012, the ad’s spokesman inspired a trending Twitter hashtag, #trivagoguy, based on his unusual look.[39] According to Rolling Stone, trivago “wanted someone real, approachable and genuine” when it chose actor Tim Williams to star in the ad. The Trivago guy became an unexpected celebrity, with some people noting his unbuttoned shirt and creepy vibe, while others found his scruffy appearance and deep voice "inexplicably sexy.”[40]
Trivago responded to the comments by launching a contest that invited people to give Trivago Guy a makeover.[41] The Trivago Guy inspired parodies, fan fiction and a large gay following.[42] Many commenters asked why Trivago chose not to have the actor wear a belt. According to the actor, that was an accident. "Unfortunately none of the belts fit the belt loops that I had on," Williams said. "I think that was probably the best break we could have gotten."[39] Following the large response for the U.S. Trivago Guy, the company decided to create French and Spanish Trivago Guys.[39]
Work environment[edit]
Trivago states that it attempts to recruit tech and business employees that are "willing to cross borders".[1] Trivago's first employees were hired via Skype interview from Spain, Italy and Canada, and today 90 percent of its staff is recruited internationally.[4]
The company operates with virtually no hierarchies or titles,[1] instead using a model called swarm intelligence. It also does not have fixed working hours, and offers employees a four-day surprise holiday each year and one month working in Mallorca.[43] Trivago states that it receives around 50,000 applicants per year.[1]
Employees[edit]
The average age of a Trivago employee is 28 years old [1] and it has 63 nationalities working out of its main office. The office space has flags lining the desks representing where each employee originates from.[44]
New campus[edit]
On February 2, 2016, Trivago announced its plans to build a global campus in Düsseldorf, designed to accommodate over 2000 people and be ready by 2018.[11] The six-story building is being designed by SOP Architekten in Düsseldorf. The new campus will be built on the docks of Kesselstraße in the Düsseldorf Media Harbour, close to the famous Neuer Zollhof buildings designed by Frank Gehry. The campus will be accessible by public transportation as well as by bike.[11]
Lawsuits[edit]
In August 2016, Buckeye Tree Lodge and Sequoia Village Inn, LLC filed a class-action lawsuit in California, accusing the company and its partners of "brazen deceit" by coordinating with internet search engines and social media institutions to return false results on lodging entities in favor of those affiliated with their websites, in violation of the Lanham Act. The case is pending.[45][46]

History[edit]
The company was founded in Düsseldorf, Germany in January 2005. Seeing an opportunity in the hotel search space, the founding team developed Germany’s first hotel search engine. Shortly after launch, Stubner resigned as Managing Director, but the three other founders remain.[4]
Initially, Trivago received €1 million from investors, including the Samwer brothers, Florian Heinemann and Christian Vollmann. [4] In 2008, Trivago received $1.14 million in Series B funding from the British company HOWZAT media LLP. [5] In December 2010, Trivago sold a quarter of the company for $52.86M to a US investment fund, Insight Venture Partners.[6]
In December 2012, Expedia, an American travel company, announced that it would acquire a 61.6% stake in Trivago for US$632 million.[7][4] The deal was completed in 2013.
In December 2014, Trivago acquired mobile app product and development company Rheinfabrik. After the acquisition, Rheinfabrik remains independent from Trivago in its work.[8]
In 2015, Andrej Lehnert[9] and Johannes Thomas (Hotel Sales, Business) joined Trivago's Managing Director team.[10] In 2015, Trivago reported more than $500 million in revenue,[11] and said its revenue had doubled every year from 2008 to 2015. [3]
In March 2016, Trivago announced it had acquired 52.3% of Cloud-PMS company Base7booking, after taking majority control of the Switzerland-based company in the third quarter of 2015. Trivago integrated Base7booking's property management system, which enables small and independent hoteliers to manage daily operations, run reports, send invoices and manage digital and email marketing.[12]
In April 2016, Trivago reached 1000 employees and began building a new campus in Düsseldorf.[13]
On December, 16, 2016, Trivago became publicly traded on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol TRVG.[14][15] Expedia retains 64.7% of voting rights and 59.7% of economic rights.[16]
Operations[edit]
Trivago is headquartered in Düsseldorf, where the international operations are conducted and 90% of the company’s employees work.[4] In 2014, Trivago opened new offices in Leipzig and Palma de Mallorca. [4]
Business model[edit]
As a hotel price comparison website, Trivago makes money from advertising partners primarily using a cost-per-click (CPC) business model. Booking platforms, hoteliers and other providers list rates and advertise on the Trivago site, paying for the clicks received from Trivago users.[17][4]
Trivago also offers free and fee-based versions[10] of its Hotel Manager product, which allows hoteliers to manage their online presence and visibility on the Trivago site.[18] Trivago claims to be the world's largest online hotel search site, comparing rates from over 1 million hotels and more than 250 booking sites worldwide. The site includes over 190 million hotel ratings and 14 million photos, and reports over 120 million visitors per month. Since their majority shareholder is Expedia the effort is to direct bookings to their sites by way of various "adjustments" to how other sites rates are perceived. They also offer rates through many sites reselling for travel wholesalers where rooms may or may not be available at time of booking. No effort is made to ensure the credibility of these sites.

The site includes over 190 million hotel ratings and 14 million photos, and reports over 120 million visitors per month.[11]
Trivago's search tool scans hotel booking sites for prices, availability, images and reviews within seconds.[19] When users choose a hotel, they are redirected to a partner website to complete the booking.[20]

Trivago Hotel Price Index (tHPI)[edit]

"I think that was probably the best break we could have gotten."[39] Following the large response for the U.S. Trivago Guy, the company decided to create French and Spanish Trivago Guys.[39]

History[edit]
The company was founded in Düsseldorf, Germany in January 2005. Seeing an opportunity in the hotel search space, the founding team developed Germany’s first hotel search engine. Shortly after launch, Stubner resigned as Managing Director, but the three other founders remain.[4]
Initially, Trivago received €1 million from investors, including the Samwer brothers, Florian Heinemann and Christian Vollmann. [4] In 2008, Trivago received $1.14 million in Series B funding from the British company HOWZAT media LLP. [5] In December 2010, Trivago sold a quarter of the company for $52.86M to a US investment fund, Insight Venture Partners.[6]
In December 2012, Expedia, an American travel company, announced that it would acquire a 61.6% stake in Trivago for US$632 million.[7][4] The deal was completed in 2013.
In December 2014, Trivago acquired mobile app product and development company Rheinfabrik. After the acquisition, Rheinfabrik remains independent from Trivago in its work.[8]
In 2015, Andrej Lehnert[9] and Johannes Thomas (Hotel Sales, Business) joined Trivago's Managing Director team.[10] In 2015, Trivago reported more than $500 million in revenue,[11] and said its revenue had doubled every year from 2008 to 2015. [3]
In March 2016, Trivago announced it had acquired 52.3% of Cloud-PMS company Base7booking, after taking majority control of the Switzerland-based company in the third quarter of 2015. Trivago integrated Base7booking's property management system, which enables small and independent hoteliers to manage daily operations, run reports, send invoices and manage digital and email marketing.[12]
In April 2016, Trivago reached 1000 employees and began building a new campus in Düsseldorf.[13]
On December, 16, 2016, Trivago became publicly traded on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol TRVG.[14][15] Expedia retains 64.7% of voting rights and 59.7% of economic rights.[16]
Operations[edit]
Trivago is headquartered in Düsseldorf, where the international operations are conducted and 90% of the company’s employees work.[4] In 2014, Trivago opened new offices in Leipzig and Palma de Mallorca. [4]
Business model[edit]
As a hotel price comparison website, Trivago makes money from advertising partners primarily using a cost-per-click (CPC) business model. Booking platforms, hoteliers and other providers list rates and advertise on the Trivago site, paying for the clicks received from Trivago users.[17][4]
Trivago also offers free and fee-based versions[10] of its Hotel Manager product, which allows hoteliers to manage their online presence and visibility on the Trivago site.[18] Trivago claims to be the world's largest online hotel search site, comparing rates from over 1 million hotels and more than 250 booking sites worldwide. The site includes over 190 million hotel ratings and 14 million photos, and reports over 120 million visitors per month. Since their majority shareholder is Expedia the effort is to direct bookings to their sites by way of various "adjustments" to how other sites rates are perceived. They also offer rates through many sites reselling for travel wholesalers where rooms may or may not be available at time of booking. No effort is made to ensure the credibility of these sites.

Hotel search[edit]
Trivago's hotel search engine was the first of its kind in Germany[1] and has websites in 50+ countries.[4] trivago claims to be the world's largest online hotel search site, comparing rates from over 1 million hotels and more than 250 booking sites worldwide. The site includes over 190 million hotel ratings and 14 million photos, and reports over 120 million visitors per month.[11]
Trivago's search tool scans hotel booking sites for prices, availability, images and reviews within seconds.[19] When users choose a hotel, they are redirected to a partner website to complete the booking.[20]
Trivago app[edit]
Trivago offers a free app for its Hotel Search product on both iOS and Android.[21] In addition to the hotel search feature, the app provides interactive maps and displays accommodations in close proximity to the user's current location.[22]
The Trivago App has been listed in Mashable's 25 Apps to save you money,[21] USA Today's 10 best apps for booking your stay,[23] the Independent in Ireland as an app to save you time and money[24] and Australia's News.com.au as one of the top apps to take on holiday.[25]
Trivago Hotel Manager[edit]
Hotel Manager is Trivago’s B2B platform that allows hoteliers to manage their presence on the Trivago site. The platform gives hotels and chains customer data to attempt to secure more bookings and increase business.[26] Hoteliers can monitor their performance, for example seeing the amount of profile views, clicks and bookings they receive.
Hotel Manager Pro[edit]
Hotel Manager Pro is the fee-based version of Trivago's Hotel Manager platform. The Pro version enables hoteliers to update and customize their own listings, as well as access analytics about competitor rates. Trivago states that up-to-date listings, including images and amenity information, help properties increase their rankings on the site.[10]
Rate Connect[edit]
Rate Connect is a feature that allows individual hotels to update their current rates and availability directly via the Trivago Hotel Manager tool.[27]
Indexes and rankings[edit]
Trivago Rating Index (TRI)[edit]
The TRI aggregates all ratings for destinations listed on Trivago and ranks them between 0 and 100.[28] The index includes criteria such as location, price, food, internet, room and facilities,[29] and is used to create annual Trivago rankings and awards such as the Reputation Ranking,[30] Island Ranking,[31] Ski Ranking,[32] the Top Hotel Awards,[33] and the Best Value Destinations (based on an algorithm combining the tRI with price).[34]
Trivago Hotel Price Index (tHPI)[edit]
The tHPI displays the average overnight accommodation prices for the most popular cities worldwide. Prices are based on the cost of a standard double room, taken from over 2 million daily price inquiries over the past month.[11]
Travel Advice Calendars[edit]
Trivago's Travel Advice Calendars show the most affordable and most expensive months to visit top destinations. The calendars feature 45 cities across six continenPI to provide average monthly hotel prices.[35]
Marketing[edit]
Trivago focuses on online marketing (SEM and display advertising), public relations and brand marketing (TV).[36] The company has historically entered new countries using predominantly television advertising.[37]
When Facebook expanded its Dynamic Ads product to cover travel brands, Trivago was one of its two initial launch participants.[38]
The "Trivago Guy"[edit]
When the company aired its first U.S. TV advertisement in 2012, the ad’s spokesman inspired a trending Twitter hashtag, #trivagoguy, based on his unusual look.[39] According to Rolling Stone, trivago “wanted someone real, approachable and genuine” when it chose actor Tim Williams to star in the ad. The Trivago guy became an unexpected celebrity, with some people noting his unbuttoned shirt and creepy vibe, while others found his scruffy appearance and deep voice "inexplicably sexy.”[40]
Trivago responded to the comments by launching a contest that invited people to give Trivago Guy a makeover.[41] The Trivago Guy inspired parodies, fan fiction and a large gay following.[42] Many commenters asked why Trivago chose not to have the actor wear a belt. According to the actor, that was an accident. "Unfortunately none of the belts fit the belt loops that I had on," Williams said. "I think that was probably the best break we could have gotten."[39] Following the large response for the U.S. Trivago Guy, the company decided to create French and Spanish Trivago Guys.[39]
Work environment[edit]
Trivago states that it attempts to recruit tech and business employees that are "willing to cross borders".[1] Trivago's first employees were hired via Skype interview from Spain, Italy and Canada, and today 90 percent of its staff is recruited internationally.[4]
The company operates with virtually no hierarchies or titles,[1] instead using a model called swarm intelligence. It also does not have fixed working hours, and offers employees a four-day surprise holiday each year and one month working in Mallorca.[43] Trivago states that it receives around 50,000 applicants per year.[1]
Employees[edit]
The average age of a Trivago employee is 28 years old [1] and it has 63 nationalities working out of its main office. The office space has flags lining the desks representing where each employee originates from.[44]
New campus[edit]
On February 2, 2016, Trivago announced its plans to build a global campus in Düsseldorf, designed to accommodate over 2000 people and be ready by 2018.[11] The six-story building is being designed by SOP Architekten in Düsseldorf. The new campus will be built on the docks of Kesselstraße in the Düsseldorf Media Harbour, close to the famous Neuer Zollhof buildings designed by Frank Gehry. The campus will be accessible by public transportation as well as by bike.[11]
Lawsuits[edit]
In August 2016, Buckeye Tree Lodge and Sequoia Village Inn, LLC filed a class-action lawsuit in California, accusing the company and its partners of "brazen deceit" by coordinating with internet search engines and social media institutions to return false results on lodging entities in favor of those affiliated with their websites, in violation of the Lanham Act. The case is pending.[45][46]

The net proceeds to us from this offering will be approximately $183 million (or
approximately $212 million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional ADSs from us in full), after deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions and expenses of this offering.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the Selling
Shareholders. The Selling Shareholders will receive all of the proceeds from
their sales of their ADSs in this offering, after commissions payable to the
underwriters. Expenses of this offering will be paid by us.

The principal reasons for this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, increase our public profile and awareness, create a public market
for the ADSs and to facilitate our future access to public equity markets. We
have not quantified or allocated any specific portion of the net proceeds to us
or range of the net proceeds to us for any particular purpose. We anticipate
that we will use the net proceeds we receive from this offering, including any
net proceeds we receive from the exercise of the underwriters’ option to acquire
additional ADSs in this offering, for general corporate purposes, including to
fund investments in technology, for working capital to fund our growth
strategies described elsewhere in this prospectus and to pursue strategic
acquisitions, although we have no agreements, commitments or understandings with
respect to any such transaction. Immediately upon the closing of this offering,
a substantial portion of the proceeds to us from this offering will be
transferred to trivago GmbH in exchange for new units issued by trivago GmbH.

The amount of what, and timing of when, we actually spend for these purposes may
vary significantly and will depend on a number of factors, including our future
revenue and cash generated by operations and Accordingly, our management board 
and supervisory board will have broad discretion in deploying the net proceeds 
of this offering.

Pending their use, we plan to hold the net proceeds from this offering in cash
and cash equivalents.


We operate in a highly competitive market. Travelers have a range of options to
find and book hotel rooms and other accommodations, both offline and online.
Similarly, OTAs, hotel chains and independent hotels advertise their rooms
through both offline and online channels. While we face competition from offline
and online channels, we believe that we compete favorably due to our
differentiated user and advertiser propositions.

Competition for users

We compete to attract users to our websites and apps to help them research and
find hotels. Given our position at the top of the online hotel search funnel,
many companies we compete with are also our customers.

Our principal competitors for users include:

• Online metasearch and review websites, such as Kayak, Qunar and TripAdvisor;

• Search engines such as Baidu, Bing, Google and Yahoo!;

• Independent hotels and hotel chains such as Accor, Hilton and Marriott;

• OTAs, such as Booking.com, Ctrip and Expedia; and

• Alternative accommodation providers such as Airbnb and HomeAway.

Competition for advertisers

We compete with other advertising channels for hotel advertisers’ marketing
spend. These include traditional offline media and online marketing channels. In
terms of user traffic, we compete on the basis of the quality of referrals, CPC
rates and advertisers’ implied return on investment. While we compete with OTAs,
hotel chains and independent hotels for user traffic, these parties also
represent the key contributors to our supply. Because we primarily refer our
users to advertisers’ websites, we do not believe that we compete directly with
advertisers for bookings.

Our principal competitors for advertisers’ marketing spend include:

• Print media, such as local newspapers and magazines;

• Other traditional media, such as TV and radio;

• Search engines, such as Baidu, Bing, Google and Yahoo!;

• Online metasearch and review websites, such as Kayak, Qunar and TripAdvisor;

• Social networking services, such as Facebook and Twitter;

• Websites offering display advertising;

• Email marketing software and tools;

• Online video channels, such as YouTube; and

• Mobile app marketing.


Company Description
trivago is a global hotel search platform. Our mission is to “be the traveler’s
first and independent source of information for finding the ideal hotel at the
lowest rate.” We are focused on reshaping the way travelers search for and
compare hotels, while enabling hotel advertisers to grow their


 businesses by
providing access to a broad audience of travelers via our websites and apps. Our
platform allows travelers to make informed decisions by personalizing their
hotel search and providing access to a deep supply of hotel information and
prices. In the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, we had 487 million
qualified referrals and offered access to approximately 1.3 million hotels in
over 190 countries. 

Our brand positions us as a key starting point for travelers searching for their
ideal hotel. Our fast and intuitive hotel search platform enables travelers to
find their ideal hotel by matching individual traveler preferences with detailed
hotel characteristics such as price, location, availability, amenities and
ratings, across a vast supply of global hotels. In the twelve months ended
September 30, 2016, comparing across all of our localized websites and apps, we
provided a range of prices per hotel with the cheapest advertiser offering a
price on average 19% lower than the most expensive advertiser.

We believe that the number of travelers accessing our websites and apps makes us
an important and scalable marketing channel for our advertisers. Additionally,
our ability to refine user intent through our search function allows us to
provide advertisers with transaction-ready referrals. Hotel advertisers, which
include online travel agencies, or OTAs, hotel chains and independent hotels,
advertise their supply on our global marketplace on a “cost-per-click,” or CPC,
basis, whereby an advertiser is charged when a user clicks on an advertised rate
for a hotel and is referred to that advertiser’s website where the user can
complete the booking. In the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, an average
of ten advertisers per hotel across all our localized websites and apps placed
CPC bids. Our CPC bidding function enables advertisers to influence their own
return on investment and the volume of referral traffic we generate for them.

Rigorous analysis and application of data and technology are critical parts of
our DNA. We capture a large amount of data on how users search on and engage
with our site and our apps, enabling us to continually test new features and the
effectiveness of existing ones, refine our search algorithms and thereby improve
our product. We have built tools that capture data and calculate our return on
many elements of our brand and performance marketing. Our application of
data-led improvement and innovation also informs our marketing strategy, which
we believe enables us to become increasingly more effective with our marketing
spend.

Our hotel search platform can be accessed globally via 55 localized websites and
apps in 33 languages. Users can search our platform on desktop and mobile
devices, but benefit from a familiar user interface, resulting in a consistent 
user experience. In June 2016, our revenue from mobile websites and apps 
exceeded our revenue from our desktop websites for the first time, which is 
consistent with an expected longer term shift towards mobile.

Beginning in the second quarter of 2016, management identified three reportable
segments, which correspond to our three operating segments: the Americas,
Developed Europe and the Rest of World. Our Americas segment is currently
comprised of Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru,
the United States and Uruguay. Our Developed Europe segment is comprised of
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United
Kingdom. Our Rest of World segment is comprised of all other countries, the most
significant by revenue of which are Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand and
Poland.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
