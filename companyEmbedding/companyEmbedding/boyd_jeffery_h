Meet The Man Who Turned Priceline Into A $24 Billion Company

Priceline's road to becoming a $24 billion company has been a bumpy one.
Jeffrey Boyd joined Priceline in 2000, took over as president of the company in May 2001 and was named CEO in November 2002.
By the time he was in fully in charge — he shared CEO duties with Richard Braddock before November — shares were down around $10 and hit a low of less than $2 only a month into his tenure as CEO.
So how did Boyd bring the company back from those depths to the point where it's trading north of $500 a share today? And who is Boyd?
Jeff Boyd got his B.A. in government from St. Lawrence University, class of 1978, and a J.D. from Cornell Law in 1981. He's now on the Board of Trustees at St. Lawrence, and he established a scholarship there with his wife. If his campaign donation filings are any indication, he lives in Greenwich, CT.
Following school, he worked as an associate at the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell and as a partner at Robinson & Cole. He then served as assistant general counsel for the money management firm Lord, Abbett and Co.
Boyd joined HMO Oxford Health Plans Inc. as executive vice president, general counsel and secretary in 1995. He worked there until 1999, when he left for Priceline. On his way out in December 1999, he netted a $1.2 million lump sum on top of that year's $348,000 salary and $500,000 bonus. A month after resigning, he came on at Priceline as executive vice president and general counsel.
By the time Boyd joined Priceline, the company was three years old. Founded by entrepeneur Jay Walker in 1997, Priceline's business hinged on its Name Your Own Price system, which started with airline tickets and hotel rooms but was rapidly expanding into other products.
Among the new products were groceries and gasoline. Trying to sell these with Name Your Own Price turned out to be a disaster. As the dot-com bubble burst,  Priceline's stock plummeted, even with its trademark ad campaign featuring William Shatner.
In May 2001, Priceline fired CEO Daniel Schulman and replaced him with Richard Braddock, who had been Priceline's chairman after a stint as CEO from 1998 to 2000. At this point, Boyd was COO, and he took over as CEO in November 2002. 
Boyd came in at a turning point. According to a BusinessWeek profile, "Priceline's net loss more than doubled to $19 million, the company fired almost 20 percent of its staff, and its stock price fell 73 percent" in 2002. As CEO, Boyd knew he'd have to make a few major changes in Priceline's business model.
The first step was to shift away from airlines, which were tanking at the time. Instead of airlines, Boyd focused on hotels, where the margins were better and the industry was incredibly receptive to Priceline.
Second, Priceline expanded aggressively in Europe, then Asia, buying up travel sites and courting independent hotels. Now, international operations make up 82% of Priceline's operating income.
These changes, plus the revival of William Shatner's Priceline ads, have helped create the $24 billion company.

Priceline shock move – Jeff Boyd steps aside as CEO and president, Huston promoted

Comment
Print

							Nov 7.2013						
 



In a development straight out of the leftfield, Priceline CEO and president Jeff Boyd has handed over control of the company to Booking.com boss Darren Huston.
The announcement was made as Priceline announced its third quarter 2013 earnings today.
Boyd, considered by many to be one of the smartest and most respected bosses in the industry, will remain as chairman of the Priceline board of directors.
Huston will continue his role as Booking.com CEO as he also takes on the daunting task of filling the shoes of Boyd, a figure at the centre of one of the most successful businesses in the history of the web, let alone the travel sector.
Hardly a Priceline lifer such as many of the executives that have surrounded Boyd for years, Huston joined the group in September 2011 to replace Kees Koolen.
Huston had spent eight years with Microsoft, responsible for its consumer and advertising businesses in 40 countries. From 2005 to 2008 he was president and CEO of Microsoft Japan.
A former McKinsey consultant and advisor to the Canadian government, before joining Microsoft, Huston was senior vice president of Starbucks Corporation where he was in charge acquisitions and product development.
Despite the credentials, it will be Boyd’s stepping aside rather than Huston’s promotion which will shock the industry after a run of financial results and growth which have left almost the entire sector – bar Carnival – trailing in its wake.
The statement announcing the transition did not disclose any reason for the move.
Boyd says:
“Darren has done a great job leading Booking.com, the Group’s largest business, delivering impressive
growth and share gains.
“Darren is the right choice to lead the Group and I look forward to working with him closely as Chairman of the Board.”
Under Boyd’s 11-year leadership, Priceline Group has seen its financial performance go from strength to strength, not least in the last six years where its share price has increased six-fold.
A string of acquisitions and launches (Booking.com and Agoda, in particular) have seen it move into leading positions around the world in hospitality, whilst the Priceline brand has continued to give the likes of Expedia a run for its money back in the US.
More recently it sharpened its eye on the car rental market when it snapped up TravelJigsaw in 2010.
But, still, it will be Priceline’s acquisition of Booking.com in 2005, which accelerated growth in the group both financially and strategically, which will go down as one of the most profitable deals in the history of online travel.
James Guyette, lead independent director of the board of directors, adds:
“Jeff has done an outstanding job leading the Priceline Group over the past eleven years and we are pleased to announce Darren’s appointment as part of our long-term succession planning.”

No shock at all. No surprise. Many have us predicted Darren will be the next PCLN CEO.  Congrats, Jeff on an unprecedented run.

Robert Cole
Wow – another of 2013’s “didn’t see that one coming moments after the US Department of Justice decided to fight the American Airlines /US Airways merger and Sabre’s gutting of Travelocity in favor of an Expedia affiliation…
Why now?  Here’s my theory:
a) Priceline’s share price finally eclipsed it’s moon-shot value of (adjusted) $974/share from the dot-com bubble in April 1999.
b) Within a month or so of Boyd becoming CEO, in January 2003, Priceline was trading below (an adjusted) $1.50 per share.  It is now over $1,020.
c) Boyd executed perhaps the greatest internet acquisition of all time, acquiring Booking.com for $135 million in July 2005 – a move largely cedited with propelling Priceline’s market cap to its current level that is now approaching $53 Billion. 
One can’t blame Boyd for giving up the reins of day to day operations.  What the hell else does he have to prove?
After his run, he deserves an opportunity to spend some of the $190 million of shareholdings.  After all, he was largely responsible for creating all that wealth himself.
