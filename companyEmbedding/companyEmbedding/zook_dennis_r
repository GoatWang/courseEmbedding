Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    MarketWatch – 
                                                    5:06 PM ET 07/21/2017
                                                


'This is a smart trade, but it is also a dangerous trade unless you are smart'. That's former Lehman trader Jared Dillian explaining one way to find the most profitable trades in this relentless bull market. It's a spin on the contrarian theme espoused by Warren Buffett: "Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful."

American Express Co's (AXP) profit declined 33 percent in the second quarter, hurt partly by higher expenses, as the card company spent heavily on rewards to woo customers amid intense competition from big U.S. banks. Shares of the company, up 16 percent so far this year, dipped 1.2 percent to $84.87 in after-market trading.

American Express Co (AXP) on Wednesday reported a 36 percent decline in quarterly profit, hurt in part by higher spending on rewards to retain customers and attract new ones. Net income attributable to common shareholders fell to $1.31 billion, or $1.47 per share in the second quarter ended June 30, from $1.98 billion, or $2.10 per share, a year earlier.

'Investor sentiment, driven by Amazon fears, may continue to overshadow strong fundamentals,' says BMO analyst. Shares of Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) slid 2% Monday, after BMO downgraded the stock, and said fears about competitive pressure from Amazon.com Inc. would likely outweigh the company's strong fundamentals. Analyst Kelly Bania cut BMO's rating on the stock to market perform from outperform and lowered its price target to$ 160 from $185..

Shares of retailers were hammered Monday, as a wave of fears about the impact of juggernaut Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) on the sector were highlighted in stories and commentary from analysts.

Shares of Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) fell 0.6% in premarket trade Monday, after the membership-based warehouse retailer was downgraded at BMO Capital, which cited concerns that investor sentiment has soured as a result of perceived competition from Amazon.com Inc.

Analyst Kelly Bania cut the rating to market perform after being at outperform since January 2015, and slashed the stock price target to $160, which is 3.8% above Friday's closing price of $154.11, from $185.

The cost of an Amazon Prime membership is going down for low-income Americans. Beginning Monday night, Amazon Prime members will have access to one of the greatest perks of their membership-- but does it justify the cost of the program? Monday, Amazon (AMZN) will be hosting its annual "Prime Day," during which special deals and offers are available to Prime members on everything from household appliances to apparel.
