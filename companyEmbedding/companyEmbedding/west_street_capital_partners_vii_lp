The partnership will provide the company with strategic, operational and financial support for growth, including for potential acquisitions in adjacent markets and internationally. The investors will take an active shareholder role and work closely with the management team on future initiatives.
“As Eurazeo’s first acquisition in the U.S., it provides a strong foothold for our firm’s future,” added Morgon. “This investment is an example of the companies we aim to invest in and partner with – high quality enterprises with strong management teams and long-term transformational growth opportunities.”
