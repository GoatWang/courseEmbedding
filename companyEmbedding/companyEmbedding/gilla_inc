Invades Britain With Coil Glaze E-Liquid ProductsGilla Inc. Invades Britain With Coil Glaze E-Liquid Products       Posted on September 14, 2016September 6, 2016 by Marty 0SHARESFacebookTwitterWorld renowned e-liquid producer Gilla Inc. will soon introduce its super popular brand Coil Glaze in stores all over the U.K.The U.K. is just one of the stops in Gilla’s global expansion efforts. Originally from the U.S., Gilla’s popular brands have been rising in popularity among dedicated vapers. Gilla specialises in producing branded e-liquid flavours for vaporising devices and e-cigarettes.E-cigarettes are considered by medical experts to be a far healthier alternative to smoking tobacco cigarettes. Tobacco is a well-known cancer-causing agent, and is also an environmental pollutant. E-cigarettes do not use tobacco to produce a smoke-like vapour. Instead, these devices heat an e-liquid largely composed of water, glycol, and flavouring to create clouds of smoke. Nicotine, an addictive agent present in tobacco cigarettes, is sometimes added in varying liquid concentrations. E-cigarettes are not known to cause cancer like tobacco cigarettes.Vaping has rapidly risen in popularity around the world. Heavy smokers are increasingly becoming reliant on e-cigarettes to kick tobacco cigarettes. As a result, the number of vaping businesses in Britain and elsewhere have risen as well. E-liquids, also known as vape juice, are the biggest moneymaker for these businesses.E-liquids come in different kinds of flavours. Originally, e-liquids had no flavour, or were infused with artificial tobacco or mint flavourings. However, as consumers get used to vaping, they are more inclined to experiment with unique and innovative flavours. The Coil Glaze brand of e-liquids Gilla produces experiments with quirky flavours that vapers love.Gilla’s Coil Glaze e-liquid flavours have been particularly popular in North America. Earlier in May this year, Coil Glaze won the “Best in Show E-liquid Award” at Canada’s Vape Expo in Toronto. Coil Glaze has won similar honours from fans in the American States of Florida and Oklahoma. Coil Glaze has also been highly praised at vape shows in the U.K., according to Gilla. Considering the brand’s international popularity, Gilla has decided to promote Coil Glaze outside of North America in Europe and Asia as well.Coil Glaze currently has two favourite branded e-liquid flavours: Honey Bunz and Whipped Dreamz. Honey Bunz is the more popular of the two. The flavour is described as invoking a sweet cinnamon sugar pastry topped with honey glaze icing. Whipped Dreamz is said to have the flavouring of a fluffy cake filled with strawberries and whipped cream, and covered in delicious strawberry syrup. Yum, indeed. The flavours are sold in 60 ml bottles with nicotine strengths of 3 mg, 6 mg, or zero. Currently, both flavours are available for wholesale purchase.Gilla seems to have high hopes for these two flavours, which have gotten solid good ratings among vaping enthusiasts. Gilla will be providing Coil Glaze e-liquid products to a major vape chain based in the U.K. with over 50 stores. The company did not name the vape chain in the press release announcing the expansion.Gilla also plans to bottle and manufacture Coil Glaze in the U.K. The British manufacturer has also agreed to distribute the product to over 600 vape shops in the country. Gilla hopes the local manufacturing and distribution will reduce lead times for delivering Coil Glaze to British customers.British vapers first noticed Gilla at Vape Expo U.K. 2016 held in Birmingham. The company had quite a popular stall exhibiting the Coil Glaze products. According to Gilla’s CEO and Chairman, J. Graham Simmonds, the company has sold over 14,000 Coil Glaze products in the two months following the Expo. The brand has become that popular in the U.K. in a surprisingly short period of time.Considering the popularity Coil Glaze currently enjoys in the British market even before an official launch, Gilla might become a major player in the British vaping industry.No related posts.

Gilla Signs Cannabis Licensing Agreement in Nevada






 TORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Jun 20, 2017) -  Gilla Inc. ("Gilla" or the "Company") (OTCQB:GLLA), the fast-growing designer, marketer and manufacturer of E-liquid for vaporizers and developer of cannabis concentrate products, today announced that the Company's Toronto-based subsidiary, Gilla Enterprises Inc., has entered into its first production and distribution licensing agreement (the "Licensing Agreement") to introduce and launch the Company's new portfolio of cannabis concentrate products. The Licensing Agreement has been entered into with Alternative Medicine Association, LC ("AMA" or the "Licensee"), a Nevada-licensed medical marijuana establishment ("MME") which was recently acquired by Friday Night Inc. (CSE:TGIF), a Canadian-based public company.
Under the terms of the Licensing Agreement, the Company granted to the Licensee an exclusive five-year license to produce and distribute Gilla's unique array of cannabis concentrate products including its high terpene vape oils, naturally extracted vape oils and pure crystalline or high grade, naturally extracted cannabis crystals (together, the "Licensed Products") in the State of Nevada. The Licensee will manufacture the Licensed Products in its medical marijuana cultivation and production facility located in Las Vegas, Nevada for wholesale distribution utilizing Gilla's standard operating procedures, marketing support and brand name that will be announced and formally launched in the coming weeks. The Licensed Products are scheduled to be launched for sale on or around July 1, 2017 in conjunction with the adoption of recreational marijuana by the State of Nevada. As consideration for the license and rights granted under the Licensing Agreement, the Company will receive a fifteen percent royalty of gross revenues generated by the Licensed Products. 
"This is a significant milestone for Gilla and we are very excited for the opportunity to work with our new partner to launch our newly developed portfolio of cannabis products alongside the adoption of recreational marijuana in Nevada," stated Mr. Graham Simmonds, Chairman and CEO of Gilla. He added, "AMA was the first-licensed MME in southern Nevada and operates a premier facility in the Las Vegas area. Their expertise and cultivation capacity has positioned them to become an industry leader in the wholesale marijuana business. In furthering our multi-jurisdictional mandate, the Company is working on a number of additional licensing opportunities in both the United States and Canada to bring Gilla's branded cannabis products to additional jurisdictions this year."
Mr. Mark Zobrist, CEO of AMA stated, "This is an excellent opportunity for Friday Night to broaden its product offering in preparation for the upcoming implementation of recreational marijuana in the State of Nevada." He added, "Our team is very impressed with the quality of the Gilla product offering and we look forward to a mutually-successful business relationship."
About Alternative Medicine Association, LC and Friday Night Inc. 
Alternative Medicine Association, LC owns and operates a licensed medical marijuana cultivation and production facility in Las Vegas, Nevada. The company produces its own line of cannabis-based extracts including shatter, live resin, wax and oils including vape oils, flavored vape oils, terpene enhanced oils, and clear distillates and manufactures other third-party brands of similar products. Friday Night Inc., a Canadian public company (CSE:TGIF), recently acquired AMA and now owns or controls both hemp and cannabis based operations in the State of Nevada with plans to expand both within and outside of the state.
