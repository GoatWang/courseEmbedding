Young Living Essential Oils: July 2017 Promotions


 
The weather is warming up, and the days are getting longerits the perfect time to pack in as much fun as possible! But between picnics, trips, and play dates, sometimes you need a break from summer break. Get in a sunshine state of mind with the July PV promotion. Its filled with goodies all ready to help you embrace summers easy-living mentality.
From the 1st through the 31st, when you place a $100 PV Essential Rewards (ER) order, you will receive  a free 5ml bottle of Lavender Vitality. With a $190 PV order, in addition to Lavender Vitality (if it is an ER order), you will receive a 15ml bottle of Fennel oil. As a bonus exclusive with your Essential Rewards order, you will also receive a 15ml bottle of Thieves essential oil blend. That's a retail value of $82.57. With your $250 PV purchase, in addition to Lavender Vitality and Thieves, if an ER order, and Fennel oil, you will receive a 10ml bottle of RutaVaLa Roll-On. With your $300 PV purchase, along with everything else, you will receive a box of Essentialzymes-4, bringing your retail value to $195.07. What makes this promotion so special is that RutaVaLa (Roll-On or otherwise) has been out of stock (OOS) for what seems like ever, and remains OOS . . . the only way to obtain this highly prized essential oil blend is to qualify for the promotion. 

Fennel: A busy summer schedule requires a little downtime. Spend some time reading or crafting with the grounding aroma of Fennel. Your time unwinding will help you feel refreshed and ready for the next adventure.
RutaVaLa Roll-On:: Ready to relax at the pool? RutaVaLa combines Ruta, Valerian, and Lavender for a calming aroma, and its roll-on packaging makes it easy to toss in your bag and use wherever you are.
Essentialzymes-4: Summer is always packed with plenty of picnics and barbecues. Take Essentialzymes-4 to keep up! This multispectral enzyme complex aids the digestion of fats, proteins, fiber, and carbohydrates.

Bonus Essential Rewards Exclusive: Lavender Vitality: Nothing says summer relaxation like lounging in the sun with a chilled glass of lemonade. Upgrade this classic drink with a drop of Lavender Vitality for a refreshing, sophisticated flavor! Thieves: After a long summer trip, the chaos of coming home can leave the house, and you, a mess. Not only can Thieves support your immune system, but you can also diffuse the crisp, cozy aroma of this essential oil blend to instantly refresh your space and make it feel like home again.

BEGIN WITH INTENTION: Intent is a force that exists in the universe. When sorcerers (those who live of the Source) beckon intent, it comes to them and sets up the path for attainment, which means that sorcerers always accomplish what they set out to do.— Carlos Castaneda 
YOUNG LIVING MISSION STATEMENT: We honor our stewardship to champion nature's living energy—essential oils—by fostering a community of healing and discovery while inspiring individuals to wellness, purpose, and abundance.
2017 AFFIRMATION: I bridge the gap between positive thinking and positive action by utilizing the principles of FHPC (Fair, Honest, Positive, Creative). Before engaging in word and/or deed, I make time to ask myself, "is what I am about to say or do Fair, Honest, Positive, and Creative?" 
Every new year brings with it the opportunity for a fresh start. In 2017, we all come together to nurture ourselves and others. We expand into That which we truly are--beings of vast, limitless possibility!
 THOUGHT OF THE MONTH: “We are what we think. All that we are arises with our thoughts. With our thoughts we make the world. Speak or act with an impure mind and trouble will follow you as the wheel follows the ox that draws the cart.


  We are what we think. All that we are arises with our thoughts. With our thoughts we make the world. Speak or act with a pure mind and happiness will follow you as your shadow, unshakable."
  ~ The Buddha 

Remember to spread Peace and Love...
Be Consistent and Aim High!!!
Let people everywhere be happy. Let everyone be free of disease. Let everyone see good everywhere.May we all see God in each other... Peace!

A Critical Look at "Dr." Robert Young's 
  Theories and Credentials
Stephen Barrett, M.D.

  In July 2017, Robert O. Young, who has marketed himself as "Robert O. Young, M.S., D.Sc., Ph.D.,"was sentenced to prison for practicing medicine without a license. Young would  like you to believe that he is a highly educated and distinguished scientist. I do not believe that is an accurate description. This article describes his background and the  activities that led to his conviction.  
Disreputable Credentials
One way  to judge someone's credibility is to examine the nature of his education. Young's Web site includes the following information:

Before Dr. Young began his extensive nutritional research, his love for sports and science led him to the University of Utah—where he studied biology and business in the early 70's. . . . His education was temporarily interrupted by an ecclesiastical mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He successfully served for two years in London, England. 
In the 80's, following his mission and schooling at the University of Utah, Dr. Young studied medical microbiology—training under Dr. Robert Bradford at the Bradford Research Institute in Chula Vista, California. Dr. Bradford is now a trustee and professor at Capital University in Washington, DC, where he teaches live and dry blood microscopy. Dr. Young also studied darkfield microscopy. . . .
In 1993, Dr. Young received a MS in nutrition from the American College in Birmingham, Alabama. In 1995, he received his D.Sc. with emphasis in chemistry and biology. . . . In 1997, Dr. Young received a Ph.D. from Clayton College of Natural Health. His Professor, James E. Harvey from San Diego State University, reviewed and accepted his dissertation as completing all the requirements for a doctorate of philosophy degree in nutrition. Continuing his studies and research, Dr. Young later received an additional doctorate degree in naturopathy (ND) from Clayton College (1999). [1]

Young's books include: Back to the House of Health: Rejuvenating Recipes to Alkalize and Energize for Life (2000); Sick and Tired?: Reclaim Your Inner Terrain (2000); Back to the House of Health: Rejuvenating Recipes to Alkalize and Energize for Life! (2000); The pH Miracle for Diabetes: The Revolutionary Diet Plan for Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetics (2005); The pH Miracle for Weight Loss: Balance Your Body Chemistry, Achieve Your Ideal Weight (2006); and The pH Miracle: Balance Your Diet, Reclaim Your Health (2008). None of these books has any scientific standing. 
In 2010, Young's Web site claimed that he had "devoted his life to researching the true cause of disease" and for 25 years  had been "widely recognized as one of the top research scientists in the world" [1]. The pH Miracle, co-authored with his wife Shelley Radford Young, states that he headed the InnerLight Biological Research and Health Education Foundation and had "gained national recognition for his research into diabetes, cancer, leukemia, and AIDS." [2] 
A recent article stated that Young took only one undergraduate course in biology and did not graduate from the University of Utah [3]. The rest of his "training" is smoke and mirrors. Robert Bradford, who was convicted of laetrile smuggling in the 1970s, was not even a college graduate. His alleged  "doctoral degrees"—two of them—were acquired from credential mills. For nearly 30 years, he operated a network of enterprises that included a Mexican clinic that offered quack treatments, a company that marketed dubious drugs and dietary supplements, a "research institute" that did no significant research, and a nonaccredited "medical school" that operated for about five years [4]. In 2011, Bradford, his wife, and their company (American Biologics, doing business as C.R.B., Inc) were  convicted of conspiring to violate federal food and drug laws and defraud individuals seeking medical care. The indictment stated that he marketed bogus Lyme disease products and a microscope system that was falsely claimed to diagnose the disease [4]. 
Clayton College of Natural Health was a nonaccredited correspondence school that advocated unscientific and quack methods [4].  Its requirements for graduation were minuscule compared to those for accredited colleges and universities that train health professionals. It closed in 2010 after Alabama began requiring accreditation for license renewal. Moreover, no correspondence school can prepare students to give competent health advice to clients because that requires years of clinical experience under expert supervision. Young's connections with Clayton and Bradford reflect extremely poor judgment.  
Claims that Robert Young is a distinguished researcher are preposterous. The National Library of Medicine's database contains no articles authored by "Young RO" that were published in a recognized scientific journal. His foundation's 2011 tax return contain an expense item of $3,915 for "food for research subjects," but the returns from 2003 to 2010 contain nothing that appear related to human clinical research activity and the 2012 return has no financial data. 
Questionable Activities
In addition to writing, Young has operated retreats and marketed herbal and dietary supplements, many of which are his own brand ("Young pHorever"). The supplements are marketed by him directly and through a multilevel company called InnerLight, which he founded. In 2010, his Web site stated:

The Youngs supplements . . . literally bring new energy to each cell directly. It's a big idea that begins with the tiniest of particles—the particles called colloids.		Since colloids are so small, it is easy for our cells to absorb vitamins and minerals introduced at this size. Knowing this, the pH Miracle begins by breaking basic nutrient elements into billions of colloidal particles. Then, unlike any other supplement provider, we ensure these colloids remain individually separated through a proprietary process called Micro-Ionization™.
Perhaps the most striking difference about the Young's products are their living energy. Not only are colloids separated for prime absorption, they are given an additional electrical charge. This charge actually attracts the colloids to your cells where they can be instantly utilized. The energy within each cell literally "jumps." Functionality is rejuvenated. And your cells—and you yourself—can feel that maybe the energy you knew as a kid isn't so long gone after all [6]. 

This description uses scientific terms, but  the processes he describes are fanciful.
In 2010, Young's  "private retreats" were said to include "personal live and dried blood microscopy, preceded by an in-depth health history including developing an understanding of the physical, social, psychological, medical, and pharmaceutical components of a person's life." [7] Young promises to "personally oversee each activity for the day which may include: history, microscopy, supplements, water and ionization, exercise, lymphatic massage, cooking, food preparation, colonics and other health programs." His findings would then provided in a 35-page blood microscopy report plus a recommended program and a three-month supply of supplements and other products he created. There were also group retreats that cost from $400 to $15,000, depending on the length and setting. In 2013, the private retreats cost from $1,295 to $2,495 per night. 
In 2010, the pH Miracle site also asserted that, "Over the many years, Dr. Young has performed live and dry blood analysis on over 15,000 people repeatedly, while simultaneously adjusting nutrition to create a pH balanced Alkaline lifestyle. This practice clearly makes Dr. Young the preeminent nutritional microbiologist in history." [6]
Not  quite.  Live blood cell analysis is carried out by placing a drop of blood from the patient's 
        fingertip on a microscope slide under a glass cover slip to keep it from drying out. The slide is then viewed at high magnification with a 
        dark-field microscope that forwards the image to a television monitor. Both practitioner and patient can then see the blood cells, which 
  appear as dark bodies outlined in white. The practitioner may take Polaroid photographs of the television picture or may videotape the procedure for himself and/or the patient. The results are then used as a basis for prescribing supplements. Dried blood cell analysis is similar but is done after the blood dries. Although much can be learned by looking at blood cells under a microscope, the practitioners who do these tests draw conclusions that have no scientific validity are are used primarily to sell products [9].  
It would be interesting to know the context in which Young performed 15,000 blood analyses.  In most states, doing blood tests and recommending products based on these tests are considered diagnosing and prescribing and are restricted to licensed health professionals. As far as I can tell, Young has never been eligible for any type of health-related professional license.  
A Dubious Testimonial


In 2009, Young claimed on YouTube that he had cured Kim Tinkham, a woman with breast cancer who had appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show and said she intended to heal herself rather than undergoing medical care. He also posted six testimonial videos to his pH Miracle Living site. However, Tinkham died of her disease about a year later. [10,11]. The  videos have been removed, but the images shown here—displayed on the site in November 2013—still imply that Young helped her.







 



Government Actions
Young has been prosecuted three times. In the mid-1990s, he was charged with taking blood samples from two women and using the samples to diagnose illnesses and  prescribe products that he sold. Young claimed that he  merely looked at blood samples from two women and gave them nutritional advice. However, under a plea bargain, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of attempted practice of medicine without a license and was promised that the charge would be dismissed if he stayed out of trouble for 18 months [12]. 
In 2001, Young was charged with another felony in Utah when a woman suffering from cancer claimed he analyzed her blood and told her to stop chemotherapy and take his "Super Greens" product instead. Young told the woman that he had cured people suffering from AIDS, the affidavit alleged. A month later he was arrested when an undercover agent went to him for a consultation. Young allegedly analyzed her blood and prescribed a liquid diet. A judge ordered Young to stop drawing blood or risk being denied bail. The San Diego Tribune reported that the charges were dropped because the prosecutor didn't think there were enough angry victims to get a conviction. The article also reported that in 2003, Young moved to California because he thought the legal climate there was more tolerant for "dietary researchers" such as himself [13].  
In January 2014,  Young and two associates were arrested and charged with multiple counts of grand theft and conspiring to practice medicine without a license. The San Diego District Attorney's press release stated that Young accepted patients, including some who were terminally ill, and temporarily housed them in ar his  pH Miracle ranch [14]. The charges alleged that Young and his associates  broke the law when they went beyond advocating dietary changes and administered intravenous treatments to patients, some of whom were terminally ill.  In February 2016, following a 2-month trial, he was convicted of two counts of practicing medicine without a license. During the trial, Deputy District Attorney Gina Darvas portrayed Young as a charlatan who preyed on the sick and vulnerable—including dying cancer patients—and duped them with bogus science [3]. A few weeks after the trial ended, Darvas announced that Young would be re-tried on the charges for which the jury was unable to reach a verdict [15]. In 2017, faced with the possibility of retrial, Young pleaded guilty to two more counts of practicing medicine without a license. The plea agreement called for a 44-month sentence, some of which had already been served under house arrest [16]. In June 2017, the judge issued the sentence and expressed hope that Young would not repeat what he did in the future [17].
Young and a medical associate (Bennie Stephen Johnson, D.O. of Roswell, Georgia) are  also facing a suit by Dawn Kali, who claims that her breast cancer progressed from stage I (localized and easily treatable) to stage IV (widely spread) because she followed Young's advice. The complaint alleges:

Without any medical support,  Young advised    Kali to ignore her doctors, forego conventional medical treatment, and allow     Young to "treat" her with injections, diet, and other "remedies." 
 Young and pH Miracle Living falsely represented that he
      had credentials to practice medicine and treat cancer.
Johnson improperly allowed Young and pH Miracle Living to use his name and license as a cover for their unlicensed conduct [18].

In 2016, the Osteopathic Medical Board of California charged Johnson with gross negligence, repeated negligence, and general unprofessional conduct in connection with his treatment of four patients at the pH Miracle Center [19]. In 2017, his license was revoked and he was assessed $20,000 for the cost of the board's enforcement action [20].
Irrational  Theories
 Young and his wife claim that health depends primarily on proper balance between an alkaline and acid cellular environment that can be optimized by dietary modification and taking supplements. (The degree of acidity or alkalinity of body fluids is expressed as "pH.") But Benjamin Abelow, M.D., who authored the highly respected textbook, Understanding Acid-Base, has concluded that their understanding of biochemistry is deficient. After reading their 2000 book, Sick and Tired?: Reclaim Your Inner Terrain, he wrote:

I read with special care the part of the book that purports to explain the fundamentals of pH to the non-scientist. This section contains basic errors that suggest to me that Dr. Young is not very knowledgeable about this area; his understanding of basic chemistry seems limited. His definitions of fundamental terms such as "hydrogen ion" are poor, and his explanation of what table salt (NaCl) is and how it dissociates in water is incorrect. He gives the same pH values for blood that comes from arteries and veins; in reality, venous blood is more acidic than arterial blood.
The manner in which Dr. Young writes suggests a religious fervor that has nothing to do with science. I saw no footnotes that support his extreme views; in fact, judging by the titles of the journal articles he cites, I saw no citations in either this or another book by him that pertain specifically to the effect of pH on disease. Further, Dr. Young does not describe any of his own experiments that might lead one to think he has a valid scientific basis for his ideas. He makes many extreme statements without any supporting evidence.
From what I can see, Dr. Young does not have any interest in actually *testing* whether his ideas are correct. For example, the simple way to test his assertions about the effects of pH on disease would be to give sick people a couple of teaspoons of baking soda per day mixed with water. Baking soda (NaHCO3) is a base and will alkalinize the person's blood at least as well as any of the dietary manipulations Dr. Young suggests. But he appears not to have done this, or even to have studied the medical literature to see if others have [21].

The same observations apply equally to The pH Miracle, which contains so many dubious passages that it would take a book to respond to them all. Young bases his notions about  alkaline nutrition on the writings of Antoine Bechamp (1822-1895), and Gunter Enderlein (1872-1968), who held that microorganisms do not have fixed structures but arise from smaller entities that are always present but shift their form and function in response to environmental influences. The Youngs refer to the alleged entities as "microforms" or "microzymas." Page 21 of The pH Miracle states that "all cells evolve from them to begin with" and that "red blood cells . . . can de-evolve and then re-evolve into any cell the body needs." They also state that "morbid changes in microforms" are spurred by body acidity and that "harmful pleomorphic organisms do not, and cannot evolve in healthy (alkaline) surroundings." They further claim to have videotaped transformations from bacteria to yeast, fungus, and mold and back again. Page 32 of the book claims  that    "acidification and overgrowth of negative microforms in the body are the root cause of every symptom, illness and disease." However, the notion of pleomorphism is unfounded and was abandoned by the scientific community long ago. The book also advises readers to check their pH, "cleanse" for several days, eat a vegetarian diet that emphasizes vegetables, and take various supplements, including colloidal silver. The foods to avoid include all dairy products, meats, eggs, corn, peanuts, and foods that contain sugar (including most fruits). The food recommendations are based on their supposed effect on body acidity and alkalinity and whether or not they contain "toxins."
The idea that dietary modification can change the acidity of the body is silly. Homeostatic mechanisms keep the acidity of the blood stream within a narrow range.  Certain foods can leave end-products called ash. Alkaline-ash foods include fresh fruit and raw vegetables. Acid-ash foods include all animal products, whole grains, beans, and other seeds. These foods can change the acidity of the urine (but not the body as a whole), but that's irrelevant since your urine is contained in your bladder and does not affect the pH elsewhere in the body [22]. Thus, even if "body pH" were a primary cause of disease, the strategies the Youngs propose would not influence  it in the way they claim.

            I read some of this because I had read the shack but it's simply not an interesting read. I agree that the shack wasn't true to the word in some instances but the shack was still an extremely good book in comparison. With the shack I couldn't put it down and read it in two sittings, it was that good. I think if you know enough of the bible to have noticed the flaws with the first book to begin with, this book is redundant. Not even sure why I got this I could of just pulled out the bible. Don't use any book as a substitute for the bible, if your going to cross reference just use the bible. Everyone should be doing this anyways.

            Finally, a book that provides proof of the unbiblical statements and ideas of the popular book, "The Shack", by William P. Young. It is utterly frightening how many people, including pastors, have been deceived by "The Shack". The god of "The Shack" is NOT the God of the Bible. People who claim that "The Shack" brought them closer to God are being misdirected and decieved into believing in a false god. "Burning Down the Shack" compares the concepts and ideas of "The Shack" with the Bible. The author provides references to the Bible so you can you can verify every false idea and statement. "Burning Down the Shack" is not confrontational - it is simply an analysis that is backed by the Bible. It is a must read for everyone who has read "The Shack".While "The Shack" is a fictional work, it is clearly not being regarded as fiction. MANY people claim "The Shack" brought them closer to God, and this demonstrates "The Shack" is not simply being read as fiction. Quite honestly, even as a fictional book, "The Shack" is offensive to God, the Bible, and Christianity. I cannot stress enough that "Burning Down the Shack" is a must read book. The first few pages alone provides plenty of evidence of the many unbiblical statements, concepts and ideas that "The Shack" contains.The author, James B. De Young, is professor of New Testament Language and Literature at Western Seminary, Portland, OR, where he has taught for thirty-four years.

            Thank you CBD for offering 'Burning Down the Shack.'"Burning Down 'The Shack,'" is a new book by New Testament scholar and professor James De Young that examines the theology behind Paul Young's publishing phenomenon, "The Shack," a paperback novel that spent more than 100 weeks on the best-sellers lists in both the Christian and secular worlds. In his book, De Young notes that "many evangelicals and churches have been seduced by "The Shack," because the story resonates with many who have difficult backgrounds in which they've been deeply wounded emotionally and spiritually." "People who have been deeply hurt, he said, "are reaching out for a sympathetic God who they can clearly understand and who loves them." But, "...unless you confront people with the truth, people will not find ultimate resolution of their need," he said. "Only there will they find freedom from their past, deliverance from that which they feel in bondage." De Young points to Jesus' promise "you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free."It's important to understand that "The Shack," De Young said, is an age-old heresy  universal reconciliation  that diminishes the work of Jesus on the cross and the holiness and justice of God by asserting that everyone eventually will be saved from eternal damnation."If you have already read 'The Shack' (or plan to), it's critically important to read "Burning Down 'The Shack,'" as well.

			   I liked and trusted Dr. Young from my very first visit. He recommended the new Rezum procedure for my condition. It worked extremely well and I am very pleased with the results. Dr. Young and his staff are warm, caring and personal.
			
Michael F 
	          	Patient
          	


			   One of the best decisions I ever made was to make an appointment with Dr. Young. I had suffered for over two years with getting up multiple times at night and not being able to urinate. On evaluation Dr. Young recommended the "REZUM" treatment for my BPH. Now all is normal after a few visits for the treatment. Dr. Young and staff were all very professional,friendly and supportive. I highly recommend them. I only wish I had visited their office sooner.

Publisher's Description▼▲
Who would have thought that a small paperback novel, written by an unknown, could land on the bestsellers list for over 100 weeks, altering millions of readers' perceptions of god?Since its release in 2008, "The Shack," by Paul Young, has been praised as an amazing source of spiritual renewal. But is the bestseller all it seems? Are Young's views orthodox? More to the point are they truth?In "Burning Down 'The Shack, '" James B. De Young, Th.D., a graduate-level professor of Greek and biblical studies for 30 years, shows just how spiritually flimsy "The Shack" truly is, and how its enticing yet false doctrine is stealthily cracking the foundations of countless Christians' faith--and rotting away their very concept of the true God. With the skill of an investigator and the heart of a counselor, De Young addresses essential issues about biblical doctrine and scriptural truth. Bringing to light a series of troubling questions about The Shack and its author, De Young clearly shows how this runaway hit is little more than a runaway from truth.-"In "Burning Down 'The Shack, '" Dr. James B. De Young has done an incredibly important favor for evangelical Christians everywhere. His evaluation of the theology and deceit involved in The Shack is on target and critical for today's world." - Paige Patterson, President of the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary

            I read some of this because I had read the shack but it's simply not an interesting read. I agree that the shack wasn't true to the word in some instances but the shack was still an extremely good book in comparison. With the shack I couldn't put it down and read it in two sittings, it was that good. I think if you know enough of the bible to have noticed the flaws with the first book to begin with, this book is redundant. Not even sure why I got this I could of just pulled out the bible. Don't use any book as a substitute for the bible, if your going to cross reference just use the bible. Everyone should be doing this anyways.

            Finally, a book that provides proof of the unbiblical statements and ideas of the popular book, "The Shack", by William P. Young. It is utterly frightening how many people, including pastors, have been deceived by "The Shack". The god of "The Shack" is NOT the God of the Bible. People who claim that "The Shack" brought them closer to God are being misdirected and decieved into believing in a false god. "Burning Down the Shack" compares the concepts and ideas of "The Shack" with the Bible. The author provides references to the Bible so you can you can verify every false idea and statement. "Burning Down the Shack" is not confrontational - it is simply an analysis that is backed by the Bible. It is a must read for everyone who has read "The Shack".While "The Shack" is a fictional work, it is clearly not being regarded as fiction. MANY people claim "The Shack" brought them closer to God, and this demonstrates "The Shack" is not simply being read as fiction. Quite honestly, even as a fictional book, "The Shack" is offensive to God, the Bible, and Christianity. I cannot stress enough that "Burning Down the Shack" is a must read book. The first few pages alone provides plenty of evidence of the many unbiblical statements, concepts and ideas that "The Shack" contains.The author, James B. De Young, is professor of New Testament Language and Literature at Western Seminary, Portland, OR, where he has taught for thirty-four years.

            Thank you CBD for offering 'Burning Down the Shack.'"Burning Down 'The Shack,'" is a new book by New Testament scholar and professor James De Young that examines the theology behind Paul Young's publishing phenomenon, "The Shack," a paperback novel that spent more than 100 weeks on the best-sellers lists in both the Christian and secular worlds. In his book, De Young notes that "many evangelicals and churches have been seduced by "The Shack," because the story resonates with many who have difficult backgrounds in which they've been deeply wounded emotionally and spiritually." "People who have been deeply hurt, he said, "are reaching out for a sympathetic God who they can clearly understand and who loves them." But, "...unless you confront people with the truth, people will not find ultimate resolution of their need," he said. "Only there will they find freedom from their past, deliverance from that which they feel in bondage." De Young points to Jesus' promise "you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free."It's important to understand that "The Shack," De Young said, is an age-old heresy  universal reconciliation  that diminishes the work of Jesus on the cross and the holiness and justice of God by asserting that everyone eventually will be saved from eternal damnation."If you have already read 'The Shack' (or plan to), it's critically important to read "Burning Down 'The Shack,'" as well.
