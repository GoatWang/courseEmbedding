History[edit]
Stratasys was founded in 1989, by S. Scott Crump and his wife Lisa Crump in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. The idea for the technology came to Crump in 1988 when he decided to make a toy frog for his young daughter using a glue gun loaded with a mixture of polyethylene and candle wax. He thought of creating the shape layer by layer and of a way to automate the process. In April 1992, Stratasys sold its first product, the 3D Modeler.[3]
In October 1994, Stratasys had an initial public offering on NASDAQ; the company sold 1.38 million shares of common stock at $5 per share, netting approximately $5.7 million.[4]
In January 1995, Stratasys purchased IBM's rapid prototyping intellectual property and other assets and employed 16 former IBM engineers, who had been developing a small 3-D printer that relied on an extrusion system very similar to Crump's patented fused deposition modeling (FDM) technology.[5]
In 2003, Stratasys fused deposition modeling (FDM)[6] was the best-selling rapid prototyping technology.[7] FDM is a process that the company patented, which is used to produce three-dimensional parts directly from 3D CAD files layer-by-layer for use in design verification, prototyping, development and manufacturing.
In 2007, Stratasys supplied 44% of all additive fabrication systems installed worldwide, making it the unit market leader for the sixth consecutive year.[8]
In January 2010, Stratasys signed an agreement with HP to manufacture HP-branded 3D printers.[9] In August 2012, the HP manufacturing and distribution agreement was discontinued.
In May 2011, Stratasys announced that they had acquired Solidscape, a leader in high-precision 3D printers for lost wax casting applications.[10]
In 2012, an unrelated project to produce a working firearm by 3D printing was intended to use a Stratasys printer. Stratasys refused to permit this and withdrew its license for use of the printer, citing that it did not allow its printers "to be used for illegal purposes".[11][12]
In 2014 the Israeli fashion designer Noa Raviv featured grid pattern centered couture garments which were created employing Stratasys' 3d printing technology. Some selections from the aforementioned collection were exhibited in 2016 at the exhibition "Manus X Machina" at the Anna Wintour Costume Center at New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art.[13][14]
Merger with Objet[edit]
On April 16, 2012, Stratasys announced that it agreed to merge with privately held Objet Ltd., a leading manufacturer of 3D printers based in Rehovot, Israel, in an all-stock transaction. Stratasys shareholders were expected to own 55 percent of the combined company, and Objet shareholders would own 45 percent. The merger was completed on December 3, 2012; the market capitalization of the new company was approximately $3.0 billion.[15]
Acquisition of MakerBot, Solid Concepts and Harvest Technologies[edit]
On June 19, 2013, MakerBot Industries announced that it was purchased by Stratasys for $403 million.[16]
On April 2, 2014, Stratasys announced that they had entered into definitive agreements to acquire Solid Concepts and Harvest Technologies, which will be combined with RedEye, its existing digital manufacturing service business, to establish a single additive manufacturing services business unit.[17] The acquisition was finalized on July 15, 2014.[18]
3D Car Production Systems[edit]
In 2014, Stratasys prototyped an electric car with fully-3D-printed exterior panels, and a few printed interior parts. Development took one year, and parts were constructed using a Stratasys Objet1000. [19]
Urbee[edit]
Urbee[20] is the name of the first car in the world car mounted using additive manufacturing technology (his bodywork and his car windows were "printed"). Created in 2010 through the partnership with the Canadian engineering group KOR Ecologic[21] it is a hybrid vehicle with futuristic look.[22][23][24]

History[edit]
Stratasys was founded in 1989, by S. Scott Crump and his wife Lisa Crump in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. The idea for the technology came to Crump in 1988 when he decided to make a toy frog for his young daughter using a glue gun loaded with a mixture of polyethylene and candle wax. He thought of creating the shape layer by layer and of a way to automate the process. In April 1992, Stratasys sold its first product, the 3D Modeler.[3]
In October 1994, Stratasys had an initial public offering on NASDAQ; the company sold 1.38 million shares of common stock at $5 per share, netting approximately $5.7 million.[4]
In January 1995, Stratasys purchased IBM's rapid prototyping intellectual property and other assets and employed 16 former IBM engineers, who had been developing a small 3-D printer that relied on an extrusion system very similar to Crump's patented fused deposition modeling (FDM) technology.[5]
In 2003, Stratasys fused deposition modeling (FDM)[6] was the best-selling rapid prototyping technology.[7] FDM is a process that the company patented, which is used to produce three-dimensional parts directly from 3D CAD files layer-by-layer for use in design verification, prototyping, development and manufacturing.
In 2007, Stratasys supplied 44% of all additive fabrication systems installed worldwide, making it the unit market leader for the sixth consecutive year.[8]
In January 2010, Stratasys signed an agreement with HP to manufacture HP-branded 3D printers.[9] In August 2012, the HP manufacturing and distribution agreement was discontinued.
In May 2011, Stratasys announced that they had acquired Solidscape, a leader in high-precision 3D printers for lost wax casting applications.[10]
In 2012, an unrelated project to produce a working firearm by 3D printing was intended to use a Stratasys printer. Stratasys refused to permit this and withdrew its license for use of the printer, citing that it did not allow its printers "to be used for illegal purposes".[11][12]
In 2014 the Israeli fashion designer Noa Raviv featured grid pattern centered couture garments which were created employing Stratasys' 3d printing technology. Some selections from the aforementioned collection were exhibited in 2016 at the exhibition "Manus X Machina" at the Anna Wintour Costume Center at New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art.[13][14]
Merger with Objet[edit]
On April 16, 2012, Stratasys announced that it agreed to merge with privately held Objet Ltd., a leading manufacturer of 3D printers based in Rehovot, Israel, in an all-stock transaction. Stratasys shareholders were expected to own 55 percent of the combined company, and Objet shareholders would own 45 percent. The merger was completed on December 3, 2012; the market capitalization of the new company was approximately $3.0 billion.[15]
Acquisition of MakerBot, Solid Concepts and Harvest Technologies[edit]
On June 19, 2013, MakerBot Industries announced that it was purchased by Stratasys for $403 million.[16]
On April 2, 2014, Stratasys announced that they had entered into definitive agreements to acquire Solid Concepts and Harvest Technologies, which will be combined with RedEye, its existing digital manufacturing service business, to establish a single additive manufacturing services business unit.[17] The acquisition was finalized on July 15, 2014.[18]
3D Car Production Systems[edit]
In 2014, Stratasys prototyped an electric car with fully-3D-printed exterior panels, and a few printed interior parts. Development took one year, and parts were constructed using a Stratasys Objet1000. [19]
Urbee[edit]
Urbee[20] is the name of the first car in the world car mounted using additive manufacturing technology (his bodywork and his car windows were "printed"). Created in 2010 through the partnership with the Canadian engineering group KOR Ecologic[21] it is a hybrid vehicle with futuristic look.[22][23][24]

History[edit]
Stratasys was founded in 1989, by S. Scott Crump and his wife Lisa Crump in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. The idea for the technology came to Crump in 1988 when he decided to make a toy frog for his young daughter using a glue gun loaded with a mixture of polyethylene and candle wax. He thought of creating the shape layer by layer and of a way to automate the process. In April 1992, Stratasys sold its first product, the 3D Modeler.[3]
In October 1994, Stratasys had an initial public offering on NASDAQ; the company sold 1.38 million shares of common stock at $5 per share, netting approximately $5.7 million.[4]
In January 1995, Stratasys purchased IBM's rapid prototyping intellectual property and other assets and employed 16 former IBM engineers, who had been developing a small 3-D printer that relied on an extrusion system very similar to Crump's patented fused deposition modeling (FDM) technology.[5]
In 2003, Stratasys fused deposition modeling (FDM)[6] was the best-selling rapid prototyping technology.[7] FDM is a process that the company patented, which is used to produce three-dimensional parts directly from 3D CAD files layer-by-layer for use in design verification, prototyping, development and manufacturing.
In 2007, Stratasys supplied 44% of all additive fabrication systems installed worldwide, making it the unit market leader for the sixth consecutive year.[8]
In January 2010, Stratasys signed an agreement with HP to manufacture HP-branded 3D printers.[9] In August 2012, the HP manufacturing and distribution agreement was discontinued.
In May 2011, Stratasys announced that they had acquired Solidscape, a leader in high-precision 3D printers for lost wax casting applications.[10]
In 2012, an unrelated project to produce a working firearm by 3D printing was intended to use a Stratasys printer. Stratasys refused to permit this and withdrew its license for use of the printer, citing that it did not allow its printers "to be used for illegal purposes".[11][12]
In 2014 the Israeli fashion designer Noa Raviv featured grid pattern centered couture garments which were created employing Stratasys' 3d printing technology. Some selections from the aforementioned collection were exhibited in 2016 at the exhibition "Manus X Machina" at the Anna Wintour Costume Center at New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art.[13][14]
Merger with Objet[edit]
On April 16, 2012, Stratasys announced that it agreed to merge with privately held Objet Ltd., a leading manufacturer of 3D printers based in Rehovot, Israel, in an all-stock transaction. Stratasys shareholders were expected to own 55 percent of the combined company, and Objet shareholders would own 45 percent. The merger was completed on December 3, 2012; the market capitalization of the new company was approximately $3.0 billion.[15]
Acquisition of MakerBot, Solid Concepts and Harvest Technologies[edit]
On June 19, 2013, MakerBot Industries announced that it was purchased by Stratasys for $403 million.[16]
On April 2, 2014, Stratasys announced that they had entered into definitive agreements to acquire Solid Concepts and Harvest Technologies, which will be combined with RedEye, its existing digital manufacturing service business, to establish a single additive manufacturing services business unit.[17] The acquisition was finalized on July 15, 2014.[18]
3D Car Production Systems[edit]
In 2014, Stratasys prototyped an electric car with fully-3D-printed exterior panels, and a few printed interior parts. Development took one year, and parts were constructed using a Stratasys Objet1000. [19]
Urbee[edit]
Urbee[20] is the name of the first car in the world car mounted using additive manufacturing technology (his bodywork and his car windows were "printed"). Created in 2010 through the partnership with the Canadian engineering group KOR Ecologic[21] it is a hybrid vehicle with futuristic look.[22][23][24]

History[edit]
Stratasys was founded in 1989, by S. Scott Crump and his wife Lisa Crump in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. The idea for the technology came to Crump in 1988 when he decided to make a toy frog for his young daughter using a glue gun loaded with a mixture of polyethylene and candle wax. He thought of creating the shape layer by layer and of a way to automate the process. In April 1992, Stratasys sold its first product, the 3D Modeler.[3]
In October 1994, Stratasys had an initial public offering on NASDAQ; the company sold 1.38 million shares of common stock at $5 per share, netting approximately $5.7 million.[4]
In January 1995, Stratasys purchased IBM's rapid prototyping intellectual property and other assets and employed 16 former IBM engineers, who had been developing a small 3-D printer that relied on an extrusion system very similar to Crump's patented fused deposition modeling (FDM) technology.[5]
In 2003, Stratasys fused deposition modeling (FDM)[6] was the best-selling rapid prototyping technology.[7] FDM is a process that the company patented, which is used to produce three-dimensional parts directly from 3D CAD files layer-by-layer for use in design verification, prototyping, development and manufacturing.
In 2007, Stratasys supplied 44% of all additive fabrication systems installed worldwide, making it the unit market leader for the sixth consecutive year.[8]
In January 2010, Stratasys signed an agreement with HP to manufacture HP-branded 3D printers.[9] In August 2012, the HP manufacturing and distribution agreement was discontinued.
In May 2011, Stratasys announced that they had acquired Solidscape, a leader in high-precision 3D printers for lost wax casting applications.[10]
In 2012, an unrelated project to produce a working firearm by 3D printing was intended to use a Stratasys printer. Stratasys refused to permit this and withdrew its license for use of the printer, citing that it did not allow its printers "to be used for illegal purposes".[11][12]
In 2014 the Israeli fashion designer Noa Raviv featured grid pattern centered couture garments which were created employing Stratasys' 3d printing technology. Some selections from the aforementioned collection were exhibited in 2016 at the exhibition "Manus X Machina" at the Anna Wintour Costume Center at New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art.[13][14]
Merger with Objet[edit]
On April 16, 2012, Stratasys announced that it agreed to merge with privately held Objet Ltd., a leading manufacturer of 3D printers based in Rehovot, Israel, in an all-stock transaction. Stratasys shareholders were expected to own 55 percent of the combined company, and Objet shareholders would own 45 percent. The merger was completed on December 3, 2012; the market capitalization of the new company was approximately $3.0 billion.[15]
Acquisition of MakerBot, Solid Concepts and Harvest Technologies[edit]
On June 19, 2013, MakerBot Industries announced that it was purchased by Stratasys for $403 million.[16]
On April 2, 2014, Stratasys announced that they had entered into definitive agreements to acquire Solid Concepts and Harvest Technologies, which will be combined with RedEye, its existing digital manufacturing service business, to establish a single additive manufacturing services business unit.[17] The acquisition was finalized on July 15, 2014.[18]
3D Car Production Systems[edit]
In 2014, Stratasys prototyped an electric car with fully-3D-printed exterior panels, and a few printed interior parts. Development took one year, and parts were constructed using a Stratasys Objet1000. [19]
Urbee[edit]
Urbee[20] is the name of the first car in the world car mounted using additive manufacturing technology (his bodywork and his car windows were "printed"). Created in 2010 through the partnership with the Canadian engineering group KOR Ecologic[21] it is a hybrid vehicle with futuristic look.[22][23][24]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Stratasys Ltd.: The Bear Case From a Bull
3D printing is going to be big business, but that doesn't guarantee investing success. 











                Travis Hoium
            

                (TMFFlushDraw)



            
            Apr 25, 2017 at 11:37AM
            
            





There's no question 3D printing is a big business -- and getting bigger. Stratasys Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS) and 3D Systems Corporation  have staked out the largest positions in the industry, giving them a head start over competitors, but it's not smooth sailing ahead. 
Stratasys hasn't yet managed to become profitable and revenue has been stagnant for three years now. While I'm bullish on the industry and the company long-term, here's where that bullish investment thesis could go wrong.

3D printing doesn't grow like we expect
If you look at the chart below, you can see that Stratasys isn't set up to make money at its current revenue level. Margins are improving, but the company needs either more sales, higher margins, or lower operating costs to regain profitability. 

SSYS Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.
Margins will be tough to increase given competition, unless high-margin resin sales increase disproportionately compared to equipment sales. But Stratasys wants more equipment sales to increase the installed base of customers that could buy resin. The company also doesn't want to cut back on sales or R&D staff because those are the investments that will grow sales and improve products long term. 
If 3D printing volume -- both equipment and resin sales -- doesn't grow over the next few years, we could see financial losses persist. The bearish case is that sales have stagnated and Stratasys and others will be unprofitable for years to come, which is certainly possible. 
Competition takes more business than expected
The 3D printing business is constantly changing, and manufacturers need to stay on top of their game to stay competitive. In the last decade, that's mainly meant improving material quality and making printing easier for a wider set of consumers, and more recently it's meant adding 3D printed metals to the equation. 
As technology changes, start-ups have come in and excited the market, gaining customers rather quickly. And there's no real brand loyalty in 3D printing, so if someone has a better product, customers are going to flock to it. The most notable purchase in Stratasys' history was the $403 million acquisition of MakerBot in 2013, which didn't exactly turn the former into a profitable giant in 3D printing.
In metals printing there are other small start-ups that are trying to gain traction with customers, creating similar competition to the plastics 3D printing market a few years ago, where a half dozen companies are competing for the same pool of customers. 
Whether it's in plastic or metals printing, competition puts pressure on prices and operating costs like sales and research and development, making it tougher to turn the corner into profitability. And there's not yet an indication that Stratasys has such a strong position in the industry that it can't be upended by a thoughtful start-up or well-funded competitor. 





Will 3D printing really start taking off? 
For Stratasys, the bull case and the bear case come down to the same metric. If the company can grow revenue at a double-digit pace over the next five years, the bulls will likely be proven right. If growth stalls, or even goes negative, bears will win out. 
I think the future of the 3D printing industry is bright and with companies like Ford and Airbus now integrating the rapid production of plastic and metal products into their businesses, the momentum should pick up. But if adoption isn't as fast or as widespread as investors think, or if competition starts taking market share from Stratasys, the bears could win out. And it's worth understanding how they might be proven right long-term.
