 Our mission is to provide you with the best promotional advertising products possible, correctly decorated and delivered on time.  

We help you search for the perfect product(s) that fit your promotion and budget. We are dedicated to providing you with quality promotional advertising products to help ensure the success of your business. Promotional Advertising offers you more exposures per advertising dollar spent versus other forms of advertising media and your advertisement, message, logo and contact information will be viewed many, many times while you pay for the item only one time.

Our family business was started as CPW & Associates in 1982 by Charles, Elaine, Marjorie & William Peck. The company was renamed in 2000 and now honors the memory of Charles & Elaine Peck.

Marjorie (Margie) & William (Bill) continue to operate the business today.  Please give Bill a call today or send an email with your questions and requests.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

About William Peck


William Peck, immigrant ancestor, was born in the city of London, England, or its vicinity in 1601.  He married Elizabeth there in 1622 & sailed for Boston, Massachusetts in the ship "Hector" with his wife & son Jeremiah, and arrived there June 26, 1637.  His son Jeremiah was the only English-born child
It is probable he came in the company of Governor Eaton, Rev. John Davenport, and others principally from London.  He was one of the original proprietors of the New Haven colony in 1638, and his autograph signature is affixed to the fundamental agreement or constitution June 4, 1639, of the government of the infant colony.  October 20, 1640, he was admitted a freeman.  He was trustee, treasurer and general business agent of the Colony Collegiate School, established on the basis of the Hopkins fund.  He was by occupation a merchant and from 1659 until his death, a deacon of the church in New Haven.  His name usually appears on the records with the title of "Mr." then a prefix of respect and distinction.   His home lot of about an acre, his house and store were on Church street, the front of which is now covered by the Connecticut Savings Bank building. His grave is now covered by the Center Church in New Haven. 
He died October 4, 1694, aged ninety-three years. His will, dated March 9, 1688-89, probated October 13, 1694, is recorded in the probate records of New Haven (Book II, p. 176). 
His first wife, Elizabeth, died December 5, 1683, and he married again, Sarah Holt, widow of William Holt.  He died October 4, 1694, and was interred in the old burying-ground, now under the Center church.  
[This information is from Vol. II, pp. 729-734 of Hudson-Mohawk Genealogical and Family Memoirs, edited by Cuyler Reynolds (New York: Lewis Historical Publishing Company, 1911). It is in SCPL's Reference collection at R 929.1 R45. Some of the formatting of the original, especially in lists of descendants, may have been altered slightly for ease of reading.]
The American ancestor of the Peck family of Troy herein considered was William Peck, who was among the first of the early settlers of New England. Others of the name arrived at about the same time, but apparently were not related. They were the progenitors of a numerous posterity, and the name is a distinguished one in the United States.
Jeremiah, John, removed to Wallingford, Connecticut; called "lieutenant" in the records. 
Joseph, settled in East Saybrook (later Lynn), Connecticut, where he was surveyor, recorder, justice of the peace and deacon of the church. 
Elizabeth, married Samuel Andrews. 
He was a Deacon, as well as one of the founders of New Haven, Connecticut.

Arrived with wife, Elizabeth in Boston on June 26, 1637.  They moved to Connecticut shorlty thereafter.  He signed the in 1639 a document which was the agreement for the establishment of New Haven, Conn.

Immigration: 26 Jun 1637, Arrived in Boston Harbor in company of Gov. Eaton, Rev. John Daven port et al. Ship Hector.1137
Occupation: 1630, Merchant in London, England.1138
Region: 1659, Chosen as Deacon, New Haven
Notes for William Peck:
William Peck, a merchant from London, sailed on the ship HECTOR, in the company of Governors Eaton and Hopkins, Rev. John Davenport, William’s brother Henry Peck and the son of the Earl of Marlborough. They arrived at Boston Harbor June 26, 1637.
This company was principally from the city of London, and consisted of wealthy merchants, and others of great respectability from London, and of farmers from Yorkshire, Hertfordshire and Kent, and some from Surrey and Sussex. They had suffered much from the intolerance and persecution of Archbishop Land during the reign of Charles I, and the object of their emigration was the unmolested enjoyment of civil and religious liberty. 
William Peck was a co-founder of New Haven, Connecticut in the spring of 1638 and among the signers of the compact for New Haven in June 1639. He was also a signer of the Fundamental Agreement Of Quinnipiack. An original proprietor of the colony, he was accepted as freeman in 1640. Peck was one of the trustees of the first New Haven grammar school for many years. A merchant by occupation, William Peck was a man of high standing in the Colony, and a Deacon of the church in New Haven from 1659 until his death Oct. 4 1694, at the age of 93. 
One of six adult male Pecks' coming from England to America in the late 1630's, William Peck was an adherent of Rev. John Davenport (1597-1670), a celebrated Church of England cleric. Davenport turned more and more to nonconformity, and as pastor of an influential City of London church, he fostered the puritan cause and had to flee to Holland in 1633, before eventually leading his company to the New World.
The only daughter, his youngest, married Samuel Andrews in 1661. In Deacon Peck's will, made out in 1689 at New Haven, he mentions his second wife, Sarah, who had been the widow of William Holt before marrying Peck, and his four children, but no more. His Will was recorded in New Haven, on Oct. 11, 1694: Probate Rec. Book II, p. 176. Deacon William Peck was buried in the Grove Street Cemetery in New Haven after Oct. 14, 1694. In 1821, his gravestone was removed with the others from the Old Churchyard in New Haven, but his tombstone was said to be still standing in the Cemetery of New Haven in New Haven in 1890
Came to America on the HMS Hector with Governor Theophilas Eaton(1590-1658) and Reverend John Davenport(1597-1670).   https://ia801409.us.archive.org/21/items/agenealogicalac00peckgoog/agenealogicalac00peckgoog.pdf
peck family hx
WILLIAM PECK was a merchart in London and it is believed that he came to America with his wife, ELIZABETH, and young son, JEREMIAH, on the good ship HECTOR, arriving in Boston on June 26, 1637. He was probably part of the Eaton-Davenport Company who migrated to New Haven in 1638/39. He signed the Fundamental Agreement of Quinnipiack in 1639 and became a freeman on October 29, 1640 in New Haven. From 1659 to his death, he was a deacon of the First Church of New Haven. His homelot was on George Street. Although his estate showed that he was not wealthy, he was highly respected.
He was one of three who inventoried the estate of Sgt. Thomas Jeffrie in 1661. In December of 1662, at a town meeting in New Haven, Deacon Peck informed those present that the town "elders" were not getting enough to eat -- that there was not enough wheat & malt to go around. 
Deacon William Peck & another ancestor, ROGER ALLING, were appointed a Committee of Trustees for a trust that totalled £918 being authorized to direct the affairs of the Collegiate Grammer School in New Haven.
After Elizabeth's death in 1683, he married Sarah, widow of William Holt around 1684. While visiting his son, JOSEPH, in Lyme, he died in 1694. Lyme Vital Records gave his age at death as 93, while New Haven record says 90 years. However, his tombstone gives his age at death as 93 years.
Deacon William was probably brothers with Henry Peck who also settled in New Haven, and my ancestor, JOSEPH PECK, who was in New Haven for a time but removed to Milford.
