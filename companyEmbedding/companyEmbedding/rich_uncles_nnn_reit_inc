Rich Uncles Review – Combining Crowdfunding and Commercial REITs










Review of: Rich Uncles
Reviewed by: Ruth Lyons
Published on: July 26, 2017
Last Modified: July 26, 2017







Editor Rating
Rated 3.5 stars












Rich Uncles is a public non-traded Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). You don't need to be accredited to invest, the tenants are screened, and you can get in with a low minimum investment. However, this is a long-term investment, which might not please traders who want quick returns or exit.
 


Using a crowdfunding platform to raise capital is a popular new concept in real estate investing, including Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs).
Crowdfunding makes property funding easier and faster than going through the traditional routes of finding bank financing or investors with large amounts of capital who are interested in specific opportunities. It also opens up real estate investing to people who have only small amounts of money to invest.
Rich Uncles’ business model allows everyone the opportunity to own commercial real estate through an investment in their NNN REIT.
What Is Rich Uncles?
Rich Uncles provides an online platform for investors to buy shares of their single-tenant commercial property REIT, called the Rich Uncles NNN REIT. The REIT is invested in property leased by retail businesses, such as gas stations, drugstores and grocery stores, that pay monthly rent. The collected rent is distributed to shareholders monthly as dividend income.
Rich Uncles’ platform provides photos and details about the properties in the REIT. While you don’t pick specific properties to invest in — there’s one REIT that holds these properties and you invest in the REIT itself — you can get a good feel for the portfolio holdings by reviewing the details of the individual properties online.
Rich Uncles’ Portfolio
Rich Uncles acquires and holds commercial properties that meet specific criteria to reduce risk and provide reliable rental income. Specifically, they seek single-tenant properties:


located in primary, secondary and certain tertiary markets;

where construction is substantially complete to reduce risk associated with new construction;

leased on a “triple net” basis where the tenant is responsible for the payment of taxes, insurance and maintenance;

leased to tenants with strong financial statements including investment-grade credit quality; and

subject to long-term leases with defined rental rate increases.

According to co-founder Howard Makler, Rich Uncles gives small investors the opportunity to “invest alongside the chairman of the world’s largest commercial real estate company and a handpicked team of experts that know the world of real estate inside and out.”
Rich Uncles’ founding investor is Raymond Wirta, former chairman of CBRE (NYSE:CBG), a global real estate services firm. Rounding out the management team is CEO Harold Hofer, a lawyer who has participated in real estate transactions, as a principal and as a broker, valued in excess of $2 billion in his 30-year real estate.
To understand Rich Uncles’ product offering, it’s important to understand the difference between a traded REIT and a public non-traded REIT, Rich Uncles being a public non-traded REIT.

A Real Estate Investment Trust, or REIT, is a corporation that takes capital from many different investors and uses it to buy income-producing real estate. In general, a REIT is an entity that:


combines the capital of many investors to acquire or provide financing for real estate investments;

allows individual investors to invest in a professionally managed, large-scale diversified portfolio of real estate;

pays distributions to investors of at least 90% of its annual REIT taxable income; and

avoids the “double taxation” treatment of investment income, because a REIT is not generally subject to federal corporate income taxes on the portion of income distributed to its stockholders.

Shares in public REITs are available to any investor through the stock market, can be purchased from any registered investment broker and are considered to be liquid — the shares trade on the stock market exchanges, and therefore can be bought and sold quickly. There are hundreds of public REITs on Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab and other brokerage houses from which you can choose.
Rich Uncles’ offering, NNN REIT, Inc., is classified as a public non-traded REIT. The distinction is they are “public” to the extent they are registered with the SEC, so the public can view their offering, but they do not trade on the open market as do the public REIT shares you purchase from an investment broker.
Typically, the sponsor of a public non-traded REIT has an in-house dealer-manager that is responsible for marketing shares to FINRA-licensed broker-dealers and SEC-regulated investment advisors, which results in substantial fees. These fees typically include:


5% to 7% sales commissions paid to the broker-dealer for soliciting the investment,

2% to 3% commission paid to the dealer managing the sales effort, and

1% to 2% paid to the broker-dealer for costs associated with a due diligence review of the offering.

All these commissions and reimbursements mean approximately 8%–12% of the cost of the typical non-traded REIT is spent on broker-dealer and dealer-manager costs, leaving only 88%–92% of investment dollars being placed into actual real estate.
Rich Uncles, LLC, was founded for “a single purpose — to make real estate investment easier and less expensive for the small investor.”
Instead of using the typical broker-dealer distribution channel and paying advisory intermediaries, Rich Uncles uses crowdfunding and the internet to market their REIT directly to investors.
Rich Uncles believes that with the ease and transparency of the internet, the company can deliver a real estate product that has roughly 10% more of the investment amount actually being invested in real estate rather than being paid to others in the form of commissions and reimbursements.

Return — Historically, Rich Uncles has distributed a 7.0% annualized dividend on a monthly basis. This is an increase from the 6.5% annualized dividend they offered when their NNN REIT first launched in July 2016. The hypothetical earnings found on their website assume you reinvest your dividends over five years.
Rich Uncles — Possible Earnings
Liquidity — Rich Uncles’ REIT provides a share redemption program that can be accessed through your shareholder dashboard. You have the option of selling back your shares to Rich Uncles. This aspect of their offering was developed in order to meet the market’s demand for a real estate investment product that did not follow the ebb and flow of the traditional stock market, but still provided a level of liquidity traditional commercial real estate can’t match. In this sense, Rich Uncles’ model adds liquidity to a previously illiquid product.
Long-term investment — When you invest, you are committing to being part owner of many commercial real estate properties. Real estate is a long-term investment. When the fund reaches its cap of investor capital — typically 4–7 years — a fund liquidation event takes place and investment proceeds are distributed. You get your value back — what your shares are worth at the time, plus profits from the proceeds of the sale of all the buildings owned by the fund.
Rich Uncles is considered an “open-ended” fund, meaning there is no set liquidation date. It is up to the principals of Rich Uncles to determine the appropriate time and circumstances for portfolio liquidation.
Rich Uncles has their shares revalued by an independent third party appraisal firm on an annual basis, which allows their investors the chance to benefit from increases in property value over time.
50% cash equity ownership in all owned properties — Rich Uncles limits their mortgage debt by buying properties with 50% cash down payments, which means they carry 50% cash equity ownership in their entire real estate portfolio.
Dividend reinvestment option — You can choose to have your monthly dividends automatically reinvested and compound your ownership.
No broker commissions; No investor fees — Because Rich Uncles doesn’t use brokers, they do not pay commissions, instead choosing to use crowdfunding to find investors, which reduces their overhead and increases the percentage of returns they can distribute to their members.
“Triple-net leases” — Rich Uncles buys commercial properties where tenants are responsible for paying all property-related expenses, including taxes, insurance and maintenance.
Availability — Rich Uncles NNN REIT is currently available to residents of: CA, CO, CT, FL, GA, HI, ID, IL, IN, KY, LA, MT, NH, NV, NY, SD, TX, UT, VT, WI, WY.

 Pros

No REIT expenses — Typically, public-traded REITs pay subordinated performance fees equal to 15% of the amounts by which asset sale proceeds exceed the amounts paid to purchase shares, and a return of their invested capital plus a 6% cumulative, non-compounded annual return on invested capital. Rich Uncles charges none of these customary fees. They completely skip the middleman — and his commissions — by marketing directly to investors through their crowdfunding platform.
You make money or Rich Uncles doesn’t get paid — Unlike your typical portfolio manager or broker who collects his monthly management fee or commissions whether he makes money for you or not, Rich Uncles’ business model is performance based. The first 6.5% of profits is paid out to shareholders — Rich Uncles makes money only if the investments deliver — and their share is 40% of profits once the investment exceeds the 6.5% hurdle.
Truly passive real estate alternative — Rich Uncles REIT is a truly passive real estate investment. You invest in the REIT and Rich Uncles does all the legwork and paperwork associated with owning, leasing and managing commercial properties, paying you cash dividends on a monthly basis.
No need to be accredited — You don’t need to be an accredited investor. Rich Uncles asks only that you have a combined family income of $75K or a net worth of at least $250K. Suitability standards differ slightly from state to state, but richuncles.com walks investors through the requirements of their state of residence.
High-quality tenants — Rich Uncles invests only in single-tenant commercial properties with existing long-term leases. They don’t buy vacant buildings and find tenants. They don’t invest in distressed properties and rehab them. They acquire only three types of properties — office, retail and industrial — which are already leased to high quality tenants.
50% equity reduces real estate mortgage risk — Rich Uncles only acquires properties with 50% equity. That would be like you putting a 50% down payment when you buy your home.
Geographical diversification reduces real estate exposure risk — Rich Uncles’ strategy is to acquire properties across the country, thereby reducing the risks of any one market by diversifying their holdings geographically.
Low minimum investment — The minimum investment of $500 opens it up to many more people than most commercial real estate crowdfunding platforms.
Monthly dividends — Like a dividend-paying stock, Rich Uncles REIT provides steady monthly dividend income (under normal circumstances). You can choose to receive your dividends in cash or reinvest them.


 Cons

Investment Liquidity — Once you make an investment, you are pretty much committed to the investment for the term. There is currently no secondary market to sell your investment to others.
Long-Term investment — While some investors have turned to non-traded REITs to sidestep stock market risk, it’s important to understand you give up some liquidity at the same time. Real estate is longer-term investment. You don’t really know what your shares are worth until the very end when the property sells, or Rich Uncles conducts its annual asset appraisal and adjusts share value accordingly.
Monthly dividends are not guaranteed — This can be said of any dividend, really. There are no guarantees when it comes to investing, and that includes the monthly payouts from Rich Uncles. Rich Uncles’ 50% equity model greatly diminishes the chance of foreclosure on any of their holdings, and their tenant screening process ensures credit worthiness, but there is still a chance tenants will fail to pay their rent, which would mean there is no rental income to distribute.
Their website requires an account even to “Learn More” — When you click on their links of “Learn More” or “How it Works,” you are given the option to create a login. If you don’t want to create a login, you don’t get to see more about the company.

Summary
Rich Uncles’ REIT investing strategy is to buy commercial real estate with at least 50% cash down, rent the spaces to reliable companies with long-term leases and pay out the rental income to their REIT shareholders via monthly dividends.
Similar to Fundrise, which we reviewed a few months ago, Rich Uncles REITs give investors access to real estate deals without the high dollar commitment typically needed, without being an accredited investor and without paying the high front-end load fees typically charged by REITs.
Rich Uncles’ business model is an investor’s dream in the sense that, unlike brokers who get paid commission whether they make you money or not, Rich Uncles is incentivized to make money for you. The company is entitled to profits only after the REIT delivers a return of 7.0% to shareholders.
Purchasing shares of Rich Uncles NNN REIT, Inc. involves some risk, including the fact that Rich Uncles is a new company with a limited track record. As with any investment, you should carefully read the prospectus prior to making your investment decision.

JB4 months 25 days agoRuth, in the section that mentions the ‘PROs’, I think you may be referring to the wrong item in point #1. The REIT DOES charge  performance fees once the performance crosses over the return threshold. You may have confused the ‘no commission’ charged by outside B/Ds with the performance fee that is being charged.  One has nothing to do with the other. The REIT does charge a 3% Dealer/Manager fee, along with high acquisition fees and disposal fees of properties. There are REIT expenses for sure.   I hope this is helpful.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 09/29/2014
            

                BBB has determined that Rich Uncles meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur
                        
7. total cost of the transaction, including tax, shipping and handling, and other related charges



                    3. If selling products or providing services on Web sites or via other electronic means: 
1. provide any required product labeling information

                            2. disclose the nature and terms of shipping, including any known delays or shortages of stock
                        
3. provide an opportunity to review and confirm the transaction before the sale is completed

                            4. provide a receipt summarizing the transaction after the purchase

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Rich Uncle’s Reviews – Legit or Scam?

from 146 reviews
Review It


 
Rich Uncle’s, found online at Rich-Uncles.com, is a company who says their goal is to create a platform that makes real estate investment accessible for everyone who wants to get involved.
Traditionally speaking, real estate investment was thought to only be available to people who had large sums of investment capital that they could translate into large stakes in investment opportunities.
Rich Uncle’s has a goal of making this type of investment available to people with different levels of capital available, so this type of investment opportunity is no longer off limits to the general public.
How Does It Work?
The whole concept of Rich Uncle’s rests on something called a Real Estate Investment Trust, or REIT, which is a corporation that takes capital from many different investors and uses it to buy and then operate income producing real estate.
In addition, REITs are exempt from taxes if certain standards can be met, including the distribution of at least 90% of the taxable income. REITs make this possible by generating and distributing this income to their shareholders in dividends.




Finally, this company does not pay commissions, instead choosing to use the internet for advertising and finding investors, which reduces their overhead and increases the percentage of returns they distribute to their members.
Is This a Legitimate Opportunity?
This company is funding real estate investment opportunities through a specific type of a crowdfunding platform. They say that their potential investors can begin purchasing ownership in REITs with investments of just $500.
Using the crowdfunding platform to raise capital for real estate opportunities is becoming a popular new concept in real estate investing. It not only opens up real estate investing to people who only have small amounts of money to invest, but it is beneficial for the properties and owners themselves.
Crowdfunding often allows these properties to be funded easier and faster than going through the traditional routes of finding bank funding or investors with large amounts of capital who are interested in the opportunity.
So this type of real estate investment is growing in acceptability and popularity, and people who are interested in it can look at the opportunities available through Rich Uncle’s, or other companies that take a similar approach.

Hello all. I’m really considering investing with RU; but your comments are causing me great concern. I guess my question though is; if RU is so bad, how is it that they have such a high rating with the BBB? I’d like to read whatever comments you can offer on this. Thanks!
REPLYCousin Teddy says:July 27th, 2017 at 5:00 pmThe leaders of this company are the real issue, they’ve never run a business before and just try to complicate everything. They are just trying to hide the Scam, if they would just keep everything simple, they would not have lost so many great employees.
Ernie says:July 25th, 2017 at 7:56 pmLawsuits are of public record. I can’t find any lawsuits with Rich Uncles as a defendant. Where have these lawsuits been filed?
Employees says:July 23rd, 2017 at 1:29 pmFraudulent ponzi that returns your own capital run by financial morons that abuse their employees. Numerous former employees suing them. Run as fast as you can and do not give them a penny or you will never see it again.
cato says:June 23rd, 2017 at 3:19 amBBB isn’t legitimate
cato says:June 23rd, 2017 at 3:17 amBBB rating isn’t a legitimate reflection of a business. It has been found to be corrupt in the past. Ask yourself one question: why do I need to invest in a non-traded REIT when there are so many on the open market?

I have been with them for a few years.  Their services have been great and they pay me every quarter.  It’s a nice price of my portfolio.
REPLYFormer Investor says:July 23rd, 2017 at 1:36 pmAs soon as the remaining lawsuits hit they will be bankrupt and your money will be tied up in court for years. Do not invest.
Cranky Grandpa says:July 4th, 2017 at 8:06 pmYou obviously have no clue what you are investing in, then…those aren’t “dividends”, they are return of principal, which is generated from the depreciation of the properties.  When the the depreciation is gone, so is your “dividend”, plus, it all needs to be paid back when the properties are sold.  It’s like cutting chunks out of a pig and thinking that the pig is “producing” pork…once it’s gone, it’s gone and *poof*, so is your money.
Sucker.
Degenerate Grandfather says:July 3rd, 2017 at 5:10 pmWhat you’re getting is a return of principal…they are paying you back with your own money.  They are losing millions of dollars every year, they balance this out by depreciating the properties.  This depreciation has to be paid back when the properties are sold.
Victoria says:June 29th, 2017 at 5:48 pmi Agree.  I get my dividends every quarter

I have been trying to analyze this opportunity for a while now as I have a significant amount to invest and 7% sounds great. However, the more I read and think about it, it seems that the “dividends” aren’t dividends at all, just a return of investor’s money. This doesn’t sound right to me, particularly after watching the HBO movie about Bernie Madoff. I think I’ll pass.

Recently looked at their audited financials. They are in the red by over a million dollars. What a scam! And half of what they say are lies. Ray West’s is not the CEO for the CBRE group. Check their website.
REPLYEmployee says:July 23rd, 2017 at 1:34 pmThey are a 100% SCAM. No profits and they fire every employee that speaks up about their illegal activities. Multiple employees just resigned due to the CA DOB AND SEC INVESTIGATION that will soon land the executives in jail. Run as far as you can.

Dear Rich Uncle,
I am looking at your SEC quarterly report for 9/30/2016.  Revenue was about $400,000 and expenses were about $1,290,000, per your own report that was filed with the SEC.  The loss per share was ($10.44), per the report you filed with the SEC.  
Thank you so much for providing us novice investors with such a great opportunity.
Sincerely,
Poor Grandson

I invested a little over $10,000 with them. They are so unorganized! They have so many computer glitches it’s rediculous! My sales person sidesteps questions, and if you look at their audited financials you will see they are not making much money.  Certainly not 7%. Perhaps it’s because of their huge staff, or their multi million dollar offices. I’ve never even seen huge hedg funds with offices or a staff like that. When I tried to cash in my investment I had to wait. I was not happy. Find a publicly traded REIT.
REPLYcato says:June 23rd, 2017 at 3:23 amNow you know. If it’s on the radio it’s a scam.

With all the negative reviews and questions concerning the ethics of
RU, why would anyone “invest” here?.  Go to Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard
and others and invest in a true REIT where you can buy and sell on the same day if you want.  No waiting for months to sell and receive your funds.  And there is never a question as to the ethics of the major
brokerage house in terms of the 1099 you receive.  And in one post
RU claims to have 5000 “investors” and $200 million under management.
Check those numbers against the major brokerage firms and RU disappears into obscurity.  And they state they have been in business for a total of three years…oh be still my heart.  They are complete novices at what they do.  Do not walk away, RUN as fast as you can from these
guys.

We wanted to take a moment to respond in this space regarding the comments about recent 1099s that have been issued. It still appears that many of these reviews are not coming from actual investors.
We are happy to address any concern that any legitimate investors have regarding how the IRS addresses “Dividends earned” in person at our offices in Costa Mesa or over the phone with our Clent Relations Team @ 949 536 9226. If they are happy to explain the reporting process on 1099s and if you still have concerns connect you directly with our CFO, President or CEO as appropriate.
In addition, we strongly suggest you consult a tax professional for your own perspective on what Rich Uncles is, in fact, distributing to its clients and reporting on your 1099 and how it is declared by the IRS.
Rich Uncles has been in business for more than 3 years now, is approaching $200M in AUM with well over 5000 investors and has been in good standing with the SEC, BBB and our independent auditors Ernst & Young since inception.
A further technical response regarding understand your 1099 is listed below:
The Form 1099-DIV that you received from Rich Uncles NNN REIT showed both “Total ordinary dividends” and “Nondividend distributions”
This is primarily due to property depreciation deductions. Current tax codes allow real estate owners to depreciate, or write off, the costs of a property’s improvements (i.e., the bricks and mortar, but not underlying ground) over a certain time frame. This is effectively a paper loss and is one of the benefits of owning commercial real estate.
NNN REIT’s business model is to acquire properties in advance of selling REIT shares, using the REIT’s acquisition line of credit. As REIT shares are sold, the line of credit is correspondingly reduced. We use this strategy to ensure that the proceeds from REIT shares sold are immediately deployed into dividend yield-generating real estate ownership, and not deposited into an escrow account until enough shares are sold to purchase the next property.
NNN REIT purchased its first properties in June of last year, utilizing the REIT’s line of credit. Depreciation deductions began to accrue then, prior to selling any REIT shares. The line of credit was also employed to purchase our Dollar General portfolio in November, and our Dana Inc. acquisition in December. The line of credit balance was reduced to $0 last week (repaid from the proceeds of REIT shares sold), but we are about to dip into the line again to purchase our next asset.
A consequence of our buy-first, sell REIT shares-next strategy is that the REIT built up depreciation deductions in 2016 that fully “tax sheltered” the dividends that were paid to shareholders.
These depreciation deductions have reduced your tax or “cost” basis in your REIT shares investment; and under current IRS codes, you will be taxed at capital gains rates on the difference between your ultimate sales price of your REIT shares and your cost basis.
We trust that this clarifies any misunderstanding that you may have had. It is important to note that NO REIT share offering proceeds were used to pay dividends; all dividend were paid from property rental receipts.
REPLYget me out! says:March 3rd, 2017 at 10:27 amYou are so full of crap.  Any “paper” depreciation at this time will subject the holder to hell of a liability when the underlying properties are sold or disposed of.  You are liar and a crook.  And amazing how 3 other “5 star” reviews showed up within hours of your posting.
I can’t wait to see you in prison where your anus will be turned into cole slaw.

Not sure what everyone is so upset about. If you speak to your accountant they will be able to explain how the 1099 is read. I’ve received mine from them, and everything checks out.

Mr/Mrs “Get out” – I’m not sure what your motivation is in writing the posts on this site – the foul language you are using reflects your true character like a mirror, also makes me think your comments lack merit.

We wanted to take a moment to respond in this space regarding the comments about recent 1099s that have been issued. It still appears that many of these reviews are not coming from actual investors. 
We are happy to address any concern that any legitimate investors have regarding how the IRS addresses “Dividends earned” in person at our offices in Costa Mesa or over the phone with our Clent Relations Team @ 949 536 9226. If they are happy to explain the reporting process on 1099s and if you still have concerns connect you directly with our CFO, President or CEO as appropriate.
In addition, we strongly suggest you consult a tax professional for your own perspective on what Rich Uncles is, in fact, distributing to its clients and reporting on your 1099 and how it is declared by the IRS. 
Rich Uncles has been in business for more than 3 years now, is approaching $200M in AUM with well over 5000 investors and has been in good standing with the SEC, BBB and our independent auditors Ernst & Young since inception.
A further technical response regarding understqnd your 1099 is listed below:
The Form 1099-DIV that you received from Rich Uncles NNN REIT showed both “Total ordinary dividends” and “Nondividend distributions”
This is primarily due to property depreciation deductions.  Current tax codes allow real estate owners to depreciate, or write off, the costs of a property’s improvements (i.e., the bricks and mortar, but not underlying ground) over a certain time frame.  This is effectively a paper loss and is one of the benefits of owning commercial real estate.
NNN REIT’s business model is to acquire properties in advance of selling REIT shares, using the REIT’s acquisition line of credit. As REIT shares are sold, the line of credit is correspondingly reduced.  We use this strategy to ensure that the proceeds from REIT shares sold are immediately deployed into dividend yield-generating real estate ownership, and not deposited into an escrow account until enough shares are sold to purchase the next property.
NNN REIT purchased its first properties in June of last year, utilizing the REIT’s line of credit. Depreciation deductions began to accrue then, prior to selling any REIT shares.  The line of credit was also employed to purchase our Dollar General portfolio in November, and our Dana Inc. acquisition in December.  The line of credit balance was reduced to $0 last week (repaid from the proceeds of REIT shares sold), but we are about to dip into the line again to purchase our next asset.
A consequence of our buy-first, sell REIT shares-next strategy is that the REIT built up depreciation deductions in 2016 that fully “tax sheltered” the dividends that were paid to shareholders.
These depreciation deductions have reduced your tax or “cost” basis in your REIT shares investment; and under current IRS codes, you will be taxed at capital gains rates on the difference between your ultimate sales price of your REIT shares and your cost basis.
We trust that this clarifies any misunderstanding that you may have had. It is important to note that NO REIT share offering proceeds were used to pay dividends; all dividend were paid from property rental receipts.
REPLYRichard B. says:February 27th, 2017 at 8:12 pmRich Uncle – Thanks so much for laying this out – really helps me understand further. I actually just happen to meet with my accountant today to review my taxes and she echoed your perspective that this really is an issue with the way the IRS tries to lump a number of things into one space on my 1099.

Harold,  
I heard about “Rich Uncles” on a radio program, and thought this
may be a good solution to put a smsll investment from my IRA. After
reading the reviews, as well, as your replies,  I see, that your stragegy,  is not for the investors, but, instead, to feed greedy
corporate pockets,  with no, regard to the investors, or their
investments. 
I am very disappointed in this company, and I am equally disappointed in the radio station, for allowing your company to be advertised.   It is obvious this is not a legitimate business, with ethical regard , so, I feel grateful to the reviewers for stopping me , from making a very terrible mistake.

I was fooled by these crooks. After opening my 1099 and seeing that they have been lying about the dividend, I tried to sell my shares back and was told that I was unable to.  “There are significant restrictions on our share repurchase program. Consequently, you must be prepared to hold your shares for an indefinite length of time and, if you are able to sell your shares, you may have to sell them at a substantial discount.” Stay as far away from these crooks as possible.

REPLYget me out! says:March 7th, 2017 at 10:16 amP-O-N-Z-I
Depreciation is not wealth generation…it’s depreciation.  After the property is fully depreciated, there is no depreciation.  When the property is sold (most likely at a gain), all of that depreciation has to be paid back.
Are you really that unsophisticated or are you just a rah-rah sock puppet?
Anonymous says:February 21st, 2017 at 6:32 pmI have invested in similar non-traded REITS and can provide the following feedback.  
The IRS categorizes both “return of capital” and depreciation as “return of capital” on your 1099.  If the portfolio used cost serration analysis, your deprecation could be nearly 100% where your 1099 could report 100% “return of capital” and yet the dividend could be fully covered.  
If they are not using cost segregation analysis, you could expect up to 50% tax deferral through depreciation (which would reflect 50% “return of capital” on a 1099)
I am not affiliated with Rich uncles nor up to speed on their portfolios financials.

I know it’s only $10,000 but i’m not going to give them any more until I see what is actually going on in the company, and see if it’s actually a 7% dividend or just a return of capital.

Some things to share with you from my many decades of investing. 
* No serious firm tells their clients that they are savvy or smart for investing with them. Red flag that they’re marketing to fools.
* No serious firm has a campy name with the work “rich” in it.
* Making things work requires hard work. Not fully understanding how your dollars are working to create a return is deluded. 
* Do your homework. This means not relying on the internet to do your research. Call people, get third party opinions, and interview people in person. It’s the only way. The internet is easy… Easy to fool those looking for an easy shortcut.
Good luck!

Another question. The Rich Uncles website says that “Our REITs are required to have audited financials”. Who audits the financials and how often? Does the SEC audit them? 
For what it’s worth, in an earlier post, “RichUncles” said “We have absolutely no salespeople or anybody who earns commissions whatsoever”. Notice that this statement is carefully crafted such that it’s not all encompassing.  With Google it took me 2 seconds to find an online review of Rich Uncles by a guy named Carlos Gomez who states “I’m not a paid employee of RU. I am, however, a consultant for which I am compensated in equity.”

Over the last few weeks, someone has built a fake “Rich Uncles” profile and has been posting ridiculous responses to reviews and question on this site that are going unmoderated.  While we have engaged in the past, Rich Uncles will no longer respond to the comments being made. Post written as of September 2016 through today claiming to be “Rich Uncles” were not made by an employee or affiliate of Rich Uncles and should not be considered a statement from the company.

This is a private REIT. If you purchase there is no market for eyour investment, you will need to sell it back to them and who knows how long that will take or what you will receive. There are hundreds of public REITS on Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab and other brokerage houses from which you can choose. Those are public so there is some regulation and oversight as well as protection. Also, public REITS are required to distribute 90% of all income back to the investors. Rich Uncles has the look, feel and smell of a Ponzi scheme. Why would you or anyone else invest your money with anyone who asks for it on the radio? Be careful and do all your due diligence. Ask for a copy of the 3rd party audited financials. Read the prospects. Especially the part about their fees!

I don’t know if I’ve seen one too many episodes of American Greed and it’s made me overly skeptical of this type of thing but just the name “Rich Uncles” sounds weird and they’ve recently raised the rate of return from 6.5% to over 7%.

After reading these reviews I invested $500 then I went and did some research of my own and have found that sure enough it is not a dividend the reviews are correct it is a “return of capital ” which is legal but it’s very deceptive. This company is set up to make the founders money, not the shareholders. The return of capital will lower your bases which in turn will cost you money. Find a publicly traded REIT. Don’t invest with these crooks!

Stay away.  If their offering was a good deal, it would have been
snapped up by institutional investors.  And how can they “guarantee”
a 7% return in a 0.5% world?  And you need to think about why anyone
would risk their money buying real estate from a radio commercial or
website.  Also, it takes up to three months or longer to have your money returned if you decide to sell.  And they are NOT a public REIT
(regardless of what they tell you).  They are “public” to the extent
they are registered with the SEC so the public can view their offering,
but they DO NOT trade on the open market such as any legitimate
REIT would…XLRE and many others.  If you are a novice investor, I suggest you contact a Certified Financial Planner (CFP) who is also
a Fiduciary (which means they are in business to serve you and not
their best interests).  They can review this with you and I am certain they will tell you essentially what I have written.  You MUST complete
your due diligence before making any decision like this.
  Good luck.
REPLYDouglas J. Lewis, CFP says:October 26th, 2016 at 5:54 pmYou are correct.  The non-traded REITs are public but not traded on stock exchanges.  There are Private REITs also which are not traded on stock exchanges.  The fact that this one is public tells you the reporting to the SEC is required. As far as safety, the public REITs are safer than the private REITs. However, there is another risk in the traded, public REITs that the non-traded ones avoid.  This is the daily potential drop in the value of your investment. The value of your non-traded REIT is not subject to marketability. Also, do not confuse the income, your monthly distribution from your REIT with your return.  You should be interested in knowing how much is your monthly income going to be (although not guaranteed), how long your income period will be (how many years), and when will there be a liquidity event.  This liquidity event is the most crucial.  During the operational period  of your REIT you are receiving a percentage return ON your investment.  Then at liquidity, you will find out what percentage receive OF your investment. If you receive 100% return upon liquidity! this turned out to be a good investment.  There are some excellent non-traded REITs and some lousy ones.  The prospectus is the best way to understand the risks.  As a  Certified Financial Planner, I always begin my due diligence here.  Then I go a lot further utilizing other due diligence attorney firms to get their written evaluations.  So far, the biggest risk I see with this risk is the lack of any information on a liquidity event.  Other risks I have found are with regard to the sponsors.

My concern is that Rich US closer seems to be responding on a very emotional level, instead of sticking to the facts.  It frankly reminds me of the behavior of the Wolf of Wall Street.
While many of us are quite interested in the opportunity to invest, we still need to be reassured of your character and not be left feeling like we are watching a cat fight.

I hold the XLF (Financial SPDR Fund) and they recently spun off
the real estate portion to the XLRE Exchange Traded Fund.  I sold the
XLRE because I think real estate has seen its best days this cycle.  My
point is that I received XLRE yesterday, sold it today with a charge
pf $7.95 and will receive all my funds by Tuesday of next week.  There
are several posters below who state it takes up to three months to
receive funds from Rich Uncles when you decide to sell.  Why would
anyone invest here when you can do so in a publically traded REIT
and do it on line in a millisecond?  And I knew exactly what my sale
price was at the instant I sold the fund shares.  That is something
you cannot find out at RU regardless of how often you ask nor will
they inform you of the value of your RU shares while you own them.
And remember, as a private REIT, Rich Uncles is not under the same
rules and regulations as a public REIT which means you have no protections, no governmental over site or review to ensure they
act as a fiduciary and in your best interest. Stay away from this
operation and only invest in a public REIT.  Otherwise, you are risking
you money.  Be careful.

I heard it on the radio over and over so called the number and spoke the one of their sales guys. Then I decided to do some due diligence. I came across this website and read the reviews then decided to call them back and ask to see the financials. After asking 3 times over a 2 week period I was finally told they don’t give those out. If they are so proud of their returns why can’t they be transparent? I do know of Ray Werta and supposedly he is a stand-up guy but he isn’t the one running the day to day operations. It is this Bozo Howard Makler. I’ve met him a few times and the guy is a joke.

Can’t rate as I am doing my DD. Here are some questions, thoughts and my $02:
1) You should disclose the cap rates you are buying the properties at?
2) You should disclose the loan terms of each property leveraged?
3) If properties are purchased with all cash then financed, how do we (investors) follow the loan disbursements? Should be rolled back into the fund and reinvested. Am sure this is happening but transparency is critical for new/less-known/non-public entities.
4) You should disclose to investors on-going cash flow analyses on each property held.
5) I see more petro, secondary market locations and non-credit tenants in the track-record portfolio than I am initially comfortable with. Seems like more DD on your purchase advisors’ part could produce less risk as quality NNN properties are out there…you just have to work harder to find them. Understand the need to get money out and working but at what cost risk-wise?
6) I do not like the radio ads on POTUS (M Smerconish’s morning show is only one I have heard) as it diminishes, in my mind, the brand. It sounds too much like used car dealership quality….”meet my dog Spot.” Especially the unbelievably fast disclosures at the end of the commercial (I get the need to capitalize on time purchased but it enhances suspicions in my mind of RUs creditability).
7) Finally…I have been involved in RE finance & banking in the OC for over 30-years and can assure you that Ray Wirta has a stellar reputation in the industry, is legitimate force and is one of the primary reasons, besides the projected return, I am looking into this. His background adds significant street cred to the entity. FYI – I do not know or have I met anyone in the company nor am I paid supporter of RU REIT.

You are far better off just putting your money in VTSAX or similar fund than a non-traded, high risk, illiquid REIT like rich uncles. Buyer beware.

skeptic66 says:September 5th, 2016 at 12:56 pmYou are right.  The prospectus says:
“The offerings on the Rich Uncles website are non-traded real estate investment trusts, or REITs. A REIT is a corporation that owns income producing real estate. REITs pool the capital of numerous investors to purchase a portfolio of properties. Non-traded REITs do not trade on a national securities exchange and thus you should understand that any investment in our REIT is generally illiquid. Early redemption of your shares may be possible each month through a Rich Uncles program, but are subject to limitations and fees discussed in the offering documents, including the prospectus or offering circular. As these REITs are not publicly traded on any securities exchange, many factors affect the valuation of non-traded REITs, including the portfolio of real estate assets owned, strength of the balance sheet, overhead expenses and cost of capital. The payment of any dividends or distributions, and that profits will be obtained from your investment, are not guaranteed. Elements of the investments involve varying degrees of risk, including high risk. “

For anyone thinking to invest here, you must complete your due
diligence first.  Read all the negative reviews and then ask yourself, if this is such a great deal, why are the negatives so numerous?  The
answer is that this is not a low risk enterprise, there are no legal
protections for you, there is no governmental oversight or review to ensure adherence to industry and fiduciary standards.  In addition, as
one commenter stated, it took three months to sell his investment and
receive the funds.  If you invest, do so with a PUBLIC REIT (which RU
is NOT despite the owners comments).  You can buy a public REIT on
Monday, decide its not for you and sell on Tuesday and have the funds
in your account by Friday or early the following week.  Since RU is
a NON traded REIT, you must go through them to find a buyer and who
knows how long that could take.  And you do not know, at any given time, the value of your shares since this is a private business and
not subject to the same rules as a PULLIC REIT.  You must be certain
you fully understand exactly what the risks are and decide if they justify lending them your money.  And remember, a PUBLIC REIT is traded in the public stock market just like any other stock and RU IS NOT TRADED.  That alone is a giant red flag that something is very wrong here. Caveat Emptor.
REPLYUChgo MBA, Yale JD says:August 26th, 2016 at 11:47 amNever Never is correct.  The reason real estate is such a good investment is because of a very large non-cash deduction — depreciation — that serves to reduce the TAXABLE income from the rents.  In other words, real estate has two types of income (broadly speaking): taxable income — the rents and similar cash flows in excess of deductions — and nontaxable cashflow — from depreciation.
The investors are only paid out of the taxable income which may be a quite small portion of total cashflow.  The promoters keep the rest!!
Potentially (depending on how much cash the offering receives) the promoters may buy real estate for 100% cash (all from the investors) but receive nearly all of the cashflow.
Another twist on that approach would be for the promoters to take a mortgage on the already purchased real estate and pay those cash proceeds to themselves.  None would be required to be paid to the investors because mortgage proceeds are not taxable income.
As Never Never points out owning a NON-public REIT is kind of like owning a timeshare at a resort.  You might not be able to sell it.

If you are looking into investing into REITs there are some very large companies traded on the US Stock Exchanges that pay large dividends on a regular basis. I own several myself – AGNC, CYS, RSO, WMC but this is more risky and my RSO has under performed the general REIT market.
A good alternative is an ETF that includes REITs like – FTY, REM, MORT & KBWD which also pay good dividends on a regular basis.
REPLYRich Uncles says:August 18th, 2016 at 6:49 pmIf you research any (all) listed REITs over a 12-month period you will find volatility of 25% (up or down, depending on the year). During that same period if you research the REITs income (called FFO – funds from operation) it is likely stable. So why the volatility? Because publicly traded REITs behaves like stocks which defeats the purpose of diversifying into an investment that acts characteristically different. Rich Uncles REIT, alternatively, re-values shares once a year based on Net Asset Value which is essentially an appraised value of the real estate holdings. Cash dividends are paid monthly along with liquidity allowing people to sell back to company at share price. Some limitations apply – but overall – we believe it’s a better mouse trap for investors.

As an investor I’ve had many problems. First of all they call me and bug me to add more money to my account way to much, after I’ve sent an investment they have misplaced it and I’ve had to make numerous calls to have them find my check, then when I did an ACH they didn’t see it on my account and they had to “Sync” my account befor it was credited. I’m really almost to my breaking point. They have way to many accounting glitches, and their sales people are way to aggressive. Also when I looked at my 1099 from last year there was no income, and yes all divideds have been return of capital.

They seem to be doing a lot of advertising. That is not cheap. When you call it all seems like a sales pitch to me, and it’s to much risk for 6.5% interest. They are such a small fund there is no way that the company is profitable yet, and they have been in business over 4 years?

I recently had one of my clients ask me my opinion on this investment. When I looked at the 1099 my client paid no taxes because there was no income. When I look at the dividend it is not a dividend is a return of capital.  I further looked at the financials and the financials look like they are losing money. Then I just decided to do simple math. I called a friend at Clear Channel worldwide and they said that  before they went to national they were spending about $300,000 per month on advertising that’s about 3 1/2 million dollars per year. Then you add that they have about 35 employees that’s probably a cost of $3 million including insurance, bonuses, Time off and special events. Then from what I understand they have some pretty fancy offices. When I look at the location and the square footage of the two offices that they have there probably spending about another million dollars a year minimum on offices. These are probably all lowballing the costs are probably much more than this but when I add that all up plus the fact that they’re saying theyre  giving a 6 1/2% dividend but they have about $85 million under management,  that they have raised over a four-year period I don’t see sustainability of this company.  I don’t think that we can really call this a Ponzi scheme but it seems like to me there is a mismanagement of money. Perhaps when they reach about a $200 million mark or even a $300 million mark  of properties under management  they will be profitable,  but at this point I do not think it’s a very good investment.
REPLYRich Uncles says:August 18th, 2016 at 7:00 pmThe REITs themselves have always been profitable enough to cover all dividend payments from rental income received and profit from real property sales.  Never have we paid a dividend from return of capital.  Keep in mind we are real estate experts… if you knew the terms of our office space lease you would be impressed.  Offices were built for very little money and our entire operation is very frugal.  Advertising costs are not the responsibility of REIT property owners as they are protected by a 3% cap on all expense contributions. 
Instead of paying a 10% commission we charge 0%.  Instead of paying a 5% Expense Contribution we charge 3%.  Very fair indeed.

Full Disclosure: I have not yet invested, but am currently researching this as a way to diversify my investments in 401(K), Roth IRA, stock brokerage account, 529 plan and home equity.
The research I have done (I am a Finance professional with a degree in Finance and an MBA) is all positive thus far. This is a legit opportunity with the same risks as any other investment…what you need to determine is whether or not the risk is worth the potential return of ~6.5%. 
I must say that the negative reviews on this site seem to be coming from uneducated people who blindly invested or know little about REITs and/or public exchanges. This REIT is subject to SEC regulation, but is done so under relatively new laws pertaining to crowd-funding. In other words, the SEC wanted individuals to be able to invest in opportunities without having to go through institutional investors or brokerage firms. This is a good thing for the individual. It DOESN’T make it a ponzi scheme. The SEC is in fact regulating this REIT, which doesn’t eliminate risk, but does ensure it is NOT a “scam”.
To the point about risk, your risk here is that the economy tanks or the commercial real estate market crashes (unlikely, but more realistic given recent history). The value of the properties in the REIT would decline, your share value would decline, and the company may not be able to repurchase your shares if you wanted to “cash out”. You have these same exact risks when investing in the stock market. If you put $500 in a DOW Jones index fund in 2007 and wanted to cash out in 2009, you would only get back 33% of what you put in, and you wouldn’t have received a dividend. If you bought Citigroup stock in 2007 @ $55, it was worth less than a dollar in 2009. Stock prices (even for safe companies) go up and down based on nothing but market speculation. At least the value of this REIT is tied to real property. The only added risk of this REIT is that the market for share repurchase is completely with the fund. They don’t have to buy back your shares, but if they don’t, their fund would fail. 
Last comment: anyone who would blindly dump $80K (or any amount) into anything without testing it first is not worthy of providing their opinion. Start with $500, see how it returns, then build it up slowly if you are happy. Get rich quick doesn’t align with safe investment.
REPLYMrMatterOfFact says:August 30th, 2016 at 9:12 pmIf you have to say “this isn’t a get rich quick scheme”, it’s a get rich quick scheme.

Why not just buy a REIT on the stock market, which is regulated by the SEC and is totally liquid ?
REPLYBill Tea says:December 17th, 2016 at 1:18 amLet’s  be sure we’re distinguishing between equity REITS and mortgauge REITS.   Big difference and yes big volatility based on many factors, especially projected interest rates (for mREITS).  
For that volatility, you are richly rewarded with yield (again, mREITS) of 8-9%, and if you have a long time window as you should with RU, you’ll probably be OK.  Based on that, I’m unsure as to what advantage this give, except that its equity based and is much more than the typical Equity REIT yield of 3-4%.

I will not get into specifics. If you are like me and want to see some good return pretty fast 6 months or so. DONT DO IT! It will take long to get your money back and the return will be minimal. VERY MINIMAL. Honestly a waste!
REPLYRich Uncles says:August 9th, 2016 at 6:27 pmThe return would be 6.5% annually, and you can re-invest your monthly dividend in order to compound your ownership.  In addition, you own your share of the real estate portfolio that has an average increase of 2% annually in rental income.  This is why savvy investors seek RichUncles.com every day.

I will verify that I was asked to post a review and  I was given one share of stock last year. I also received many many many many calls to add more money to my account. I recently  look at my 1099 from last year and we paid no taxes on it. Then I looked at the financials and found out that it is correct the company is not making any money. All their costs related with the business that fancy office and all those employees are all charged to the reit. I think next quarter  I am going to pull out my money, because I no longer think it’s a safe investment.
REPLYJoe says:August 17th, 2016 at 7:52 amI will verify that I was also offered 1 share of stock which was equivalent to $10 to post a review
Rich Uncles says:August 9th, 2016 at 6:24 pmThis is not true.  Our expense reimbursement is expressly limited to 3%.  We own approximately $90,000,000 worth of real estate with less than 40% in debt.  These are the facts.

Here are some genuine reviews from actual investors:
Larry VanderPloeg
Solar Energy Inc.
“Seemed too good to be true. Own real estate without the hassles? Thats why it took me about a year to actually start investing. That was a year of dividends not realized.”
Jorge Salazar
Police Officer
“I was really skeptical to invest money at first, but now I can’t wait to add more funds to my account! I really like the idea of investing in commercial real estate as a group since I wouldn’t be able to do this on my own. As soon as I heard the radio commercial on KFI, I knew this was something I would be very interested in, but felt I couldn’t just jump in. So a few weeks later and after some research I decided to invest! I’m glad I did!”
Blair Pettyjohn
Project Manger in the Broadcast Industry
“Rich Uncles has afforded me the opportunity to dip my feet into the real estate investment pool without heavy burden of actually having to manage the investment. I should see my first quarterly dividends quite soon – time to invest some more…”
Chirag Amin
Orthopedic Surgeon
“Hello fellow investors, my name is Chirag and I am an orthopedic surgeon in the Inland Empire. I consider myself a seasoned investor, holding everything from stocks, real estate, precious metals, and even have fractional ownership in various oil and natural gas wells. The challenge in investing for retirement has always been doing the research and due diligence, staying on top of one’s investment decisions by keeping track of performance, and keeping well-diversified. The great thing about this RichUncles investment is that you get a great investment return, a diversified portfolio of strong income-producing properties, as well as a highly experienced management team that makes smart decisions yet know how to keep expenses in check. I am so glad to be an investor with Uncle Howard, Uncle Harold, and Uncle Ray. Keep up the great work. God Bless.”
REPLYAnthony says:August 18th, 2016 at 7:52 amAny review that starts with “I can’t wait to give these guys more money!” is, in my experience, a paid or “suggested” review.

Unless this REIT is traded on the NYSE or NASDAQ then it’s a non-traded REIT. It’s as simple as that.  And the owner can say what he wants, but
the truth is plain to see.   Avoid at all costs or you will likely lose
your money.  Remember, be more concerned about the return of your
investment rather than the return on your investment.  Caveat Emptor.
REPLYRich Uncles says:August 9th, 2016 at 6:31 pmSuggesting people will lose their money is disingenuous.  Over the last 18 months we have acquired $90,000,000 in real estate with under 40% debt.  We own real estate, leased to creditworhty tenants, with long term leases.  All of our financials are disclosed per the SEC.

Rich Uncles can deny it all they want but they did offer 1 share of stock for posting a review on there website, which is equivalent to $10, therefore they were paying for the reviews! My husband is an an investor and is so excited about all the possibilities but I am a CPA and have looked over the financials and it is true that Rich Uncles has never made a profit. The money they are paying out is “Return of Capital” not a divided. It definitely is a Ponzi scheme at least for now. The investor relations (sales person) that has our account has assured us that they hope to be profitable “soon!”
REPLYRich Uncles says:August 9th, 2016 at 6:28 pmThis is absolutely not true.  Rich Uncles has never paid back money as “return of capital”.  If you are a CPA please post your real identity.  We will gladly show you this is not the case.

Interesting post both positive and negative …
It appears that there are a number of web businesses using the name “Rich Uncle” is various combinations and permutations.
Richuncle.com
Richuncles.com
My-Rich-Uncle.com
The BBB says Richuncle.com in Costa Mesa, Ca. is good. 100% no complaints … ( I’m not a fan of the BBB … )
So … all of these posting just go to demonstrate that it is TOTALLY upon the individual investor to know where exactly you are placing your money … and what are the terms of the investments.
It appears that the majority of complaints posted have been addressed … If you call the company and talk to someone … and don’t even get that persons name … you either have to much money … or have no business investing …
REPLYRich Uncles says:August 12th, 2016 at 10:02 amThank you, Dan.  
I am Howard Makler, President of RichUncles.com.  This is the only site that is offering a Registered Public Offering in the form of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) with 3rd party audited financials (Ernst & Young is our auditor) and fully disclosed financials available on the SEC website.  We are not perfect and sometimes have/do make errors, all of which are addressed promptly and professionally.  
We have grown from a $25,000,000 portfolio to over $100,000,000 in real estate between our CA REIT (now sold out) and our recently launched national offering.  Debt is always limited to 50% or less.  We collect rent from creditworthy tenants who pay all property related expenses (taxes, insurance, maintenance) and distribute a cash dividend monthly.  It’s a fantastic formula for success.  
The owners take personally a strong desire to be know for delivering Integrity and Capability in delivering Real Estate Investing for Everyone via the consumer direct RichUncles.com website.

I am looking into richuncles, and I have to say I like that it isn’t on the exchange. As far as the renters go they seem by and large to be companies that seldom fail even when business is slow. I do find it a bit strange that a company whose portfolio speaks to its strength is defending itself in online reviews. Most people who do reviews online either have nothing to do with the company or have built a minor annoyance into a major catastrophe. Due diligence should not be built on online reviews.

many years ago Bernie Madoff started out like this not with REITS but similar Financial offerings to the public and advertised on the radio and in the internet. He was registered with the SEC and promise the moon in the world and after several years it turned into a Ponzi scheme. so apparently some of the Madoff family members work at Rich uncles because I have a feeling if it looks like a duck and sounds like a duck it must be a duck beware.
REPLYChris says:August 24th, 2016 at 11:31 pmThat should be “quack,” Tony. “Quacks like a duck.” And your punctuation is pretty bad.
Rich Uncles says:August 9th, 2016 at 6:30 pmYou can certainly be skeptical of everything and everybody… but meanwhile… Google the person behind this, Ray Wirta.  Do some homework for yourself.  His only reason for creating this company was to provide an honest mechanism for people to invest in commercial real estate.

Very odd and does anyone know who owns this site? As I said before greed will cloud your judgement and look up “Ponzi”.

I have been an investor for almost a year. I had needed to sell some shares to I put in a share order. I was told yesterday that there was a glitch in the system and it wasn’t executed. In addition my divideds did not get paid. I’m very unhappy! I decided to go back and look at the financials with my accountant and he pointed out that in the past 4 years the company has never made a profit. They are loosing money and the so called “Divided” they are paying out is actually a return of capital. They are trying to make it look like they pay this great divided but they are not! I am going to attempt to sell all my shares but who know I may have lost all my money since they keep having glitches. Go over the financials before you buy!

This information is incorrect.  All dividends have been paid from rental income or profit from real estate sales.  Our CFO will happily review the details with your accountant.  As for the glitch I am unaware that any requested sales did not occur.  You have not lost your money.  We are a public company and takes these matters very seriously.  You can visit our office in Costa Mesa and verify that your funds are safe and the real estate is owned.

REPLYChris says:August 24th, 2016 at 11:41 pmUh, John, if they blocked your ability to post, how did you post? I’m enjoying the back and forth between Rich Uncles and everybody else.  And I’m considering investing.  But I’m doing my due diligence.  Not ready to invest quite yet but it seems intriguing.  I like how it’s highly regulated by the SEC. I know 4 people who have invested and they are happy.  Not sure I like the idea of having to pay a surrender fee for selling before 3 years in their current offering.  But, as a current small-time real estate investor, I understand this should be a long-term investment.

Fine, you are registered with the SEC but that does not mean you are a public company, only that your filing is open to public review.  If
you are indeed a public company, what is your symbol and what exchange
do you use to buy / sell?  And if you are truly public, why do you
use radio advertising to gain investor’s rather than simply allowing
your publicly reported results to speak for you? Providing your
trading symbol / exchange will go a long way to ensure you are what you say and do as you say.
REPLYRich Uncles says:August 3rd, 2016 at 10:32 amYour facts are incorrect.  We are indeed a public company but not traded on a stock exchange – by our choice.  Publicly traded REITs perform like any other stock, namely, they are volatile.  Rich Uncles is a public non-listed REIT where the value of our portfolio is determined by the Net Asset Value of our properties.  We believe this is a much better structure.

I just read through the prospectus and the fee’s (3% acquisition fee and 3% disposition fee! plus 3% organization fee!!!) that you are charging are way too high for supplying what I consider to be substandard properties in very tertiary markets…..  Once there is another correction in the economy, a lot of these properties will be abnormally subject to high risk.  The returns promised do not take into account the high level of risk.
REPLYRich Uncles says:August 3rd, 2016 at 10:33 amYou are not correct.  The fees are frankly industry standard.  Regarding our tenants, we take great effort to scrutinize the credit of our tenants.

I invested 18K and needed it all back after my wife wanted a new state of the art fridge and to remodel our bathroom.  It took only one quarter to get my money, plus $300 in dividend profit back.  I only was asked why I was leaving the REIT.  Once I told them, it was fine.  Not sure what the other people are griping about.  If they make a mistake, tell them!  Keep your records and emails as proof.  They are very responsive.
REPLYWarren says:August 24th, 2016 at 8:22 pmI made two investments with them last year, the first was a lump sum pension plan payout rolled over into an IRA, the other was part of the profits on the sale of a house. Both of these have paid the historical 7.5%, on time.
No complaints here!
Rich Uncles says:August 3rd, 2016 at 4:29 pmDoes anybody do math?  
The CA REIT was paying a 7.5% annual cash dividend.  $18,000 with a 7.5% annual cash dividend would yield $1,350 in dividend payment or $337.50 per quarter.
This isn’t buying lottery tickets or gambling.  This is owning income producing commercial real estate.  You receive a cash dividend along with any property value increases as our leases have an average annual rental increase of 2%.
Sage says:August 1st, 2016 at 4:00 pm@Fred, if you actually read the comment he says he got his initial investment of 18K PLUS a $300 dividend. You should stick to investing in lottery tickets.
Fred Rated says:July 30th, 2016 at 12:55 amInvested 18K and only got $300 back???   Sucky rate of return…

This is a private REIT.  If you purchase there is no market for
your investment, you will need to sell it back to them and who knows how long that will take or what you will receive.   There are
hundreds of public REITS on Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab and other
brokerage houses from which you can choose.  Those are public so
there is some regulation and oversight as well as protection. Also,
public REITS are required to distribute 90% of all income back to the
investors…what percent does RU distribute?  Rich Uncles has the
look, feel and smell of a Ponzi scheme.  Why would you or anyone else
invest your money with anyone who asks for it on the radio?  Be
careful and do all your due diligence.

Unique RichUncles.com Crowdfunding Platform Empowers “Real Estate Investing for Everyone™”







RichUncles.com



Costa Mesa, CA (PRWEB)
July 21, 2016
 RichUncles.com, a technology-enabled platform that allows small investors the opportunity to participate in large-scale real estate ownership for as little as $500, has announced the launch of Rich Uncles NNN REIT. Rich Uncles NNN REIT is a Real Estate Investment Trust authorized to raise $1 billion to purchase single-tenant, triple-net leased properties. Founded in 2012 by Ray Wirta, Chairman of the Board of CBRE Group, Inc., RichUncles.com is the realization of his long-held vision of democratizing commercial real estate ownership - delivering Wall Street deals to Main Street investors.
“We are very excited to launch Rich Uncles NNN REIT, bringing our easy-to-use platform to investors nationwide who may not otherwise have access to commercial real estate investment opportunities,” stated Harold Hofer, CEO of Rich Uncles NNN REIT.
This latest announcement comes on the heels of Rich Uncles’ recent closing of Rich Uncles REIT I, an $80 million California REIT. Rich Uncles REIT I originally started as a $25 million offering, increasing its size twice and has paid over $3 million in dividends to date. 
“Our investors have limited exposure to real estate investments” explained Hofer. “Much of corporate America has made the decision to lease, rather than own, real estate, and Rich Uncles acts as a Crowdfunding conduit, delivering corporate America’s rental payments into Middle America’s pocketbooks.”
About RichUncles.com: 
Rich Uncles was founded for a single purpose – to make real estate investment easier and less expensive for the small investor.  Rich Uncles has created an on-line distribution channel for the sale of non-exchange listed public REITs that eliminates payment of 10% commissions to financial planner intermediaries. This new distribution channel embraces the large-scale reach of the internet, and the ease of access to and transparency of information contained over the internet.
Company executives include Ray Wirta, Chairman of the Board, who is also the current Chairman and former CEO of CBRE, and Harold Hofer, CEO and Director. The company's president is Howard Makler.
