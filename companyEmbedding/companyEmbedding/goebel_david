Overview



Juan Quezada is the premier potter in Mexico. With local materials and the primitive methods of the Casas Grandes people  including using human hair to make brushes and cow manure to feed the flames that fire his pots  Juan creates stunning pots in the traditional style. Each is a work of art unlike any other.The text is written in the form of "The House That Jack Built" and accompanied by a comprehensive afterword with photos and information about Juan's technique as well as a history of Mata Ortiz, the northern Mexican village where Juan began and continues to work. This celebratory story tells how Juan's pioneering work has transformed Mata Ortiz from an impoverished village into a prosperous community of world-renowned artists.

Editorial Reviews


Publishers Weekly
Noted Mexican potter Juan Quezada is the subject of an  inventive and engrossing biography from newcomer Andrews-Goebel  (who coproduced a documentary on Quezada) and Caldecott winner  Diaz. On the left side of each spread, a "House That Jack  Built"-style rhyme accumulates the often humble factors that  shaped an extraordinary artist ("These are the cows all white  and brown/ That left manure all over the ground/ That fueled the  flames so sizzling hot/ That flickered and flared and fired the  pot/ The beautiful pot that Juan built"). This lilting rhyme  describes the rudiments of Quezada's process, but for more  ambitious readers, the opposite page (unfortunately, in very  small type) provides a straightforward elaboration ("Juan's  pottery is fired the traditional way, using dried cow manure for  fuels.... [M]anure from cows that eat grass, rather than  commercial feed, burns at the best temperature to turn his clay  pots into perfectly fired works of art"). Diaz ingeniously ties  the two narrative threads together with strongly horizontal  compositions and radiant, stencil-like digital renderings (a  highlight is the spread in which ants point the way to a vein of  fine white clay). The artist shows Quezada both at work and  seeking inspiration in the scrubby foothills. The glowing tones  of the artwork capture the sweep and heat of the sun-bleached  landscape, while the highly stylized elements echo the  decorative motifs of Quezada's pottery and lend a suitably  mythic patina to this visionary artist's story. Ages 6-up.  (Sept.)


Children's Literature
This variation on the House That Jack Built pattern takes us from the beautiful pot back through the firing, the painting and the shaping, all the way to the finding and digging of the clay, "the very best clay all squishy and white." Parallel to this cumulative story runs very detailed information in smaller type about professional potter Juan Quesada's life and work in his Mexican village. Diaz has created decorative double-page spreads of computer-generated, stencil-like images in warm colors of local scenery and architecture along with Juan and his friends. Several small color photographs of Juan and his creations are included in the several pages of the Afterword, as well as a great deal of further information, making a book for expanding knowledge as well as for pleasure reading. 2002, Lee & Low Books,  Ken Marantz and Sylvia Marantz



Combining aspects of folklore and nonfiction, this book tells the story of Juan Quezada, a man living in Mata Ortiz, a remote village in Chihuahua, Mexico. In his explorations in the mountains near his village, Juan found shards of pottery from the Casa Grandes people who had disappeared six hundred years earlier. Juan set about to rediscover their method for making pottery, using the resources at hand. His success—using the fine local clay and found minerals for paint, using human hair for his brushes, and burning dried cow dung to fire the pots at the ideal temperature to make incomparably beautiful pots—has changed forever the economic and artistic life of the village. The left-hand pages in this book contain a story told in the cumulative rhyming folk pattern found in The House that Jack Built. These words describe the process Juan uses to create his unique works of art. On the right-hand side of the pages, a denser but more straight-forward text provides a factual account of Quezada's discoveries and techniques. The Afterward amplifies this information with actual small color photographs of the village, the artist, the process, and a couple of examples of the beautiful, original pottery created by Quezada and others in the village to whom he has taught his craft. The text is set against an orange/yellow, fire-colored background created by Caldecott Award-winning artist, David Diaz, on which decorative art patterns and stylized illustrations of Juan Quezada, the cows, foliage, and other story elements seem to glow. The cover and opening page, which shows Quezada holding a glowing pot against his chest, makes the pot seem to serve as his heart, suffused with a glowing warmth andexpansive light. This is a fascinating and inspiring first book by a California author/filmmaker. The author's rich language in the cumulative tale artfully summarizes the factual details. David Diaz's glowing illustrations lend a magical quality to the story. The book can be appreciated in many dimensions. It could be shared along with the 2001 Newberry Award-winning book by Linda Sue Park, A Single Shard (Houghton Mifflin), as part of investigating the importance of pottery in the artistic and cultural life of a people. It can be used as a read-aloud for younger students, can be read for art appreciation, and as a cultural and anthropological work. It is, finally, a story of one man's vision and persistence directed towards realizing a dream while, at the same time, validating his heritage, forming artifacts of beauty for the world, teaching this art to his siblings and neighbors, and creating with them a future filled with the light of hope. 2002, Lee & Low,  Marilyn Robertson


School Library Journal
K-Gr 5-Juan Quezada is one of the best-known potters in Mexico.  Using only natural materials to form and paint his pots, he is  responsible for creating a vibrant folk-art economy in his small  town of Mata Ortiz. This unusual book is set up to allow for  differing levels of reading expertise, presenting information  about Quezada in such a way that it can be read as a story or as  an informational book, part biography, part fine-arts  discussion. One page contains a catchy cumulative rhyme modeled  on "This Is the House That Jack Built," which outlines the  process of making a pot. The facing page offers a clearly  written prose presentation, laying out the story of the potter's  life and his method of constructing pots in the classic style of  the Casas Grandes Indians. Diaz's arresting illustrations,  rendered in Adobe Photoshop, use yellows, oranges, and reds in a  layered effect that seems to glow with an inward light. The use  of stylized forms-all of the people with a full-face front eye  in the manner of ancient Egyptian art-adds a sense of gravitas  and historical continuity to the artwork. An afterword gives a  more in-depth treatment of Quezada's life and work, and is  illustrated with small inset color photographs. This is a must  purchase for all collections, and could be used with Diana  Cohn's Dream Carver (Chronicle, 2002) for a look at how both art  and economies of scale can work to enrich our lives and to build  community.-Ann Welton, Grant Elementary School, Tacoma, WA   Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information.


Kirkus Reviews
Ingeniously crafted with a three-part structure, this informational picture book tells the story of Juan Quezada of Mata Ortiz, Chihuahua, Mexico, who single-handedly rediscovered the processes and materials used by the long-vanished Casas Grandes Indians to create fine pottery. Fascinated by the ancient potsherds he found as a child, Quezada knew that this pottery had to have been made using only natural materials found in the area, and so began to experiment until he was able to create pottery that resembled these ancient fragments. The result, after many years, has been the transformation of his impoverished village into a thriving community of craftspeople, and the creation of astonishingly beautiful pottery that is now found in museums and art galleries around the world. Andrews-Goebel tells this story by interweaving a rhyme patterned on "The House that Jack Built" ("This is the cock that crowed at dawn / That greeted the village and woke up Juan") with a prose telling of Quezada's story ("When he was twelve years old, while bringing firewood down from the hills on his burro, Juan found his first potsherds"). A final section that includes small photographs provides additional factual and background information. Based on the author's visits with Quezada to make a documentary film, no additional sources of information are provided. Diaz's (Angel Face, 2001, etc.) characteristic illustrations, with colors somewhat muted by the earth tones of clay, reflect Quezada's intricate, swirling pottery designs in background patterns, and capture, in a stylized manner, the ambience of the little village on the high windy plains of Chihuahua and the drama of Juan's discoveries. A lovely andunusual offering. (Nonfiction/picture book. 6+)

Product Description
The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 not only opened the border to the West for seventeen million East Germans; it also allowed art lovers and researchers to gain access to the rich cultural treasures housed in Central European museums and libraries. As director of Musica Antiqua Koln, Reinhard Goebel was constantly on the lookout for musical treasures from the Baroque for his ensemble to perform. So he did not mingle with the souvenir hunters along the length of the Berlin Wall but headed straight on the treasure trail to Dresden. It was here in the 18th century that culture had enjoyed a golden age unprecedented in Germany thanks to the tireless patronage of Augustus the Strong and his successor: an active building programme turned the Saxon capital into the Florence on the Elbe immortalized in the wonderful canvases by Bernardo Bellotto (Canaletto). In addition, the royal residence with its venerable court orchestra and the opera house that was opened on the Zwinger in 1719 were centres of Baroque music, attracting musicians from all over Europe keen to work at the court of the electors of Saxony, who were also kings of Poland. Even Johann Sebastian Bach gazed wistfully at Dresden from his Kantors position in Leipzig and in 1736 was proud to acquire the title of Court Composer to the Electors of Saxony and Kings of Poland.The Saxon Regional Library in Dresden finally became generally accessible again in 1990, and it was with genuine delight that Goebel, a tireless researcher, buried himself in its treasures, soon bringing several to light. The Concerti grandi by Johann David Heinichen, who was born near Weissenfels in 1683 and was court Kapellmeister in Dresden from 1716 until his death in 1729, were just one of the works that Goebel rediscovered in Dresden; they proved to be altogether outstanding. Until then Heinichen had received no more than a few lines in dictionaries of music, and although the second half of the 20th century saw an awakening interest in the treasures of Baroque music, his first-rate compositions remained hidden beneath layers of dust in Dresdens archives. If you want to understand the festive nature of the culture in Augustus Dresden, with its uncommonly peaceable German kind of absolutism, you need to hear the concertos of Johann David Heinichen: practical and straightforward, unusually energetic and magnificent, sometimes lovely, but never losing sight of their ceremonial purpose by becoming unduly self-referential or self-infatuated, they reflect their age and also mirror that self-confident and grandiose love of life that inspired Augustus the Strong and his son and that was also communicated to their subjects, even today justifying a certain feeling of superiority on the part of art-loving Saxons in the face of Prussians committed to a duelling-corps mentality Reinhard Goebels enthusiasm at his discovery is palpableDetmar Huchting

… full of the most beautiful and stylish playing from the Musica Antiqua Koln. They perform consistently with insight and panache, and a great deal of care has been taken to vary continuo instruments. --Classic CD, London[The concertos] show … the scope, vivacity and stylishness of Goebels team of Cologne experts in bringing the hidden delights into the open. An irresistible collection for the Baroque enthusiast. --Hi-Fi News & Record Review, London
