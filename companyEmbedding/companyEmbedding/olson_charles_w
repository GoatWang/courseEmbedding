Automatic measurement of ischemic levels in coronary segments to determine artery responsible therefor



Patent number:  8983589
                                            

Abstract:  A method for localizing ischemia in segments of a heart in a patient under test includes attaching a plurality of electrodes to the patient to form a plurality of leads, capturing electric signals at each of the leads, determining a normalized vector magnitude for each lead as is inherent in a normal heart, calculating an output for each cardiac segment as a percentage of the left ventricle (LV) by adding up the contributions for all of the leads in the direction of each segment at the J point based on the normalized vector magnitudes and a correct calibration factor for conversion to the percent of LV and taking a dot product of each lead vector and each segment vector to identify a normalized response for each lead at each segment center and using the dot products to multiply the ST J-point signal for each lead.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant

Inventor:

Three dimensional vector cardiograph and method for detecting and monitoring ischemic events



Patent number:  6884218
                                            

Abstract:  A method of determining an ischemic event includes the steps of: monitoring and storing an initial electrocardiogram vector signal (x, y, z) of a known non-ischemic condition over the QRS, ST and T wave intervals; calculating and storing a J-point of the vector signal and a maximum magnitude of a signal level over the T wave interval; monitoring a subsequent electrocardiogram vector signal over the QRS, ST and T wave intervals; measuring and storing the magnitude (Mag.) of the vector difference between a subsequent vector signal and the initial vector signal; measuring and storing the angle (Ang.

Heavy duty punch



Patent number:  5044244
                                            

Abstract:  A heavy duty punch for piercing armor plate and the like has a shank by which the punch may be held when in use and a piercing end projecting axially from the shank. The piercing end terminates in a sharp-edged tip. The tip is connected to the shank by a reduced-diameter portion defined by a curved sidewall extending axially from the tip toward the shank and a straight-sided sidewall extending axially from the curved sidewall toward the shank. The straight-sided sidewall is spaced from the tip a distance slightly greater than the thickness of the workpiece being punched; the diameter of the straight-sided sidewall is slightly less than the diameter of the tip.

Cam operated clamp housing for injection molding heaters



Patent number:  4968247
                                            

Abstract:  A clamp housing for cylindrically wound heaters, particularly for an injection molding nozzle heater has a slit that permits changing the effective diameter of the housing and it is actuated by an axially extending cam pin that can be easily adjusted from an exposed end of the heater. The cam pin has a central cam portion formed between two end hubs that are rotatably mounted with respect to one edge of a longitudinal slit in the clamp housing, and a central cam portion that is mounted in a loop formed from the opposite edge of the slit in the housing. As the cam pin is rotated the two edges of the slit in the housing can be forced together because of the cam action and the housing will tighten around a heater held on the interior of the clamp.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant
                                            

Filed:

Coke briquette



Patent number:  4078902
                                            

Abstract:  A coke briquette for use in iron foundries in which coke fines screened from coke being fed to the cupola are recycled into briquette form to be used in place of raw coke in the iron making process. A mix for making the briquettes employs an 80-10-10 percentage by weight ratio of coke fines, high early cement and fly ash respectively to which water is added in a two-step process. The fines have their external surfaces prewetted prior to the adding of the fly ash, cement and additional water for activating the cement. The resulting mix is then formed and cured into cylindrical briquettes by conventional block-making apparatus.

Range-bearing computer



Patent number:  3947804
                                            

Abstract:  1. In an electro-mechanical bearing computer in which the bearing angle of target relative to a predetermined line is computed from the time interval between the arrivals of a wave front at two spaced locations and a constant voltage proportional to the distance of separation of the spaced locations, the velocity of propagation of the wave front, and the angle of inclination formed by the intersection of a line drawn through the spaced locations and a horizontal plane through one of the spaced locations,A. means for generating a first signal proportional to said time interval,B. means for generating a second signal proportional to said constant voltage,C. first resolving means connected to said first and second signal generating means for providing an unmodified third signal equal to the difference between said first and second signals,D.
