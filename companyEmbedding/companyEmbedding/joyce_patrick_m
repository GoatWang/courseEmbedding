Joyce, Patrick J. Schoolcraft Patrick was received into the arms of his Savior, while surrounded by family and friends on Monday, December 26, 2016. Pat was born January 23, 1953 in Kalamazoo, the son of the late Alfred and Mary (Landrum) Joyce. He was employed for 36 years as a pipefitter with the Upjohn-Pfizer Company, and was a member of 12th Street Baptist Church. Pat loved the outdoors. He was an avid hunter and outdoorsman, who passed along his love and interest in hunting to his children and grandchildren. The last 11 years changed Pat's life. He was diagnosed with cancer in 2005 and underwent a stem-cell transplant in 2007. He faced numerous trials and tribulations that ultimately led him closer to God. His positivity and faith radiated even when he was lying in a hospital bed. Despite his own suffering, he was always there to lend an ear, offer advice and provide support for others. He was not afraid to share his testimony with all who would listen. He will always be remembered for his love of family, music, humor, and faith. Our earthly loss is heaven's gain. On March 24, 1990 Patrick was united in marriage to his loving wife Karin, who survives. Also surviving are his children, Kristin (Ken) Youngs, Brooke (Joel) Camp, Timothy (Erika) Balkema, Carley (Tim) Bosker, Nickolas (Kacee) Balkema; 12 grandchildren, Landen, Kenny, Kadynce, Nolan, Kaylee, Faith, Avery, Brody, Bryce, Hadley, Patrick, and Timmy; brother and sister, Michael (Sandra) Joyce, Kelly (Tim) Jones; and many nieces and nephews. Friends may meet the family from 2-4 and 6-8pm Thursday, December 29 at the Langeland Family Funeral Homes, Westside Chapel, 3926 South 9th Street. A memorial service will be held at 11:00am Friday, December 30 at the 12th Street Baptist Church, 3911 South 12th Street, with Pastor Thaddeus Stout officiating. Private family interment will be at a later date. Memorial may be directed to the 12th Street Baptist Church, West Michigan Cancer Center, or the NRA. To view Patrick's personalized guestbook please visit www.langelands.com.
