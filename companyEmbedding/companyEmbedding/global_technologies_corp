The net proceeds to us from the sale of up to 1,000,000 Shares offered at a
public Offering price of $0.04 per share will vary depending upon the total
number of Shares sold. Regardless of the number of Shares sold, we expect to
incur Offering expenses estimated at approximately $11,500, consisting of
$10,000 for legal, accounting, and $1,500 of other costs in connection with this
Offering (estimated transfer agent fees). The table below shows the intended net
proceeds from this Offering that we expect to receive for scenarios where we
sell various amounts of the Shares. Since we are making this Offering without
any minimum requirement, there is no guarantee that we will be successful at
selling any of the securities being offered in this prospectus. Accordingly, the
actual amount of proceeds we will raise in this Offering, if any, may differ.

None of the proceeds from this Offering will be used to pay the salaries to our
officers and directors.

Net Offering Proceeds    $   4,500     $  12,500     $  20,500     $    28,500  

If the Company raises 10% or 20% it will not raise sufficient funds to cover the
offering expenses.

At 30%, $12,000 it will just have enough funds to cover the offering, and no
funds for further activity.

The Use of proceeds set forth below demonstrates how we intend to use the funds
under the various percentages of amounts of the related Offering. All amounts
listed below are estimates.

                                            40 %            60 %            80 %           100 %

Our Offering expenses are comprised of legal and accounting expenses and
transfer agent fees relating to the Offering. Our Officers and Directors will
not receive any compensation for their efforts in selling our Shares.

We intend to use the proceeds of this Offering in the manner and in order of
priority set forth above. We do not intend to use the proceeds to acquire assets
or finance the acquisition of other businesses. At present, no material changes
are contemplated. Should there be any material changes in the projected use of
proceeds in connection with this Offering, we will issue an amended prospectus
reflecting the new uses.

In all instances, after the effectiveness of this Registration Statement, the
Company will need some amount of working capital to maintain its general
existence and comply with its public reporting obligations. Our Company
estimates that we will need approximately an additional $10,000 per year to
cover additional expenses for public reporting, legal fees, accounting,
auditing, and transfer of agent fees. The Company recognizes that if it does not
raise net proceeds of at least $20,500 in this Offering, it will have to seek
additional funds to cover these expenses. The $20,500 in net proceeds that we
need to stay in business for twelve months is comprised of (i)$10,000 for public
reporting expenses (ii) $10,000 for the development of the application and $500
for working capital. While the existing liabilities on our balance sheet also
include $2,900 in shareholder loans, the shareholder loans do not have a fixed
repayment date, and will not be paid out of the Net Offering , and the Offering
costs will also be paid out of the gross proceeds from the Offering. The net
proceeds from the Offering will not be used to pay either of these liabilities.

The Company will fail if it does not raise a minimum of gross proceeds of
$32,000and the Director will not be able to fund the Company.

In addition to changing allocations because of the amount of proceeds received,
we may change the use of proceeds because of required changes in our business
plan. Investors should understand that we have wide discretion over the use of
proceeds. Therefore, management decisions may not be in line with the initial
objectives of investors, who will have little ability to influence these
decisions.


There are several applications that are currently available that enable you to
scan receipts and other documents to your iPhone. While most current solutions
require a physical receipt, our solution will bypass the need to print a receipt
by connecting the source of the receipt, namely the Vendor’s computerized cash
register to a Bluetooth-enabled Tablet or secondary device such as an iPad or
laptop.

Furthermore, these other solutions may offer some competition for Global
Technologies’ Front and Back office solution, the main difference with most of
these applications is that they are for the end-user only and require the iPhone
user to physically take a paper receipt and scan it and then save the file. In
our case, we plan to introduce an integrated solution that manages both the
end-user side and the Vendor side of the transaction, taking the sale receipt
directly from the Vendor’s cash register to an interim device such as a Tablet,
which will have the ability to transfer the saved file to the purchaser’s iPhone
via Bluetooth or similar technology.

Other solutions that may compete with our solution involve the use of a scanner.
These devices are well known and readily available in both handheld varieties as
well as tabletop versions. In both cases, again, these scanners require a
physical piece of paper that is scanned and then transferred, usually by a flash
drive to a laptop or similar device. Here too, our solution will be different in
that no hardware other than the iPhone and Tablet are required. Our solution
will connect the Vendor’s cash register output directly to the customer’s iPhone
without having to use a physical piece of paper and a physical scanner.

Another aspect of our solution will be the file management module of the Front
Office solution that the end-user will be able to manually install on a
Smartphone such as an iPhone. While there are many applications that enable file
management on both an iPhone and a Tablet, our solution will involve an
integrated solution that receives a file via Bluetooth or similar transfer
technology and then automatically catalogs that file and stores it on the iPhone
according to preconfigured criteria such as location, file name syntax, etc. The
iPhone owner will not be required to do anything other than enable the Bluetooth
operation of the iPhone and accept the connection to the Tablet for transferring
a file. Once received, our solution will automatically process the file and save
it within the Front Office interface for future handling such as printing,
emailing, viewing, etc.


Company Description
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 28, 2014 and are a
development stage company. Our Company's business plan involves the development
of a software solution that will connect via Bluetooth or similar technology
(our "Back Office Software") to a Tablet or iPad that is connected to


 the cash
register at a wide variety of retail outlets (our "Vendors"). Our plan is to
market and sell Vendors licenses for our Back Office Software to Vendors based
upon a Vendoryearly service package. The Back Office Software will run on a
standard Tablet, connected via Bluetooth, cable, or other technology to the
Vendor’s computerized cash register. Vendors will have the option for using
other devices such as an iPad or laptop.

In standard operation, after the cash register tallies the total purchase for
each client, the receipt is saved to the network where it can be accessed at any
time. For our solution, the Vendor will configure the cash register to save the
receipt to the Tablet (or other device, as detailed above). The receipt will
automatically be saved in a file with a configurable name to include such
elements as the time and date, name of the store, etc. The Back Office Software
running on the Tablet will archive the receipt. It will also transfer it to
theapplication running on the end user’s iPhone or similar device ("SmartPhone".
The transfer will be accomplished by Bluetooth or through use of a cable
connection. Once the receipt is transferred to the purchaser’s Smartphone, in a
non-editable format such as an image or protected PDF format, it will be logged
into the Front Office. The end user can configure the Front Office application
to store receipts by month, location or other customizable settings. Each
receipt will be saved under a unique file name which will should include the
date and time stamp. One of the main benefits of this solution will be the
elimination of a paper receipt. Once the receipt has been transferred to the
purchaser electronically, there is no need to print the receipt at the store and
it is less likely that the receipt will be misplaced. The Front Office
application, located on the purchaser’s Smartphone, will have an interface for
the end-user that will enable them to sort, view, delete or email receipts that
have been saved to their iPhone. In this way, the end-user should be able to
print the receipt if necessary, but avoid printing and save paper, if the
receipt is only used for reference purposes.

To promote the solution, initially planned for iOS operating systems running on
iPhone and iPad devices, the Company will create a website from which Vendors
can purchase the Back Office and from which users can download the Front Office
application, which we believe will be offered at no cost. The company will
generate income via a yearly service charge to Vendors and advertisements that
appear while the application is in use.

While the Company's operations will be based in Israel, we anticipate that our
Back Office Solutions can and will be marketed globally. The Company also
expects to build a website which will serve as both a base for marketing as well
as offers of customer service. The website, which has not been designed yet,
should include a Knowledge Base with articles detailing use and benefits of the
application and may include a Partner Portal to allow Vendors to sign up and get
additional technical support regarding setup and configuration of the Back
Office application required to communicate between the store’s computer cash
register and the tablet hosting the back office application. The company plans
to work with an outside development team and web developer to create the
guidelines for an initial design, or prototype, of the full solution, including
the Back and Front Office parts of the solution, and then license the idea to a
third party for development, global marketing, and management. At this time, we
do not anticipate any hardware-related requirements other than a standard device
such as a laptop or tablet that will connect via USB to the Vendor’s cash
register, and the end-user’s personal Smartphone, currently planned for iOS
systems running on iPhone devices.

It is likely that we will have to engage marketing and social media experts to
determine the best way to promote the application, the website, and the brand of
our offering. In later stages of the development of the product, development
teams may be needed to assess the feasibility of also developing this solution
for Android-based devices such as standard Tablets and Smartphones. We will also
need to hire user interface experts to optimize the graphic user interface of
both the Back Office Software and the Front Office application seen by iPhone
and iPad users.

In addition to application-specific advertising on the website and within the
end-user application, we plan to monetize the site through several means
including topic-based advertisement; local, national, global and corporate
sponsors, and more. While the base service will be free to end-users, additional
for-pay services may be added both on the site and for the Vendors. Cloud-based
service accounts can be offered to end-users to enable them to store their
records in a place that can then be accessed by their other devices and
computers simply by logging into the repository and accessing a secure,
password-protected account. Our third party licensing partner will need to
define the terms of this service in terms of cost, length of time the service is
offered, etc.. A full set of for-pay end-user benefits will need to be discussed
with the development agency we hire. Some of the initially planned features may
need to be shifted to later development cycles. Certain features of the proposed
services for both Vendor and end-users may not be developed without proper
funding.
