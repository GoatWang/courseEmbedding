	NEWS RELEASE







	AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE CORP. ANNOUNCES




	2015 FIRST-QUARTER RESULTS






	New York, New York, May 7, 2015.  American Independence Corp. (NASDAQ: AMIC) today reported 2015 first-quarter results.







	Financial Results







	AMIC reported net income of $0.7 million ($.09 per diluted share) for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $0.6 million ($.08 per diluted share) for the three months ended March 31, 2014.  





	Revenues increased to $43.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to revenues of $43.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014, primarily due to an increase in premiums offset by a decrease in agency income.  











	Chief Executive Officers Comments







	Roy T. K. Thung, Chief Executive Officer, commented, We are pleased with the continuing growth in earned premium and with the profitability of business written by IHC Risk Solutions.  We expect continued improvement in this line of business, as evidenced by the 39% growth in our direct business written for the twelve months ended April 2015, while maintaining consistent profit margins on a growing premium base.  With respect to our fully insured operating companies, we continue to build out the direct-to-consumer distribution that is essential to our future growth as a specialty health company, and we are pleased with the growth and profitability of our ancillary lines of business.  Our financial condition and balance sheet remain strong.  We have no debt and have grown our book value to $11.48 per share at March 31, 2015 from $11.34 per share at December 31, 2014.







	Change in Accounting Principle








	AMIC was acquired in a series of transactions by Independence Holding Company (IHC) beginning in 2002 with a 19.9% equity investment and culminating in its current ownership of approximately 92%.  In March 2010, IHC increased its ownership to over 50% and, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"), IHC established a new basis for AMIC's assets and liabilities in IHC's consolidated financial statements based on the fair value of AMIC's identifiable assets and liabilities assumed at that time. AMIC did not "push down" the new basis for its assets and liabilities; instead, AMIC maintained its historical basis in its assets and liabilities for the purpose of issuing its separate standalone financial







	2










	statements. Accordingly, the reporting basis for AMIC's assets and liabilities included in the consolidated financial statements of IHC were different from the reporting basis for AMIC's assets and liabilities included in AMIC's previously reported separate standalone financial statements.  During the second quarter of 2014, due to the lifting of certain restrictions and requirements relating to IHCs ownership of AMIC stock, AMIC has elected, for all periods presented, to reflect IHC's basis.







	As a result of the above-mentioned change in accounting principle, the consolidated financial statements and financial information of AMIC reported prior to June 30, 2014 are not directly comparable to the financial statements and financial information of AMIC included in this news release.  The differences relate to the write-off of goodwill, basis differences in intangible assets and related amortization, other assets, other investments, non-controlling interests in subsidiaries, taxes and related tax provisions, net income, additional paid-in capital, retained earnings and total shareholders' equity (including a corresponding change in book value per share).  See Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in the March 31, 2015 Form 10-Q for the impact of this adoption on AMIC's condensed consolidated statements of income for the period ended March 31, 2014.  The restatement resulted in the reduction of book value per share to correspond with IHCs carrying basis in AMIC.
