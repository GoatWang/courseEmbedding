James Perse Reviews












 
DressesPants/LeggingsSkirtsTops


             Although James Perse grew up surrounded by high fashion pieces—his father owned a clothing boutique called Maxwell—it was actually the humble baseball hat that inspired him to design. After noticing a lack of elevated options on the market, he created his own luxe take on the classic cap for his family’s shop in the early ‘90s. Just three years later, a line of breezy James Perse T-shirts followed. By the time he released an equally easygoing women’s ready-to-wear collection in 1996, the namesake brand was firmly established as a mainstay for quality basics worth buying in multiples.

James Pearce

 "My hope is that you find my furniture aesthetic in form and perfect in function."James Pearce's work is inspired by the nature of the wood itself. He finds the grain, color, and the texture of a piece of wood particularly interesting and, most of the time, the wood dictates the final form in a piece of furniture. Pearce has traveled and lived all over the world and draws design influences from the countries he has visited.Finding traditional tools and methods of work the most satisfying, Pearce uses hand tools to refine the curves and shapes that are prevalent in his work. The artist does not use stain in his pieces and prefers that the natural color of the wood determine whether a piece is light or dark. He makes his own varnishes based on old recipes and uses them to highlight and protect each finished piece.James Pearce grew up working with wood, the fourth generation in his family to do so. The form, function, and style of his pieces result from personal exploration of the medium.
