Rev. Dr. David P. Murray 


M.A., Dip. Theol., D. Min

Professor of Hebrew and Old Testament

Advisory Board and Doctoral Committee Member
 

Rev. 
Dr. David P. Murray was born in Scotland in 1966. Educationally, he has achieved 
an M.A. from the University of 
Glasgow, a diploma (equivalent to an M.Div.) in theology from the
Free Church of Scotland 
College and a Doctorate of Ministry from Reformation International 
Theological Seminary. 

While raised in the church, he experienced conversion in 1989 at the age of 
twenty-three years old. He was ordained by the
Free Church of Scotland, 
but in the painful split that took place in that church, joined with the
Free Church of 
Scotland (Continuing) (FCSC). He has pastored in two congregations, the 
first in Hochcaron in Wester Ross and the last in
Stornoway in the Isle 
of Lewis. This last congregation was the largest congregation in the FCSC. 
During his latter years, he was called upon to be a lecturer and tutor (while 
holding down a pastorate) in the FCSC's own training program for its future 
ministers. His area of expertise was in Hebrew and Old Testament. 
 



In 
2004, he came in contact with Reformation International Theological 
Seminary (RITS) 
while seeking a doctorate. Through the course of his work to earn a Doctor of 
Ministry degree, he prepared a course for the purpose of teaching an Old 
Testament survey for the ministerial students of the FCSC. He also prepared the 
current course that is being used by RITS for the training of students in 
Hebrew. Upon the completion of his degree under the mentorship of
Dr. Stephen Westcott, the doctoral 
committee became quite impressed with his abililties and invited him to serve 
both as a professor of Hebrew and Old Testament for our distance learning 
students (both courses of which are his), but we also requested that he serve on 
our doctoral committee and as an advisor to RITS on the education committee. In 
these capacities he continues to serve. 

In 2007, he accepted an offer to become a professor of Old Testament at
Puritan Reformed 
Theological Seminary in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and subsequently moved to 
the United States (our gain and Scotland's loss). 

He now resides in the greater Grand Rapids area where along with his 
professorial responsibilities, he frequently fills the pulpit for area churches. 
He resides with his wife and four children (two boys, the older; and two girls 
the younger). They are  happy in the United States, though they do occasionally 
miss the friends and family who all remain in Scotland.
