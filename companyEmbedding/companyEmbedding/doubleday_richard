Richard B. Doubleday
by Kerry William Purcell
The graphic designer is a time traveler. Often unknowingly, they journey across time and space, gathering images, typefaces, and illustrations, to form new creations that exist in indistinct time we call the present. One could argue, as Eugene O’Neil famously said, that ‘there is no present or future, only the past, happening over and over again, now.’ But this would be to negate how the most perceptive of designers seek to draw connections between their contemporary subject, and the visual forms they draw on to communicate that subject in the most perspicacious manner possible. Such designers are few and far between. But one such individual is Richard B. Doubleday.
Doubleday is an Assistant Professor at the School of Art, Louisiana State University. Unlike many designers who also teach, there is no dividing line between the way he provokes and stimulates his students into solving a design problem, and his own commitment to a project. As in his classes, Doubleday attempts to approach each work of design as a spontaneous creation of form and colour. His method is eclectic, with no singular style dominating his design output. However, this flexibility is not a weakness. Rather, by avoiding a prescriptively dogmatic and narrow approach, Doubleday can be fleet-footed in his response to a visual challenge. Yet, saying this, a discernable pattern does emerge when viewing his posters in their totality. Many of his works are international in reach, with a strong focus on the Middle East,  South America and Asia. In each of these works, Doubleday appears to start with a physical object that acts as a broad signifier for a region, city or individual. These include recognisable national buildings or landmarks (churches, squares), statues (Buddha, Japanese Lucky Cat), or artistic objects (paintings, photographs or illustrations). From this baseline of imagery, layers of colour, text and illustrations are carefully positioned to achieve the most arresting formal arrangement. Beyond these works, another strand of Doubleday’s oeuvre, are works that are simply composed of type, form and colour. In these examples, the function of the poster is reduced to what A.M. Cassandre famously referred to as a  ‘visual telegram’. That is, the purpose being to communicate a simple message effectively and quickly. In this instance, Doubleday’s work becomes part of a long lineage of designers in which this approach, that of condensing everything down to its essential elements, was seen as the natural end point of all graphic design. Yet, it is clear, as already noted, that on this occasion, this technique is just another string to bow.
Our visual landscape is ever changing. Whether it is the screen that sits on our desk, in our lounge, or we hold in our hand; or the constant state of flux we experience as we travel from place to place; works of design that effortlessly make us look at the world anew, that make us pause for a moment, are a rarity. Richard B. Doubleday’s posters are such works. They make us experience anew the familiar and everyday. In a world where graphic design is too often ensnared by the glare of consumerism, the space these posters afford is one to be treasured and respected.

Nora and Theresa Flynn are 21 and 17 when they leave their Irish village for Boston. Nora is shy and serious, engaged to a man she isn’t sure she loves. Theresa is gregarious, besotted with dresses and dances. When Theresa gets pregnant, Nora devises a plan—with consequences they’re too young to understand.
Fifty years on, Nora has four grown children: John, a political consultant; Bridget, preparing to have a baby with her girlfriend; Brian, at loose ends after a failed baseball career; and Patrick, Nora’s favorite, who gives her no end of heartache. Estranged from Nora, Theresa is a nun, cloistered in Vermont.
After decades apart, a sudden death forces Nora and Theresa to confront their choices in this graceful, moving novel.
Review Quotes
“What a beautiful, beautiful book. I loved this family, recognized them, cheered them on and cried for them.”—Elin Hilderbrand
“I hope to read another novel as strong and wise and beautiful and heartbreaking…but I’m not sure I will.”—Richard Russo
“Of Catholic guilt, silences, and secrets: an expertly spun family drama…. Sullivan is a master at making a sideways glance or a revealed detail add to a larger picture.”—Kirkus Reviews
“Sullivan has a gift for capturing complicated sibling dynamics, especially in a family ruled by Catholic repression.”—Publishers Weekly

Item Description: Century Company, New York, New York, 1886. Stiff Printed Wraps. Book Condition: Very Good. First edition thus. Single issue, Small quarto, 10" tall, pages 1 to 160 + 68 ads, stiff illustrated wraps. A very good, clean, sturdy soft cover magazine with minor shelf wear, light exterior surface soiling to the cover, back strip chipping at top and bottom of spine; internal binding solid, paper clean and lightly yellowed. This is an original copy with all of the editorial material and advertisements. Note: 'The Century Magazine' was retitled from the earlier 'Scribner's Monthly' (thus the 'New Series' title statement) in 1881, with new management, under the editorship of the great Richard Watson Gilder, carrying forward its high standards for illustration and the best authors. Subject matters range from art, fiction, and poetry to history and science. As such it makes a terrific read as an anthology of its moment in time.  Bookseller Inventory # 19651
