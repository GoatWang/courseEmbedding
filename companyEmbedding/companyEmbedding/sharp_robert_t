Detailed item info
Synopsis"Right from the start I picked her for a thief, although that day she didn't take anything. . . . I knew she'd be back," the narrator/bookseller of "Severina" recalls in this novel's opening pages. Imagine a dark-haired book thief as alluring as she is dangerous. Imagine the mesmerized bookseller secretly tracking the volumes she steals, hoping for insight into her character, her motives, her love life. In Rodrigo Rey Rosa's hands, this tale of obsessive love is told with almost breathless precision and economy. The bookstore owner is soon entangled in Severina's mystery: seductive and peripatetic, of uncertain nationality, she steals books to actually read them and to share with her purported grandfather, Senor Blanco. In this unsettling exploration of the alienating and simultaneously liberating power of love, the bookseller's monotonous existence is rocked by the enigmatic Severina. As in a dream, the disoriented man finds that the thin border between rational and irrational is no longer reliable. "Severina" confirms Rey Rosa's privileged place in contemporary world literature., DVM is a collection of almost forty tales by veterinarian Robert Sharp that relate the joys and misadventures of an animal doctor in rural Ohio., For the millions of animal enthusiasts in America, here's a heartwarming collection of tales by veterinarian Robert Sharp that relate the joys and misadventures of being an animal doctor in small-town U.S.A. With humor and compassion, No Dogs in Heaven? portrays the great and not-so-great characteristics of human and animal nature, all infused by a lovable veterinarian's belief that indeed, there are dogs in heaven. Included is the telling of Sharp's first day as a rookie veterinarian nervously preparing to inject a needle into a one-ton Holstein bull; finding a rash on a cute puppy whose lovely young owner bared her breasts to ask his opinion of a similar skin ailment; treating a vicious dog whose violent owner had stabbed it with a knife, only to treat the same dog two years laternow a sweet and gentle pet of an adoptive family; and caring for a kitten struck by a car who survived amputations of both right legs, somehow learned to walk, earned the name "Lefty," and was taken in by a family who loved him. In the vein of James Herriot's compelling stories, this charming, eccentric, and comic book is sure to strike a chord with readers everywhere."Product IdentifiersISBN-100786715243ISBN-139780786715244Key DetailsAuthorRobert T.

A MUST read for any animal lover! Inspirational & funny
This is one of the best books I have read in a while. Told from the point of view of a 'big-city/small-animal' vet who takes over a 'small-town/big-animal' retiring vet's practice. The true tales in this book will have you wagging your tail. Hysterically funny, heart-touchingly tender and true, it rang home with me and work I do with horse-human relationships. From drunk hogs to to a pack of dogs all with the name Brownie, you will laugh and cry. Not for the cynical of heart. You can tell that Dr. Sharp, the author, is both a people person and an animal person. Some of God's angel's have four feet, and it seems Dr. Sharp got to meet a few. Written with awesome realness, humility, humor and plain language it should touch every heart. I'm keeping a few back up copies to hand out...In a word, this book is WONDERFUL!

A book is the nearest thing we have to telepathy, sending thoughts from the author's mind directly to the readers even over a gap of two thousand years. Even with all our technology, there is no better way to make a brain to brain connection than by simply reading a book. Go Way Back to the BeginningAntique books and manuscripts offer an amazing look into history, you can see the thoughts of the past as they saw them themselves. Antiquarian and collectible books don't just look good on the shelf, they also grow in value. There is nothing like picking up an old book to really feel the past. Explore the Human ConditionThe beauty of fiction and literature is that it lets you explore the human condition in a way that mere recitations of fact can never duplicate. Rather than focusing on the mundane, these books bring out the emotional truth of human experience. They show you who you really are by exposing you to other experiences you could never have discovered yourself. These books are the underpinnings of human culture. See how someone else sees the world. Discover the World Around YouNon fiction books offer the widest range of human experience, joined only by their commitment to the truth. From self-help to space travel, they run the gamut of human thought. Learn how to deal with your family, how to save money for that trip, or how the Egyptians built the pyramids. Follow famous lives, or study esoteric philosophies. It's all there for you to find. Non fiction gives us the foundations of human civilization, the story of how everything works. Keep Learning for LifeEducation is the gateway to success, and textbooks are your key to that door. From elementary readers to calculus texts, these books are the doors to our full potential. Textbooks not only give us facts, they give us the tools to interpret and make use of those facts. They are the key to organizing our thoughts and making our brains work for us. It's not just academia either, mechanics textbooks can help you learn how to fix your car.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsSee all in Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsBook Wholesale LotsOther Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsWholesale AudiobooksWholesale MagazinesBook AccessoriesSee all in Book AccessoriesAddress BooksBlank Diaries & JournalsBook CoversBook LightsBook PlatesBook Stands & HoldersBookendsBookmarksOther Book AccessoriesCatalogsSee all in CatalogsAgriculture CatalogsArt & Exhibitions CatalogsAuction CatalogsClothing & Fashion CatalogsDepartment Stores CatalogsMusic & Instruments CatalogsOther CatalogsOwner's Manuals CatalogsToys & Hobbies CatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksSee all in Children & Young Adult BooksChildren & YA Non-Fiction BooksChildren's Fiction BooksChildren's Picture BooksOther Children & Young Adult BooksYoung Adult Fiction BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksOther BooksTextbooks & Educational Books

Nonfiction books span the gamut of human experience, and some people have done unbelievable things. Nonfiction isn't limited to memoirs and biographies, either; it covers anything that isn't made up.Take a Step Into the PastHistory has always been a popular form of nonfiction, largely because there are so many different kinds of history. You can study everything from military history, to the history of quilting on the Canadian prairies. Anything people have ever done has a history, and in most cases you can find a nonfiction book about it. History covers everything from the broad sweep of empires to the personal stories of a single week in an individual's life. It's the story of humanity.Discover Your Inner SpiritualityEven as the world grows more and more materialistic, people find themselves turning toward nonfiction books on religion and spirituality. These books provide many people a way to find meaning in a world that is moving faster and faster every day. You can find everything from closely reasoned apologetics for the major faiths, to New Age life guides in the same place. Perhaps you'll succeed at your quest for meaning between the pages of a nonfiction book.Everyone Has to EatAll cultures have one thing in common; recipes. No matter what the culture, someone has written a cookbook, spreading cuisine around the world. You can find books on French, German, Italian, Caribbean, and just about any other form of cuisine you can imagine. In addition to cookbooks, there is also a whole world of diet books. Whether you want to lose weight, gain weight, or manage a health condition, there is a diet book to fit your needs.The Eyes Have ItArt and photography books bring the vision of the world to your very eyes. Art is fundamental to the human experience, and just one art book can show you millions of dollars' worth of old masters from around the world without the need to leave your couch. Photography books let you see the world as people like Ansel Adams and F-Stop Fitzgerald see it.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryBooksNonfiction BooksBook AccessoriesAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksCatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesTextbooks & Educational BooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsOther BooksFormatsee allHardcoverPaperbackMixed LotSubjectsee allArt & PhotographyBiography & AutobiographyBooks on CollectingHistoryMilitary & WarReligion & SpiritualitySports & RecreationTransportationPublication Yearsee all1800-18991900-19491950-19992000-20102011-NowSpecial Attributessee all1st EditionDust JacketEx-LibraryIllustratedLarge PrintSignedLanguagesee allConditionsee allBrand NewLike NewVery GoodGoodAcceptableNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...
