Top 5 Sleep Supplements of :Which Brands Think You're Stupid?



If You’re Looking for a Better sleep Support Supplement, Look No Further!




Posted on
 by Paul Grudnitsky | SleepSupportSupplements.com





See how we make our pick: According to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 35% of adults in America aren’t getting enough sleep, and sleeping less than seven hours a night is associated with serious health consequences: obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and frequent mental stress.
 
Needless to say, sleep is vital to your overall health and mental health, so any interruptions in your normal sleep schedule should be taken seriously.
 
« Skip To Our Top Reviewed Sleep Remedy »
 
“What Causes Sleep Disorders?”
 
The most common sleep disorder is insomnia, which is when you’re unable to fall asleep or remain asleep, and it’s usually the main reason people look for sleep remedies. Unfortunately, this sleep disorder is extremely common and about 50% of American adults experience it at some point in their lives.
 
There are a variety of causes, but some of the most common are:
 
Stress, Anxiety, and Depression: these are two of the most common causes of chronic insomnia. Stress, anger, worry, anxiousness, and negative thoughts can have a dramatic effect on sleep quality.
 
Stimulants: Excessive use of caffeine, such as energy drinks and coffee, is one of the most common causes of intermittent and transient insomnia. This is insomnia that occurs periodically or only for a few nights at a time.
 
Medications: Some medications can interfere with sleep, such as antidepressants, ADHD medication, corticosteroids, thyroid hormone, high blood pressure medication, some contraceptives, pain relievers that contain caffeine, diuretics, and diet pills.
 
Allergies and Respiratory Problems: Colds, sinus infections, and upper respiratory problems can make it hard to breathe at night which can cause sleeping difficulties.
 
Nocturia: Frequent urination and constantly getting up in the middle of the night to use the restroom causes sleep disturbances.
 
Chronic Pain: A variety of conditions that cause chronic pain can also disrupt sleep, such as: arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, inflammatory bowel disease, headaches, lower back pain.
 
“How are Sleep Disorders Treated”  
 
The most common problem people have is falling asleep and staying asleep. For serious sleep disorders, a doctor may advise a prescription drug to be taken nightly.
 
Selective Gamma-aminobutyric acid medications (Ambien, Lunesta, Sonata): These prescription medications target the GABA receptors in the brain. GABA is the neurotransmitter that reduces alertness and promotes relaxation.
 
Unfortunately, this medication is known to cause side effects like hallucinations, memory disturbances, and  “black-outs” wherein people report sleepwalking, sleep-eating, and even sleep-driving.
 
Benzodiazepines (Xanax, Valium, Restoril, Halcion, Ativan): Typically prescribed for anxiety, these prescription drugs activate the GABA receptors in the brain and cause sedation and relaxation. They are considered extremely addictive with very difficult withdrawal symptoms, and can cause a similar “black-out” effect with users.
 
Antihistamines (Benadryl, Advil PM, Dramamine, Unisom, Zzzquil, etc.): These over-the-counter antihistamines are a common alternative for people who don’t want to take prescription drugs. The most common side effects of antihistamines are dryness, constipation, upset stomach, and feeling groggy the next day.
 
​WARNING
​Recently, these common antihistamine sleep aids have been associated with an increased risk of dementia and various forms of MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment).1 These sleep aids all have several things in common:•  They’re unnatural, pharmaceutical drugs•  They’re expensive•  They all come with serious side-effects
So the real question is:
 
“Are There Any NATURAL Sleep Remedies that Actually Work?”
 
With any condition, there will inevitably be a line of natural remedies created to help alleviate symptoms and build a path towards remission and health. Judging by the number of customers these companies have year after year, the volume of verified testimonials, and the support some of their ingredients have from the medical community, they must be doing something right.
 
These natural remedies are often used in order to avoid the cost, inconvenience, and side effects of prescription drugs and invasive treatments. Among so many choices, we have to ask:
 
“How Do You Separate The Good Products From The Junk?”
 
We have a passion for natural health and many of us have suffered from insomnia and sleep issues ourselves. That’s why we went out and compared some of the top natural neuropathy remedies to see which ones really worked and which ones we can throw in the garbage.
 
Here’s What We Looked for in a Product:
 
With years of experience, our research team dove into stacks of medical journals and consumer reports and studied exactly how certain vitamins and herbs can promote relaxation and deep, restful sleep. We narrowed the list to 4 ESSENTIAL ingredients that no effective sleep remedy would be without:
 
​Melatonin▼  Click To Read  ▼This is a ‘no-brianer’ for any sleep formula. Melatonin is the hormone made by your pineal gland that controls your sleep and wake cycles. Light affects melatonin production, and your body will naturally release more melatonin at night, which is why indoor lighting, TVs, and your cell-phone’s brightness can disrupt sleep. Melatonin causes drowsiness, lowers body temperature, and puts the body into sleep mode.Magnesium▼  Click To Read  ▼This is one of the most vital minerals when it comes to relaxation, sleep, and mental health. A magnesium deficiency can cause anxiety, sleep disorders, irritability, and abnormal heart rhythms. The relaxing, sleep-boosting properties of magnesium are well known. One study shows that magnesium improved subjective measures of insomnia, sleep efficiency, sleep time and sleep onset. Theanine▼  Click To Read  ▼This amino acid promotes a sense of calm and has many observable anti-anxiety properties, and this happens quickly, usually within 20minutes. By reducing anxiety and stress, theanine helps ‘quiet’ the mind before sleep. Studies note that theanine improved overall sleep quality.2 5 Essential Herbs▼  Click To Read  ▼Valerian Root: Valerian Root helps increase the amount of the neurotransmitter GABA in the brain, which brings about relaxation and calm. Drugs like Xanax and Valium increase GABA synthetically, but Valerian is all natural and safe. In one study, 44% reported perfect sleep and 89% reported improved sleep with Valerian Root.3 Passionflower: Passionflower is actually listed as a tranquilizing herb in Germany and its calming, sleep inducing effects have been known for a long time. It has a similar effect on anxiousness, too, so in combination with Valerian Root, it’s a perfect way to slip into deep, restful sleep. Several studies show it’s an effective remedy against anxiety.4,5 Lemon Balm: Lemon Balm is well studied. It encourages deeper and more restful sleep, as shown in a German sleep study. Additionally, it’s an excellent antioxidant for the liver, a brain booster that helps improve memory, and mood booster as well!6,7 Hops: It’s not just for beer. Studies show that those who drank non-alcoholic beer with hops actually had improved sleep quality and reduced levels of anxiety. Hops have a lot in common with Valerian Root as far as its relaxing, calm-promoting effects, which makes the two a perfect combination.8,9 Chamomile: Chamomile is a sleep remedy as old as time. It’s most commonly consumed in the form of tea, and its health benefits are incredible: it’s an anti-inflammatory, helps with digestive issues, helps with skin irritation, helps get rid of sore throat, and of course, is an excellent sleep remedy.10 Liquid Delivery Method▼  Click To Read  ▼We gave a heavy favoritism to liquid extracts, and it wasn’t for no good reason. Studies show the body uses 98% of the liquid extract compared to only about 39-53% of a capsule or tablet, meaning the remainder of those ingredients and the money spent on them are just flushed down the toilet. Furthermore, capsules have to travel through the stomach and liver before their ingredients are even available to the body, while 87% of the liquid extract is absorbed in the first 20-30 seconds.11,12
 
What We Looked For In A Brand:
 
​Strength of Money-Back Guarantee: A money-back guarantee shows the manufacturer is so confident in the product that they’re willing to put their money where their mouth is. There’s simply no reason to trust a product that doesn’t offer a money-back-guarantee. 24 Hour Customer Support: A 24-hour customer-support service shows a manufacturer’s commitment to their customers, because 24-hour support isn’t cheap. With any remedy, you’re likely to have questions, and those questions can arise at any time of the day or night; 24-hour customer service offers a peace-of-mind knowing the answers are only a phone call away.
 
What We Discovered:  
 
There are tons and tons of sleep formulas out there, and unfortunately, most seem to be merely copy-cats of other sleep formulas, as if they’re all buying the same product from one pill manufacturer and slapping on a different label and price.
 
However, some formulas did attempt to separate themselves from their competition. And for us, there was a clear winner:

This report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of Section
27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company's actual results could differ
materially from those set forth on the forward looking statements as a result of
the risks set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
general economic conditions, and changes in the assumptions used in making such
forward looking statements.
Unless indicated otherwise, or the context otherwise requires, references in
this report to "Sleepaid Holdings," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" or
similar terms are to Sleepaid Holding Co..
Overview
Our principle line of business is developing, producing and selling our
mattress, pillow, and bedding products. In the three months ended March 31,
2017, the retail industry in China had not yet recovered and competition was
furious. Traditional retail share has been eaten by E-commerce platform trading
and O2O business. We are continuous in restructuring and modifying our business
by rearrangement of our marketing resources to our brand and widen our products
range and sourcing for new health enhancement products, and also involving more
trading via the E-Commerce channel.
Adapting to the current market situation, our company changed the sales
strategy, doing more promotion and kicked started to our O2O marketing channel,
so that we can still control the decline of our sales volume. In the three
months ended March 31, 2017, our total revenue was $580,387. Of this total
revenue, the revenue generated by our self-managed store was $377,370, the
revenue generated by the franchised stores totaled $4,291, and the revenue
generated by direct sales was totaled $198,726. Our revenues by brand for the
three months ended March 31, 2017 were as follows: Revenue of SleepAid was
$198,950, and BEMCO was $381,437.
Net Revenue
In the three months ended March 31, 2017, our revenue was $580,387, compared to
$632,572 the same period in 2016. In three months ended, the revenue decreased
by 8.25% from the same period in 2016. The revenue generated by our self-managed
store was $377,370, by the franchised stores was $$4,291, and by direct sales
was totaled $198,726. Our revenues by brand for the three months ended March 31,
2017 were as follows: Revenue of SleepAid was $198,950, and BEMCO was $381,437.
Cost of Sales
In the three months ended March 31, 2017, the cost was $451,024 compared to the
same period in 2016 decreased 3.11% from $465,482. The change of cost of sales
reflects a decrease rate much lesser than that of the decrease rate in revenue.
This was caused by the continuous slowed down of retail business in China, and
resulted that the profit margin was reduced to maintain the sales volume.
Selling expense
In the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the selling expense was
$89,525 and $59,190 respectively. The increase of 51.25% which was resulted of
the management increased in spending on using various trade platform and
promotion activities to stimulate the sales volume.
General and administrative expense
General and administrative expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was
$181,620 compared to the same period in 2016 increased 2.63% from $176,965, the
increase was attributed to the increase in consultancy fee and business
development and general increase of expenses on general inflation.
Income Tax
During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the company incurred no
tax and its subsidiary has paid $Nil and $Nil tax respectively as a foreign
corporation.

Net Income


The Company recorded a net loss of $141,657 for the three months ended March 31,
2017 compared to the net loss of $69,272 for the same period in 2016. The net
income decreased $72,385 or by 104.49%. The cause of expanded losses was due to
the increase in Selling and G&A expenses, as well as the result of lowered
profit margin due to poor retail market in bedding products.
Interest expenses
In the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the interest expenses was
$Nil and $Nil respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company's liquidity and capital is dependent on the company continuing to
increase its revenues and the capital it can raise to continue the Company's
development and expansion of its product lines. The Company estimates that its
current and available capital resources are sufficient to fund its planned
operations through the second quarter of 2017.
The operation had been financed by the current beneficiary shareholders through
not only the injection of capital, but also by loans to the Company. The loans
are unsecured, non-interest bearing and repayable at demand. Going forward, the
current beneficiary shareholders will continue to finance the company's
operations by various means, including additional capital injection or
conversion of debts to stock and we also plan to secure additional financing
through private placements of equity and short-term borrowings from banks.
Working capital
As at December 31, 2016, the company had negative working capital of ($103,325)
with current assets of $1,715,916 and current liabilities of $1,819,241. The
current assets consisted cash and cash equivalents of $86,101, short-term
investment of $14,377, inventory of $707,087, trade receivables of $768,913,
advance to supplies of $79,921, and other receivables of $59,517. The current
liabilities of the Company at December 31, 2016 are composed of loans from
related parties of $761,101, accounts payable of $725,976, advances from
customers of $54,112, accrued expenses of $75,515, income tax payable of
$24,901, and other payable of $177,636.
At March 31, 2017, the Company had negative working capital of ($242,788) with
current assets of $1,566,118 and current liabilities of $1,808,906. The current
assets consisted cash and cash equivalents of $129,336, inventory of $872,202,
trade receivables of $240,134, advance to supplies of $271,023, and other
receivables of $53,423. The current liabilities of the Company as at March 31,
2017 were composed of accounts payable of $610,403, accrued expenses of $82,451,
loans from related parties of $795,484, advances from customer of $82,807, tax
payable of $10,807, and other payable of $226,954.
Our business generates revenue in the currency of the PRC, Renminbi ("RMB"). RMB
is still not a freely exchangeable currency. Since 1998, the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange of China has promulgated a series of
circulars and rules in order to enhance verification of foreign exchange
payments under a Chinese entity's current account items, and has imposed strict
requirements on borrowing and repayments of foreign exchange debts from and to
foreign creditors under the capital account items and on the creation of foreign
security in favor of foreign creditors.
This may complicate foreign exchange payments to foreign creditors under the
current account items and thus may affect the ability to borrow under
international commercial loans, the creation of foreign security, and the
borrowing of RMB under guarantees in foreign currencies. Moreover, the value of
RMB may become subject to supply and demand, which could be largely impacted by
international economic and political environments. Any fluctuations in the
exchange rate of RMB could have an adverse effect on the operational and
financial condition of the Company and its subsidiaries in China.
In an effort to eliminate concerns over the ability to transfer cash between
entities, cross border and to U.S. investor, Guangzhou Sleepaid Household
Suppliers Co., Ltd. ("Sleepaid Household"), our subsidiary and parent company to
Yuewin Trading. ("Yuewin"), is incorporated in China as a wholly-owned foreign
enterprise ("WOFE"). Because of such WOFE status, and profit (after tax)
distribution received by Guangzhou Smartfame from Yuewin can be freely
transferred back to YIL in Hong Kong Dollars, which is not subject and
restriction on its conversion into any foreign currency.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations
As at March 31, 2017, our material off-balance sheet arrangements are operating
lease obligations. We excluded these items from the balance sheet in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America
("GAAP"). Operating lease commitments consist principally of leases for our
office and warehouse. These leases frequently include options which permit us to
extend the terms beyond the initial fixed lease term. With respect to most of
those leases, we intend to renegotiate those leases as they expire.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Sleep: Consumers are looking for natural alternatives, but what's holding the category back? 
By Stephen Daniells+Stephen Daniells 30-Jan-20152015-01-30T00:00:00ZLast updated on 31-Jan-2015 at 03:37 GMT2015-01-31T03:37:44Z



 The Institute of Medicine estimates that between 50 and 70 million American adults suffer from sleep or wakefulness disorder.

The overall sleep aid category is growing at an eye-watering 27% and is expected to hit $732 million in 2018, but natural products and dietary supplements only occupy a small portion of the market. NutraIngredients-USA explores the challenges and opportunities for the sector.
 


 
Researcher Dr Michael Grandner
 from the University of Pennsylvania knows sleep better than many, having spent his academic career studying it. “Sleep is involved in a very large number of physiological processes,” he told attendees at the CRN’s Day of Science in November. “Sleep is critical for healing and recovery. The less sleep you get, the more impaired you are. And the deficits are cumulative.”“Awareness of the importance of sleep is growing, and the motivation to get better sleep is growing,” he added.Data from the Datamonitor Consumer 2014 survey found that “insomnia” was tied for the fourth most prominent health issue of American consumers ranked by percentage, coming in behind stress, tiredness and fatigue (which itself is related to sleep), and allergy.“Across all age groups, 34% of American women say they are concerned about insomnia now, versus just 26% of men,” said Tom Vierhile, Innovation Insights Director for Datamonitor Consumer. “By age group, middle-age women are the most worried about insomnia.”‘The majority of the consumers for these products are in CVS and Walgreens’Daniel Wallace, CEO of NutraClick, told us that his company saw potential in the sleep category in late 2010, and its second major product launch was positioned for that category.  


The company’s Somnapure Natural Sleep Aid product now commands the largest store retail footprint of any of its other products. The product is formulated with a combination of ingredients, including valerian root, L-theanine, hops, chamomile, melatonin, lemon balm extract, and passion flower extract.“Somnapure launched really well in GNC,” he said,” but the majority of the consumers for these products are in CVS and Walgreens.”“The problem with the category is that it is really diversified in terms of the user base,” said Wallace. “The number and type of people who want to find solutions is really varied.”But such a diverse consumer base does have advantages. “As we spin out to other retailers it doesn’t hurt existing ones,” said Wallace. Somnapure is now available in retailers such as Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, GNC, Harris Teeter, and Meijer.The market



 
 

"Increasingly hectic work and school schedules, overstimulation via portable electronics and their networks, and the popularity of energy-boosting drinks and tonics, all serve to get people up earlier and keep them up later in modern US society," says Euromonitor

Natural sleep aids experienced a few years of good growth, until P&G’s ZzzQuil launched in 2012 to become a $134 million brand almost overnight. P&G quickly took over the category lead with a 22% share of value sales, according to Euromonitor International.“P&G came in with Zzzquil and took the majority of the market share,” observed Wallace. “Natural products have to compete with large CPG and pharma.”Of the current $602.4 million market for calming and sleep aids, about 25% ($151 million) comes from branded calming and sleeping products containing analgesics, including Tylenol PM, Advil PM, Excedrin PM and most recently Aleve PM, explained Mark Strobel, Consumer Health Analyst with Euromonitor.Other branded standard sleep aids, including ZzzQuil, most Unisom products, Simply Sleep, drive the majority of sales in the category, with approximately US$232 million, while private label accounts for another US$168 million.By far the smallest portion of sales comes from herbal/traditional calming and sleeping products, said Strobel, accounting for $52 million in 2014.“Herbal/traditional calming and sleeping aids and supplements containing melatonin have actually posted declines in both 2013 and 2014,” he said. “While natural and herbal calming and sleeping remedies continue to grow in popularity among certain consumers and are perceived by some as safer with fewer side effects relative to other standard sleep aids with pharmaceutical ingredients, these herbal/traditional sleep aids suffered -20% declines in retail value sales between 2012 and 2014. “The rise of new, standard products like P&G’s ZzzQuil and the return of brands like Johnson & Johnson’s Simply Sleep and Novartis’s Excedrin PM have been too much to overcome. However, as the growth of standard products, like ZzzQuil, begin to plateau, more consumers may turn back to natural products that they perceive to be less addictive and have fewer side effects like residual drowsiness and grogginess.”

‘There are a lot of products on the market but it’s difficult to recommend many of them’And if natural products are to get back to 2012 levels or more (see chart above), then the industry and academia must “demonstrate that some of these things work”, said Dr Grandner.“There are a lot of products on the market [in the supplement space] but it’s difficult to recommend many of them,” he said during his presentation at the CRN event.The elephant in the room for sleep ingredients is melatonin. “Most people have heard of it but don’t really know what it does,” said Dr Grandner. “It’s a hormone that the brain uses to tell your body that it is night. Light affects it.”Numerous dietary supplement products can be found in retailers across the country, with many giving the direction to take 30 minutes before bedtime. Such directions are wrong, according to Dr Grandner. “The ideal time to take melatonin is 9-11 hours before your peak sleep,” he said. “It’s not a sedative.”ValerianAnother key player in this sector is valerian
 (Valeriana officinalis), an herb that contains gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter, and may also increase GABA release.“Valerian contains GABA,” said Dr Grandner, “but it doesn’t cross the blood-brain barrier. However, valerian has been evaluated in a lot of studies.”Indeed, a 2010 meta-analysis of 18 randomized clinical trials involving valerian’s potential sleep benefits (Sleep Medicine
, Vol. 11, pp. 505-511) concluded that, “the qualitative dichotomic results suggest that Valerian would be effective for subjective improvement of insomnia, although its effectiveness has not been demonstrated with quantitative or objective measurements. Nevertheless, its use can be considered for some patients given its safety.”Other ingredients with varying degrees of support include tryptophan, chamomile (“There is a glaring absence of clinical trial data in humans,” said Dr Grandner), hops (“They do have active sedative properties”), tart cherries, vitamin C (lower levels associated with shorter & more disturbed sleep, he noted), magnesium, potassium, sodium, and selenium (lower levels associated with less sleep), and iron (linked to restless leg syndrome).“It’s a time of great opportunity for natural products in the sleep category,” said Dr Grandner. “And there is a tremendous opportunity to leverage science to move beyond old wives’ tales.”
