Dr. Francis Schaeffer - A Christian Manifesto (DVD)
That Swiss Hermit Strikes Again!
Dr. Schaeffer, who was one of the most influential Christian thinkers in the twentieth century, shows that secular humanism has displaced the Judeo-Christian consensus that once defined our nation’s moral boundaries. Law, education, and medicine have all been reshaped for the worse as a consequence. America’s dominant worldview changed, Schaeffer charges, when Christians weren’t looking.
Schaeffer lists two reasons for evangelical indifference: a false concept of spirituality and fear. He calls on believers to stand against the tyranny and moral chaos that come when humanism reigns-and warns that believers may, at some point, be forced to make the hard choice between obeying God or Caesar. A Christian Manifesto is a thought-provoking and bracing Christian analysis of American culture and the obligation Christians have to engage the culture with the claims of Christ.

The Silent Scream (DVD) Eight Languages
“When the lives of the unborn are snuffed out, they often feel pain, pain that is long and agonizing.” – President Ronald Reagan to National Religious Broadcasters Convention, January 1981
Ronald Reagan became convinced of this as a result of watching The Silent Scream – a movie he considered so powerful and convicting that he screened it at the White House.
The modern technology of real-time ultrasound now reveals the actual responses of a 12-week old fetus to being aborted. As the unborn child attempts to escape the abortionist’s suction curette, her motions can be seen to become desperately agitated and her heart rate doubles.  Her mouth opens – as if to scream – but no sound can come out. Her scream doesn’t have to remain silent, however … not if you will become her voice. This newly re-mastered version features eight language tracks and two bonus videos.
“… a high technology “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” arousing public opinion just as Harriet Beecher Stowe’s 1852 antislavery novel ignited the abolitionist movement.” – Sen. Gordon Humphrey, Time Magazine
Languages: English, Spanish, French, South Korean, Chinese,   Russian, Portuguese, Japanese

Amazing Grace: The History and Theology of Calvinism (DVD)
Download the Free Study Guide!
Just what is Calvinism?
Does this teaching make man a deterministic robot and God the author of sin? What about free will? If the church accepts Calvinism, won’t evangelism be stifled, perhaps even extinguished? How can we balance God’s sovereignty and man’s responsibility? What are the differences between historic Calvinism and hyper-Calvinism? Why did men like Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Spurgeon, Whitefield, Edwards and a host of renowned Protestant evangelists embrace the teaching of predestination and election and deny free will theology?
This is the first video documentary that answers these and other related questions. Hosted by Eric Holmberg, this fascinating three-part, four-hour presentation is detailed enough so as to not gloss over the controversy. At the same time, it is broken up into ten “Sunday-school-sized” sections to make the rich content manageable and accessible for the average viewer.

The Four Keys to the Millennium (Book)
Foundations in Biblical Eschatology
By Jay Rogers, Larry Waugh, Rodney Stortz, Joseph Meiring. High quality paperback, 167 pages.
All Christians believe that their great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, will one day return. Although we cannot know the exact time of His return, what exactly did Jesus mean when he spoke of the signs of His coming (Mat. 24)? How are we to interpret the prophecies in Isaiah regarding the time when “the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD as the waters cover the sea” (Isa. 11:19)? Should we expect a time of great tribulation and apostasy or revival and reformation before the Lord returns? Is the devil bound now, and are the saints reigning with Christ? Did you know that there are four hermeneutical approaches to the book of Daniel and Revelation? 
These and many more questions are dealt with by four authors as they present the four views on the millennium. Each view is then critiqued by the other three authors.

KNOXVILLE, Tenn., Oct. 31, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- TeamHealth Holdings, Inc. ("TeamHealth" or the "Company") (NYSE:   TMH), a leading physician services organization, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by funds affiliated with Blackstone, a leading global asset manager, and certain co-investors in a transaction valued at approximately $6.1 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, which has been unanimously approved by TeamHealth's Board of Directors, Blackstone and its co-investors will acquire all of the outstanding shares of TeamHealth common stock for $43.50 per share in cash. This represents a premium of approximately 33 percent over TeamHealth's closing share price on October 3, 2016, the last trading day prior to news reports that TeamHealth was considering a possible sale of the Company. JANA Partners LLC ("JANA") has entered into a voting agreement pursuant to which JANA has agreed to vote its beneficially owned shares, totaling approximately 8 percent of the outstanding shares of TeamHealth common stock, in favor of the transaction.








"We are pleased to reach this agreement with Blackstone, which maximizes value for all TeamHealth stockholders," said Leif Murphy, President and Chief Executive Officer of TeamHealth. "We remain committed to delivering the highest quality patient care and supporting our affiliated clinicians, hospital and post-acute partners. Blackstone is focused on working closely with TeamHealth to achieve our strategic objectives and drive innovation and operational excellence in the context of the evolving U.S. healthcare marketplace. We continue to believe that TeamHealth is uniquely positioned to leverage our national scale and functional expertise to drive high quality patient care, operational efficiencies and physician satisfaction in hospital-based and post-acute settings."  
Neil Simpkins, a Senior Managing Director at Blackstone, commented, "We are thrilled to have the opportunity to invest in TeamHealth and once again partner with such an experienced management team and high quality business. We look forward to supporting TeamHealth during the next phase of its development." 
Bruce McEvoy, a Senior Managing Director at Blackstone, added, "TeamHealth has built an industry leading physician services platform that is ideally positioned to enable its hospital partners and clinicians to navigate the evolving healthcare landscape while providing outstanding service to its patients. We are excited to help the Company continue its long track record of organic and acquisition driven growth."
"Blackstone is one of the world's leading investment firms and will be a tremendous capital partner to help accelerate TeamHealth's growth priorities and fund our long-term initiatives as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities," said Lynn Massingale, MD, co-founder and Executive Chairman of TeamHealth. "As a prior owner of TeamHealth, Blackstone knows TeamHealth and the U.S. healthcare industry well and will work with us to create value for all our stakeholders over the long-term. We are very proud of our team and believe this investment is a testament to the underlying strength of the organization and the thousands of skilled and dedicated clinicians who choose to be part of TeamHealth."
TeamHealth's Board of Directors recommends that stockholders approve the agreement. TeamHealth expects to hold a Special Meeting of Stockholders to consider and vote on the proposed merger and merger agreement as soon as practicable after the mailing of the proxy statement to stockholders.
The merger agreement includes a "go-shop" period, during which TeamHealth and its Board of Directors may actively solicit, receive, evaluate and potentially enter negotiations with parties that offer alternative proposals during a 40-day period following the execution date of the definitive agreement. There can be no assurance this process will result in a superior proposal. TeamHealth does not intend to disclose developments about this process unless and until its Board of Directors has made a decision with respect to any potential superior proposal. 
The transaction, which is subject to the receipt of TeamHealth stockholder approval, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017. The transaction has fully committed financing and is not subject to any condition with regard to financing. Following completion of the transaction, TeamHealth will become a privately held company, wholly owned by funds affiliated with Blackstone, and will no longer be traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
Goldman, Sachs & Co. is acting as lead financial advisor and Citi is acting as co-financial advisor to TeamHealth. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP is acting as TeamHealth's legal counsel. BofA Merrill Lynch is acting as advisor to Blackstone on the transaction. Kirkland & Ellis LLP and Ropes & Gray LLP are acting as Blackstone's legal counsel.
Quarterly Results Announcement
TeamHealth noted that, with the proposed transaction, it will not host a conference call to discuss financial results for the third quarter of 2016. The Company expects to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 on or before November 7, 2016.

Voicemails to the office mgr are never returned. Expect 1-2 hour wait times once you get seated in the exam room. Expect to be over charged and fight for your refund. Front office staff is rude. Yolanta is awesome. Sheila was terrible my 2nd visit. Its nearly impossible to get an appt w the Dr. I did talk to Dr. Skeete on the phone once & she was nice & takes a laid back approach to care which I appreciate. I had heard through other patients that she encourages natural minded moms to birth outside the hospital with a birth center or unaffiliated midwife. I was leaning that way anyway so decided I would switch to a birth center & ask Dr. Skeete to be the backup physician in case my circumstances/ risk factors changed & disqualified me from an out of hospital birth. I was very disappointed when she said no. It took months to get my medical records. I do not plan to see anyone in the office again as I will switch to a provider who values my business and time.Moselle, Herbert I, MDsteveproper ratedThe staff at Dr. Moselle's off...The staff at Dr. Moselle's office act as if they are all best friends, and when I go to the office, I automatically feel like part of the family. They are profficient and professional,but they act like they really enjoy their friendship and jobs. Also, Heather is the one who saw me and I could feel comfortable because she listened and answered all my concerns. My hearing in my left ear still has not returned but she already told me on my first appointment, what we would do on my follow-up appt. on Monday, if it doesn't return to normal. I look forward to returning, which I don't usually do for most Dr's. offices.Nara, Sreenivas, MDAdeline F. ratedDr Nara took care of my Mom the last days before her passing at St Catholic Hospital.

These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.

KNOXVILLE, Tenn., Jan. 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Team Health Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") (NYSE:    TMH) today announced that Tennessee Merger Sub, Inc. ("Merger Sub"), an affiliate of The Blackstone Group L.P. (the "Sponsor"), formed in connection with the previously announced proposed acquisition of the Company by certain investment funds affiliated with the Sponsor pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 30, 2016 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among the Company, Tennessee Parent, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Merger Sub (the "Merger"), intends to offer $1,015 million in aggregate principal amount of its Senior Notes due 2025 (the "Notes"), subject to market and other conditions. Merger Sub intends to use the proceeds from the offering of the Notes to finance a portion of the cash consideration for the Merger. Upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation. 








Unless the Merger and certain related transactions are consummated simultaneously with the offering of the Notes, Merger Sub will deposit (or cause to be deposited) the gross proceeds of the offering of the Notes into a segregated escrow account until the date that certain escrow release conditions, including the consummation of the Merger, have been satisfied. The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of Merger Sub. Upon the release of the proceeds from escrow, the Company will assume the obligations under the Notes and the Notes will initially be guaranteed by certain of the Company's subsidiaries on a senior unsecured basis.
The Notes and the related guarantees will be offered to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes and the related guarantees have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state or other jurisdiction's securities laws. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements under the Securities Act and any applicable state or other jurisdiction's securities laws.
This press release is being issued pursuant to Rule 135c under the Securities Act, and is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities and shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a sale of any securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful.

NORTH BILLERICA, Mass. & CHALFONT ST GILES, United Kingdom--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Lantheus 
      Medical Imaging, Inc. (“LMI”), a subsidiary of Lantheus 
      Holdings, Inc. (“Lantheus”) (NASDAQ: LNTH), and GE 
      Healthcare (NYSE:GE), today announced the signing of a term sheet 
      relating to the continued Phase III development and worldwide 
      commercialization of flurpiridaz F 18, an investigational positron 
      emission tomography (PET) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) agent that 
      may improve the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD).
    


      Under the proposed transaction, GE Healthcare would fund the second 
      Phase III flurpiridaz F 18 clinical study, worldwide regulatory 
      approvals and its worldwide launch and commercialization, with LMI 
      collaborating in both development and commercialization through a joint 
      steering committee. LMI would also maintain the option to co-promote the 
      agent in the U.S. GE Healthcare’s development plan would focus on 
      obtaining regulatory approval in the U.S., Japan, Europe and Canada.
    

      Mary Anne Heino, President and CEO of Lantheus commented, “We are 
      excited about the prospect of GE Healthcare being our global partner to 
      complete the development of flurpiridaz F 18 and bring this next 
      generation agent to market, as they touch every level of the PET 
      diagnostic delivery continuum and share our commitment to serving the 
      nuclear medicine community. The collaboration would enable us to 
      participate in the long-term economic success of flurpiridaz F 18. LMI 
      will also continue to advance our other pipeline assets and pursue 
      additional near-term business development opportunities to drive growth.”
    

      Emmanuel Ligner, General Manager, Core Imaging, GE Healthcare, said: 
      “Pursuing this agreement with LMI will further strengthen our nuclear 
      medicine portfolio and demonstrates our commitment to cardiovascular PET 
      imaging. It is a key focus of our strategy to increase the number of 
      tools at the disposal of clinicians around the world diagnosing and 
      treating patients with cardiovascular disease.”
    

      Under the proposed transaction, LMI would receive a USD 5 million 
      upfront cash payment and, if successful, up to USD 60 million in 
      regulatory and sales milestones payments, plus tiered double-digit 
      royalties on U.S. sales and mid-single-digit royalties on sales outside 
      of the U.S. LMI also would receive an option to co-promote in the U.S. 
      Subject to satisfactory due diligence and necessary approvals, the 
      parties anticipate entering into a definitive agreement for the proposed 
      transaction in the second quarter of 2017. However, there is no 
      assurance that the parties will enter into a definitive agreement on 
      these terms or at all.
    

About Flurpiridaz F 18 and Coronary Artery DiseaseFlurpiridaz 
      F 18, a fluorine 18-labeled agent that binds to mitochondrial complex 1 
      (MC-1)1, was designed to be a novel PET imaging agent that 
      may better evaluate patients with known or suspected CAD, which is the 
      most common form of heart disease2, affecting an estimated 
      15.5 million Americans 20 years of age or older3. CAD is the 
      leading cause of death in the United States for both men and women2. 
      Each year more than 400,000 Americans die from CAD2. In the 
      first phase 3 study, flurpiridaz F 18 demonstrated improved CAD 
      detection and reduced radiation exposure over standard single photon 
      emission computed tomography (SPECT). In subgroup analyses, the 
      risk-benefit profile of flurpiridaz F 18 PET imaging appeared to be 
      favorable in women, obese patients and patients with multi-vessel 
      disease. It is important to note that, with a 110 minute half-life, 
      flurpiridaz F 18 can be used in conjunction with treadmill exercise, 
      which is not feasible with other currently available PET tracers for MPI.
    

About PET and MPIPET imaging or a PET scan is a type of 
      nuclear medicine imaging procedure4 that provides information 
      about the function and metabolism of the body’s organs, unlike computed 
      tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which primarily 
      show anatomy and structure5. MPI is a non-invasive test that 
      utilizes a small amount of radioactive material (radiopharmaceutical) 
      injected into the body to depict the distribution of blood flow to the 
      heart. MPI is used to identify areas of reduced blood flow to the heart 
      muscle. The test is typically conducted under both rest and stress 
      conditions, after which physicians examine and compare the two scans and 
      predict whether the patient has significant coronary artery disease6. 
      Although SPECT is most commonly used for MPI7, PET imaging 
      has gained considerable support and use in the field of cardiovascular 
      imaging, as it offers many advantages to SPECT, including higher spatial 
      and contrast resolution, resulting in higher image quality and improved 
      diagnostic accuracy, accurate attenuation correction and risk 
      stratification8.
