Donald Allen Williams, 82, of Vinton, went to his heavenly home Saturday morning, September 26, 2015, at home surrounded by his family. Don was preceded in death by his parents, Allen and Annie Williams; and his stepfather, Norman Dooley; and an infant daughter, Dana Marie Williams. The owner of Don Williams Drafting for 42 years, he was one of the few local draftsmen who still drew house plans by hand and was known as THE LEGEND by friends and colleagues across the region.Don was proud to call himself a family man! He was an adoring husband to Carolyn Williams; a patient and loving father and grandfather; and a loyal friend to many. He loved working in his garden, riding his tractor, and tinkering with his old trucks. One of Don's hobbies was cooking; he was at home in the kitchen and often cooked and baked quantities large enough to share with his many Vinton friends. He looked forward to fall and to making Chow-Chow which he gifted to friends and family every year.He served his community in many ways. A charter member of the Vinton Relay for Life Committee, along with his wife Carolyn, he co-chaired Vinton Relay for three years. He also chaired the Luminaries Committee and each year assembled thousands of luminaries to light the track for the relay. Because of Relay for Life, Don was also a member of the American Cancer Society Leadership Council and was honored to be be Honorary Parade Marshall for the Vinton Dogwood Festival.Assisting his wife with publicity for the Miss Virginia Pageant, he was a familiar face at the events and loved knowing many former Miss Virginias, two Miss Americas, and loved the entire the Miss Virginia Family.He lives on in the heart of his wife, Carolyn, and all of those touched by his life. Missing him already are his children, Timmy, Sherry (and daughter-in-law, Susie), and Kim (and daughter-in-law, Julie); along with precious granddaughter, Skylar Grace, who adored her 'DD'; and his sisters, Ruby Jean Nichols and Carolyn Lee Turner; and his many nieces and nephews.Don loved his hometown of Vinton and Vinton loved him.Funeral services will be conducted at Vinton Baptist Church 3 p.m. Tuesday, September 29, 2015, with Dr. Bill Booth officiating. Visitation will be held at Oakey's Vinton Chapel 6 to 9 p.m. Monday, September 28, 2015. The family requests that if you have a special photo of Don please bring a copy to share on the memory board during visitation. Burial will follow at Mountain View Cemetery following the service. Arrangements by Oakey's Vinton Chapel.

Donald Allen Williams, the youngest of nine, was born July 6, 1968 in Atlanta, Georgia to Moses Williams and the late Minnie Lee Williams. In addition to his mother, he was preceded in death by his mother, Minnie Lee Williams, and two brothers, Eddie and Alphonso Williams. He was united in Holy Matrimony to Carol Fortson-Williams on February 14, 2012.
Donald accepted Christ at an early age. His first church was Shady Grove Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia, where he was a faithful member of the youth group and attended Sunday school regularly. He attended West Fulton High School in Atlanta and was a proud member of the Class of 1986. Upon relocating to Columbia, Donald was an active member of Word of God Church and Ministries, where he served on the audio video ministry.
He loved his family and friends, and especially enjoyed family gatherings. Don uplifted many people with his kind words, sense of humor and gentle spirit. He was truly a man of God. He was the owner and operator of Clean As New Carpet Care, LLC, and was a master barber for over 20 years. Donald was very creative and ahead of his time. His many talents will be missed, especially his great haircuts.
Our Heavenly Father sent his angels for his faithful servant, Donald, on Tuesday, July 19, 2016. Left to cherish his memories are: his devoted wife, Carol Fortson-Williams; his father, Moses Williams; six children: Chantel Harris, DeAllen Williams, De’Andrea Staudamire, JeMonica Staudamire, Khadija Williams and Lauren Williams; his grandchildren; Aliyah Hernandez, Cameron and Skylar Reniya-Nicole Williams; his siblings: Annie Reed, Minnie Curry, Alvin Williams, Charlene (Herman) Williams, Joyce Williams and Towanda (Michael) Little; and a host of nieces, nephews and friends.

How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Florida:













Does Williams, Donald Allen carry a valid contracting license?



If you pay someone to construct a building or a structure, make structural alterations to load bearing walls, or perform services such as plumbing or air conditioning work, that person must have a state contractor's license.
Williams, Donald Allen currently holds license AR95116 (Architect), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Florida?



The Florida Construction Industry License Board maintains high standards for contractor licensing. Prior to receiving their license, Florida contractors are required to prove four years of relevant work experience or education; pass a board examination and prove financial solvency.











Your liability risk when hiring Williams, Donald Allen



In Florida, licensed contractors with employees are required to carry workers' compensation insurance and attest they have obtained public liability and property damage insurance in the amounts determined by the Board.











Financial recourse when hiring Williams, Donald Allen



Florida maintains a recovery fund, called the Florida Homeowners' Construction Recovery Fund, which is available to a natural person who has suffered monetary damages by the financial mismanagement or misconduct of a contractor, and who has exhausted all other sources of payment. The Board makes the determination of eligibility for an award. Florida contractors are not required to carry an active bond.











What else should I know before hiring Williams, Donald Allen



As of 2007, the Florida DBPR began requiring license applicants to submit their fingerprints, which are used to run a criminal background check with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. In addition, they are required to provide a credit report during the license application process to demonstrate financial stability. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Florida Construction Industry License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
