Ronald D. Webb, Photographer










Photography is an intense multi-sensory experience for me. Once the camera is in my hands, I feel, hear, smell, and see more clearly . The moment I put the viewfinder up to my eye, I become acutely aware of the light, colors, textures, lines, forms, values, and shapes that comprise the scene. Balance, proportion, rhythm, movement, and unity become the visual building blocks that help me organize and arrange what I see into a single frame in time. The completed images serve as a reminder of those transformative moments and inspire me to further explore the world. This slideshow features an eclectic collection of images I've captured over the years.Enjoy!If you are looking for images I have shot for Clovis Unified School District and Clovis High, they have all been moved to http://clovisunified.zenfolio.com*You can see a collection of my black and white images at hotshoe.org. Hotshoe is a site dedicated to the promotion of black an white photography. Click on the link and come take a look.http://www.hotshoe.org/user/1030

I've been addicted to photography since I bought my first camera in 1977. Originally, I was a self-taught photographer who was fortunate enough to eventually take classes and participate in workshops taught by some of the great "American Masters of Photography". I've been on a 35 year journey filled with the excitement and satisfaction that comes from nurturing an artistic longing within this technological medium. I've been teaching high school photography in Clovis, CA since 1980. I'm the grateful one who gets to say... "My passion became my profession."

How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Texas:













Does Webb, Ronald D carry a valid contracting license?



Only certain types of specialty contractors (e.g. HVAC, electrical) need to be licensed in Texas. There are no licensing requirements when it comes to hiring for a construction or major remodeling project.











How important is contractor licensing in Texas?



The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulates HVAC and electrical contractors. You should verify their license status on the TDLR Website before hiring. General contractors and home builders are not licensed so you should do additional research before hiring one.











Your liability risk when hiring Webb, Ronald D



Although it isn't a regulatory requirement, you can ask your general contractor to provide evidence of workers' compensation and general liability insurance prior to hiring them. 











Financial recourse when hiring Webb, Ronald D



The Texas Department of Licensing Regulation does not require general contractors to carry a surety bond nor is there a state recovery fund.











What else should I know before hiring Webb, Ronald D



There is no financial or criminal background check performed on general contractors by the TDLR. The State's Department of Public Safety does maintain a publicly accessible database so you can run your own background check prior to hiring. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



The information on BuildZoom is made available as a public service and should not be considered advertising. We collect client feedback and verify contractors' permitted history with dozens of local building departments in Texas, which saves you time and helps minimize your risk when hiring. 











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Texas Attorney General's office recommends getting several bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). 









About BuildZoom






BuildZoom has one simple purpose: To help you find the perfect contractor
for any job, commercial or residential.


BuildZoom is a database of every licensed contractor in the United States.
We work hard to figure out who the great contractors are, and who the bad
contractors are.

more...





BuildZoom combines license information on 3.5 million contractors with
110 million building permits, and over 80,000
reviews from property owners.If you are looking for a specific
contractor and you can’t find them on BuildZoom, it’s likely that they do
not have a license - please
contact us
and we’ll try to help!



Finding a Contractor through BuildZoom



The best way to use BuildZoom is to let us recommend contractors for
your remodeling projects.


Homeowners who

hire through BuildZoom's free bidding system
 report high rates of satisfaction, and homeowners who research
contractors online are twice as likely to be happy at the end of their
project.


If you hire a contractor through BuildZoom, that contractor is
accountable to us. We can enforce standards of behavior, mediate
disputes, and guarantee satisfaction.

Very approachable and sincere. Although I thought I knew exactly what I wanted, after talking to us a bit Ronald R. Webb provided some better ideas to accomplish our desires and wishes.

Thank you for making a somewhat unpleasant task much easier to take. I feel confident that all is as I had hoped and the fact that I can make changes is very reassuring.

- Charity Pointon




 


Explain Things Very Well

Estate Planning was something that I knew I needed to do forever, just avoided it because of cost fear of how complicated it might be. Ron made things extremely easy and explained things very well. It is somewhat of an investment, but his fees are very reasonable compared to others that we looked into.
