James Rupert Jacob Murdoch (/ˈmɜːrdɒk/;[2] born 13 December 1972) is a British-born Australian-American businessman,[3] the younger son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive officer (CEO) of 21st Century Fox, and chairman of Sky plc. He is the former chairman and CEO of News Corp., Europe and Asia, where he oversaw assets such as News International (British newspapers), publisher of The News of the World newspaper, SKY Italia (satellite television in Italy), Sky Deutschland, and STAR TV (satellite television in Asia).
He sits on the News Corporation board of directors and is a member of the office of the chairman. He was made executive chairman of News International in December 2007[4] He has since resigned from the post. He previously held a non-executive chair at British Sky Broadcasting, in which News Corporation has a controlling minority stake. In April 2012, he was forced to resign as chairman of BSkyB in the wake of the ongoing phone-hacking scandal, in which he was implicated.[5] He was reappointed chairman of the company following its merger with its Italian and German sister companies to form Sky plc.
He was formerly an executive vice-president of News Corporation, the controlling shareholder of BSkyB, and served on the board of directors of News Datacom and of News Corporation.[6]
In May 2012, a highly critical UK Parliamentary report said that Murdoch "showed wilful ignorance of the extent of phone-hacking" and found him "guilty of an astonishing lack of curiosity" over the issue.[7] It went on to say that both Murdoch and his father, Rupert, 'should ultimately be prepared to take responsibility' for wrongdoing at the News of the World and News International.[8]
Murdoch is a British citizen by birth and a naturalised US citizen. He lost Australian citizenship when his father became a US citizen, but he is eligible to reclaim it.

Early life[edit]
Murdoch was born in Wimbledon, London, England. He is the fourth of billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch's six children, and the third with Scottish-born journalist and author Anna Murdoch Mann.[9]
As a youngster James was regarded as the brightest of the Murdoch children, but also considered something of a rebel.[6] He first came to public notice as a 15-year-old intern at the Sydney Daily Mirror but made headlines in the rival The Sydney Morning Herald after he was photographed asleep on a sofa at a press conference.[6]
Murdoch attended Horace Mann School in New York City[6] and graduated in 1991. He then studied film and history at Harvard University, where he edited underground magazines and drew a comic strip for the college's famed satirical magazine, Harvard Lampoon. He dropped out of university in 1995 without completing his studies.[6] With university friends Brian Brater and Jarret Myer, he backed the establishment of Rawkus Records, an independent hip hop record label. The company was bought by News Corporation in 1998.[6]
Business career[edit]
In 1996 Murdoch joined News Corporation and was appointed chairman of Festival Records. He took charge of News Corporation's internet operations, where he invested in a series of ventures, including financial website TheStreet and the short-lived online music site Whammo, with mixed results.[6] He also continued to contribute cartoons to US magazine Gear.
He is credited with sparking his father's interest in the internet, and he reportedly tried to persuade his father to buy internet company Pointcast for US$450million. It was subsequently sold to another company for $7 million.[6]
After installing a new management team at Festival, Murdoch purchased the controlling 51% share of Mushroom Records in 1999, and the merged group was rebranded as Festival Mushroom Records.[citation needed] It was at first thought that News might use FMR as the foundation of a new international entertainment company, but Festival struggled while Murdoch was in charge and after his departure its fortunes declined rapidly; the company was wound up in late 2005 and its remaining assets were sold. The recording catalogue was sold to the Australian division of Warner Music for only A$10 million in October 2005, and the publishing division was sold to Michael Gudinski a month later, for an undisclosed sum.[10]
In May 2000, Murdoch was appointed chairman and chief executive of News Corporation's ailing Asian satellite service Star Television, which at the time was losing £100m a year, and he moved to Hong Kong.[6]
In February 2003, Murdoch became a director of BSkyB. Later that year, he controversially became CEO of BSkyB, in which News Corporation owns a controlling minority stake. His appointment sparked accusations of nepotism, with some commentators and shareholders feeling that the job had not been opened to outsiders and that Murdoch was too young and inexperienced to run one of the UK's top companies[11] (on appointment he was by far the youngest chief executive of a FTSE 100 company).
Following the shock resignation of his brother Lachlan Murdoch from his executive positions at News Corporation on 29 July 2005, James is widely viewed as his father's heir-apparent.[12]




Murdoch at a digital media conference in 2006


On 7 December 2007, Murdoch stepped down as CEO from BSkyB and was appointed non-executive chairman of the company (a position formerly held by his father, Rupert).[13]
In a related announcement, Murdoch also took "direct responsibility for the strategic and operational development of News Corporation's television, newspaper, and related digital assets in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East."[14] This included holdings such as News International, SKY Italia, STAR Group ltd and possibly other News Corp. related assets. He was based at News International's headquarters in Wapping, East London.
In February 2009, Murdoch was appointed a non-executive director with the British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline.[15]
In August 2009, Murdoch delivered the MacTaggart Memorial Lecture at the Edinburgh International Television Festival, in which he attacked the BBC and UK media regulator Ofcom calling the BBC's expansion "chilling" and "In this all-media marketplace, the expansion of state-sponsored journalism is a threat to the plurality and independence of news provision, which are so important for our democracy."[12][16] The BBC chairman, Sir Michael Lyons officially responded, "We have to be careful not to reduce the whole of broadcasting to some simple economic transactions. The BBC's public purposes stress the importance of the well-tested principles of educating and informing, and an impartial contribution to debate in the UK."[17]
In April 2010, Murdoch and his associate Rebekah Brooks stormed into the offices of The Independent to complain about an advertisement campaign by the newspaper.[18] The advertisement read, "Rupert Murdoch won't decide this election—you will."
In April 2014, it was announced that Murdoch would join the board of advertising start-up True[X] Media.[19]
In June 2015, his father, Rupert announced he would be leaving his position as CEO of 21st Century Fox and James will take over the position in the near future.[20]
In January 2016, Murdoch became the chairman of Sky, Britain's subscription broadcaster.[21]
In July 2017, Murdoch became an independent director on the board of Tesla. [22]
Phone hacking scandal and aftermath[edit]
On 7 July 2011, James Murdoch announced the closure of the British tabloid newspaper the News of the World in the wake of a phone hacking scandal.[23]
On 19 July 2011, along with his father, Rupert, he appeared at a hearing of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee. He appeared once again before the same committee on 10 November 2011. James maintained that until late in 2010 he was unaware that more than one "rogue reporter" from the News of the World tabloid had been involved in phone hacking.[24] This statement was challenged by the formal legal manager and editor for the newspaper, who claimed they had informed James of the "Transcript for Neville" email, a potential "smoking gun" indicating several of the newspaper's journalists may have been involved, during the settlement negotiations with Gorden Taylor in 2008 and alerted him to the potential liability if this document became public.
On 22 July 2011, Britain's prime minister, David Cameron, said that Murdoch has "questions to answer in Parliament," a day after former top executives of the News of the World accused the News Corporation executive of giving "mistaken" evidence.[25]
In November 2011, British newspapers reported that Murdoch had resigned as chairman of News Group Newspapers, the holding company above The Sun, News of the World and Times Newspapers Ltd, itself owner of The Times and The Sunday Times. News Group Newspapers is the company subject to a series of lawsuits, all related to the phone hacking scandal. James Murdoch's resignation was also said to be related to the 12 October 2011 resignation[clarification needed] of another Dow Jones executive, Andrew Langhoff, after a company whistleblower revealed an editorial scam and questionable circulation dealings at The Wall Street Journal Europe.[26][27]
In February 2012, News Corp announced that Murdoch would be stepping down as executive chairman of its British newspaper arm. The company said he would remain deputy chief operating officer of News Corp and focus on the company's international TV business,[28] including continued responsibility for BSkyB.[29] He stepped down also from the GlaxoSmithKline board.[30]
In April 2012, he stood down as chairman of BSkyB, but remained on the board.[31] He was replaced as chairman by Nicholas Ferguson.
In September 2012 Murdoch was criticised by the British Office of Communications (Ofcom), which concluded that he "repeatedly fell short of the conduct to be expected of as a chief executive and chairman" and that his lack of action in relation to phone hacking was "difficult to comprehend and ill-judged".[32]
Personal life[edit]
Murdoch was married in 2000[33] and has three children, Anneka (born 2003), Walter (born 2006), and Emerson (born 2008), with his American wife Kathryn Hufschmid Murdoch. Kathryn works for the Clinton Climate Initiative, a charitable foundation set up by the former US president, Bill Clinton in 2006.[9] In 2013, they launched Quadrivium Foundation.[34]
Murdoch was instrumental in the formation of Sky Procycling and is a keen cyclist himself.[35] He has a black belt in karate.[36]
Murdoch donated money to the Clinton Foundation, the nonprofit organization run by Chelsea, Bill and Hillary Clinton.[37]

James Rupert Jacob Murdoch (/ˈmɜːrdɒk/;[2] born 13 December 1972) is a British-born Australian-American businessman,[3] the younger son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive officer (CEO) of 21st Century Fox, and chairman of Sky plc. He is the former chairman and CEO of News Corp., Europe and Asia, where he oversaw assets such as News International (British newspapers), publisher of The News of the World newspaper, SKY Italia (satellite television in Italy), Sky Deutschland, and STAR TV (satellite television in Asia).
He sits on the News Corporation board of directors and is a member of the office of the chairman. He was made executive chairman of News International in December 2007[4] He has since resigned from the post. He previously held a non-executive chair at British Sky Broadcasting, in which News Corporation has a controlling minority stake. In April 2012, he was forced to resign as chairman of BSkyB in the wake of the ongoing phone-hacking scandal, in which he was implicated.[5] He was reappointed chairman of the company following its merger with its Italian and German sister companies to form Sky plc.
He was formerly an executive vice-president of News Corporation, the controlling shareholder of BSkyB, and served on the board of directors of News Datacom and of News Corporation.[6]
In May 2012, a highly critical UK Parliamentary report said that Murdoch "showed wilful ignorance of the extent of phone-hacking" and found him "guilty of an astonishing lack of curiosity" over the issue.[7] It went on to say that both Murdoch and his father, Rupert, 'should ultimately be prepared to take responsibility' for wrongdoing at the News of the World and News International.[8]
Murdoch is a British citizen by birth and a naturalised US citizen. He lost Australian citizenship when his father became a US citizen, but he is eligible to reclaim it.

Early life[edit]
Murdoch was born in Wimbledon, London, England. He is the fourth of billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch's six children, and the third with Scottish-born journalist and author Anna Murdoch Mann.[9]
As a youngster James was regarded as the brightest of the Murdoch children, but also considered something of a rebel.[6] He first came to public notice as a 15-year-old intern at the Sydney Daily Mirror but made headlines in the rival The Sydney Morning Herald after he was photographed asleep on a sofa at a press conference.[6]
Murdoch attended Horace Mann School in New York City[6] and graduated in 1991. He then studied film and history at Harvard University, where he edited underground magazines and drew a comic strip for the college's famed satirical magazine, Harvard Lampoon. He dropped out of university in 1995 without completing his studies.[6] With university friends Brian Brater and Jarret Myer, he backed the establishment of Rawkus Records, an independent hip hop record label. The company was bought by News Corporation in 1998.[6]
Business career[edit]
In 1996 Murdoch joined News Corporation and was appointed chairman of Festival Records. He took charge of News Corporation's internet operations, where he invested in a series of ventures, including financial website TheStreet and the short-lived online music site Whammo, with mixed results.[6] He also continued to contribute cartoons to US magazine Gear.
He is credited with sparking his father's interest in the internet, and he reportedly tried to persuade his father to buy internet company Pointcast for US$450million. It was subsequently sold to another company for $7 million.[6]
After installing a new management team at Festival, Murdoch purchased the controlling 51% share of Mushroom Records in 1999, and the merged group was rebranded as Festival Mushroom Records.[citation needed] It was at first thought that News might use FMR as the foundation of a new international entertainment company, but Festival struggled while Murdoch was in charge and after his departure its fortunes declined rapidly; the company was wound up in late 2005 and its remaining assets were sold. The recording catalogue was sold to the Australian division of Warner Music for only A$10 million in October 2005, and the publishing division was sold to Michael Gudinski a month later, for an undisclosed sum.[10]
In May 2000, Murdoch was appointed chairman and chief executive of News Corporation's ailing Asian satellite service Star Television, which at the time was losing £100m a year, and he moved to Hong Kong.[6]
In February 2003, Murdoch became a director of BSkyB. Later that year, he controversially became CEO of BSkyB, in which News Corporation owns a controlling minority stake. His appointment sparked accusations of nepotism, with some commentators and shareholders feeling that the job had not been opened to outsiders and that Murdoch was too young and inexperienced to run one of the UK's top companies[11] (on appointment he was by far the youngest chief executive of a FTSE 100 company).
Following the shock resignation of his brother Lachlan Murdoch from his executive positions at News Corporation on 29 July 2005, James is widely viewed as his father's heir-apparent.[12]




Murdoch at a digital media conference in 2006


On 7 December 2007, Murdoch stepped down as CEO from BSkyB and was appointed non-executive chairman of the company (a position formerly held by his father, Rupert).[13]
In a related announcement, Murdoch also took "direct responsibility for the strategic and operational development of News Corporation's television, newspaper, and related digital assets in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East."[14] This included holdings such as News International, SKY Italia, STAR Group ltd and possibly other News Corp. related assets. He was based at News International's headquarters in Wapping, East London.
In February 2009, Murdoch was appointed a non-executive director with the British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline.[15]
In August 2009, Murdoch delivered the MacTaggart Memorial Lecture at the Edinburgh International Television Festival, in which he attacked the BBC and UK media regulator Ofcom calling the BBC's expansion "chilling" and "In this all-media marketplace, the expansion of state-sponsored journalism is a threat to the plurality and independence of news provision, which are so important for our democracy."[12][16] The BBC chairman, Sir Michael Lyons officially responded, "We have to be careful not to reduce the whole of broadcasting to some simple economic transactions. The BBC's public purposes stress the importance of the well-tested principles of educating and informing, and an impartial contribution to debate in the UK."[17]
In April 2010, Murdoch and his associate Rebekah Brooks stormed into the offices of The Independent to complain about an advertisement campaign by the newspaper.[18] The advertisement read, "Rupert Murdoch won't decide this election—you will."
In April 2014, it was announced that Murdoch would join the board of advertising start-up True[X] Media.[19]
In June 2015, his father, Rupert announced he would be leaving his position as CEO of 21st Century Fox and James will take over the position in the near future.[20]
In January 2016, Murdoch became the chairman of Sky, Britain's subscription broadcaster.[21]
In July 2017, Murdoch became an independent director on the board of Tesla. [22]
Phone hacking scandal and aftermath[edit]
On 7 July 2011, James Murdoch announced the closure of the British tabloid newspaper the News of the World in the wake of a phone hacking scandal.[23]
On 19 July 2011, along with his father, Rupert, he appeared at a hearing of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee. He appeared once again before the same committee on 10 November 2011. James maintained that until late in 2010 he was unaware that more than one "rogue reporter" from the News of the World tabloid had been involved in phone hacking.[24] This statement was challenged by the formal legal manager and editor for the newspaper, who claimed they had informed James of the "Transcript for Neville" email, a potential "smoking gun" indicating several of the newspaper's journalists may have been involved, during the settlement negotiations with Gorden Taylor in 2008 and alerted him to the potential liability if this document became public.
On 22 July 2011, Britain's prime minister, David Cameron, said that Murdoch has "questions to answer in Parliament," a day after former top executives of the News of the World accused the News Corporation executive of giving "mistaken" evidence.[25]
In November 2011, British newspapers reported that Murdoch had resigned as chairman of News Group Newspapers, the holding company above The Sun, News of the World and Times Newspapers Ltd, itself owner of The Times and The Sunday Times. News Group Newspapers is the company subject to a series of lawsuits, all related to the phone hacking scandal. James Murdoch's resignation was also said to be related to the 12 October 2011 resignation[clarification needed] of another Dow Jones executive, Andrew Langhoff, after a company whistleblower revealed an editorial scam and questionable circulation dealings at The Wall Street Journal Europe.[26][27]
In February 2012, News Corp announced that Murdoch would be stepping down as executive chairman of its British newspaper arm. The company said he would remain deputy chief operating officer of News Corp and focus on the company's international TV business,[28] including continued responsibility for BSkyB.[29] He stepped down also from the GlaxoSmithKline board.[30]
In April 2012, he stood down as chairman of BSkyB, but remained on the board.[31] He was replaced as chairman by Nicholas Ferguson.
In September 2012 Murdoch was criticised by the British Office of Communications (Ofcom), which concluded that he "repeatedly fell short of the conduct to be expected of as a chief executive and chairman" and that his lack of action in relation to phone hacking was "difficult to comprehend and ill-judged".[32]
Personal life[edit]
Murdoch was married in 2000[33] and has three children, Anneka (born 2003), Walter (born 2006), and Emerson (born 2008), with his American wife Kathryn Hufschmid Murdoch. Kathryn works for the Clinton Climate Initiative, a charitable foundation set up by the former US president, Bill Clinton in 2006.[9] In 2013, they launched Quadrivium Foundation.[34]
Murdoch was instrumental in the formation of Sky Procycling and is a keen cyclist himself.[35] He has a black belt in karate.[36]
Murdoch donated money to the Clinton Foundation, the nonprofit organization run by Chelsea, Bill and Hillary Clinton.[37]

James Rupert Jacob Murdoch (/ˈmɜːrdɒk/;[2] born 13 December 1972) is a British-born Australian-American businessman,[3] the younger son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive officer (CEO) of 21st Century Fox, and chairman of Sky plc. He is the former chairman and CEO of News Corp., Europe and Asia, where he oversaw assets such as News International (British newspapers), publisher of The News of the World newspaper, SKY Italia (satellite television in Italy), Sky Deutschland, and STAR TV (satellite television in Asia).
He sits on the News Corporation board of directors and is a member of the office of the chairman. He was made executive chairman of News International in December 2007[4] He has since resigned from the post. He previously held a non-executive chair at British Sky Broadcasting, in which News Corporation has a controlling minority stake. In April 2012, he was forced to resign as chairman of BSkyB in the wake of the ongoing phone-hacking scandal, in which he was implicated.[5] He was reappointed chairman of the company following its merger with its Italian and German sister companies to form Sky plc.
He was formerly an executive vice-president of News Corporation, the controlling shareholder of BSkyB, and served on the board of directors of News Datacom and of News Corporation.[6]
In May 2012, a highly critical UK Parliamentary report said that Murdoch "showed wilful ignorance of the extent of phone-hacking" and found him "guilty of an astonishing lack of curiosity" over the issue.[7] It went on to say that both Murdoch and his father, Rupert, 'should ultimately be prepared to take responsibility' for wrongdoing at the News of the World and News International.[8]
Murdoch is a British citizen by birth and a naturalised US citizen. He lost Australian citizenship when his father became a US citizen, but he is eligible to reclaim it.

Early life[edit]
Murdoch was born in Wimbledon, London, England. He is the fourth of billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch's six children, and the third with Scottish-born journalist and author Anna Murdoch Mann.[9]
As a youngster James was regarded as the brightest of the Murdoch children, but also considered something of a rebel.[6] He first came to public notice as a 15-year-old intern at the Sydney Daily Mirror but made headlines in the rival The Sydney Morning Herald after he was photographed asleep on a sofa at a press conference.[6]
Murdoch attended Horace Mann School in New York City[6] and graduated in 1991. He then studied film and history at Harvard University, where he edited underground magazines and drew a comic strip for the college's famed satirical magazine, Harvard Lampoon. He dropped out of university in 1995 without completing his studies.[6] With university friends Brian Brater and Jarret Myer, he backed the establishment of Rawkus Records, an independent hip hop record label. The company was bought by News Corporation in 1998.[6]
Business career[edit]
In 1996 Murdoch joined News Corporation and was appointed chairman of Festival Records. He took charge of News Corporation's internet operations, where he invested in a series of ventures, including financial website TheStreet and the short-lived online music site Whammo, with mixed results.[6] He also continued to contribute cartoons to US magazine Gear.
He is credited with sparking his father's interest in the internet, and he reportedly tried to persuade his father to buy internet company Pointcast for US$450million. It was subsequently sold to another company for $7 million.[6]
After installing a new management team at Festival, Murdoch purchased the controlling 51% share of Mushroom Records in 1999, and the merged group was rebranded as Festival Mushroom Records.[citation needed] It was at first thought that News might use FMR as the foundation of a new international entertainment company, but Festival struggled while Murdoch was in charge and after his departure its fortunes declined rapidly; the company was wound up in late 2005 and its remaining assets were sold. The recording catalogue was sold to the Australian division of Warner Music for only A$10 million in October 2005, and the publishing division was sold to Michael Gudinski a month later, for an undisclosed sum.[10]
In May 2000, Murdoch was appointed chairman and chief executive of News Corporation's ailing Asian satellite service Star Television, which at the time was losing £100m a year, and he moved to Hong Kong.[6]
In February 2003, Murdoch became a director of BSkyB. Later that year, he controversially became CEO of BSkyB, in which News Corporation owns a controlling minority stake. His appointment sparked accusations of nepotism, with some commentators and shareholders feeling that the job had not been opened to outsiders and that Murdoch was too young and inexperienced to run one of the UK's top companies[11] (on appointment he was by far the youngest chief executive of a FTSE 100 company).
Following the shock resignation of his brother Lachlan Murdoch from his executive positions at News Corporation on 29 July 2005, James is widely viewed as his father's heir-apparent.[12]




Murdoch at a digital media conference in 2006


On 7 December 2007, Murdoch stepped down as CEO from BSkyB and was appointed non-executive chairman of the company (a position formerly held by his father, Rupert).[13]
In a related announcement, Murdoch also took "direct responsibility for the strategic and operational development of News Corporation's television, newspaper, and related digital assets in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East."[14] This included holdings such as News International, SKY Italia, STAR Group ltd and possibly other News Corp. related assets. He was based at News International's headquarters in Wapping, East London.
In February 2009, Murdoch was appointed a non-executive director with the British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline.[15]
In August 2009, Murdoch delivered the MacTaggart Memorial Lecture at the Edinburgh International Television Festival, in which he attacked the BBC and UK media regulator Ofcom calling the BBC's expansion "chilling" and "In this all-media marketplace, the expansion of state-sponsored journalism is a threat to the plurality and independence of news provision, which are so important for our democracy."[12][16] The BBC chairman, Sir Michael Lyons officially responded, "We have to be careful not to reduce the whole of broadcasting to some simple economic transactions. The BBC's public purposes stress the importance of the well-tested principles of educating and informing, and an impartial contribution to debate in the UK."[17]
In April 2010, Murdoch and his associate Rebekah Brooks stormed into the offices of The Independent to complain about an advertisement campaign by the newspaper.[18] The advertisement read, "Rupert Murdoch won't decide this election—you will."
In April 2014, it was announced that Murdoch would join the board of advertising start-up True[X] Media.[19]
In June 2015, his father, Rupert announced he would be leaving his position as CEO of 21st Century Fox and James will take over the position in the near future.[20]
In January 2016, Murdoch became the chairman of Sky, Britain's subscription broadcaster.[21]
In July 2017, Murdoch became an independent director on the board of Tesla. [22]
Phone hacking scandal and aftermath[edit]
On 7 July 2011, James Murdoch announced the closure of the British tabloid newspaper the News of the World in the wake of a phone hacking scandal.[23]
On 19 July 2011, along with his father, Rupert, he appeared at a hearing of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee. He appeared once again before the same committee on 10 November 2011. James maintained that until late in 2010 he was unaware that more than one "rogue reporter" from the News of the World tabloid had been involved in phone hacking.[24] This statement was challenged by the formal legal manager and editor for the newspaper, who claimed they had informed James of the "Transcript for Neville" email, a potential "smoking gun" indicating several of the newspaper's journalists may have been involved, during the settlement negotiations with Gorden Taylor in 2008 and alerted him to the potential liability if this document became public.
On 22 July 2011, Britain's prime minister, David Cameron, said that Murdoch has "questions to answer in Parliament," a day after former top executives of the News of the World accused the News Corporation executive of giving "mistaken" evidence.[25]
In November 2011, British newspapers reported that Murdoch had resigned as chairman of News Group Newspapers, the holding company above The Sun, News of the World and Times Newspapers Ltd, itself owner of The Times and The Sunday Times. News Group Newspapers is the company subject to a series of lawsuits, all related to the phone hacking scandal. James Murdoch's resignation was also said to be related to the 12 October 2011 resignation[clarification needed] of another Dow Jones executive, Andrew Langhoff, after a company whistleblower revealed an editorial scam and questionable circulation dealings at The Wall Street Journal Europe.[26][27]
In February 2012, News Corp announced that Murdoch would be stepping down as executive chairman of its British newspaper arm. The company said he would remain deputy chief operating officer of News Corp and focus on the company's international TV business,[28] including continued responsibility for BSkyB.[29] He stepped down also from the GlaxoSmithKline board.[30]
In April 2012, he stood down as chairman of BSkyB, but remained on the board.[31] He was replaced as chairman by Nicholas Ferguson.
In September 2012 Murdoch was criticised by the British Office of Communications (Ofcom), which concluded that he "repeatedly fell short of the conduct to be expected of as a chief executive and chairman" and that his lack of action in relation to phone hacking was "difficult to comprehend and ill-judged".[32]
Personal life[edit]
Murdoch was married in 2000[33] and has three children, Anneka (born 2003), Walter (born 2006), and Emerson (born 2008), with his American wife Kathryn Hufschmid Murdoch. Kathryn works for the Clinton Climate Initiative, a charitable foundation set up by the former US president, Bill Clinton in 2006.[9] In 2013, they launched Quadrivium Foundation.[34]
Murdoch was instrumental in the formation of Sky Procycling and is a keen cyclist himself.[35] He has a black belt in karate.[36]
Murdoch donated money to the Clinton Foundation, the nonprofit organization run by Chelsea, Bill and Hillary Clinton.[37]

James Rupert Jacob Murdoch (/ˈmɜːrdɒk/;[2] born 13 December 1972) is a British-born Australian-American businessman,[3] the younger son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive officer (CEO) of 21st Century Fox, and chairman of Sky plc. He is the former chairman and CEO of News Corp., Europe and Asia, where he oversaw assets such as News International (British newspapers), publisher of The News of the World newspaper, SKY Italia (satellite television in Italy), Sky Deutschland, and STAR TV (satellite television in Asia).
He sits on the News Corporation board of directors and is a member of the office of the chairman. He was made executive chairman of News International in December 2007[4] He has since resigned from the post. He previously held a non-executive chair at British Sky Broadcasting, in which News Corporation has a controlling minority stake. In April 2012, he was forced to resign as chairman of BSkyB in the wake of the ongoing phone-hacking scandal, in which he was implicated.[5] He was reappointed chairman of the company following its merger with its Italian and German sister companies to form Sky plc.
He was formerly an executive vice-president of News Corporation, the controlling shareholder of BSkyB, and served on the board of directors of News Datacom and of News Corporation.[6]
In May 2012, a highly critical UK Parliamentary report said that Murdoch "showed wilful ignorance of the extent of phone-hacking" and found him "guilty of an astonishing lack of curiosity" over the issue.[7] It went on to say that both Murdoch and his father, Rupert, 'should ultimately be prepared to take responsibility' for wrongdoing at the News of the World and News International.[8]
Murdoch is a British citizen by birth and a naturalised US citizen. He lost Australian citizenship when his father became a US citizen, but he is eligible to reclaim it.

Early life[edit]
Murdoch was born in Wimbledon, London, England. He is the fourth of billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch's six children, and the third with Scottish-born journalist and author Anna Murdoch Mann.[9]
As a youngster James was regarded as the brightest of the Murdoch children, but also considered something of a rebel.[6] He first came to public notice as a 15-year-old intern at the Sydney Daily Mirror but made headlines in the rival The Sydney Morning Herald after he was photographed asleep on a sofa at a press conference.[6]
Murdoch attended Horace Mann School in New York City[6] and graduated in 1991. He then studied film and history at Harvard University, where he edited underground magazines and drew a comic strip for the college's famed satirical magazine, Harvard Lampoon. He dropped out of university in 1995 without completing his studies.[6] With university friends Brian Brater and Jarret Myer, he backed the establishment of Rawkus Records, an independent hip hop record label. The company was bought by News Corporation in 1998.[6]
Business career[edit]
In 1996 Murdoch joined News Corporation and was appointed chairman of Festival Records. He took charge of News Corporation's internet operations, where he invested in a series of ventures, including financial website TheStreet and the short-lived online music site Whammo, with mixed results.[6] He also continued to contribute cartoons to US magazine Gear.
He is credited with sparking his father's interest in the internet, and he reportedly tried to persuade his father to buy internet company Pointcast for US$450million. It was subsequently sold to another company for $7 million.[6]
After installing a new management team at Festival, Murdoch purchased the controlling 51% share of Mushroom Records in 1999, and the merged group was rebranded as Festival Mushroom Records.[citation needed] It was at first thought that News might use FMR as the foundation of a new international entertainment company, but Festival struggled while Murdoch was in charge and after his departure its fortunes declined rapidly; the company was wound up in late 2005 and its remaining assets were sold. The recording catalogue was sold to the Australian division of Warner Music for only A$10 million in October 2005, and the publishing division was sold to Michael Gudinski a month later, for an undisclosed sum.[10]
In May 2000, Murdoch was appointed chairman and chief executive of News Corporation's ailing Asian satellite service Star Television, which at the time was losing £100m a year, and he moved to Hong Kong.[6]
In February 2003, Murdoch became a director of BSkyB. Later that year, he controversially became CEO of BSkyB, in which News Corporation owns a controlling minority stake. His appointment sparked accusations of nepotism, with some commentators and shareholders feeling that the job had not been opened to outsiders and that Murdoch was too young and inexperienced to run one of the UK's top companies[11] (on appointment he was by far the youngest chief executive of a FTSE 100 company).
Following the shock resignation of his brother Lachlan Murdoch from his executive positions at News Corporation on 29 July 2005, James is widely viewed as his father's heir-apparent.[12]




Murdoch at a digital media conference in 2006


On 7 December 2007, Murdoch stepped down as CEO from BSkyB and was appointed non-executive chairman of the company (a position formerly held by his father, Rupert).[13]
In a related announcement, Murdoch also took "direct responsibility for the strategic and operational development of News Corporation's television, newspaper, and related digital assets in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East."[14] This included holdings such as News International, SKY Italia, STAR Group ltd and possibly other News Corp. related assets. He was based at News International's headquarters in Wapping, East London.
In February 2009, Murdoch was appointed a non-executive director with the British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline.[15]
In August 2009, Murdoch delivered the MacTaggart Memorial Lecture at the Edinburgh International Television Festival, in which he attacked the BBC and UK media regulator Ofcom calling the BBC's expansion "chilling" and "In this all-media marketplace, the expansion of state-sponsored journalism is a threat to the plurality and independence of news provision, which are so important for our democracy."[12][16] The BBC chairman, Sir Michael Lyons officially responded, "We have to be careful not to reduce the whole of broadcasting to some simple economic transactions. The BBC's public purposes stress the importance of the well-tested principles of educating and informing, and an impartial contribution to debate in the UK."[17]
In April 2010, Murdoch and his associate Rebekah Brooks stormed into the offices of The Independent to complain about an advertisement campaign by the newspaper.[18] The advertisement read, "Rupert Murdoch won't decide this election—you will."
In April 2014, it was announced that Murdoch would join the board of advertising start-up True[X] Media.[19]
In June 2015, his father, Rupert announced he would be leaving his position as CEO of 21st Century Fox and James will take over the position in the near future.[20]
In January 2016, Murdoch became the chairman of Sky, Britain's subscription broadcaster.[21]
In July 2017, Murdoch became an independent director on the board of Tesla. [22]
Phone hacking scandal and aftermath[edit]
On 7 July 2011, James Murdoch announced the closure of the British tabloid newspaper the News of the World in the wake of a phone hacking scandal.[23]
On 19 July 2011, along with his father, Rupert, he appeared at a hearing of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee. He appeared once again before the same committee on 10 November 2011. James maintained that until late in 2010 he was unaware that more than one "rogue reporter" from the News of the World tabloid had been involved in phone hacking.[24] This statement was challenged by the formal legal manager and editor for the newspaper, who claimed they had informed James of the "Transcript for Neville" email, a potential "smoking gun" indicating several of the newspaper's journalists may have been involved, during the settlement negotiations with Gorden Taylor in 2008 and alerted him to the potential liability if this document became public.
On 22 July 2011, Britain's prime minister, David Cameron, said that Murdoch has "questions to answer in Parliament," a day after former top executives of the News of the World accused the News Corporation executive of giving "mistaken" evidence.[25]
In November 2011, British newspapers reported that Murdoch had resigned as chairman of News Group Newspapers, the holding company above The Sun, News of the World and Times Newspapers Ltd, itself owner of The Times and The Sunday Times. News Group Newspapers is the company subject to a series of lawsuits, all related to the phone hacking scandal. James Murdoch's resignation was also said to be related to the 12 October 2011 resignation[clarification needed] of another Dow Jones executive, Andrew Langhoff, after a company whistleblower revealed an editorial scam and questionable circulation dealings at The Wall Street Journal Europe.[26][27]
In February 2012, News Corp announced that Murdoch would be stepping down as executive chairman of its British newspaper arm. The company said he would remain deputy chief operating officer of News Corp and focus on the company's international TV business,[28] including continued responsibility for BSkyB.[29] He stepped down also from the GlaxoSmithKline board.[30]
In April 2012, he stood down as chairman of BSkyB, but remained on the board.[31] He was replaced as chairman by Nicholas Ferguson.
In September 2012 Murdoch was criticised by the British Office of Communications (Ofcom), which concluded that he "repeatedly fell short of the conduct to be expected of as a chief executive and chairman" and that his lack of action in relation to phone hacking was "difficult to comprehend and ill-judged".[32]
Personal life[edit]
Murdoch was married in 2000[33] and has three children, Anneka (born 2003), Walter (born 2006), and Emerson (born 2008), with his American wife Kathryn Hufschmid Murdoch. Kathryn works for the Clinton Climate Initiative, a charitable foundation set up by the former US president, Bill Clinton in 2006.[9] In 2013, they launched Quadrivium Foundation.[34]
Murdoch was instrumental in the formation of Sky Procycling and is a keen cyclist himself.[35] He has a black belt in karate.[36]
Murdoch donated money to the Clinton Foundation, the nonprofit organization run by Chelsea, Bill and Hillary Clinton.[37]

James Rupert Jacob Murdoch (/ˈmɜːrdɒk/;[2] born 13 December 1972) is a British-born Australian-American businessman,[3] the younger son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive officer (CEO) of 21st Century Fox, and chairman of Sky plc. He is the former chairman and CEO of News Corp., Europe and Asia, where he oversaw assets such as News International (British newspapers), publisher of The News of the World newspaper, SKY Italia (satellite television in Italy), Sky Deutschland, and STAR TV (satellite television in Asia).
He sits on the News Corporation board of directors and is a member of the office of the chairman. He was made executive chairman of News International in December 2007[4] He has since resigned from the post. He previously held a non-executive chair at British Sky Broadcasting, in which News Corporation has a controlling minority stake. In April 2012, he was forced to resign as chairman of BSkyB in the wake of the ongoing phone-hacking scandal, in which he was implicated.[5] He was reappointed chairman of the company following its merger with its Italian and German sister companies to form Sky plc.
He was formerly an executive vice-president of News Corporation, the controlling shareholder of BSkyB, and served on the board of directors of News Datacom and of News Corporation.[6]
In May 2012, a highly critical UK Parliamentary report said that Murdoch "showed wilful ignorance of the extent of phone-hacking" and found him "guilty of an astonishing lack of curiosity" over the issue.[7] It went on to say that both Murdoch and his father, Rupert, 'should ultimately be prepared to take responsibility' for wrongdoing at the News of the World and News International.[8]
Murdoch is a British citizen by birth and a naturalised US citizen. He lost Australian citizenship when his father became a US citizen, but he is eligible to reclaim it.

Early life[edit]
Murdoch was born in Wimbledon, London, England. He is the fourth of billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch's six children, and the third with Scottish-born journalist and author Anna Murdoch Mann.[9]
As a youngster James was regarded as the brightest of the Murdoch children, but also considered something of a rebel.[6] He first came to public notice as a 15-year-old intern at the Sydney Daily Mirror but made headlines in the rival The Sydney Morning Herald after he was photographed asleep on a sofa at a press conference.[6]
Murdoch attended Horace Mann School in New York City[6] and graduated in 1991. He then studied film and history at Harvard University, where he edited underground magazines and drew a comic strip for the college's famed satirical magazine, Harvard Lampoon. He dropped out of university in 1995 without completing his studies.[6] With university friends Brian Brater and Jarret Myer, he backed the establishment of Rawkus Records, an independent hip hop record label. The company was bought by News Corporation in 1998.[6]
Business career[edit]
In 1996 Murdoch joined News Corporation and was appointed chairman of Festival Records. He took charge of News Corporation's internet operations, where he invested in a series of ventures, including financial website TheStreet and the short-lived online music site Whammo, with mixed results.[6] He also continued to contribute cartoons to US magazine Gear.
He is credited with sparking his father's interest in the internet, and he reportedly tried to persuade his father to buy internet company Pointcast for US$450million. It was subsequently sold to another company for $7 million.[6]
After installing a new management team at Festival, Murdoch purchased the controlling 51% share of Mushroom Records in 1999, and the merged group was rebranded as Festival Mushroom Records.[citation needed] It was at first thought that News might use FMR as the foundation of a new international entertainment company, but Festival struggled while Murdoch was in charge and after his departure its fortunes declined rapidly; the company was wound up in late 2005 and its remaining assets were sold. The recording catalogue was sold to the Australian division of Warner Music for only A$10 million in October 2005, and the publishing division was sold to Michael Gudinski a month later, for an undisclosed sum.[10]
In May 2000, Murdoch was appointed chairman and chief executive of News Corporation's ailing Asian satellite service Star Television, which at the time was losing £100m a year, and he moved to Hong Kong.[6]
In February 2003, Murdoch became a director of BSkyB. Later that year, he controversially became CEO of BSkyB, in which News Corporation owns a controlling minority stake. His appointment sparked accusations of nepotism, with some commentators and shareholders feeling that the job had not been opened to outsiders and that Murdoch was too young and inexperienced to run one of the UK's top companies[11] (on appointment he was by far the youngest chief executive of a FTSE 100 company).
Following the shock resignation of his brother Lachlan Murdoch from his executive positions at News Corporation on 29 July 2005, James is widely viewed as his father's heir-apparent.[12]




Murdoch at a digital media conference in 2006


On 7 December 2007, Murdoch stepped down as CEO from BSkyB and was appointed non-executive chairman of the company (a position formerly held by his father, Rupert).[13]
In a related announcement, Murdoch also took "direct responsibility for the strategic and operational development of News Corporation's television, newspaper, and related digital assets in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East."[14] This included holdings such as News International, SKY Italia, STAR Group ltd and possibly other News Corp. related assets. He was based at News International's headquarters in Wapping, East London.
In February 2009, Murdoch was appointed a non-executive director with the British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline.[15]
In August 2009, Murdoch delivered the MacTaggart Memorial Lecture at the Edinburgh International Television Festival, in which he attacked the BBC and UK media regulator Ofcom calling the BBC's expansion "chilling" and "In this all-media marketplace, the expansion of state-sponsored journalism is a threat to the plurality and independence of news provision, which are so important for our democracy."[12][16] The BBC chairman, Sir Michael Lyons officially responded, "We have to be careful not to reduce the whole of broadcasting to some simple economic transactions. The BBC's public purposes stress the importance of the well-tested principles of educating and informing, and an impartial contribution to debate in the UK."[17]
In April 2010, Murdoch and his associate Rebekah Brooks stormed into the offices of The Independent to complain about an advertisement campaign by the newspaper.[18] The advertisement read, "Rupert Murdoch won't decide this election—you will."
In April 2014, it was announced that Murdoch would join the board of advertising start-up True[X] Media.[19]
In June 2015, his father, Rupert announced he would be leaving his position as CEO of 21st Century Fox and James will take over the position in the near future.[20]
In January 2016, Murdoch became the chairman of Sky, Britain's subscription broadcaster.[21]
In July 2017, Murdoch became an independent director on the board of Tesla. [22]
Phone hacking scandal and aftermath[edit]
On 7 July 2011, James Murdoch announced the closure of the British tabloid newspaper the News of the World in the wake of a phone hacking scandal.[23]
On 19 July 2011, along with his father, Rupert, he appeared at a hearing of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee. He appeared once again before the same committee on 10 November 2011. James maintained that until late in 2010 he was unaware that more than one "rogue reporter" from the News of the World tabloid had been involved in phone hacking.[24] This statement was challenged by the formal legal manager and editor for the newspaper, who claimed they had informed James of the "Transcript for Neville" email, a potential "smoking gun" indicating several of the newspaper's journalists may have been involved, during the settlement negotiations with Gorden Taylor in 2008 and alerted him to the potential liability if this document became public.
On 22 July 2011, Britain's prime minister, David Cameron, said that Murdoch has "questions to answer in Parliament," a day after former top executives of the News of the World accused the News Corporation executive of giving "mistaken" evidence.[25]
In November 2011, British newspapers reported that Murdoch had resigned as chairman of News Group Newspapers, the holding company above The Sun, News of the World and Times Newspapers Ltd, itself owner of The Times and The Sunday Times. News Group Newspapers is the company subject to a series of lawsuits, all related to the phone hacking scandal. James Murdoch's resignation was also said to be related to the 12 October 2011 resignation[clarification needed] of another Dow Jones executive, Andrew Langhoff, after a company whistleblower revealed an editorial scam and questionable circulation dealings at The Wall Street Journal Europe.[26][27]
In February 2012, News Corp announced that Murdoch would be stepping down as executive chairman of its British newspaper arm. The company said he would remain deputy chief operating officer of News Corp and focus on the company's international TV business,[28] including continued responsibility for BSkyB.[29] He stepped down also from the GlaxoSmithKline board.[30]
In April 2012, he stood down as chairman of BSkyB, but remained on the board.[31] He was replaced as chairman by Nicholas Ferguson.
In September 2012 Murdoch was criticised by the British Office of Communications (Ofcom), which concluded that he "repeatedly fell short of the conduct to be expected of as a chief executive and chairman" and that his lack of action in relation to phone hacking was "difficult to comprehend and ill-judged".[32]
Personal life[edit]
Murdoch was married in 2000[33] and has three children, Anneka (born 2003), Walter (born 2006), and Emerson (born 2008), with his American wife Kathryn Hufschmid Murdoch. Kathryn works for the Clinton Climate Initiative, a charitable foundation set up by the former US president, Bill Clinton in 2006.[9] In 2013, they launched Quadrivium Foundation.[34]
Murdoch was instrumental in the formation of Sky Procycling and is a keen cyclist himself.[35] He has a black belt in karate.[36]
Murdoch donated money to the Clinton Foundation, the nonprofit organization run by Chelsea, Bill and Hillary Clinton.[37]

James Rupert Jacob Murdoch (/ˈmɜːrdɒk/;[2] born 13 December 1972) is a British-born Australian-American businessman,[3] the younger son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive officer (CEO) of 21st Century Fox, and chairman of Sky plc. He is the former chairman and CEO of News Corp., Europe and Asia, where he oversaw assets such as News International (British newspapers), publisher of The News of the World newspaper, SKY Italia (satellite television in Italy), Sky Deutschland, and STAR TV (satellite television in Asia).
He sits on the News Corporation board of directors and is a member of the office of the chairman. He was made executive chairman of News International in December 2007[4] He has since resigned from the post. He previously held a non-executive chair at British Sky Broadcasting, in which News Corporation has a controlling minority stake. In April 2012, he was forced to resign as chairman of BSkyB in the wake of the ongoing phone-hacking scandal, in which he was implicated.[5] He was reappointed chairman of the company following its merger with its Italian and German sister companies to form Sky plc.
He was formerly an executive vice-president of News Corporation, the controlling shareholder of BSkyB, and served on the board of directors of News Datacom and of News Corporation.[6]
In May 2012, a highly critical UK Parliamentary report said that Murdoch "showed wilful ignorance of the extent of phone-hacking" and found him "guilty of an astonishing lack of curiosity" over the issue.[7] It went on to say that both Murdoch and his father, Rupert, 'should ultimately be prepared to take responsibility' for wrongdoing at the News of the World and News International.[8]
Murdoch is a British citizen by birth and a naturalised US citizen. He lost Australian citizenship when his father became a US citizen, but he is eligible to reclaim it.

Early life[edit]
Murdoch was born in Wimbledon, London, England. He is the fourth of billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch's six children, and the third with Scottish-born journalist and author Anna Murdoch Mann.[9]
As a youngster James was regarded as the brightest of the Murdoch children, but also considered something of a rebel.[6] He first came to public notice as a 15-year-old intern at the Sydney Daily Mirror but made headlines in the rival The Sydney Morning Herald after he was photographed asleep on a sofa at a press conference.[6]
Murdoch attended Horace Mann School in New York City[6] and graduated in 1991. He then studied film and history at Harvard University, where he edited underground magazines and drew a comic strip for the college's famed satirical magazine, Harvard Lampoon. He dropped out of university in 1995 without completing his studies.[6] With university friends Brian Brater and Jarret Myer, he backed the establishment of Rawkus Records, an independent hip hop record label. The company was bought by News Corporation in 1998.[6]
Business career[edit]
In 1996 Murdoch joined News Corporation and was appointed chairman of Festival Records. He took charge of News Corporation's internet operations, where he invested in a series of ventures, including financial website TheStreet and the short-lived online music site Whammo, with mixed results.[6] He also continued to contribute cartoons to US magazine Gear.
He is credited with sparking his father's interest in the internet, and he reportedly tried to persuade his father to buy internet company Pointcast for US$450million. It was subsequently sold to another company for $7 million.[6]
After installing a new management team at Festival, Murdoch purchased the controlling 51% share of Mushroom Records in 1999, and the merged group was rebranded as Festival Mushroom Records.[citation needed] It was at first thought that News might use FMR as the foundation of a new international entertainment company, but Festival struggled while Murdoch was in charge and after his departure its fortunes declined rapidly; the company was wound up in late 2005 and its remaining assets were sold. The recording catalogue was sold to the Australian division of Warner Music for only A$10 million in October 2005, and the publishing division was sold to Michael Gudinski a month later, for an undisclosed sum.[10]
In May 2000, Murdoch was appointed chairman and chief executive of News Corporation's ailing Asian satellite service Star Television, which at the time was losing £100m a year, and he moved to Hong Kong.[6]
In February 2003, Murdoch became a director of BSkyB. Later that year, he controversially became CEO of BSkyB, in which News Corporation owns a controlling minority stake. His appointment sparked accusations of nepotism, with some commentators and shareholders feeling that the job had not been opened to outsiders and that Murdoch was too young and inexperienced to run one of the UK's top companies[11] (on appointment he was by far the youngest chief executive of a FTSE 100 company).
Following the shock resignation of his brother Lachlan Murdoch from his executive positions at News Corporation on 29 July 2005, James is widely viewed as his father's heir-apparent.[12]




Murdoch at a digital media conference in 2006


On 7 December 2007, Murdoch stepped down as CEO from BSkyB and was appointed non-executive chairman of the company (a position formerly held by his father, Rupert).[13]
In a related announcement, Murdoch also took "direct responsibility for the strategic and operational development of News Corporation's television, newspaper, and related digital assets in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East."[14] This included holdings such as News International, SKY Italia, STAR Group ltd and possibly other News Corp. related assets. He was based at News International's headquarters in Wapping, East London.
In February 2009, Murdoch was appointed a non-executive director with the British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline.[15]
In August 2009, Murdoch delivered the MacTaggart Memorial Lecture at the Edinburgh International Television Festival, in which he attacked the BBC and UK media regulator Ofcom calling the BBC's expansion "chilling" and "In this all-media marketplace, the expansion of state-sponsored journalism is a threat to the plurality and independence of news provision, which are so important for our democracy."[12][16] The BBC chairman, Sir Michael Lyons officially responded, "We have to be careful not to reduce the whole of broadcasting to some simple economic transactions. The BBC's public purposes stress the importance of the well-tested principles of educating and informing, and an impartial contribution to debate in the UK."[17]
In April 2010, Murdoch and his associate Rebekah Brooks stormed into the offices of The Independent to complain about an advertisement campaign by the newspaper.[18] The advertisement read, "Rupert Murdoch won't decide this election—you will."
In April 2014, it was announced that Murdoch would join the board of advertising start-up True[X] Media.[19]
In June 2015, his father, Rupert announced he would be leaving his position as CEO of 21st Century Fox and James will take over the position in the near future.[20]
In January 2016, Murdoch became the chairman of Sky, Britain's subscription broadcaster.[21]
In July 2017, Murdoch became an independent director on the board of Tesla. [22]
Phone hacking scandal and aftermath[edit]
On 7 July 2011, James Murdoch announced the closure of the British tabloid newspaper the News of the World in the wake of a phone hacking scandal.[23]
On 19 July 2011, along with his father, Rupert, he appeared at a hearing of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee. He appeared once again before the same committee on 10 November 2011. James maintained that until late in 2010 he was unaware that more than one "rogue reporter" from the News of the World tabloid had been involved in phone hacking.[24] This statement was challenged by the formal legal manager and editor for the newspaper, who claimed they had informed James of the "Transcript for Neville" email, a potential "smoking gun" indicating several of the newspaper's journalists may have been involved, during the settlement negotiations with Gorden Taylor in 2008 and alerted him to the potential liability if this document became public.
On 22 July 2011, Britain's prime minister, David Cameron, said that Murdoch has "questions to answer in Parliament," a day after former top executives of the News of the World accused the News Corporation executive of giving "mistaken" evidence.[25]
In November 2011, British newspapers reported that Murdoch had resigned as chairman of News Group Newspapers, the holding company above The Sun, News of the World and Times Newspapers Ltd, itself owner of The Times and The Sunday Times. News Group Newspapers is the company subject to a series of lawsuits, all related to the phone hacking scandal. James Murdoch's resignation was also said to be related to the 12 October 2011 resignation[clarification needed] of another Dow Jones executive, Andrew Langhoff, after a company whistleblower revealed an editorial scam and questionable circulation dealings at The Wall Street Journal Europe.[26][27]
In February 2012, News Corp announced that Murdoch would be stepping down as executive chairman of its British newspaper arm. The company said he would remain deputy chief operating officer of News Corp and focus on the company's international TV business,[28] including continued responsibility for BSkyB.[29] He stepped down also from the GlaxoSmithKline board.[30]
In April 2012, he stood down as chairman of BSkyB, but remained on the board.[31] He was replaced as chairman by Nicholas Ferguson.
In September 2012 Murdoch was criticised by the British Office of Communications (Ofcom), which concluded that he "repeatedly fell short of the conduct to be expected of as a chief executive and chairman" and that his lack of action in relation to phone hacking was "difficult to comprehend and ill-judged".[32]
Personal life[edit]
Murdoch was married in 2000[33] and has three children, Anneka (born 2003), Walter (born 2006), and Emerson (born 2008), with his American wife Kathryn Hufschmid Murdoch. Kathryn works for the Clinton Climate Initiative, a charitable foundation set up by the former US president, Bill Clinton in 2006.[9] In 2013, they launched Quadrivium Foundation.[34]
Murdoch was instrumental in the formation of Sky Procycling and is a keen cyclist himself.[35] He has a black belt in karate.[36]
Murdoch donated money to the Clinton Foundation, the nonprofit organization run by Chelsea, Bill and Hillary Clinton.[37]

James Rupert Jacob Murdoch (/ˈmɜːrdɒk/;[2] born 13 December 1972) is a British-born Australian-American businessman,[3] the younger son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive officer (CEO) of 21st Century Fox, and chairman of Sky plc. He is the former chairman and CEO of News Corp., Europe and Asia, where he oversaw assets such as News International (British newspapers), publisher of The News of the World newspaper, SKY Italia (satellite television in Italy), Sky Deutschland, and STAR TV (satellite television in Asia).
He sits on the News Corporation board of directors and is a member of the office of the chairman. He was made executive chairman of News International in December 2007[4] He has since resigned from the post. He previously held a non-executive chair at British Sky Broadcasting, in which News Corporation has a controlling minority stake. In April 2012, he was forced to resign as chairman of BSkyB in the wake of the ongoing phone-hacking scandal, in which he was implicated.[5] He was reappointed chairman of the company following its merger with its Italian and German sister companies to form Sky plc.
He was formerly an executive vice-president of News Corporation, the controlling shareholder of BSkyB, and served on the board of directors of News Datacom and of News Corporation.[6]
In May 2012, a highly critical UK Parliamentary report said that Murdoch "showed wilful ignorance of the extent of phone-hacking" and found him "guilty of an astonishing lack of curiosity" over the issue.[7] It went on to say that both Murdoch and his father, Rupert, 'should ultimately be prepared to take responsibility' for wrongdoing at the News of the World and News International.[8]
Murdoch is a British citizen by birth and a naturalised US citizen. He lost Australian citizenship when his father became a US citizen, but he is eligible to reclaim it.

Early life[edit]
Murdoch was born in Wimbledon, London, England. He is the fourth of billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch's six children, and the third with Scottish-born journalist and author Anna Murdoch Mann.[9]
As a youngster James was regarded as the brightest of the Murdoch children, but also considered something of a rebel.[6] He first came to public notice as a 15-year-old intern at the Sydney Daily Mirror but made headlines in the rival The Sydney Morning Herald after he was photographed asleep on a sofa at a press conference.[6]
Murdoch attended Horace Mann School in New York City[6] and graduated in 1991. He then studied film and history at Harvard University, where he edited underground magazines and drew a comic strip for the college's famed satirical magazine, Harvard Lampoon. He dropped out of university in 1995 without completing his studies.[6] With university friends Brian Brater and Jarret Myer, he backed the establishment of Rawkus Records, an independent hip hop record label. The company was bought by News Corporation in 1998.[6]
Business career[edit]
In 1996 Murdoch joined News Corporation and was appointed chairman of Festival Records. He took charge of News Corporation's internet operations, where he invested in a series of ventures, including financial website TheStreet and the short-lived online music site Whammo, with mixed results.[6] He also continued to contribute cartoons to US magazine Gear.
He is credited with sparking his father's interest in the internet, and he reportedly tried to persuade his father to buy internet company Pointcast for US$450million. It was subsequently sold to another company for $7 million.[6]
After installing a new management team at Festival, Murdoch purchased the controlling 51% share of Mushroom Records in 1999, and the merged group was rebranded as Festival Mushroom Records.[citation needed] It was at first thought that News might use FMR as the foundation of a new international entertainment company, but Festival struggled while Murdoch was in charge and after his departure its fortunes declined rapidly; the company was wound up in late 2005 and its remaining assets were sold. The recording catalogue was sold to the Australian division of Warner Music for only A$10 million in October 2005, and the publishing division was sold to Michael Gudinski a month later, for an undisclosed sum.[10]
In May 2000, Murdoch was appointed chairman and chief executive of News Corporation's ailing Asian satellite service Star Television, which at the time was losing £100m a year, and he moved to Hong Kong.[6]
In February 2003, Murdoch became a director of BSkyB. Later that year, he controversially became CEO of BSkyB, in which News Corporation owns a controlling minority stake. His appointment sparked accusations of nepotism, with some commentators and shareholders feeling that the job had not been opened to outsiders and that Murdoch was too young and inexperienced to run one of the UK's top companies[11] (on appointment he was by far the youngest chief executive of a FTSE 100 company).
Following the shock resignation of his brother Lachlan Murdoch from his executive positions at News Corporation on 29 July 2005, James is widely viewed as his father's heir-apparent.[12]




Murdoch at a digital media conference in 2006


On 7 December 2007, Murdoch stepped down as CEO from BSkyB and was appointed non-executive chairman of the company (a position formerly held by his father, Rupert).[13]
In a related announcement, Murdoch also took "direct responsibility for the strategic and operational development of News Corporation's television, newspaper, and related digital assets in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East."[14] This included holdings such as News International, SKY Italia, STAR Group ltd and possibly other News Corp. related assets. He was based at News International's headquarters in Wapping, East London.
In February 2009, Murdoch was appointed a non-executive director with the British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline.[15]
In August 2009, Murdoch delivered the MacTaggart Memorial Lecture at the Edinburgh International Television Festival, in which he attacked the BBC and UK media regulator Ofcom calling the BBC's expansion "chilling" and "In this all-media marketplace, the expansion of state-sponsored journalism is a threat to the plurality and independence of news provision, which are so important for our democracy."[12][16] The BBC chairman, Sir Michael Lyons officially responded, "We have to be careful not to reduce the whole of broadcasting to some simple economic transactions. The BBC's public purposes stress the importance of the well-tested principles of educating and informing, and an impartial contribution to debate in the UK."[17]
In April 2010, Murdoch and his associate Rebekah Brooks stormed into the offices of The Independent to complain about an advertisement campaign by the newspaper.[18] The advertisement read, "Rupert Murdoch won't decide this election—you will."
In April 2014, it was announced that Murdoch would join the board of advertising start-up True[X] Media.[19]
In June 2015, his father, Rupert announced he would be leaving his position as CEO of 21st Century Fox and James will take over the position in the near future.[20]
In January 2016, Murdoch became the chairman of Sky, Britain's subscription broadcaster.[21]
In July 2017, Murdoch became an independent director on the board of Tesla. [22]
Phone hacking scandal and aftermath[edit]
On 7 July 2011, James Murdoch announced the closure of the British tabloid newspaper the News of the World in the wake of a phone hacking scandal.[23]
On 19 July 2011, along with his father, Rupert, he appeared at a hearing of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee. He appeared once again before the same committee on 10 November 2011. James maintained that until late in 2010 he was unaware that more than one "rogue reporter" from the News of the World tabloid had been involved in phone hacking.[24] This statement was challenged by the formal legal manager and editor for the newspaper, who claimed they had informed James of the "Transcript for Neville" email, a potential "smoking gun" indicating several of the newspaper's journalists may have been involved, during the settlement negotiations with Gorden Taylor in 2008 and alerted him to the potential liability if this document became public.
On 22 July 2011, Britain's prime minister, David Cameron, said that Murdoch has "questions to answer in Parliament," a day after former top executives of the News of the World accused the News Corporation executive of giving "mistaken" evidence.[25]
In November 2011, British newspapers reported that Murdoch had resigned as chairman of News Group Newspapers, the holding company above The Sun, News of the World and Times Newspapers Ltd, itself owner of The Times and The Sunday Times. News Group Newspapers is the company subject to a series of lawsuits, all related to the phone hacking scandal. James Murdoch's resignation was also said to be related to the 12 October 2011 resignation[clarification needed] of another Dow Jones executive, Andrew Langhoff, after a company whistleblower revealed an editorial scam and questionable circulation dealings at The Wall Street Journal Europe.[26][27]
In February 2012, News Corp announced that Murdoch would be stepping down as executive chairman of its British newspaper arm. The company said he would remain deputy chief operating officer of News Corp and focus on the company's international TV business,[28] including continued responsibility for BSkyB.[29] He stepped down also from the GlaxoSmithKline board.[30]
In April 2012, he stood down as chairman of BSkyB, but remained on the board.[31] He was replaced as chairman by Nicholas Ferguson.
In September 2012 Murdoch was criticised by the British Office of Communications (Ofcom), which concluded that he "repeatedly fell short of the conduct to be expected of as a chief executive and chairman" and that his lack of action in relation to phone hacking was "difficult to comprehend and ill-judged".[32]
Personal life[edit]
Murdoch was married in 2000[33] and has three children, Anneka (born 2003), Walter (born 2006), and Emerson (born 2008), with his American wife Kathryn Hufschmid Murdoch. Kathryn works for the Clinton Climate Initiative, a charitable foundation set up by the former US president, Bill Clinton in 2006.[9] In 2013, they launched Quadrivium Foundation.[34]
Murdoch was instrumental in the formation of Sky Procycling and is a keen cyclist himself.[35] He has a black belt in karate.[36]
Murdoch donated money to the Clinton Foundation, the nonprofit organization run by Chelsea, Bill and Hillary Clinton.[37]

LONDON — Sky, the British satellite television giant, has been a most elusive crown jewel for the Murdoch family.The last time a company led by Rupert Murdoch tried to acquire Sky, it was News Corporation, and the deal was abandoned amid a phone hacking scandal. Now, Mr. Murdoch, the executive co-chairman of 21st Century Fox, and his sons James and Lachlan are again vying for control of the 60.9 percent of Sky shares that 21st Century Fox does not already own. And again there are calls for British regulators to consider a scandal, this one involving sex harassment allegations at Fox News Channel in the United States that led to the ousters of Roger E. Ailes, the network’s longtime chairman, and Bill O’Reilly, its top star.On Friday, Britain postponed its regulatory review of 21st Century Fox’s proposal to take full control of Sky until after the country’s general election in June. The regulator, the Office of Communications, or Ofcom, is reviewing the potential effects of the potential acquisition on competition in the media industry and also assessing whether the combined company would be “fit and proper” to hold a broadcasting license.The government cited a shifting political timetable as the reason for the delay. Prime Minister Theresa May issued a surprise call on Tuesday for early elections to be held on June 8. When a general election approaches, officials enter a period known as purdah, during which they avoid announcements that risk influencing the outcome of the coming vote.

But the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News has cast a shadow over the British review, and vice versa. Critics of the Murdochs have been eager to draw the connection. Continue reading the main story

In a letter to Ofcom last week, Lisa Bloom, a lawyer representing Wendy Walsh, one of Mr. O’Reilly’s accusers, wrote that “the similarities between the current harassment scandal and the phone-hacking scandal reveal the company’s approach to business and management — a lack of oversight, intervention, and decency.”In its own letter to Ofcom, Color of Change, an activist group that promotes racial justice, called 21st Century Fox “a company with a deep-seated culture of systemic racial and sexual abuse.”Mr. O’Reilly has said the claims against him are unfounded.Claire Enders, founder of Enders Analysis, a media and telecom industry research company in London, said it was “inconceivable” that Mr. O’Reilly’s departure this week was unconnected to the scrutiny surrounding the takeover.“I am sure that Ofcom has asked questions about every single misconduct issue anywhere in the world, and above all in the U.S.,” she said.Ms. Enders and other analysts believe that the deal will ultimately be approved, but it is also clear that Sky is an asset the Murdochs do not want to risk losing out on a second time. That appears to be particularly true of James Murdoch, who is the chief executive of 21st Century Fox and the chairman of Sky.“It will set up his future as a chief executive officer,” Ms. Enders said.Sky is both a giant cable and broadband provider in Britain and a producer of shows like “The Young Pope,” the Jude Law vehicle that Sky developed with HBO and Canal+. It has divisions in Italy and Germany and deals with Britain’s Premier League and the Bundesliga soccer league in Germany. Its Sky Atlantic channel has rights to American hits like “Game of Thrones.”From a business perspective, the timing of the deal is good.Sky has a reasonable valuation, and it has become highly profitable. It also has direct experience with consumers that 21st Century Fox lacks, as a provider of cable and broadband services and through NowTV, its rival to Netflix. That expertise is valuable at a time when many consumers are abandoning bundled cable offerings.

“A generic problem for a lot of media companies everywhere, in the U.K. or the U.S., is, how do you crack the direct-to-consumer nut?” said Thomas Singlehurst, an analyst at Citigroup. “And here is a company that has been doing it very successfully, and that’s part of the consideration alongside the cheap valuation, the weak sterling, and the fact that the group just throws off a lot of cash.”

Mr. Singlehurst said he expected that the government would ultimately approve the deal.“At the end of the day, you do have to have proper evidence of something that has gone wrong, and that evidence has to have been provided definitively one way or the other, most likely in a court of law,” he said.With the fit-and-proper test, Ofcom is trying to determine whether the people who would be running the company are fit to do so. While relatively rare, the test is familiar to the Murdochs. The last such review by Ofcom began in 2011, and also examined the fitness of Sky, then called British Sky Broadcasting, amid a bid by News Corporation to acquire full control of the company.News Corporation has since split into two companies, including 21st Century Fox. Sky ultimately passed the review, but James Murdoch was criticized in Ofcom’s report for mishandling the hacking matter, and the proposed acquisition was abandoned.Ofcom, which is independent, will provide its latest report to Karen Bradley, the British minister for culture, media and sport, who will decide whether to abide by its recommendations. Ms. Bradley, who previously called for the competition review to be completed by May 16, said in a statement on Friday that she was extending the deadline to June 20 “given the proximity of this decision to the forthcoming general election.”It is not even certain that the review of the pending Sky deal would encompass actions that have taken place in the United States.“We’ve been listening to a range of views around what we should consider relevant to the current ‘fit and proper test,’” said Joe Smithies, a spokesman for Ofcom.Speaking generally, Mr. Smithies added: “We have an ongoing duty to be satisfied that holders of our broadcasting licenses are fit and proper, and that duty is a legal obligation from the Broadcasting Act, and it’s something we take very seriously.”“In considering whether any licensee is fit and proper, we would take into account any relevant misconduct of those who manage and control a broadcast licensee,” he said.

Tom Watson, the deputy leader of the opposition Labour Party, said in a statement that it was “important that full and proper process is followed in the assessment of this bid.”“I have consistently argued Ofcom must consider the serious and systemic corporate governance failures at Fox as part of its inquiry into whether the company should be allowed to take full control of Sky,” he added.A spokeswoman for 21st Century Fox pointed to previous statements by the company. One said the company was “confident that the proposed transaction will be approved following a thorough review process”; a second said that the company “takes its regulatory and compliance obligations very seriously. We have a strong record of compliance in all our markets, including in the U.K.”Sky declined to comment.

Five generations of the family are descended from two Scottish emigrants to Australia: the Reverend James Murdoch (1818–1884), a minister of the Free Church of Scotland and his wife Helen, née Garden (1826–1905).[1] Both were from the Pitsligo area of Aberdeenshire and emigrated to the Colony of Victoria in 1884.[1]

First generation[edit]
Helen and the Rev. James Murdoch had 14 children.[1]
Their eldest child, the Rev. Patrick Murdoch was born in Pitsligo and raised at Rosehearty, Aberdeenshire.[1][2] He was ordained at Cruden, Aberdeenshire, where he also married Annie Brown (in 1882). At the age of 34, Murdoch emigrated with his wife and parents to Victoria. He was a prominent there as a Presbyterian minister and published several books on theology. Two of Patrick and Annie Murdoch's six children achieved prominence, Sir Keith Murdoch and Ivon George Murdoch.[1]
Nora Curle Smith, née Murdoch, was born in Pitsligo and married David Curle Smith (1859–1922). A pioneering electrical engineer, David Curle Smith was in charge of the municipal electricity supply at Kalgoorlie, Western Australia during the early 20th century, invented a pioneering electric stove, which he patented in 1906.[3] To promote the stove, Nora Curle Smith wrote the world's first cookbook for electric stoves, which featured 161 recipes and operating instructions for the stove, under the name "H. Nora Curle Smith": Thermo-Electrical Cooking Made Easy (1907; reprinted 2011). Nora Curle Smith was also a noted painter.[citation needed]




Part of the main campus of Murdoch University, in Murdoch, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia. Both the university and suburb are named after Sir Walter Murdoch.


Sir Walter Murdoch KCMG, who was born at Rosehearty, was a prominent Australian academic and essayist. He married Violet Catherine Hughston in 1897. Murdoch published his first essay, "The new school of Australian poets", in 1899 and for many years he wrote a weekly column titled "Books and Men" for the Melbourne Argus (under the pen name of "Elzevir").[4] His academic career began with an appointment in 1904 as an assistant lecturer in English at Melbourne University.[citation needed] In 1913, he was appointed founding Professor of English at the University of Western Australia (UWA). During the 1920s, his essays were syndicated across Australia through the Herald & Weekly Times newspaper group run by his nephew, Sir Keith Murdoch (see below). Collections of Walter Murdoch's writings were published in book form from the 1930s onward. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael & St George (CMG) in 1939, served as Chancellor of UWA in 1943–48 and was made a Professor Emeritus upon his retirement. Violet Murdoch died in 1952 and 10 years later Murdoch remarried, to Barbara Marshall Cameron. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael & St George (KCMG) in 1964.[4]
In Perth, Sir Walter Murdoch is commemorated by the names of both Murdoch University and the suburb surrounding its main campus: Murdoch.

Third generation[edit]




Rupert Murdoch at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, 2007.


Main article: Rupert Murdoch
Rupert Murdoch AC, KSG, born in Melbourne, is a major international media proprietor – he chairs two United States-based companies that control most of his assets: News Corp and 21st Century Fox. Murdoch's career as a media proprietor began in 1952, when he inherited his father's stake in News Limited.[9] The company's only major asset was an Adelaide daily newspaper distributed only in South Australia, The News. During the 1950s and 1960s, News Ltd acquired daily and weekly newspapers, including suburban and provincial publications, throughout Australia and New Zealand. From 1968, Murdoch bought British newspapers, beginning with the weekly News of the World and the daily The Sun.[10]
Murdoch made his first acquisition in the United States in 1973, when he purchased the San Antonio Express-News. Soon afterwards, he founded a US supermarket tabloid Star, and in 1976, he purchased the New York Post.[9]
In 1981, Murdoch acquired The Times of London and The Sunday Times. He bought a major stake in 20th Century Fox in 1984, which became the basis of a new US free to air television network, Fox Broadcasting Company.[9] To satisfy a legal requirement that only US citizens could own US television stations, Murdoch became a naturalised US citizen in 1985, and consequently forfeited his Australian citizenship.[11][12]
During the 1980s and 1990s, Murdoch became involved in pay television interests throughout the world, including STAR TV and Tata Sky in Asia and BSkyB, Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland in Europe. NewsCorp also came to control both a major international publishing house HarperCollins, and Dow Jones & Company, which includes The Wall Street Journal.[citation needed]
Rupert Murdoch has been married four times and has six children:

1956–1967: to Patricia Booker, a flight attendant from Melbourne, with whom he had one child, Mrs Prudence MacLeod.[13][14][15]
1967–1999: to Anna Torv (later Anna Murdoch Mann; born 1944),[13] a Scottish journalist of Estonian descent, who worked on Murdoch's Sydney Daily Telegraph, later published two novels and is the aunt of actress Anna Torv.[15] Torv and Murdoch had three children, Elisabeth Murdoch junior (b. 1968), Lachlan Keith Murdoch (b. 1971) and James Rupert Jacob Murdoch, also known as James R. Murdoch (b. 1972).[13][14]

Members of the Murdoch family are prominent as international media proprietors, especially in Australia, the United Kingdom and United States. Some members have also been prominent in the arts, clergy and military in Australia.
Five generations of the family are descended from two Scottish emigrants to Australia: the Reverend James Murdoch (1818–1884), a minister of the Free Church of Scotland and his wife Helen, née Garden (1826–1905).[1] Both were from the Pitsligo area of Aberdeenshire and emigrated to the Colony of Victoria in 1884.[1]

History[edit]




Prof. Walter Murdoch (left) and family at Point Lonsdale, Victoria, in 1910. His wife, Violet (née Hughston) is upper centre. Their daughter, Catherine – as Catherine King a prominent broadcaster – is centre right and son William (Will) Murdoch is on the right.


First generation[edit]
Helen and the Rev. James Murdoch had 14 children.[1]
Their eldest child, the Rev. Patrick Murdoch was born in Pitsligo and raised at Rosehearty, Aberdeenshire.[1][2] He was ordained at Cruden, Aberdeenshire, where he also married Annie Brown (in 1882). At the age of 34, Murdoch emigrated with his wife and parents to Victoria. He was a prominent there as a Presbyterian minister and published several books on theology. Two of Patrick and Annie Murdoch's six children achieved prominence, Sir Keith Murdoch and Ivon George Murdoch.[1]
Nora Curle Smith, née Murdoch, was born in Pitsligo and married David Curle Smith (1859–1922). A pioneering electrical engineer, David Curle Smith was in charge of the municipal electricity supply at Kalgoorlie, Western Australia during the early 20th century, invented a pioneering electric stove, which he patented in 1906.[3] To promote the stove, Nora Curle Smith wrote the world's first cookbook for electric stoves, which featured 161 recipes and operating instructions for the stove, under the name "H. Nora Curle Smith": Thermo-Electrical Cooking Made Easy (1907; reprinted 2011). Nora Curle Smith was also a noted painter.[citation needed]




Part of the main campus of Murdoch University, in Murdoch, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia. Both the university and suburb are named after Sir Walter Murdoch.


Sir Walter Murdoch KCMG, who was born at Rosehearty, was a prominent Australian academic and essayist. He married Violet Catherine Hughston in 1897. Murdoch published his first essay, "The new school of Australian poets", in 1899 and for many years he wrote a weekly column titled "Books and Men" for the Melbourne Argus (under the pen name of "Elzevir").[4] His academic career began with an appointment in 1904 as an assistant lecturer in English at Melbourne University.[citation needed] In 1913, he was appointed founding Professor of English at the University of Western Australia (UWA). During the 1920s, his essays were syndicated across Australia through the Herald & Weekly Times newspaper group run by his nephew, Sir Keith Murdoch (see below). Collections of Walter Murdoch's writings were published in book form from the 1930s onward. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael & St George (CMG) in 1939, served as Chancellor of UWA in 1943–48 and was made a Professor Emeritus upon his retirement. Violet Murdoch died in 1952 and 10 years later Murdoch remarried, to Barbara Marshall Cameron. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael & St George (KCMG) in 1964.[4]
In Perth, Sir Walter Murdoch is commemorated by the names of both Murdoch University and the suburb surrounding its main campus: Murdoch.
Second generation[edit]




Sir Keith Murdoch (1885–1952).


Main articles: Sir Keith Murdoch, Ivon Murdoch, William David Murdoch, and Catherine Helen King
Keith Arthur Murdoch, later Sir Keith Murdoch, was born in West Melbourne and grew up in the Melbourne suburb of Camberwell.[5] He became prominent as a journalist, while serving as a war correspondent during World War I. In 1921, Murdoch was appointed chief editor of the Melbourne Herald and in 1928 became managing director of its parent company, The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd. That same year he married Elisabeth Joy Greene (1909–2012), who was later prominent as the philanthropist Dame Elisabeth Murdoch AC, DBE (1909–2012). Murdoch was knighted in 1933. During World War II, Sir Keith Murdoch served briefly in an Australian government role, as Director-General of Information.[6]
Lieutenant Ivon George Murdoch MC and bar, saw action with the 8th Battalion (AIF) on the Western Front during World War I.[7][8] Ivon Murdoch achieved the rare distinction of twice being awarded the Military Cross (MC) for bravery; his first resulted from him leading extended night patrols, during March and April 1918, south-east of Ypres in No Man's Land and behind German lines, which captured a pillbox and returned wounded men to Australian positions.[citation needed] The second MC was awarded for actions during August 1918 that: successfully defended recently captured German field guns near Rosieres and; set up a machine gun enfilade, during the Battle of Lihons (part of the Hundred Days Offensive). After the war, Ivon Murdoch was a farmer at Wantabadgery, New South Wales.[citation needed]
The children of Andrew Chrystal Murdoch and Annie Murdoch (née Esler) included a prominent concert pianist, William David Murdoch (born 1888, Bendigo, Victoria – died 1942, Holmbury St Mary, England),[citation needed]
A daughter of Sir Walter and Violet Murdoch, Dr Catherine King (née Murdoch) MBE (born 1904, Surrey Hills, Victoria – died 2000), was a pioneering radio broadcaster in Western Australia.[citation needed]
Third generation[edit]




Rupert Murdoch at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, 2007.


Main article: Rupert Murdoch
Rupert Murdoch AC, KSG, born in Melbourne, is a major international media proprietor – he chairs two United States-based companies that control most of his assets: News Corp and 21st Century Fox. Murdoch's career as a media proprietor began in 1952, when he inherited his father's stake in News Limited.[9] The company's only major asset was an Adelaide daily newspaper distributed only in South Australia, The News. During the 1950s and 1960s, News Ltd acquired daily and weekly newspapers, including suburban and provincial publications, throughout Australia and New Zealand. From 1968, Murdoch bought British newspapers, beginning with the weekly News of the World and the daily The Sun.[10]
Murdoch made his first acquisition in the United States in 1973, when he purchased the San Antonio Express-News. Soon afterwards, he founded a US supermarket tabloid Star, and in 1976, he purchased the New York Post.[9]
In 1981, Murdoch acquired The Times of London and The Sunday Times. He bought a major stake in 20th Century Fox in 1984, which became the basis of a new US free to air television network, Fox Broadcasting Company.[9] To satisfy a legal requirement that only US citizens could own US television stations, Murdoch became a naturalised US citizen in 1985, and consequently forfeited his Australian citizenship.[11][12]
During the 1980s and 1990s, Murdoch became involved in pay television interests throughout the world, including STAR TV and Tata Sky in Asia and BSkyB, Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland in Europe. NewsCorp also came to control both a major international publishing house HarperCollins, and Dow Jones & Company, which includes The Wall Street Journal.[citation needed]
Rupert Murdoch has been married four times and has six children:

1956–1967: to Patricia Booker, a flight attendant from Melbourne, with whom he had one child, Mrs Prudence MacLeod.[13][14][15]
1967–1999: to Anna Torv (later Anna Murdoch Mann; born 1944),[13] a Scottish journalist of Estonian descent, who worked on Murdoch's Sydney Daily Telegraph, later published two novels and is the aunt of actress Anna Torv.[15] Torv and Murdoch had three children, Elisabeth Murdoch junior (b. 1968), Lachlan Keith Murdoch (b. 1971) and James Rupert Jacob Murdoch, also known as James R. Murdoch (b. 1972).[13][14]
1999–2013 to Wendi Deng, a Chinese-US media executive and company director,[16] They have two daughters.
2016– to Jerry Hall.[citation needed]

Both Prue and Alasdair MacLeod hold or have held directorial and/or executive roles within the News Corporation empire.

        James Murdoch says 'Empire' Pepsi story hits the spot 

         by Brian Stelter   @brianstelter   November 19, 2015: 8:19 PM ET                  
Pepsi's insertion into Fox's hit show "Empire" is exactly what James Murdoch wants to see more of.  Murdoch, who's been the CEO of 21st Century Fox for nearly five months, is becoming more and more vocal about how the TV advertising model has to change — and fast.     His view is that consumers are less and less willing to accept three or four minutes of ads interrupting their favorite shows every seven or eight minutes.   "What we haven't seen enough of is a lot of ad innovation," he said at a Paley Center conference Thursday morning.   Murdoch praised the producers of "Empire" for a "creative collaboration" with Pepsi that started on Wednesday night's show and will continue for several weeks. It involves a character shooting a commercial for Pepsi, and the finished product will eventually air right inside the episode.    "It's not something that's inauthentic," Murdoch said. "It's something that works in the narrative of the show and pushes the narrative forward."   Related: James on Lachlan Murdoch: 'I don't think we bicker'   He pointed out that a product integration like Pepsi's can't be avoided through ad fast-forwarding.   Murdoch wants more experimentation a la Hulu's new ad-free option, which lets streaming TV subscribers pay an extra $4 a month to remove practically all the ads from the service.   At the conference on Thursday, Murdoch said he couldn't reveal specifics about how many people have paid for it, but he said the ad-free option has conditioned users to think differently about the service as a whole.   "Once you give people the choice," he said, "the people who stay with the limited ad load complain less about the ads, because they've actually consciously made that choice."   Related: Rupert Murdoch to turn over Fox to his sons   He said they perceive that by sitting through the ads, "I'm saving $4."   "We shouldn't be afraid of that," Murdoch said. "We should always trust the customers."   Murdoch praised another Hulu feature: The choice to view one long, special ad before a show to avoid any interruptions later.   "You actually end up thanking the sponsor for giving you an ad-free experience," he said.   Hulu has been pioneering such changes to the ad model for years, but now, with Murdoch making the subject a priority, it is getting more attention.   Media executives like Murdoch are increasingly concerned that Netflix -- which is ad-free -- is conditioning a generation of viewers to want TV without interruptions.   Related: 'Empire' reigns with huge season 2 premiere   Murdoch said the industry should not "give up on advertising in any way," but must work hard to "earn the attention of customers."   His comments doubled as an argument for why TV-style advertising should be more highly valued than digital ads on sprawling social networks on Facebook.   Streaming TV sites like Hulu can offer "immersive full-screen experiences," he said, while barely-visible ads on Facebook make no lasting impression.
