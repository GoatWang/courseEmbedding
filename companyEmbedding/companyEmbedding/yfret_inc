About Us - YFret




































































	
		The YFret Mission		
				
	



Our mission is to drastically simplify the life of an eCommerce marketer by abstracting sophisticated data-driven technology into a very simple “Marketing assistant for eCommerce” Our goal is three clicks to an engaging and relevant campaign.











Buyers are bombarded with promotions from retailers. For a brand to stand out and engage them, they must keep up, with content that is dynamic, fresh, contextual, personalized, and relevant. This is a constantly moving target and impossible to achieve without the right tools.
We have worked very closely with eCommerce marketers and seen the number of things that they have to handle in a day. They are brimming with ideas on engaging customers, but limited by the tools available to make this possible.
YFret’s marketing assistant for eCommerce was developed by an agile and innovative technology team, passionate about solving difficult problems and backed by experts in the marketing world.
