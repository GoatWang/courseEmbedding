It has been 2 months since I got my car with Fifth Third Bank and I am yet to get a statement from them. With my social security I figured my first payment was due two weeks ago but I dont even know my account number! I have tried for DAYS to get a hold of someone but nobody picks up the phone HORRIBLE service. I am trying to pay them and I can't get a hold of them. This should be the easiest way to get a hold of someone...to give them money.

Amended and Restated

Trust Agreement
(2013-A)







Trust Estate and the making of
distributions to the Certificateholders and the
Noteholders.

The Owner Trustee is hereby
authorized to engage in the foregoing activities on behalf of the
Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Owner Trustee on behalf of the
Issuer shall engage in any activity other than in connection with
the foregoing or other than as required or authorized by the terms
of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.

SECTION 2.4 Appointment of the
Owner Trustee . The Depositor hereby appoints the Owner Trustee
as trustee of the Issuer effective as of the date hereof, to have
all the rights, powers and duties set forth herein.

SECTION 2.5 Initial Capital

Trust . The Owner Trustee hereby declares that it will hold the

herein for the use and benefit of the Certificateholders, subject
to the obligations of the Issuer under the Transaction Documents.
It is the intention of the parties hereto that the Issuer
constitute a statutory trust under the Statutory Trust Act and that
(i) this Agreement constitute the governing instrument of such
statutory trust and (ii) for United States federal, state and
local income, franchise and value added tax purposes, the Issuer
shall be treated as a grantor trust of the type described in
Treasury Regulation section 301.7701-4(c), with the assets of the
Issuer constituting the Receivables and other assets held by the
Issuer, and the Notes constituting non-recourse debt of the
Certificateholder(s), provided that if it is successfully asserted
by the appropriate tax authorities that the Issuer is not properly
characterized as a grantor trust of the type described in Treasury
Regulation section 301.7701-4(c), the Issuer shall be treated, for
United States federal, state and local income, franchise and value
added tax purposes, as (A) a disregarded entity if there is
only one beneficial owner of the Certificates and any Notes that
are treated as equity in the Issuer, or (B) a partnership
(other than an association or publicly traded partnership taxable
as a corporation) if there is more than one beneficial owner of the
Certificates and any Notes that are treated as equity in the
Issuer, with the assets of the partnership being the Receivables
and other assets held by the Issuer, the partners of the
partnership being the Certificateholders and the holders of the
Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer, and the remaining
Notes constituting indebtedness of the partnership. The parties
hereto and each Certificateholder, by acceptance of a Certificate,
agree to treat the Issuer in accordance with the intention that the
Issuer be characterized as a grantor trust of the type described in
Treasury Regulation section 301.7701-4(c) and, unless otherwise
required by appropriate taxing authorities or by law, not to take
any action or, direct any other party to take any action,
inconsistent therewith, including, but not limited to, modifying,
or directing any other party to modify, the terms of a Receivable
unless the modification is a Permitted Modification. The provisions
of this Trust Agreement shall be interpreted consistent with and to
further this intention of the parties. The parties agree that,
unless otherwise required by appropriate tax authorities, the
Issuer will file or cause to be filed

Amended and Restated

Trust Agreement
(2013-A)






annual or other necessary tax returns, reports
and other forms consistent with the foregoing characterization of
the Issuer for United States federal, state and local income,
franchise and value added tax purposes. No election will be made by
or on behalf of the Issuer to be classified as an association
taxable as a corporation for United States federal income tax
purposes. Effective as of the date hereof, the Owner Trustee shall
have all rights, powers and duties set forth herein and, to the
extent not inconsistent herewith, in the Statutory Trust Act with
respect to accomplishing the purposes of the Issuer. The Owner
Trustee filed the Certificate of Trust with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware as required by Section 3810(a) of the
Statutory Trust Act, such filing hereby being ratified and approved
in all respects. Notwithstanding anything herein or in the
Statutory Trust Act to the contrary, it is the intention of the
parties hereto that the Issuer constitute a “business
trust” within the meaning of Section 101(9)(A)(v) of the
Bankruptcy Code.

SECTION 2.7 Organizational
Expenses; Liabilities of the Holders .

(a) The Servicer shall pay
organizational expenses of the Issuer as they may arise.

the Depositor) shall have any personal liability for any liability
or obligation of the Issuer.

SECTION 2.8 Title to the Trust
Estate . Legal title to all the Trust Estate shall be vested at
all times in the Issuer as a separate legal entity.

SECTION 2.9 Representations and
Warranties of the Depositor . The Depositor hereby represents
and warrants to the Owner Trustee that:

(a) Existence and Power . The
Depositor is a limited liability company validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has, in
all material respects, all power and authority required to carry on
its business as now conducted. The Depositor has obtained all
necessary licenses and approvals in each jurisdiction where the
failure to do so would materially and adversely affect the ability
of the Depositor to perform its obligations under the Transaction
Documents.

(b) Authorization and No
Contravention . The execution, delivery and performance by the
Depositor of each Transaction Document to which it is a party
(i) have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the
part of the Depositor and (ii) do not contravene or constitute
a default under (A) any applicable law, rule or regulation,
(B) its organizational instruments or (C) any material
agreement, contract, order or other instrument to which it is a
party or its property is subject (other than violations of such
laws, rules, regulations, indenture or agreements which do not
affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any of such
agreements and which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
materially and adversely affect the transactions contemplated by,
or the Depositor’s ability to perform its obligations under,
the Transaction Documents to which it is a party).

Amended and Restated

Trust Agreement
(2013-A)







(c) No Consent Required . No
approval, authorization or other action by, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance by the Depositor of any
Transaction Document other than (i) UCC filings,
(ii) approvals and authorizations that have previously been
obtained and filings which have previously been made and
(iii) approvals, authorizations or filings which, if not
obtained or made, would not have a material adverse effect on the
ability of the Depositor to perform its obligations under the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party.

(d) Binding Effect . Each
Transaction Document to which the Depositor is a party constitutes
the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Depositor
enforceable against the Depositor in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, receivership,
conservatorship or other similar laws affecting creditors’
rights generally and, if applicable the rights of creditors of
limited liability companies from time to time in effect or by
general principles of equity or other similar laws of general
application relating to or affecting the enforcement of
creditors’ rights generally and subject to general principles
of equity.

(e) No Proceedings . There is
no action, suit, Proceeding or investigation pending or, to the
knowledge of the Depositor, threatened against the Depositor which,
either in any one instance or in the aggregate, would result in any
material adverse change in the business, operations, financial
condition, properties or assets of the Depositor, or in any
material impairment of the right or ability of the Depositor to
carry on its business substantially as now conducted, or in any
material liability on the part of the Depositor, or which would
render invalid this Agreement or the Receivables or the obligations
of the Depositor contemplated herein, or which would materially
impair the ability of the Depositor to perform under the terms of
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document.

(f) Situs of Issuer . The
Issuer shall be located in the State of Delaware (it being
understood that the Issuer may have bank accounts located and
maintained outside of Delaware).

ARTICLE III

. Upon the formation of the Issuer and until the issuance of the
Certificates, the Depositor shall be the sole beneficiary of the
Issuer; and upon the issuance of the initial Certificate, the
Depositor will no longer be a beneficiary of the Issuer, except to
the extent that the Depositor is a Certificateholder.

Trust Agreement
(2013-A)







SECTION 3.2 Authentication of
Certificates . (a) Concurrently with the sale of the
Transferred Assets to the Issuer pursuant to the Sale Agreement,
the Owner Trustee shall cause the initial Certificate to be
executed on behalf of the Issuer, authenticated and delivered to or
upon the written order of the Depositor, signed by its chairman of
the board, its president, its chief financial officer, its chief
accounting officer, any vice president, its secretary, any
assistant secretary, its treasurer or any assistant treasurer,
without further corporate action by the Depositor.

(b) The Certificates shall represent
100% of the beneficial interest in the Issuer and shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be fully paid and
nonassessable.

SECTION 3.3 Form of the
Certificates . The initial Certificate, upon issuance, will be
a typewritten, definitive Certificate, substantially in the form of
Exhibit A hereto and shall be registered in the name of
Fifth Third Holdings Funding, LLC or its nominee as the initial
registered owner thereof.

SECTION 3.4 Registration of
Certificates . The Owner Trustee, in its capacity as
“Certificate Registrar” shall maintain at its office
referred to in Section 2.2 , or at the office of any
agent appointed by it and approved in writing by the
Certificateholders at the time of such appointment, a register (the
“ Certificate Register ”) for the registration
and transfer of any Certificate, and the Owner Trustee or such
agent shall promptly notify the Indenture Trustee of any change in
the registered ownership of a Certificate. Prior to the presentment
for registration of transfer of any Certificate, the Owner Trustee
and the Indenture Trustee or any agent of the Owner Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee and the Depositor may treat the Person in whose
name any Certificate is registered (as of the applicable Record
Date) as the owner of such Certificate for the purpose of receiving
distributions on such Certificate and for all other purposes
whatsoever and unless the Certificate Register is notified of such
change in ownership the only available recourse such transferee
shall have shall be to the person in whose name the related
Certificate is registered. For the avoidance of doubt, the records
maintained by the Owner Trustee in the Certificate Register with
respect to each Certificate and its related registered owner are
intended to cause the Certificates to be issued in registered form,
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation section 5f.103-1(c), and
shall record (a) the Percentage Interest in all of the assets
of and the right to distributions from, the Issuer evidenced by
each Certificate and (b) all distributions made to each
Certificateholder with respect to the Issuer’s
assets.

SECTION 3.5 Transfer of
Certificates . (a) Any Certificateholder may assign,
convey or otherwise transfer all or any of its right, title and
interest in the related Certificate; provided ,
that:

(i) (a) such transferee is either an
Affiliate of the Depositor or (b) (1) is a Qualified
Institutional Buyer, (2) is aware that the sale of the
Certificates to it is being made in reliance on the exemption from
registration provided by Rule 144A, and (3) is acquiring the
Certificates for its own account or for one or more accounts, each
of which is a Qualified Institutional Buyer, and as to each of
which the owner exercises sole investment discretion or for resale
pursuant to Rule 144A;

(2013-A)







(ii) such transferee understands
that the Certificates will bear the applicable legends set forth in
Section 3.5(g) ;

(iii) such transferee understands
that the Certificates are being offered only in a transaction not
involving any public offering in the United States within the
meaning of the Securities Act, none of the Certificates have been
or will be registered under the Securities Act, and, if in the
future the transferee decides to offer, resell, pledge or otherwise
transfer the Certificates, such Certificates may only be offered,
resold, pledged or otherwise transferred in accordance with this
Agreement and the applicable legend on such Certificates set forth
below;

(iv) such transferee understands
that an investment in the Certificates involves certain risks,
including the risk of loss of all or a substantial part of its
investment under certain circumstances. The transferee has had
access to such financial and other information concerning the
Issuer and the Certificates as it deemed necessary or appropriate
in order to make an informed investment decision with respect to
its purchase of the Certificates. The transferee has such knowledge
and experience in financial and business matters that the
transferee is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
investment in the Certificates, and the transferee and any accounts
for which it is acting are each able to bear the economic risk of
the holder’s or of its investment;

(v) such transferee will not offer,
transfer, pledge, sell or otherwise dispose of the Certificates or
any interest in the Certificates to any Person in any manner, or
solicit any offer to buy, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of
the Certificates or any interest in the Certificates from any
Person in any manner, or make any general solicitation by means of
general advertising or in any other manner, or take any other
action that would constitute a distribution of the Certificates
under the Securities Act or that would render the disposition of
the Certificates a violation of Section 5 of the Securities
Act or any other applicable securities laws or require registration
pursuant thereto, and will not authorize any Person to act on its
behalf, in such manner with respect to the Certificates;

(vi) the Owner Trustee and the
Issuer determine (based on the advice of counsel or such other
information as they deem necessary or advisable) that the transfer
complies with the requirements of clauses (d)  and
(e)  of this Section 3.5 ;

(vii) such Certificate may not be
acquired by or for the account of or with the assets of a Benefit
Plan or a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan which is
subject to any Similar Law;

(viii) the transferee provides a
Certificate Investor Representation Letter substantially in the
form of Exhibit B ; and

(ix) such transferee acknowledges
that the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Placement Agent and others
will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the

Trust Agreement
(2013-A)







acknowledgements, representations,
warranties and agreements in this Section 3.5 and
agrees that if any of the acknowledgements, representations,
warranties or agreements made by it in connection with its purchase
of the Certificates are no longer accurate, the transferee will
promptly notify the Issuer, the Owner Trustee and the Placement
Agent.

Each Certificateholder will
represent and warrant that it is not (and will not be) a Benefit
Plan or a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan which is
subject to any Similar Law and is not (and will not be) accepting
or holding such Certificate (or any interest therein) on behalf of
or with assets of a Benefit Plan or a governmental, non-U.S. or
church plan which is subject to Similar Law. The Owner Trustee
shall have no duty to independently determine that the requirement
in (vi) above is met and shall incur no liability to any
Person in the event the Certificateholder does not comply with such
restrictions. Subject to the transfer restrictions contained herein
and in the Certificates, any Certificateholder may transfer all or
any portion of the Percentage Interest evidenced by such
Certificate upon surrender thereof to the Owner Trustee accompanied
by the documents required by this Section. Such transfer may be
made by a registered Certificateholder in person or by his attorney
duly authorized in writing upon surrender of the Certificate to the
Owner Trustee accompanied by (a) a written instrument of
transfer in the form of the “Assignment” attached to
the Form of Certificate attached hereto as Exhibit A and
with such signature guarantees and evidence of authority of the
Persons signing the instrument of transfer as the Owner Trustee may
reasonably require; provided, however , that the Owner
Trustee shall not require the signature of the Depositor to be
medallion guaranteed for the transfers from the Depositor to the
applicable transferees on the date hereof, (b) an executed
direction letter regarding registration of such transfer in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit D , and (c) the
documents required by Sections 3.5(a)(viii) and
3.5(e) hereof. Promptly upon the receipt of such documents
and receipt by the Owner Trustee of the transferor’s
Certificate, the Owner Trustee shall record the name of such
transferee as a Certificateholder and its Percentage Interest in
the Certificate Register and issue, execute and deliver to such
Certificateholder a Certificate evidencing such Percentage
Interest. In the event a transferor transfers only a portion of its
Percentage Interest, the Owner Trustee shall register and issue to
such transferor a new Certificate evidencing such
transferor’s new Percentage Interest and shall issue, execute
and deliver to such transferee a new Certificate evidencing such
transferee’s Percentage Interest. Subsequent to each transfer
of beneficial interest and upon the issuance of the new Certificate
or Certificates, the Owner Trustee shall cancel and destroy the
Certificate surrendered to it in connection with such transfer. The
Owner Trustee may treat, for all purposes whatsoever (other than
for purposes of clauses (d)  and (e)  of
this Section 3.5 ), the Person in whose name any
Certificate is registered as the sole owner of the Percentage
Interest evidenced by such Certificate.

(b) As a condition precedent to any
registration of transfer under this Section 3.5 , the
Owner Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover
the payment of any tax or taxes or other governmental charges
required to be paid in connection with such transfer.

(c) The Owner Trustee shall not be
obligated to register any transfer of a Certificate unless the
transferee has certified to the Owner Trustee that such transfer
does not

violate any of the transfer restrictions stated
herein including, but not limited to clauses (d)  and
(e)  of this Section 3.5 . The Owner
Trustee shall not be liable to any Person for registering any
transfer based on such certifications.

(d) No transfer shall be permitted
if such transfer is effected through an established securities
market or secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof)
within the meaning of Code section 7704 and any proposed, temporary
or final Treasury regulations thereunder.

(e) Each registered owner of and, if
different, each owner of a beneficial interest in, a Certificate
that is a “United States person” (as defined in Code
section 7701(a)(30)) shall deliver to the Owner Trustee, the
Administrator and the Certificate Paying Agent two properly
completed and duly executed originals of U.S. Internal Revenue
Service Form W-9 (or applicable successor form) certifying that it
is not subject to backup withholding. Each registered owner of and,
if different, each owner of a beneficial interest in, a Certificate
that is not a “United States person” shall deliver to
the Owner Trustee, the Administrator and the Certificate Paying
Agent two properly completed and duly executed originals of U.S.
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (Certification of Foreign
Status as Beneficial Owner), IRS Form W-8IMY (Certification of
Foreign Intermediary Status) or IRS Form W-8ECI (Certification of
Foreign Person’s Claim for Exemption from Withholding on
Income Effectively Connected with Conduct of a U.S. Trade or
Business), or any successors to such IRS forms (i) to permit
the Owner Trustee, the Administrator and the Certificate Paying
Agent to make payments to the purchaser without, or at a reduced
rate of, withholding, (ii) to enable the Issuer to qualify for
a reduced rate of withholding in any jurisdiction from or through
which the Issuer receives payments on its assets, or (iii) to
enable the Owner Trustee, the Administrator and the Certificate
Paying Agent to satisfy any reporting or other obligations under
any applicable tax law, and will update or replace such form,
certification or other information as necessary in accordance with
its terms or its subsequent amendments.

The applicable Internal Revenue
Service forms required to be delivered, as described above, shall
be delivered on or prior to the date on which a Certificateholder
becomes a Certificateholder under this Agreement and from time to
time thereafter as prescribed by applicable law or upon the request
of the Certificate Paying Agent.

In addition, each registered owner
of and, if different, each owner of a beneficial interest in, a
Certificate that is not a “United States person” within
the meaning of section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, shall submit a
statement certifying that it is not a “controlled foreign
corporation” that is related to the Issuer, within the
meaning of section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code.

Each purchaser, beneficial owner and
subsequent transferee of a Certificate or an interest therein shall
provide to the Issuer and the Owner Trustee, on or prior to, and
after, the date of its acquisition of a Certificate or beneficial
interest, any information requested by the Issuer and the Owner
Trustee as is necessary (as determined in the sole discretion of
the Issuer or the Owner Trustee, as applicable) for the Issuer and
the Owner Trustee to determine the obligations of any party under
this Agreement pursuant to Code sections 1471-1474 (the “
FATCA Provisions ”), including whether such purchaser,
beneficial owner or transferee is a U.S. Person or a
non-U.S.

person, and if such purchaser, beneficial owner
or transferee is a non-U.S. person whether it is a foreign
financial institution (“ FFI ”) as defined in
Code section 1471(d)(4) or a non-financial foreign entity as
defined in Code section 1472(d) (“ non-FFI
”).

If a purchaser, beneficial owner or
transferee of a Certificate is, or would be, a FFI, such FFI shall
represent (or shall be deemed by acceptance of its Certificate or
interest therein to represent) to the Issuer and Owner Trustee that
it has met (or will meet as soon as applicable guidance is issued
by the IRS) the reporting requirements of Code section 1471(b)
(“ FFI Reporting Obligations ”), and such FFI
shall further represent and agree that it shall continue to meet
its FFI Reporting Obligations and has not made (and will not
make) the election to be withheld upon pursuant to Code
section 1471(b)(3). If a purchaser, beneficial owner or transferee
of a Certificate is, or would be, a non-FFI such non-FFI shall,
when applicable law requires a non-FFI to meet the reporting
requirements of Code section 1472(b) either (i) represent (or
shall be deemed by acceptance of its Certificate or interest
therein to represent) to the Issuer and Owner Trustee that it does
not have (or will not have as soon as applicable guidance is issued
by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service) any substantial United States
owners within the meaning of Code section 1472(b)(1)(A) or
(ii) provide to the Issuer and Owner Trustee the name,
address, and taxpayer identification number of each of its
substantial United States owners and any other information required
by Code section 1472.

Each purchaser, beneficial owner and
subsequent transferee of Certificates or an interest therein will
be required or deemed to acknowledge that the Issuer may provide
such information and any other information concerning its
investment in the Certificates to the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service. In addition, each purchaser, beneficial owner and
subsequent transferee of Certificates or an interest therein will
be required or deemed to understand and acknowledge that the Issuer
has the right, hereunder, to withhold on any beneficial owner of an
interest in a Certificate that fails to comply with the foregoing
requirements.

(f) If a Responsible Officer of
Owner Trustee becomes aware that (1) a transfer or attempted
or purported transfer of any Certificate or interest therein was
consummated in compliance with the provisions of this
Section 3.5 on the basis of a materially incorrect
certification from the transferor or purported transferee,
(2) a transferee failed to deliver to the Owner Trustee the
certificate required to be delivered under
Section 3.5(a)(viii) or (3) the Certificateholder of any
Certificate or interest therein is in material breach of any
representation or agreement set forth in any certificate or any
deemed representation or agreement of such Certificateholder, the
Owner Trustee will direct the Certificate Registrar not to register
such attempted or purported transfer and, if a transfer has been
registered, such transfer shall be absolutely null and void ab
initio and shall not operate to transfer any rights to the
purported transferee (such purported transferee, a
“Disqualified Transferee”) and the last preceding
Certificateholder of such Certificateholder that was not a
Disqualified Transferee shall be restored to all rights as a
Certificateholder thereof retroactively to the date of the
purported transfer of such Certificate by such
Certificateholder.

(g) Each Certificate will bear a
legend to the following effect:

“THIS CERTIFICATE HAS NOT BEEN
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE
“SECURITIES ACT”) OR ANY OTHER APPLICABLE SECURITIES OR
“BLUE SKY” LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION. THE
HOLDER HEREOF, BY PURCHASING THIS CERTIFICATE, AGREES THAT THIS
CERTIFICATE MAY BE RESOLD, ASSIGNED, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFERRED ONLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS
OF THE SECURITIES ACT OR ANY OTHER APPLICABLE SECURITIES OR
“BLUE SKY” LAWS AND ONLY PURSUANT TO RULE 144A UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT (“RULE 144A”) TO A PERSON THAT THE
HOLDER REASONABLY BELIEVES IS A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER
WITHIN THE MEANING OF RULE 144A (A “QIB”), PURCHASING
FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR THE ACCOUNT OF A QIB, WHOM THE HOLDER HAS
INFORMED THAT THE REOFFER, RESALE OR OTHER TRANSFER IS BEING MADE
IN RELIANCE ON RULE 144A.”

SECTION 3.6 Lost, Stolen,
Mutilated or Destroyed Certificates . If (i) any mutilated
Certificate is surrendered to the Owner Trustee, or (ii) the
Owner Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction that any
Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, and upon proof of
ownership satisfactory to the Owner Trustee together with such
security or indemnity on behalf of the Issuer as may be requested
by the Owner Trustee to save it harmless, then, in the absence of
notice to the Owner Trustee that such Certificate has been acquired
by a protected purchaser, the Owner Trustee shall execute and
deliver a new Certificate for the same Percentage Interest in the
Issuer as the Certificate so mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen,
of like tenor and bearing a different issue number, with such
notations, if any, as the Owner Trustee shall determine. Upon the
issuance of any new Certificate under this Section 3.6
, the Issuer or Owner Trustee may require the payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may
be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of the
Certificate and any other reasonable expenses (including the
reasonable fees and expenses of the Issuer and the Owner Trustee)
connected therewith. If, after the delivery of such new Certificate
a protected purchaser of the original Certificate in lieu of which
such new Certificate was issued presents such original Certificate
for transfer or payment, the Issuer and Owner Trustee shall be
entitled to recover such new Certificate from the Person to whom it
was delivered or any Person taking title therefrom, except a
protected purchaser, and the Issuer and Owner Trustee shall be
entitled to recover upon the security or indemnity provided
therefor to the extent of any loss, damage, cost or expense
incurred by the Issuer and Owner Trustee, in connection therewith.
Any duplicate Certificate issued pursuant to this
Section 3.6 shall constitute complete and indefeasible
evidence of ownership in the Issuer, as if originally issued,
whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate shall be
found at any time. The provisions of this Section 3.6 are
exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other
rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of
mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen
Certificates.

SECTION 3.7 Appointment of the
Certificate Paying Agent . The Certificate Paying Agent shall
make distributions to Certificateholders from the Certificate
Distribution Account pursuant to Section 5.5 and shall
report the amounts of such distributions to the Owner Trustee and
the Servicer. Any Certificate Paying Agent shall have the revocable
power to withdraw funds from the Certificate Distribution Account
for the purpose of making the distributions referred to above. The
Owner Trustee may revoke such power and remove the

its sole discretion that the Certificate Paying Agent shall have
failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement in any
material respect. The Certificate Paying Agent shall initially be
Wilmington Trust, National Association, and any co-paying agent
chosen by the Certificate Paying Agent. Wilmington Trust, National
Association shall be permitted to resign as Certificate Paying
Agent upon thirty (30) days’ written notice to the Owner
Trustee. If Wilmington Trust, National Association shall no longer
be the Certificate Paying Agent, the Administrator shall appoint a
successor to act as Certificate Paying Agent (which shall be a bank
or a trust company). The Administrator shall cause such successor
Certificate Paying Agent or any additional Certificate Paying Agent
appointed by the Administrator to execute and deliver to the Owner
Trustee a written agreement in which such successor Certificate
Paying Agent or additional Certificate Paying Agent shall agree
with the Owner Trustee that, as Certificate Paying Agent, such
successor Certificate Paying Agent or additional Certificate Paying
Agent shall hold all sums, if any, held by it for payment to the
Certificateholders in trust for the benefit of the
Certificateholders entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid
to such Certificateholders. Subject to applicable laws, with
respect to the escheat of funds, the Certificate Paying Agent shall
return all funds that have remained unclaimed by a
Certificateholder for two years to the Owner Trustee. Immediately
upon its removal, a Certificate Paying Agent shall return all funds
(including any unclaimed funds) in its possession to the Owner
Trustee. The rights, protections and indemnities of the Owner
Trustee under Article VII and Section 8.2 and
9.2 of this Agreement shall apply to the Owner Trustee also
in its role as Certificate Paying Agent for so long as the Owner
Trustee shall act as Certificate Paying Agent and, to the extent
applicable, to any other paying agent appointed hereunder. Any

surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange, and where
notices and demands to or upon the Issuer in respect of the
Certificates and this Agreement may be served. The Issuer hereby
initially appoints the Owner Trustee to serve as its agent for the
foregoing purposes. The Issuer shall give prompt written notice to
the Owner Trustee of the location, and of any change in the
location, of any such office or agency. If at any time the Issuer
shall fail to maintain any such office or agency or shall fail to
furnish the Owner Trustee with the address thereof, such
surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the
applicable Corporate Trust Office, and the Issuer hereby appoints

ARTICLE V

APPLICATION OF TRUST FUNDS; CERTAIN
DUTIES

SECTION 5.1 Application of Trust
Funds . Deposits into the Certificate Distribution Account
shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture

Agent shall withdraw from the Certificate Distribution Account and
distribute to the Certificateholders, pro rata based on the
Percentage Interest of each Certificateholder, all funds received

Paying Agent shall promptly distribute to the Certificateholders
all other amounts (if any) received by the Certificate Paying Agent
on behalf of the Issuer in respect of the Trust Estate (pro rata
based on the Percentage Interest of each such Certificateholder).
After the termination of the Indenture in accordance with its
terms, the Certificate Paying Agent shall distribute all amounts
received (if any) by the Owner Trustee on behalf of the Issuer in
respect of the Trust Estate in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement. If any withholding tax is imposed on any Issuer

Section 5.1 ; provided that the Owner Trustee

(but such authorization shall not prevent the
Owner Trustee from contesting any such tax in appropriate
proceedings and withholding payment of such tax, if permitted by
law, pending the outcome of such proceedings). The amount of any
withholding tax imposed with respect to a Certificateholder shall
be treated as cash distributed to such Certificateholder at the
time it is withheld by the Issuer and remitted to the appropriate
taxing authority. If there is a possibility that withholding tax is
payable with respect to a distribution or income allocation, the
Owner Trustee may in its sole discretion withhold such amounts in
accordance with this Section 5.1 . If a
Certificateholder wishes to apply for a refund of any such
withholding tax, the Owner Trustee shall reasonably cooperate with
such Certificateholder in making such claim so long as such
Certificateholder agrees to reimburse the Owner Trustee for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred.

SECTION 5.3 Signature on
Returns . The Owner Trustee shall prepare (or cause to be
prepared) and shall sign, on behalf of the Issuer, the
Issuer’s tax returns, if any, unless applicable law requires

Issuer is required to be treated as a partnership for United States
federal income tax purposes, the Certificateholder that is a United
States Person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30)
holding the largest Certificate Percentage Interest shall be
designated the “tax matters partner” of the Issuer
pursuant to Code section 6231(a)(7)(A) of the Code and shall sign
the tax return of the Issuer. In the event that two or more
Certificateholders would be described in the preceding sentence
then Certificateholder with the alphabetically first name shall be
so designated and in the event that no Certificateholder is a

Section 7701(a)(30), the requirements of this
Section 5.3 shall be applied without regard to such
consideration.

fixed investment trusts under Treasury Regulations
Section 1.671-5, or a partnership information return, IRS Form
1065 if the Issuer is treated as a partnership for United States
federal income tax purposes) and make such elections as from time
to time may be required or appropriate under any applicable state
or federal statute or any rule or regulation thereunder so as to
maintain the Issuer’s tax characterization as described in
Section 2.6 hereof, (d) cause applicable tax
returns to be signed in the manner required by law and
(e) collect or cause to be collected any withholding tax as

Certificateholder on any Payment Date and all amounts received by

Trust Agreement
(2013-A)







SECTION 6.2 General Duties .
It shall be the duty of the Owner Trustee to discharge
(or cause to be discharged) all of its responsibilities
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and to administer the Issuer in the interest of the
Certificateholders, subject to Transaction Documents, and in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Owner Trustee shall be deemed to have discharged
its duties and responsibilities hereunder and under the Transaction
Documents to the extent the Administrator has agreed in the
Administration Agreement to perform any act or to discharge any
duty of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee hereunder or under any
Transaction Document, and the Owner Trustee shall not be liable for
the default or failure of the Administrator to carry out its
obligations under the Administration Agreement and shall have no
duty to monitor the performance of the Administrator or any other
Person under the Administration Agreement or any other document.
The Owner Trustee shall have no obligation to administer, service
or collect the Receivables or to maintain, monitor or otherwise
supervise the administration, servicing or collection of the
Receivables. For the avoidance of doubt, the Owner Trustee shall
not be required to perform any of the obligations of the Issuer
under any Transaction Document that are required to be performed by
the Sponsor, the Servicer, the Depositor, the Administrator or the
Indenture Trustee.

SECTION 6.3 Action upon
Instruction . (a) Subject to Article IV , and in
accordance with the Transaction Documents, the Certificateholders
may, by written instruction, direct the Owner Trustee in the
management of the Issuer. Such direction may be exercised at any
time by written instruction of the Certificateholders pursuant to
Article IV .

(b) Subject to
Section 7.1 , the Owner Trustee shall not be required
to take any action hereunder or under any Transaction Document if
the Owner Trustee shall have reasonably determined or been advised
by counsel that such action is likely to result in liability on the
part of the Owner Trustee or is contrary to the terms hereof or of
any Transaction Document or is otherwise contrary to
law.

(c) Whenever the Owner Trustee is
unable to decide between alternative courses of action permitted or
required by the terms of this Agreement or any Transaction Document
or is unsure as to the application of any provision of this
Agreement or any Transaction Document or any such provision is
ambiguous as to its application, or is, or appears to be, in
conflict with any other applicable provision, or in the event that
this Agreement permits any determination by the Owner Trustee or is
silent or is incomplete as to the course of action that the Owner
Trustee is required to take with respect to a particular set of
facts, the Owner Trustee shall promptly give notice (in such form
as shall be appropriate under the circumstances) to the
Certificateholders requesting instruction as to the course of
action to be adopted or application of such provision, and to the
extent the Owner Trustee acts or refrains from acting in good faith
in accordance with any written instruction of the Majority
Certificateholders (or, if specifically required, all
Certificateholders) received, the Owner Trustee shall not be liable
on account of such action or inaction to any Person. If the Owner
Trustee shall not have received appropriate instruction within ten
days of such notice (or within

(2013-A)







such shorter period of time as
reasonably may be specified in such notice or may be necessary
under the circumstances) it may, but shall be under no duty to,
take or refrain from taking such action, not inconsistent with this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents, as it shall deem to be in
the best interests of the Certificateholders, and shall have no
liability to any Person for such action or inaction.

(d) The Owner Trustee shall be under
no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it
by this Agreement, or to institute, conduct or defend any
litigation, at the request, order or direction of any
Certificateholder or any other Person, unless such
Certificateholder or such Person has offered to the Owner Trustee
security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs,
expenses and liabilities that may be incurred by the Owner Trustee
(including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of
its counsel) therein or thereby, including such advances as the
Owner Trustee shall reasonably request.

(e) The Owner Trustee shall not be
personally liable for any distribution made in accordance with the
provisions set forth in Section 9.1(c) .

SECTION 6.4 No Duties Except as
Specified in this Agreement or in Instructions . The Owner
Trustee shall not have any duty or obligation to manage, make any
payment with respect to, register, record, sell, dispose of, or
otherwise deal with the Trust Estate, or to otherwise take or
refrain from taking any action under, or in connection with, any
document contemplated hereby to which the Issuer or the Owner
Trustee is a party, except as expressly provided by the terms of
this Agreement or in any document or written instruction received
by the Owner Trustee pursuant to Section 6.3 ; and no
implied duties or obligations shall be read into this Agreement or
any Transaction Document against the Owner Trustee. The Owner
Trustee shall have no responsibility for filing any financing or
continuation statement in any public office at any time or to
otherwise perfect or maintain the perfection of any security
interest or Lien granted to it hereunder or to prepare or file any
Commission filing (including any filings required under the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act) for the Issuer or to record this Agreement or
any Transaction Document. Wilmington Trust, National Association
nevertheless agrees that it will, at its own cost and expense,
promptly take all action as may be necessary to discharge any Liens
on any part of the Trust Estate that result from actions by, or
claims against, Wilmington Trust, National Association that are not
related to the ownership or the administration of the Trust Estate.
The Owner Trustee shall have no responsibility or liability for or
with respect to the genuineness, value, sufficiency or validity of
the Trust Estate.

SECTION 6.5 No Action Except
under Specified Documents or Instructions . The Owner Trustee
shall not manage, control, use, sell, dispose of or otherwise deal
with any part of the Trust Estate except (i) in accordance
with the powers granted to and the authority conferred upon the
Owner Trustee pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) in accordance
with the Transaction Documents and (iii) in accordance with
any document or instruction delivered to the Owner Trustee pursuant
to Section 6.3 .

Trust Agreement
(2013-A)







SECTION 6.6 Restrictions .
The Owner Trustee shall not take any action (a) that is
inconsistent with the purposes of the Issuer set forth in
Section 2.3 or (b) that, to the actual knowledge
of a Responsible Officer of the Owner Trustee, would for United
States federal income, state and local income and franchise tax
purposes, (i) affect the treatment of the Notes as
indebtedness, (ii) be deemed to cause a taxable exchange of
the Notes or (iii) cause the Issuer or any portion thereof to
be treated as an association or publicly traded partnership taxable
as a corporation, or cause the Issuer to be treated as other than a
grantor trust of the type described in Treasury Regulation section
301.7701-4(c). No Certificateholder shall direct the Owner Trustee
to take action that would violate the provisions of this Section
6.6.

SECTION 6.7 Relevant Trustee
. Following the payment in full of principal and interest on the
Notes, the Owner Trustee shall assume the role of Relevant Trustee
for all purposes under the Transaction Documents and shall perform
the obligations of the Relevant Trustee under the Indenture. In
furtherance of the foregoing, Article 7 , Article 8
and Article 12 of the Indenture are hereby incorporated by
reference into this Agreement.

SECTION 6.8 Reporting . Upon
receipt by the Owner Trustee from the Depositor of any reports or
general loan data, the Owner Trustee will forward such reports in
the form received to the Certificateholders. The Owner Trustee
shall have no duty or obligations to review, verify or confirm the
reports or any information contained therein, and shall have no
liability in connection therewith. Delivery of the Monthly Servicer
Report to the Owner Trustee, as provided for in the Transaction
Documents, is for informational purposes only and the Owner
Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute constructive
notice of any information contained therein or determinable from
information contained therein, including the Issuer’s
compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the
Owner Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officer’s
Certificates).

ARTICLE VII

and Duties . The Owner Trustee accepts the trusts hereby
created and agrees to perform its duties hereunder with respect to
such trusts but only upon the terms of this Agreement. The Owner
Trustee also agrees to disburse all moneys actually received by it
constituting part of the Trust Estate upon the terms of the
Transaction Documents and this Agreement. The Owner Trustee shall
not be personally liable or accountable hereunder or under any
Transaction Document under any circumstances notwithstanding
anything herein or in the Transaction Documents to the contrary,
except (i) for its own willful misconduct, bad faith or gross
negligence, (ii) in the case of the inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty contained in Section 7.5
expressly made by Wilmington Trust, National Association in its
individual capacity, (iii) for liabilities arising from the

obligations expressly undertaken by it in the third sentence of

the preceding sentence) of the foregoing:

shall require the Owner Trustee to expend or risk its personal

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
