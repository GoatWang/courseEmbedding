Life and career[edit]
Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Epstein attended public schools in Milton, Massachusetts. He graduated from Columbia College of Columbia University in 1949 and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He received a Master of Arts degree from Columbia the following year and joined Doubleday and Company as an editorial trainee.
At Doubleday, he saw the need for inexpensive, well made paperbacks of the kinds of books that his classmates, many of them veterans studying on the GI Bill, were reading but couldn't afford to own in their hardcover editions. With the support of Ken McCormick, Doubleday's chief editor, he launched Anchor Books,[1] the first so-called Quality Paperbacks, which quickly became the dominant paperback format. In 1954 Anchor Books won the Carey-Thomas Award.[2]
In 1958 he left Doubleday to join Random House where he served as editorial director until his retirement in 1999. At Random House he edited such writers as Jane Jacobs, Norman Mailer, Philip Roth, Derek Jeter, Gore Vidal, Vladimir Nabokov, E. L. Doctorow, Michael Korda and Peter Matthiessen. During the New York newspaper strike of 1963 Epstein, his wife Barbara and their friends Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Hardwick created The New York Review of Books and turned to their friend Robert Silvers to be its editor along with Epstein's wife Barbara.
In 1979 with the critic Edmund Wilson he conceived the Library of America, well-made, reliable editions of important American writers. With the support of the Ford Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities, the first volumes were published in 1982.[3] He later published The Reader's Catalogue of 40,000 titles available by mail order, an analog precursor of online book selling.[4] In 2004, he co-founded On Demand Books, marketer of the Espresso Book Machine, which reproduces a paperback book from a digital file in a few minutes. Epstein has predicted that the Espresso Book Machine will supplant the 500-year-old Gutenberg technology.[5][6]
Awards[edit]
Epstein has received The National Book Award for Distinguished Service to American Letters, The Curtis Benjamin Award of the Association of American publishers for creative publishing, the Bulldog Award, the lifetime achievement award of the National Book Critic’s Circle,[7] and the Philolexian Award for Distinguished Literary Achievement.
Publications[edit]
His essays and reviews have appeared in The New York Times Magazine, The New York Review of Books, and Condé Nast Traveler, among other publications. He is the author of the following books:
Book Business: Publishing Past, Present and Future. W. W. Norton & Company (January 2001) ISBN 978-0393049848 [1]
Eating: A Memoir. A. A. Knopf (October 19, 2010) ISBN 978-1400078257 [2]

The Great Conspiracy Trial. Random House (1970) ISBN 978-0394419060 [4]
Personal life[edit]
In 1953 Jason Epstein married Barbara Zimmerman with whom he had two children, Jacob and Helen. The couple divorced in 1990 and in 1993 he married Judith Miller, a reporter for The New York Times.

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREBook Business: Publishing Past Present And Futureby Epstein, JasonThe book industry stands at the edge of a historic transformation. Jason Epstein tells us what the future holds. Jason Epstein has led arguably the most creative career in book publishing during the past half-century. In 1952 he created Anchor Books, which launched the so-called quality paperback revolution and established the trade paperback format. In the following decade he was co-founder of the New York Review of Books. In the 1980s he created The Library of America and The Reader's Catalog, the precursor of on-line bookselling. In this short book, based on his W.W. Norton Lectures given at the New York Public Library in October 1999, he discusses the severe crisis facing the book business today--a crisis that affects writers and readers as well as publishers--and looks ahead to the radically transformed industry that will revolutionize the idea of the book as profoundly as the introduction of movable type did five centuries ago.PublishingCondition: Used - GoodHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

Synopses & ReviewsPublisher CommentsPublished to coincide with the 50th anniversary of its initial publication, this special edition of Jane Jacobs’s masterpiece, The Death and Life of Great American Cities, features a new Introduction by Jason Epstein, the book’s original editor, who provides an intimate perspective on Jacobs herself and unique insights into the creation and lasting influence of this classic. The Death and Life of Great American Cities was described by The New York Times as “perhaps the most influential single work in the history of town planning. . . . [It] can also be seen in a much larger context. It is first of all a work of literature; the descriptions of street life as a kind of ballet and the bitingly satiric account of traditional planning theory can still be read for pleasure even by those who long ago absorbed and appropriated the book’s arguments.” Jane Jacobs, an editor and writer on architecture in New York City in the early sixties, argued that urban diversity and vitality were being destroyed by powerful architects and city planners. Rigorous, sane, and delightfully epigrammatic, Jane Jacobs’s tour de force is a blueprint for the humanistic management of cities. It remains sensible, knowledgeable, readable, and indispensable.About the AuthorJane Jacobs was born on May 4, 1916, in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Her father was a physician and her mother taught school and worked as a nurse. After high school and a year spent as a reporter on the Scranton Tribune, Jacobs went to New York, where she found a succession of jobs as a stenographer and wrote free-lance articles about the city's many working districts, which fascinated her. In 1952, after a number of writing and editing jobs ranging in subject matter from metallurgy to a geography of the United States for foreign readers, she became an associate editor of Architectural Forum. She was becoming increasingly skeptical of conventional planning beliefs as she noticed that the city rebuilding projects she was assigned to write about seemed neither safe, interesting, alive, nor good economics for cities once the projects were built and in operation. She gave a speech to that effect at Harvard in 1956, and this led to an article in Fortune magazine entitled "Downtown Is for People," which in turn led to The Death and Life of Great American Cities. The book was published in 1961 and produced permanent changes in the debate over urban renewal and the future of cities. In opposition to the kind of large-scale, bulldozing government intervention in city planning associated with Robert Moses and with federal slum-clearing projects, Jacobs proposed a renewal from the ground up, emphasizing mixed use rather than exclusively residential or commercial districts, and drawing on the human vitality of existing neighborhoods: "Vital cities have marvelous innate abilities for understanding, communicating, contriving, and inventing what is required to combat their difficulties.... Lively, diverse, intense cities contain the seeds of their own regeneration, with energy enough to carry over for problems and needs outside themselves." Although Jacobs's lack of experience as either architect or city planner drew criticism, The Death and Life of Great American Cities was quickly recognized as one of the most original and powerfully argued books of its day. It was variously praised as "the most refreshing, provocative, stimulating, and exciting study of this greatest of our problems of living which I have seen" (Harrison Salisbury) and "a magnificent study of what gives life and spirit to the city" (William H. Whyte). Jacobs is married to an architect, who she says taught her enough to become an architectural writer. They have two sons and a daughter. In 1968 they moved to Toronto, where Jacobs has often assumed an activist role in matters relating to development and has been an adviser on the reform of the city's planning and housingpolicies. She was a leader in the successful campaign to block construction of a major expressway on the grounds that it would do more harm than good, and helped prevent the demolition of an entire neighborhood downtown. She has been a Canadian citizen since 1974. Her writings include The Economy of Cities (1969); The Question of Separatism (1980), a consideration of the issue of sovereignty for Quebec; Cities and the Wealth of Nations (1984), a major study of the importance of cities and their regions in the global economy; and her most recent book, Systems of Survival (1993).
