HBR Guide to Buying a Small Business: Think Big, Buy Small, Own Your Own Company
Richard S. Ruback and Royce Yudkoff
Find, acquire, and run your own business. Are you looking for an alternative to a career path at a big firm? Does founding your own start-up seem too risky? There is a radical third path open to you: you can buy a small business and run it as CEO. Purchasing a small company offers significant financial rewards—as well as personal and professional fulfillment. Leading a firm means you can be your own boss, put your executive skills to work, fashion a company environment that meets your own needs, and profit directly from your success. But finding the right business to buy and closing the deal isn't always easy. In the HBR Guide to Buying a Small Business, we help you: determine if this path is right for you, raise capital for your acquisition, find and evaluate the right prospects, avoid the pitfalls that could derail your search, understand why a "dull" business might be the best investment, negotiate a potential deal with the seller, and avoid deals that fall through at the last minute.

Buying Your Way into Entrepreneurship
Richard S. Ruback and Royce Yudkoff
An increasingly popular route to success as a small business owner is “acquisition entrepreneurship”—buying and running an existing operation. If you’re considering such a path, the authors offer practical advice for each stage of the process. Think it through. Do you have the right qualities for the job (managerial skills, confidence, persuasiveness, persistence, a thirst for learning, and tolerance for stress)? Are you willing to trade the benefits of working at a large organization for the chance to be in charge? Search diligently and efficiently. Plan to spend six months to two years—full time—following leads and systematically vetting business prospects. Focus on companies that are consistently profitable and have annual revenues of $5 million to $15 million. During this phase, you can self-finance or establish a search fund to recruit potential investors. Strike a deal. When you’ve settled on a target, do preliminary due diligence to confirm the business’s viability and arrive at a fair offer. If the seller accepts, you’ll have about 90 days to work with your accountant and attorney on confirmatory due diligence. Transition into leadership. After the sale closes, your priorities should be building relationships (with employees, customers, and suppliers) and setting up processes to ensure steady cash flow.
Keywords: Entrepreneurship; 
				  Acquisition; 
				  Planning;

Lind Equipment
Richard S. Ruback and Royce Yudkoff
Lind Equipment failed to meet its loan covenants with its senior bank lender in the summer of 2008, just six months after it was acquired. While the senior bank debt comprised only 6% of the capital used in the acquisition and was fully secured, it exercised its right to stop payments to Lind's subordinated lender that funded about 40% of the acquisition, pushing that debt into default as well. These financial problems were the result of declining revenues and profits at Lind as exchange rates and the impact of the Great Recession took its toll on the firm. Without a quick solution, Lind could be pushed into bankruptcy.

National Public Broadcasting
Richard S. Ruback and Royce Yudkoff
Bob Williams, the CEO of National Public Broadcasting (NPB), was considering an unsolicited offer to purchase the company in the early spring of 2006. The company was a media underwriting representative for public television and radio stations throughout the United States. When Mr. Williams and his wife Linda Williams started NPB in 1996, they had imagined that it would grow quickly and be acquired by a larger media representation firm in a few years. But the business proved to be more complex than they had anticipated with slower growth and less interest from strategic acquirers and, as a result, Mr. Williams had been running NPB ever since. The unsolicited offer gave the Williams and their partners the potential opportunity to realize a significant cash payment for the business. The case explores the impact on the sale of the ownership structure decisions that were made when NPB was formed and the complexity of the sales process for small businesses.

Red Hen Baking Company
Richard S. Ruback and Royce Yudkoff
In 2007, the Red Hen Baking Company was deciding whether to move from its cramped and inefficient facility to a new facility. It had been in business about 8 years, and 2006 was the first year RHB realized a profit that was over $50,000. The added annual cost of the new location was about $58,000 and would require a $300,000 build-out. While the owner of Red Hen was excited about the possibility of a new, efficient bakery, he wondered if it was worth the added expense and risk.

Triple Point Technology
Richard S. Ruback and Royce Yudkoff
The founding CEO of Triple Point Technology, Peter Armstrong, was considering the sale of the company. The company specialized in providing its clients with software used for transaction processing and risk management in various commodity markets. Triple Point Technology had grown substantially in its 13 years of existence and potentially was a source of a significant amount of wealth for its owners. The sale was prompted by a co-founder who wanted to sell his share of the business. The case explores the rationale for owners to monetize at least a portion of their company's value, the sales process, and compares two different offers from the perspective of the company's executives that will have a significant continuing interest in it.

Next Street, LLC
Richard S. Ruback and Royce Yudkoff
Next Street Financial, LLC was a modern merchant bank that provided high quality advisory services and capital to small- and mid-sized inner city businesses. Next Street was a for-profit business that aimed to increase the growth, profitability and success of its client companies, thereby enhancing economic development, wealth and job creation in the inner city. The advisory component of its mission seemed well underway but raising a fund to directly finance client companies had proved challenging. As Next Street considered expanding its capacity to help clients achieve their growth potential, the firm was deciding between raising a fund or focusing its resources on expanding its abilities to more effectively help its clients obtain financing from other institutions.

ALAC International
Richard S. Ruback and Royce Yudkoff
ALAC was a small importer of specialty industrial chemicals. The case explores the different financing alternatives to facilitate the company's explosive growth in working capital. At the end of 2009, the company was awarded the United States distributorship for the specialty chemical di-isononyl phthalate (DINP) from a large Taiwanese producer and had almost tripled its sales in 2010. It expected to double its sales in 2011 and to dramatically increase its profits. ALAC critically needed to obtain financing for the explosive growth in its inventory and accounts receivable balances.

Richard S. Ruback and Royce Yudkoff, professors at Harvard Business School, spell out an overlooked career path: buying a business and running it as CEO. Purchasing a small company lets you become your own boss and reap financial rewards without the risks of founding a start-up. Still, there are things you need to know. Ruback and Yudkoff are the authors of the HBR Guide to Buying a Small Business.

SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: Welcome to the HBR IdeaCast from Harvard Business Review. I’m Sarah Green Carmichael. There you are in your downtown office tower as the sun goes down. It’s where you’ve worked countless hours and late nights. And from your window, you can see other offices with the lights on across the street, other people burning the candle at both ends for the corporation, just like you. 
Not everyone with a deserving resume ends up on the executive team and not everyone can be the CEO, except, maybe you think to yourself a little dreamily, but those kids dropping out of college starting start-ups and running their own companies with big valuations changing the world. But entrepreneurship, that’s a big risk for you at this stage in your career. 
If only there were a third way, if only there were a way to be in charge, be the leader you know you are, get more value out of your experience, but do so without the roller coaster ride of a high growth startup that’s more likely to fail than not. 
Well, there is another way, an open path rarely taken that is laid out in a new book, the HBR Guide to Buying a Small Business. The authors are Rick Ruback and Royce Yudkoff. They’re here with me now to talk about it. Rick and Royce, thank you guys so much for coming on the HBR IdeaCast. 
ROYCE YUDKOFF: It’s a pleasure to be here. Thank you for having us. ? 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: So you’re both professors at Harvard Business School, where you teach an enormously popular class on this topic of buying a small business. And I have to say, I’m a little surprised to know that so many Harvard MBA students are interested in this path, because I associate them with this stereotype of, oh, they want to go into finance or consulting or maybe go out to Silicon Valley and start some high-growth startup. 
Why do you think so many of your students are really interested in this topic? 
ROYCE YUDKOFF: One of the factors that has excited our students about this is the opportunity to have a leadership role very early in their career, not 10 or 15 years out as they’ve climbed the ranks in someone else’s company. And also, it avoids the tremendous risks of starting something from scratch and proving that you have a working business model. Instead, they’re able to buy a proven business and become the CEO. And within a year or two, they’re really fully functioning as an entrepreneur CEO. 
RICHARD RUBACK: There’s also the sense of building the world you want to live in. So people want to be home with their families, people want to be able to build the work environment that they want employees to live in and work in. And by buying your own company, you get to shape it in a way that allows you to both thrive as a human being, executing the responsibilities you have, as well as making a great living. So you get sort of the best of both. 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: I was interested to see in the book and in your HBR article some of the examples of things that your students have gone on to do. Could you just maybe give us a couple of examples of the kinds of businesses that they’re running now? 
ROYCE YUDKOFF: Sure, both Rick and I can do that. Great small businesses operate in small off-the-run-niches. In other words, they’re not small because people don’t want to buy their product or competitors take away their products, they’re small because they are a terrific competitor in some small defensible niche. 







So our students have bought businesses like companies that process the insurance claims for local emergency ambulance services, companies that clean the windows on high-rise skyscrapers, companies that test the fire hoses for safety at firehouses in large regions of the country. 
RICHARD RUBACK: Yeah, there’s just lots of examples. These are businesses that are small for the right reasons, not the wrong reasons. And by the way, I should say what we mean by small. We don’t mean your corner grocery store. We mean businesses that have profits of about $500,000, maybe $750,000 to upwards of a $2 million. 
And there are businesses of that size, probably 100,000 of them, Royce, in the United States and hundreds of thousands more throughout the world. And we have students at the Harvard Business School from everywhere. And our students go out to buy businesses all around the world. 
We have a student who was in sub-Saharan Africa. 
ROYCE YUDKOFF: Yes. 
RICHARD RUBACK: Who bought a yogurt– 
ROYCE YUDKOFF: Manufacturer. 
RICHARD RUBACK: A yogurt manufacturer in sub-Saharan Africa. 
ROYCE YUDKOFF: And we have many students who’ve done it in Latin America, we have many students who’ve done it in Western Europe, we have some students in Southeast Asia. Because the phenomenon is universal– founders create these businesses, they build them over 20 or 30 years and, inevitably, they approach retirement. And for many of these people, they don’t have a daughter or son who wants to take over the business and they need to sell the business. Because the business not only needs to give them the capital they need to retire, but it also needs to have a successor CEO. 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: I think of the examples we’ve talked about, yogurt might be one of the more exciting ones. And I don’t mean that disparagingly. 
RICHARD RUBACK: We think dull is really good. 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: Dull is good. 
RICHARD RUBACK: Being dull is really good. You want a business that is dull in the sense that there’s no exciting growth. It’s growing by a little bit every year, a business where customers come back and purchase from you year after year because you’re providing a great product or a great service. They have no desire to look for somewhere else. You’re not a big part of their business. That is to say, your service isn’t a big part of the costs of their business. So it doesn’t pain them to shop. So it’s kind of dull, but dull is really good. 







SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: And dull is good because it’s predictable? 
ROYCE YUDKOFF: Exactly so. The customers will buy from you year after year after year because it’s in their interests not to switch. And it’s a lot of work to switch, there’s some risk involved. And so the financial performance of that business is really secure. 
I’d add one more thing to Rick’s comments. Our students who go off and do this or who examine this divide in two groups. There are some students who are passionate about a type of product or service they want to be associated with. But there are many students that are really passionate about being CEOs and managers. And they’re somewhat agnostic about the service itself. 
In other words, what excites them is that every one of their skills is tested every day as a manager. They’re hiring people and teaching people and selling to customers and negotiating with vendors and handling finance issues. And at the end of the day, they walk out and feel, today, I used all of my capabilities. And that’s what’s exciting to them, not the particular product or service. 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: As a reality check, are there downsides? Are there things people should think about maybe before they decide if this path is right for them? 
RICHARD RUBACK: Sure, and one of the biggest things I think people need to think about is whether they really want the independence and responsibility that comes from running your own small business. Most of us believe we would like to set our own agendas. But most of us really like having a boss deep down inside. We like having that person that says, this is what you should be doing. We don’t want to tell you exactly how to do it, but generally, this is what you should be doing, and try to get that done in the next couple weeks. 
That level of direction, everybody likes a boss to set broad agenda items. And when you run your own small business, the most important part of your day is setting your own to-do list. And it’s up to you, you have to decide what’s important and how you allocate your time. And you’ll either succeed or fail based on your decisions and your ability to execute that to-do list. 
And some people, that’s too blank a sheet of paper and that’s too much flexibility. Some people like to know that work starts at 7:00 AM or 6:00 AM and ends at some time. It just doesn’t always go with you because you’re always thinking about what the next thing you’re going to do. So it’s not for everybody. 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: Yeah, if you’re running a business with 50 employees, it’s not just you who’s unemployed if you mess up, it’s 50 other people, too. 
ROYCE YUDKOFF: That’s a good point, Sarah. I think that, when you’re an entrepreneur, the responsibilities really do end with you. In a way, you don’t feel they do when you’re part of a large organization and responsibility is on many people’s shoulders. So when you’ve had a bad day, you’ve made everybody you care about’s life worse– yourself, your family, your investors, your employees. And that really feels terrible. 
Now conversely, when you’ve had a good day, you really feel like you’re at the center of it all. And so these emotional ups and downs that entrepreneurs report having are really big. And you have to be able to handle that as an entrepreneur. You have to look inside yourself and say, yeah, the great offsets the bad, and I am perfectly comfortable managing those emotional oscillations. 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: I don’t think of people who go into these businesses or even acquire them and run them as entrepreneurs. And I’m just curious to know why that is a word that you do use? 
ROYCE YUDKOFF: Rick and I feel like this space has been overlooked by many people who thought of their choices as being, I can go work in someone else’s company or I need to come up with an idea and rub two sticks together to make fire, which is of course fraught with risk. 
But here, overlooked, are thousands and thousands and thousands of businesses all over the world that have been around for 20 and 30 and 40 years and have an enduring profitability. And when you buy that company and run it, you are in every sense an entrepreneur. You’ve just skipped the part with no scale and where you had to prove out whether you could create a business model. So what they do every day is exactly what an entrepreneur does. 
RICHARD RUBACK: And if you think about a startup, most start-ups maybe begin with blank sheets of paper. But for us, the most interesting part of a firm’s life is taking an idea that is proven and scaling it, making it reach out to many people, making it to be at the scale where you can actually employ those 50 people you talked about. 
So having it be a secret enterprise with you and your buddies eating potato chips is perhaps a wonderful activity. Lord knows, there’s nothing wrong with potato chips. Maybe they upgrade them to French fries in the winter. But it’s that next step, which I think is extraordinarily entrepreneurial. 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: If you’ve decided this is the right path for you, how do you search for one of these businesses to acquire? 
ROYCE YUDKOFF: Well, the very first step is probably creating a budget for yourself so that you can afford to do this. And there are two broad paths. One is that you have some savings or a working spouse who can fund this activity as you proceed to source opportunities to buy. Almost everyone needs to raise money for the actual acquisition from investors. We can talk about that later. And in this path, you raise that money when you’ve found a specific opportunity. 
But there are also many people who don’t have those resources to search and they’re not stopped because it turns out there is a network of active investors who will invest in funding a search in return for a first look at the right to invest when that opportunity comes up. So one of the early decisions is, do I need some backing to fund my search and the advice that comes with it. Or can I afford to actually go out on my own and look for a companies to buy. 
RICHARD RUBACK: I think it actually starts even a little bit before that. You have to put yourself in the right mindset. And the right mindset is to tell yourself, this is a full-time job. That is, searching for a company to buy is a full-time job. It’s not something you can do occasionally on the weekends, like refurbishing your playroom in the basement. It’s not like that. It’s full-time. 
And the reason it’s full-time is, one, it’s an enormous amount of work. So to find a company to buy, most people report that they work 12, 16 hours a day sourcing potential acquisitions. So it’s not something you do casually. 
So it’s really a mindset. It says, you have to say to yourself, self, I’m giving up the rest of my working life, I am focusing on this activity. This is going to be my passion. 
The other thing about the mindset that’s really hard, if you think about it, you may be searching for a year or two to find the right business. It takes that long. And for every day that you don’t find the right business, the day sort of kind of ends in failure. 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: Oh no. 
RICHARD RUBACK: Because when you go home and you talk to your loved one, even if it’s just a dog– maybe it’s best if it’s just a dog– and you say to the dog, you know, I left at 5 o’clock this morning or I started work in my bathrobe on my desk at 5:00 o’clock this morning and I’ve been working for 12 hours and I haven’t bought a company today. I haven’t even talked to somebody who wants to sell to me today. Or I talked to somebody who might be interested in taking another phone call in two weeks, and I’m calling that a victory. 
So in the end, there’s a big victory. But it’s a victory that’s made up of lots and lots and lots of failure along the way, if you call it failure. 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: So one of my really basic questions here is how do you even find these companies. Because there’s not like an eBay or a Craigslist where you can just find them. 
ROYCE YUDKOFF: Well, actually are there is. Let me start with the United States. But what I’m going to describe is replicated in virtually every developed market around the world and many emerging markets. So in the United States, there are about 3,000 small business brokers. 
So one of the first steps most searchers do is they do outreach to several of hundred of these. And very quickly, you’ll find that you’re getting a flow into you of somewhere around 20 opportunities a week of companies that are currently for sale. 
In addition, there are a couple of electronic databases where brokers or sellers will list their companies. And you can go to those portals and access this, too. But within a couple of months of starting your sourcing, you should be seeing at least 20 companies a week that are for sale and filtering those. And Rick, some searchers actually supplement that by direct outreach to sellers. 
RICHARD RUBACK: Right, so sometimes, you’ll decide you really want to buy a business in a particular geography. Two searchers who are searching together, former students whose spouses were both tied to New York City, so they knew they had to buy a business in New York City. So they drew a circle and said, we’re just going to visit every Chamber of Commerce meeting, we’re going to talk to every business we can within that circle. And we’re going to buy a business within that circle. And they did. They bought a business– what was it, two or three years ago– and they’re doing great– a travel business. 
Other searchers decide that there is an industry they really want to be in. We’ve had examples where people fall in love with odd businesses, the porta potty business. Had somebody fell in love with the porta potty business. Really wanted to buy a porta potty company. 
And you can see why, by the way, right? They’re a low-cap– 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: Not immediately. 
RICHARD RUBACK: Really? Really? It’s an exciting business. They’re plastic, so they’re not very expensive to buy. They’re a quick service item, right– somebody services them. I think we saw it was like a minute per porta potty to clean and whatever. It’s like an essential thing, right. It’s not nobody’s going to say– 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: When you got to go, you got to go. 
RICHARD RUBACK: Right, right? And nobody’s going to renegotiate the price of the porta potty. If you think about what you want in a porta potty, you want it clean and available. 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: And there. 
RICHARD RUBACK: And there, right? And so people don’t shop for porta potty providers. So it’s a great business. 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: So this is interesting to me. Say you find a business like that, that is desirable in many respects. How do you start doing the research to know that this company is a good buy? 
RICHARD RUBACK: Well, first of all, let me answer the question we started this porta potty excitement one, which is, well, OK, suppose you fall in love with porta potties, what do you do. And the answer is, you get on Google or some other search engine and you find out all the porta potty service providers in the place you want to live in. And you research them all and see how much they all charge and how big they are and how many trucks they own and all this stuff. 
And pretty soon, you’ll know a lot about the porta potty business. By then, you’ll know how much they cost, you’ll know what the profit rates are, you’ll know what the market penetration is, you’ll know how many competitors there are in the region. You’ll know a lot about the porta potty business just in a particular region with a couple of hours on a search engine, maybe less. 
So that’s how you begin to discover. And then you’re going to get a list of companies, and you’ll figure out which are the biggest and which are the best. And you’ll start calling them. And you’ll say, hi, this is Sarah. I used to host podcasts or the like. But now I’ve decided to become an entrepreneur and I really want to buy one business to run. And I’m really excited about your business because I’ve always wanted to own a business that services porta potties. 
And what’s it going to feel like when you go to that cocktail party and everybody else is talking about whatever else they do. And they’ll say, what do you do. And you’ll say– 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: I am the porta potty queen of Greater Boston. 
RICHARD RUBACK: I’m the porta potty queen of Greater Boston. 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: Yes, I love it. OK, I’m starting to see why this actually is appealing. 
RICHARD RUBACK: And suppose you made $1 million a year as the queen of porta potties in Greater Boston. 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: That would be a really good feeling. 
ROYCE YUDKOFF: And answer to no one. 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: Yeah. 
ROYCE YUDKOFF: Right, you’ll answer to no one. This is one of the things Rick and I have found as we’ve traveled across the country meeting with a lot of entrepreneurs– is in any small city, there are many of these people who lead these quiet lives of great independence in businesses you might not give a second look to, and they’re making $1 million, $2 million a year for their families and doing work that they actually love– disassociated from whether the product is a humble one or an intensely exciting dramatic one– and they find great satisfaction in that. 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: So let’s say you’ve found the business, you’re really excited about it, it looks like a business where the fundamentals are strong, and you call them up. And maybe they’re not interested in selling, maybe they are. How do you have that conversation in a way that starts the negotiation? How do you get the ball rolling with a business you’re serious about buying? 
ROYCE YUDKOFF: There are at least a couple of early steps because you’re trying to screen down to a small number of businesses that are likely prospects from the large number of businesses that will be flowing into you. And so one of the early conversations is actually about the seller’s price expectations. 
Because just like you’re a first time buyer, your seller is likely to be a first time seller. And some of these sellers understand what market prices are for smaller firms. And some have an imaginary price that most might be associated with how much they want to have for when they retire. And it’s very important that you husband your time so that it’s spent with people who have a realistic sales price. So early on, getting a sense of price expectations is very important. 
And then second, you really want to be buying a business which Rick has used the phrase– enduringly profitable smaller firm. And that means you want to be finding out some basic facts, like over the last half decade, has the business been steadily profitable. Is it cyclical or non-cyclical? Do the customers recur from year-to-year? So as a year starts, I can count on almost all of my revenues being repeated. Basic questions like this will quickly clue you in to whether this is a transaction you’re likely to close on. 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: OK. 
RICHARD RUBACK: To Royce’s very good list, I would add that you want some evidence that convinces you the seller is really serious about selling. And you can imagine what might compel somebody to sell– they’re ill, their spouse is ill, they fall in love and they want to go off to a different place with their new love, lots of reasons why people do this. 
But nobody does it unless there’s an outside reason. Because people who say, maybe I want to do something different, and they’re in their 50s, seem to be in good health, you want to be suspicious of that. And the reason you want to be suspicious of that is you don’t really want to spend three months of your life pursuing an acquisition when the person can, at the last moment say, you know, I’ve been thinking about this, you’re so excited about the business, maybe I should get excited about the business again. I’m not going to sell. 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: Yeah, that’s good advice. Let’s say you make the deal happen– that and it doesn’t fall through, it actually happens– what are some things to be aware of as you’re transitioning into the leadership role at that company? 
ROYCE YUDKOFF: Almost always, part of the negotiated deal is that the seller will stick around for three to six months to help in the transition. That means teaching you the specifics of the business, the history, making sure you have introductions to important clients and vendors, and just smoothing that take over of the business. So that eases a lot of the learning process. 
The second thing to be aware of is that, it’s a very good idea when you go into one of these businesses not to make any big changes early on because you’re going to be learning that business over the first year. You’ll still make lots of decisions, little decisions will come up every day. And if you’ve bought the kind of business that Rick and I recommend, which is a sturdy, enduringly profitable business, these businesses are very resilient and will permit you a gradual patient period of learning. 
RICHARD RUBACK: Yeah, I would say that the other thing to think about is just the people management as you walk in. So it’s really important to be very respectful of the people who are working there. They know more about the business than you do. And it’s really important to be humble. 
When we teach our class, we have maybe 20 or so first time CEOs come in to visit the class. And one of my common questions is, what did you wear on your first day. And they all talk about, if they’re buying a business that has a blue collar workforce in the Midwest, they’re getting rid of their designer jeans and they’re buying Carhartts or Levi’s or whatever is the appropriate jean for the region they’re in. And they’re probably not coming in with a multicolored PowerPoint presentation their first day there. 
They’re trying to be respectful of the culture of the place and they’re trying to show that they’re going to fit in. Because just as you’re afraid your employees are going to quit and you’re going to be left with a hollow shell, they’re afraid you’re going to fire them. 
So you need to build some trust and credibility. A couple of other things that are really important. You need to be willing to do everything. One of our graduates talks about how he bought a very blue collar business in Nebraska and it was a business that put threads on pipes that are used in oil wells. Odd business, right? Very profitable business, it turns out. 
And so the guys are on the lathe cutting the threads. And the toilets won’t work. And he went out to the hardware store and bought a plunger or a snake or whatever you do to unplug a toilet and unplugged all the toilets and became the hero. Suddenly, he got enormous credibility because he was willing to do that. And nobody else could do that. So I think you have to do whatever it takes. 
And the other thing I would add is that’s building credibility inside. You also should build credibility outside. So certainly within the first month, as Royce mentioned, you have the seller staying with you for a transition period. You and that seller need to go out how to visit all your major customers and get a proper introduction and say, we’re going to maintain all the quality, we’re going to keep the services exactly the same. We’re all committed to providing you at least as good a business as you had before. We really respect the legacy of the seller, all those right things that people say. 
As well as, what is it we could do for you that we don’t do for you that would be appreciated in what you pay for. And that’s how you cement those relationships, which are key both, inside and outside. 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: Pipe threading businesses, porta potty businesses– why do you think this profitable work-life balance, relatively friendly way of working does not get more attention from the business press? Why does this fly under the radar? 
ROYCE YUDKOFF: Well, one reason is that these businesses don’t change rapidly. So there’s an absence of newsworthiness about them, right? They’re not introducing new products. They’re not growing from $5 million in sales to $100 million in sales. They are steady, profitable, fascinating businesses to run, but they lack the newsworthiness of high-tech or giant companies opening new markets. 
RICHARD RUBACK: The other thing is small business owners crave confidentiality. If you think about what it’s like to be a competitor in a big business, if you’re competing with a company that’s a public company and you’re a public company, one of the things you see is your competitor’s strategy. You read it in analyst’s reports, you read it in the company’s annual reports, you read it in the transcripts of the conference calls. 
But if you’re a private company, you don’t have to tell anybody anything. You have to tell your investors, but it’s all private. There are no filings that are public. It’s between you, your bankers, your investors. So you could have a tremendously profitable business that nobody knows is tremendously profitable. 
And think about how valuable that is, right? Because your workers don’t say, wow, you know, Joe, the CEO and owner, is making $1 million a year and I know everything Joe does and I’m making $80,000 a year. I think I’ll go be Joe, I’m going to set up my own business. I’m just going to move across the street and set up my own business. I’ll know the clients, I’ll be able to compete. 
If that general manager who’s getting paid $80,000 doesn’t know how profitable the business is, he can’t really do that. Competitors can’t come in. Our students, who are always looking for startup opportunities, can’t say, wow, I just read in the magazine how profitable that local business is. I think I’ll go do that. So there’s a real economic incentive to keep that information confidential. So they generally don’t seek this out. 
ROYCE YUDKOFF: And so the profitability of many of these small businesses is extraordinary. The high-rise window washing business I referenced earlier makes $2.5 million in profit a year. This regional insurance billing company for emergency ambulance services– $1.5 million a year. So all over the world, these private, proven, profitable businesses exist discretely, flying below the radar screen. 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: People seem to obsess over growth, both at the business level and the national level. Is it important for these businesses to grow, or do they just have to sustain? 
ROYCE YUDKOFF: Well, most of them grow modestly, although some new entrepreneurs who buy them revitalize them and take them to the next level. And that’s very exciting. But let’s talk about the economics of owning one of these businesses. 
The most magical thing about buying a small firm is the price at which you get to buy it. Because these firms sell for about four times their annual pretax profit. So if you buy a business with $1 million of profit, you’ll pay $4 million for it. 
And so every year, your investment will earn a 25% dividend, even if you don’t grow one bit. Most people buy these businesses using about 2/3 debt and 1/3 equity. And because of that, the dividend on the equity piece they’ve put up becomes around 40% a year, because so much of the purchase price was paid for by debt. 
So before you start to grow this business, you’re earning a return on either your money or your investor’s money or both of about 40% a year. If you’re able to grow the business, it gets even better, quicker. But it takes a lot of the pressure off in terms of having to reinvent the business or hit high growth targets, because you’re experiencing huge success just through purchasing and running. 
RICHARD RUBACK: Just remember, with growth comes risk, right? So the dollar is really good. Having most of your customers be customers who purchased from you before is really good, because you don’t have to market very much, you keep costs low, you know what they want, you can satisfy them. They stick, they’re sticky. 
If you’re growing rapidly, many of your customers are new, and they don’t have that long-term relationship with you. You have to build that relationship. It’s a much more difficult business to run. It’s much more stressful. 
So a high-growth business isn’t always a high-risk business, but it’s much riskier because you have these new customers that don’t have this preexisting sticky relationship with you coming all the time. So it’s a much harder business to get this unbreakable, enduringly profitable business. 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: So this is all sounding very, very appealing. Is there anything else about the personality or the type of person that we haven’t touched on about the kind of person who should really think about these opportunities? 
ROYCE YUDKOFF: Sure, because entrepreneurship through acquisition isn’t for everybody. The people who are drawn to it tend to be people who want a high level of professional independence. They like being in a world where they make many decisions. And they are happy being on their own in the sense they won’t have a lot of people like them in their small firm. 
But for many people, they crave other things in life. They want to be surrounded by colleagues who have the same educational background aspirations. They want to be part of a brand that they can tell people, I work for Harvard Business School Press or I work for Google, and that matters a lot to them. 
And as Rick said earlier in the interview, that they, in some sense, have their professional life more structured by a larger organization. And those are perfectly legitimate feelings. So going down this path in a way begins with a self-assessment of what’s really important to you. 
RICHARD RUBACK: Right, who do you like to have lunch with? Because if you’re the owner, Sarah the porta potty queen of Boston is going to have lunch most of the time by herself at her desk, if she even gets lunch. And that’s very different than the social interactions that you get in a more established, larger enterprise that have lots of successful professional, well-dressed people hanging around. 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: What are some of the things that might go wrong with buying a small business? What are some of the things people might have to watch out for? 
ROYCE YUDKOFF: Of all the people we see who march down this path, about 75% succeed in acquiring a small firm of the type we describe. And usually they accomplish that in about a one to two year period. So 3/4 of those people accomplish this. The remaining quarter don’t and usually go back and get a job that’s similar to the job they had before they did this. 
When they buy these businesses, what we observe is that, if they’re buying the kind of enduringly profitable small firm Rick and I describe, it’s very hard to find anyone who has gone out of business or failed because these companies are so resilient, although some of them, of course, will face a downturn like marching through a big recession. But it is a pretty resilient economic opportunity, in our observation. 
Can I just add one thing to this? When you ask about risks, I feel compelled to remind us about the alternative, which is that, when you go to work in someone else’s company, that’s not without risk. You can be denied the promotion you think you deserve. The division you work in can be shut down. For any particular reason, your boss can take a disliking to you and you could find your self shoved out of that company. 
RICHARD RUBACK: Or if I may interject, your boss’s boss may take a disliking to your boss. And that won’t be good for your career, too. And that has nothing to do with you. 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: Yeah. 
RICHARD RUBACK: So the real truth about any career in which you have aspirations is there are no guarantees. If you want a guarantee, buy a toaster. 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: Excellent. It’s been great doing the podcast all these years, but I think I’m going to go start my business now. No, seriously, thank you both for coming in today. 
ROYCE YUDKOFF: It’s a pleasure. Thanks for having us. 
RICHARD RUBACK: Thank you for having us. 
SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: That’s Harvard Business School professors Rick Ruback and Royce Yudkoff. They’re the authors of a new book, The HBR Guide to Buying a Small Business. You can find it at hbr.org. I’m Sarah Green Carmichael. Thanks for listening to the HBR IdeaCast.

Summary

Welcome to Patrick O’Shaughnessy's podcast series, Invest Like the Best.In this episode, I continue to pull on one of the most interesting threads that I have uncovered in the course of producing this podcast: the world of permanent equity.My guests today are Royce Yudkoff and Rick Ruback, two Harvard Business School professors who have partnered to create a popular class that teaches students how to search for, acquire, and run a small business directly after graduation. The course is aimed at students who want hands-on, management experience as soon as possible. After purchase, there is no timetable for selling the business. Indeed, if done well, there is never any reason to sell because the free cash flow yields to owners are higher than most alternatives.Learn More:For more episodes, go to: InvestorFieldGuide.com/podcast.

HBR Guide to Buying a Small Business: Think Big, Buy Small, Own Your Own Company
Richard S. Ruback and Royce Yudkoff
Find, acquire, and run your own business. Are you looking for an alternative to a career path at a big firm? Does founding your own start-up seem too risky? There is a radical third path open to you: you can buy a small business and run it as CEO. Purchasing a small company offers significant financial rewards—as well as personal and professional fulfillment. Leading a firm means you can be your own boss, put your executive skills to work, fashion a company environment that meets your own needs, and profit directly from your success. But finding the right business to buy and closing the deal isn't always easy. In the HBR Guide to Buying a Small Business, we help you: determine if this path is right for you, raise capital for your acquisition, find and evaluate the right prospects, avoid the pitfalls that could derail your search, understand why a "dull" business might be the best investment, negotiate a potential deal with the seller, and avoid deals that fall through at the last minute.

Buying Your Way into Entrepreneurship
Richard S. Ruback and Royce Yudkoff
An increasingly popular route to success as a small business owner is “acquisition entrepreneurship”—buying and running an existing operation. If you’re considering such a path, the authors offer practical advice for each stage of the process. Think it through. Do you have the right qualities for the job (managerial skills, confidence, persuasiveness, persistence, a thirst for learning, and tolerance for stress)? Are you willing to trade the benefits of working at a large organization for the chance to be in charge? Search diligently and efficiently. Plan to spend six months to two years—full time—following leads and systematically vetting business prospects. Focus on companies that are consistently profitable and have annual revenues of $5 million to $15 million. During this phase, you can self-finance or establish a search fund to recruit potential investors. Strike a deal. When you’ve settled on a target, do preliminary due diligence to confirm the business’s viability and arrive at a fair offer. If the seller accepts, you’ll have about 90 days to work with your accountant and attorney on confirmatory due diligence. Transition into leadership. After the sale closes, your priorities should be building relationships (with employees, customers, and suppliers) and setting up processes to ensure steady cash flow.

				  Acquisition; 
				  Planning;

Valuation of Bankrupt Firms
S. C. Gilson, E. S. Hotchkiss and R. S. Ruback
This study compares the market value of firms that reorganize in bankruptcy with estimates of value based on management's published cash flow projections. We estimate firm values using models that have been shown in other contexts to generate relatively precise estimates of value. We find that these methods generally yield unbiased estimates of value, but the dispersion of valuation errors is very wide—the sample ratio of estimated value to market value varies from less than 20% to greater than 250%. Cross-sectional analysis indicates that the variation in these errors is related to empirical proxies for claimholders' incentives to overstate or understate the firm's value.

Behavioral Corporate Finance: A Survey
Malcolm Baker, Richard Ruback and Jeffrey Wurgler
Research in behavioral corporate finance takes two distinct approaches. The first emphasizes that investors are less than fully rational. It views managerial financing and investment decisions as rational responses to securities market mispricing. The second approach emphasizes that managers are less than fully rational. It studies the effect of nonstandard preferences and judgmental biases on managerial decisions. This survey reviews the theory, empirical challenges, and current evidence pertaining to each approach. Overall, the behavioral approaches help to explain a number of important financing and investment patterns. The survey closes with a list of open questions.

Valuation When Cash Flow Forecasts Are Biased
Richard S. Ruback
This paper focuses adaptations to the discount cash flow (DCF) method when valuing forecasted cash flows that are biased measures of expected cash flows. I imagine a simple setting where the expected cash flows equal the forecasted cash flows plus an omitted downside. When the omitted downside is temporary, the adjustment is to deflate the forecasts and to set the discount rate equal to the cost of capital. However, when the downside is permanent, the adjustment is to deflate the cash flows and to increase the discount rate so that it includes the cost of capital plus the probability of a downside.

Red Hen Baking Company
Richard S. Ruback and Royce Yudkoff
In 2007, the Red Hen Baking Company was deciding whether to move from its cramped and inefficient facility to a new facility. It had been in business about 8 years, and 2006 was the first year RHB realized a profit that was over $50,000. The added annual cost of the new location was about $58,000 and would require a $300,000 build-out. While the owner of Red Hen was excited about the possibility of a new, efficient bakery, he wondered if it was worth the added expense and risk.

MC Tool
Richard S. Ruback and Royce Yudkoff
Two partners acquired MC Tool in October 2007 for $5 million. The company was a machine shop that manufactured parts for a wide variety of applications in the energy, automotive and industrial equipment industries. In their first year of ownership, the partners focused on improving operations and enhancing sales with impressive results: sales doubled and EBTIDA increased by over 40%. But the "Great Recession" had an immediate impact in the fall of 2008 as customers cancelled orders and new sales became scarce. MC Tool's core business was cyclical and risky. The partners were considering transforming the business towards manufacturing more precise parts that would be less cyclical and less risky.

Roxbury Technology Corporation 
Richard S. Ruback and Royce Yudkoff
Roxbury Technology is a Boston-based re-manufacturer of ink and toner cartridges. In early 2012 RTC was re-evaluating its approach to the company's two most important goals: reducing customer concentration and increasing profitability. RTC's largest customer accounted for most of its sales and the company had roughly broken even over the last two years. The two goals were intertwined because RTC's sales growth strategy had to be designed so it didn't bring the company into conflict with its largest customer. That raised its marketing costs and reduced profitability.

Castronics, LLC
Richard S. Ruback and Royce Yudkoff
Patrick Dickinson (HBS '09) and Michael Weiner (MIT's Sloan '07) acquired Castronics, a firm that specialized in threading pipe used in the oil and natural gas industry, at the end of 2009. The partners overcame significant hurdles during the first two years of ownership, which included the loss of nearly half of their workforce, the threatened entry of a formidable competitor into their market, and limited production capacity. In spite of these challenges and many other day-to-day obstacles, by the summer of 2011, the company successfully tripled production and EBITDA and the partners were deciding whether or not to sell the company.

Home Nursing of North Carolina 
Richard S. Ruback and Royce Yudkoff
Ari Medoff's (HBS '11) goal was to control his own professional destiny by owning his own company. His search identified a suitable acquisition in Home Nursing of North Carolina, and he had negotiated a purchase price of $3.5 million, or 4.2x trailing EBITDA. Medoff had completed his due diligence, arranged financing, and completed the legal documents required to complete the acquisition and anticipated closing the transaction in just a few weeks. But then the sellers surprisingly asked to renegotiate the terms of the note they had agreed to early in the acquisition process. Medoff must decide whether to renegotiate the debt or abandon the transaction.

Penn Warranty Corporation
Richard S. Ruback and Royce Yudkoff
Penn Warranty Corporation sold warranty contracts to the used car market. During the recession in 2008/2009 Penn's sales declined by 26% Instead of growing by 11% as forecasted. Also, disruptions in financial and insurance markets created a cash shortfall. In the summer of 2009, Penn was facing the likelihood of default and possible foreclosure under its loan agreements. Its lender was refusing to waive covenants unless the company paid down $1 million of its outstanding debt of $7.75 million. The only source for such a refinancing was the equity investors who funded buyout of purchase of the company eighteen months earlier.

Lind Equipment
Richard S. Ruback and Royce Yudkoff
Lind Equipment failed to meet its loan covenants with its senior bank lender in the summer of 2008, just six months after it was acquired. While the senior bank debt comprised only 6% of the capital used in the acquisition and was fully secured, it exercised its right to stop payments to Lind's subordinated lender that funded about 40% of the acquisition, pushing that debt into default as well. These financial problems were the result of declining revenues and profits at Lind as exchange rates and the impact of the Great Recession took its toll on the firm. Without a quick solution, Lind could be pushed into bankruptcy.

National Public Broadcasting
Richard S. Ruback and Royce Yudkoff
Bob Williams, the CEO of National Public Broadcasting (NPB), was considering an unsolicited offer to purchase the company in the early spring of 2006. The company was a media underwriting representative for public television and radio stations throughout the United States. When Mr. Williams and his wife Linda Williams started NPB in 1996, they had imagined that it would grow quickly and be acquired by a larger media representation firm in a few years. But the business proved to be more complex than they had anticipated with slower growth and less interest from strategic acquirers and, as a result, Mr. Williams had been running NPB ever since. The unsolicited offer gave the Williams and their partners the potential opportunity to realize a significant cash payment for the business. The case explores the impact on the sale of the ownership structure decisions that were made when NPB was formed and the complexity of the sales process for small businesses.

Triple Point Technology
Richard S. Ruback and Royce Yudkoff
The founding CEO of Triple Point Technology, Peter Armstrong, was considering the sale of the company. The company specialized in providing its clients with software used for transaction processing and risk management in various commodity markets. Triple Point Technology had grown substantially in its 13 years of existence and potentially was a source of a significant amount of wealth for its owners. The sale was prompted by a co-founder who wanted to sell his share of the business. The case explores the rationale for owners to monetize at least a portion of their company's value, the sales process, and compares two different offers from the perspective of the company's executives that will have a significant continuing interest in it.

Next Street was a for-profit business that aimed to increase the growth, profitability and success of its client companies, thereby enhancing economic development, wealth and job creation in the inner city. The advisory component of its mission seemed well underway but raising a fund to directly finance client companies had proved challenging. As Next Street considered expanding its capacity to help clients achieve their growth potential, the firm was deciding between raising a fund or focusing its resources on expanding its abilities to more effectively help its clients obtain financing from other institutions.

Clear Channel 2006
Richard S. Ruback and Leslie Pierson
The Board of Directors of Clear Channel Communications, a radio broadcasting and outdoor advertising company, has to respond to a revised proposal from two private equity firms to take the company private. In November of 2006, the Board had unanimously approved an offer of $37.60 per share after going through intense negotiations with numerous firms, but institutional shareholders had indicated that they would reject this offer. In light of this recent news, the two private equity firms had come back to the Board with a revised offer. Now the Board must decide if it thinks the new proposal will satisfy the institutional shareholders, one of which is an activist hedge fund.

The Restructuring of Daiei
Richard S. Ruback
In 2004, the Industrial Revitalization Corporation of Japan (IRCJ) was given the task of restructuring Daiei, one of the largest Japanese retailers and the country's most prominent zombie companies. The IRCJ was a government-sponsored organization that was funded with 50 billion yen in equity capital and 10 trillion yen of government - guaranteed funds. Daiei presented the IRCJ with a unique opportunity to demonstrate the effectiveness of its restructuring strategy which would require a significant write-down of Daiei's bank debts, substantial store closures and workforce reductions, and sufficient new private equity capital to help reposition and revitalize Daiei's retail operations. Overcoming these hurdles in a large and visible company like Daiei would be an important accomplishment for the IRCJ. But, failure, too, would have far reaching consequences.

ABRY Fund V
Nabil N. El-Hage, Richard S. Ruback and Leslie Pierson
In January 2006, Andrew Banks and Royce Yudkoff were considering raising a 5th fund for their media-focused private equity firm, ABRY Partners. ABRY had a strong track record that the co-founders attributed to their group's deep knowledge of the media industry and relationships with media lenders, coupled with a client-service approach to working with Limited Partners. For the fund, Banks and Yudkoff had intended to raise $1 billion and continue their existing strategy, but potential Limited Partners had indicated that they would be willing to commit up to $4 billion. Banks and Yudkoff had to decide whether or not to quadruple the capital in their latest fund.

Dell's Working Capital
Richard S. Ruback and Aldo Sesia
Dell Computer Corp. manufactures, sells, and services personal computers. The company markets its computers directly to its customers and builds computers after receiving a customer order. This build-to-order model enables Dell to have much smaller investment in working capital than its competitors. It also enables Dell to more fully enjoy the benefits of reduction in component prices and to introduce new products more quickly. Dell has grown quickly and has been able to finance that growth internally by its efficient use of working capital and its profitability. This case highlights the importance of working capital management in a rapidly growing firm.

Pharmacyclics: Financing Research & Development
Malcolm P. Baker, Richard S. Ruback and Aldo Sesia
Pharmacyclics (NASDAQ: PCYC), a pharmaceutical company that manufactures products that will improve existing therapeutic treatments for cancer, arteriosclerosis, and retinal disease, was considering a $60 million private placement in February 2000. The company had more cash than ever before, but projections of R&D and marketing expenses were also unprecedented. PCYC's most promising oncology drug, a radiation enhancer called Xcytrin, was in Phase III clinical trials--the rigorous final phase before FDA approval for commercialization. Analysts gave the drug a slightly better than 50% chance of success. This case focuses on stage financing and a simple decision-tree evaluation. Students have the opportunity to consider the impact of past staged financing decisions on the ownership structure of the firm and to evaluate the current stock market price in light of analyst forecasts of the cash flow and the probability of success for each drug. These two analyses help inform the private placement decision.

Health Development Corporation
Richard S. Ruback
Health Development Corp. (HDC) owns and operates health clubs in the Greater Boston area. HDC engaged a local investment banker to explore a sale of the company. The most likely buyer views HDC's prior purchase of real estate as a negative. HDC's management is convinced the purchase enhanced value, and a discounted cash flow analysis confirms that it was a substantially positive net present value decision. Nevertheless, the real estate reduces the valuation according to the approach used by the potential buyer. The challenge is to structure a transaction that allows HDC to realize its full value.

Tree Values
Richard S. Ruback and Kathleen Luchs
Describes two alternative tree cutting strategies. The first is to cut all trees that are at least 12 inches in diameter at breast height. The second is to thin the forest by cutting less desirable trees immediately and harvesting the crop trees later. The case presents information for students to estimate the cash flows for each alternative. After estimating the corresponding cash flows, students have the opportunity to use discounted cash flow techniques to decide when to cut trees under each strategy and to select which strategy maximizes the value of the forest.

Southland Corp. (A)
Richard S. Ruback
Examines the Thompson's $4.9 billion leveraged buyout of the Southland Corp. in 1987. As the original founders of Southland, the Thompsons were concerned about losing control over the company upon learning of the Belzberg family's acquiring interest. The teaching objectives are: to explore the characteristics of an LBO candidate, to examine the dynamics of the corporate control process when insiders are substantial stockholders, and therefore serve as both buyer and seller, and to evaluate the cash flow forecasts in an LBO and use them to analyze bidding behavior.

Introduction to Cash Flow Valuation Methods
Richard S. Ruback
Provides an introduction to three cash flow valuation methods. The three methods differ in their measure of cash flows and the discount rate applied to those cash flows. The names for the three methods correspond to the type of cash flow that is used in the valuation: Equity Cash Flow (ECF), Capital Cash Flow (CCF), and Free Cash Flow (FCF). The three methods provide consistent valuations when applied correctly.

A Note on Capital Cash Flow Valuation
Richard S. Ruback
Presents the capital cash flow method for valuing risky cash flows. In this method cash flows are calculated to include the benefits of interest tax shields. In a capital structure, with just ordinary debt and common equity, capital cash flows equal the flows available to equity--net income plus depreciation less capital expenditure and the change in working capital--plus the cash interest paid to bondholders. The interest tax shields decrease taxable income and thereby increase cash flows. Since the interest tax shields are included in the cash flows, a before-tax interest rate that corresponds to the riskiness of the assets is appropriate to value the capital cash flows.
Keywords: Capital; 
				  Cash Flow; 
				  Valuation;

Pioneer Petroleum Corp.

Pioneer is an integrated oil company. Its operations include exploration and development, production, transportation, and marketing. The case focuses on Pioneer's cost of capital calculations and its choice between a single company-wide cost of capital or divisional costs of capital. Provides students the opportunity to learn how to calculate a company-wide weighted average cost of capital. An appropriate measure of the cost of equity capital is presented so that students are able to challenge their understanding of key concepts by critiquing the company's measure and suggesting their own.

Estimating Industry Multiples
Malcolm Baker and R. S. Ruback
We analyze industry multiples for the S&P 500 in 1995. We use Gibbs sampling to estimate simultaneously the error specification and small sample minimum variance multiples for 22 industries. In addition, we consider the performance of four common multiples: the simple mean, the harmonic mean, the value-weighted mean, and the median. The harmonic mean is a close approximation to the Gibbs minimum variance estimates. Finally, we show that EBITDA is a better single basis of substitutability than  EBIT or revenue in the industries that we examine.
