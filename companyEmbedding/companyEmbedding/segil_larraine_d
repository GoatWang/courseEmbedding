Recently a friend asked us to post our wedding photos – brought back memories so many years ago!

Posted on July 20, 2017 by Grandma 

 We are almost at 49 years of marriage – the big 50 coming up soon! Here are two pictures of that day. So young – I was just 19 and  my husband was 29. And we are still together! My father had died suddenly a few months before the wedding and you can see some of that sadness in my face – mixed with the wonder of being a bride.

A gorgeous picture of our little family – all looking healthy and happy! Lucky us! And a great zucchini salad

Posted on July 19, 2017 by Grandma 

 Summers are wonderful in California – actually any time of year is great! And here is a super summer salad – no need to cook – light and easy to make – enjoy! Also a great picture of my son and I and then another one of our immediate family looking happy and healthy!
RAW ZUCCHINI SALAD
 INGREDIENTS


·        1 pound medium or small zucchini, preferably a mix of green and yellow
·        Salt to taste
·        3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
·        1 garlic clove, crushed
·        3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
·        2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley, mint, chives, dill or a combination

DIRECTIONS:

 
1. Slice the squash as thinly as you can. Sprinkle with salt, preferably kosher salt, and let sit for 15 to 30 minutes. Rinse and drain on paper towels.
2.   Mix together the lemon juice, garlic and olive oil. Toss with the zucchini. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for four to six hours.

Telacu Foundation had its annual gala and I am honored to serve on their advisory board

Posted on July 15, 2017 by Grandma 

 What a star studded event it was! Hundreds of Telacu scholarship winners were on the stage and the tables were filled with luminaries from all over the State of California and elsewhere. And all of this is the brainchild and passion of David and Priscilla Lizarraga. It is an honor to serve on their advisory board – as their mission of finding worthy students and supporting them with money and mentoring is indeed my passion with the Larraine Segil Scholars. Here they are with their son David, the heir of the Telacu mission as well as a superb musician with many other talents to be sure. Of course I am accompanied by my husband Clive. What a FABULOUS evening down at LA LIVE. Priscilla developed and produced the whole event – and it was so professionally done that I suggested she take her skills to the academy awards! The evening was perfection!

Our new Segil Urban Farm Fellow was appointed this last weekend – a wonderful celebration!

Posted on July 12, 2017 by Grandma 

This is the time of year that the Segil Urban Farm Fellow is appointed through an endowment my husband and I have made to the Shalom Institute. What a fabulous camp it is and the environment with the market garden, animals, bees and more – some of which we taught and donated – thriving with young adults and all the children ( thousands) who attend the camp year round being exposed to nature and good values and how the two are intertwined.
Here we are with our family and in the lower photo with the counselors who tend the garden and animals, Ariel our special Segil Urban Farm Fellow, the Camp CEO Bill and Camp Director Joel ( and divine little one) with expert photographer Marsha capturing the shot with our family too. Happiness is this!

Shakshuka – a Middle Eastern dish that is delicious!

Posted on July 10, 2017 by Grandma 

Shakshuka is served in the Middle East especially in Israel – you can find it in the USA in many middle eastern restaurants. It is good for breakfast, lunch, dinner or in between and with warmed fresh pita is divine! And of course we use our Little Farm Tomatoes, onion and garlic as well as Italian parsley for garnish  – yummy! 
Shakshuka – Little Farm Style
Ingredients

1/4 cup of olive oil
1 large onion chopped
1 clove of garlic mashed
1 red and 1 yellow pepper seeded and chopped
8-10 large tomatoes ( try to use the farmers market ones – they have such a good taste compared to supermarket ones)
2 Tbsp of paprika
2 Tbsp of mild chili ( add a touch of cayenne if you like it hot!)
1 tsp of cumin powder ( or more to taste)
Salt and Pepper to taste
6 eggs


Directions:

Use a cast iron pan if possible.
Heat the oil.
Fry the onions in the heated oil until translucent
Add the garlic and saute for a few moments until combined
Add the chopped peppers and saute until soft
Add the chopped tomatoes with their juice
Add the chili powder, paprika, cumin and salt and pepper and combine well
Allow to simmer for about 10-15 minutes until the liquid has reduced
Break the eggs in a circular pattern – with one in the middle 
Cover the pan and allow to simmer until the eggs are the right consistency for you. ( you can add chopped parsley for garnish if you wish – we didn’t)
Serve in the pan, with warmed Pita bread ( for dipping and wiping out the pan too!

Carrot Salad  and Cucumber soup – both are easy and low calorie

Posted on July 5, 2017 by Grandma 

 Post holiday weekend – and all that sugar fat and yummy stuff — sigh – today is back to watching what I put in my mouth day – and here is a truly fabulous low calorie carrot salad. One of the best things about it is that  you have to do a LOT of chewing – so it takes longer to eat and so one gets fuller sooner! And the cucumber soup is refreshing and cool and also low calorie. 
Cucumber Soup
Ingredients:

8 small Persian cucumbers or two large English ones cleaned, chopped but not peeled
1/4 cup of chopped sweet onion ( I used red onion my favorite)
1 chopped garlic clove
1 cup of vegetable or chicken stock ( depends on whether you want it vegetarian or not)
1 cup of Fage 0% Fat yogurt
1 cup of non fat Sour Cream
Dill plus thin slices of cucumber for garnish

 Directions:
Blend first four ingredients in a blender then add the yogurt and cream and blend again – add more stock for desired consistency – cool in the fridge for a few hours -and serve. It is that easy!

Carrot Salad:
Ingredients

6 large carrots peeled and cleaned and then grated
2 tbsp of yellow raisins
1/2 cup of non fat sour cream
1/8 cup of balsalmic vinegar
1 small packet of stevia or splenda or 1 tbsp of sugar ( if you do not mind the calories and prefer rather than using the chemicals in the artificial sweetener)


Directions:
Mix the carrots and raisins. Mix the cream vinegar and sugar separately – then mix all together. Cool in the fridge and serve. YUM!

Failed Cobb Salad Pizza recipe from Cooking Light – looks good but tasted bad! Plus adorable pics of our twins!

Posted on June 18, 2017 by Grandma 

 I tried a really fun looking recipe from Cooking Light and it was a disaster. So I am sharing it with you. The good news was that same weekend our grandson twins had a hip hop concert  – so adorable – lots of running around the stage – but they are darling so we hollered and yelled and they were happy and so were we!

 
So here is the recipe – I failed at it – what about you?www.cookinglight.com/recipes/cobb-pizza
What happened to me is the following:
1. Pizza crust got too hard
2. All the pieces kept falling off as we tried to eat it
3. Finally we gave up and eat the toppings and threw away the pizza part.
Not worth the calories. 
I am sure I was the problem as Cooking light are normally fabulous. Sigh and oh well. Onward we go! I had an empathetic group for lunch ( my god daughter and her son) and since I had great cookies for dessert that made up for it.

The New Segil Urban Farm Fellow – Training Camp staff in Urban Farming, Beekeeping and More

Posted on June 11, 2017 by Grandma 

Every year we endow a young adult to become a Segil Urban Farm Fellow at the Shalom Institute Children’s camp in Malibu. My husband Clive trains them with his deep knowledge of farming in an urban environment ( although you can see from the picture below that the camp is in the middle of a bucolic scene protected by federal and state parks in the mountains of Malibu – but don’t forget –  it is surrounded by a city of 10 million people!). 
Clive is an expert beekeeper too and the Institute has many offspring of our animals ( goats and chickens) as well as beehives my husband and our farm manager Max, have rescued. Thousands of children from far and wide, including many inner city kids who have no idea that eggs do not come from the supermarket but are laid by chickens, attend this camp for weeks, or weekends depending on the program. The camp also  has a special program called Shemesh for special needs children and adults. All moves the heart and soul and we are so proud to be involved albeit in a small way.
When reading a variety of texts, especially the Talmud, the 5 books of Moses ( The Torah), and the Bible both old and new testaments , it is found that acts of goodness are the active representation of a covenant among people, a social contract. This is not about simply getting a request in the mail for funds and writing a check, or bringing a can of soup to a box at your Church or Synagogue. It is not even about showing up once a year at the homeless shelter or soup kitchen or writing letters to Congress to effect social policies. Those are truly important, relevant acts, but they fail to engage people in relationships of understanding. It is when we become engaged with real people and communities on the other end of our giving of time and resources that we realize the covenantal aspect of doing good. The Segil Urban Farm Fellowship along with our Larraine Segil Scholars are our ways of creating joy for others as well as receiving joy at the same time. In a few months, there will be a small ceremony at the Camp for the new farm fellow and I will post a picture then with her name and background. Stay tuned!

Making Ossobucco – yummy! And in the slow cooker it is a snap to make!

Posted on June 9, 2017 by Grandma 

 This is a really easy recipe for Osso-bucco using my Slow Cooker.
Slow-Cooker Osso Buco
Servings: 4

Bottom of Form

Ingredients
·        1/2 cup all-purpose flour
·        Four 1-1/2- to 2-inch-thick veal shanks (about 2-1/2 lb.)
·        Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
·        2 Tbs. unsalted butter
·        1 cup dry white wine
·        One 14-1/2-oz. can diced tomatoes
·        3/4 cup lower-salt chicken broth
·        1 small red onion, chopped (1-1/2 cups)
·        1 medium carrot, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch-thick rounds (1/2 cup)
·        1 stalk celery, chopped (1/2 cup)
·        5 sprigs fresh thyme
·        3 Tbs. finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
·        1 Tbs. finely grated lemon zest
·        1 large clove garlic, minced (1 tsp.)
Preparation
·        Put the flour in a wide, shallow dish. Season the veal shanks all over with salt and pepper and dredge in the flour; shake off the excess flour.
Heat a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add the butter, and when it foams, add the shanks to the skillet. Cook until golden, turning once, about 10 minutes. Transfer the shanks to a slow cooker.
Add the wine to the skillet. Scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet and pour the contents of the skillet into the slow cooker. Add the tomatoes and their juices, chicken broth, onion, carrot, celery, and thyme. Cover and cook on low heat for 6 to 8 hours—the meat will be very tender and almost falling off the bone.
Transfer the shanks to a platter and cover with foil to keep warm. Pour the sauce from the slow cooker into a large skillet. Simmer over medium heat until reduced to about 2 cups, 10 to 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the parsley, lemon zest, and garlic to make a gremolata. Serve the veal shanks topped with the sauce and the gremolata.
