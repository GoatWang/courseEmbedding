What started as a passion project for Mikaila Ulmer has turned into something much bigger.
The 11-year-old Austin entrepreneur and her family recently changed the name of their company from Bee Sweet Lemonade to Me & the Bees LLC, reflecting a desire to move into other products.

“When I started, I thought it was going to be a one-time thing but it actually grew and I realized the name wasn’t right,” Mikaila said.




An appearance on ABC-TV’s “Shark Tank” in March 2015 was the start of a whirlwind publicity tour. She has visited the White House multiple times — to attend a 2015 state dinner, then again in March of this year as a guest chef at the White House Easter Egg Roll. What’s more, she spoke in May at a New York City event hosted by Microsoft Corp. highlighting standout students and appeared on “Good Morning America” to promote her business —and win over the hearts of millions of viewers. Between all of those engagements, plus the regular childhood obligations of school and playtime with friends, she found time to speak to Austin Business Journal about her plans.
Me & the Bees has more than doubled production in the past year — the company sold 89,666 bottles of lemonade from January-May 2016, up from 33,879 bottles in the same period in 2015. The company has also reached a distribution agreement with Rhode Island-based United Natural Foods Inc. — one of the nation’s largest distributors of natural and organic foods with 2015 revenue of $8.2 billion — which got Me & the Bees lemonade onto the shelves of 39 Austin-area Starbucks store for an eight-week trial.
The company’s lemonade is also sold in more than 70 stores throughout the Southeast U.S., including 55 Whole Foods Market Inc. locations.




 


“It has been super cool traveling to all of these different places and meeting really cool people,” Mikaila said.
Plans aren’t solidified but she is considering new product lines in gift merchandise plus food and drinks. She also wants to continue motivational speaking and will travel to Cape Town, South Africa this summer for a summit hosted by the Dell Women’s Entrepreneur Network.

Most of Me & the Bee’s expansion has been funded by revenue growth. The company also received an early $35,000 loan from the city of Austin and is now considering seeking investments. D’Andra Ulmer, Mikaila’s mother, said the company is open to venture capital and other forms of funding “so we can finance explosive growth.”
No matter what direction the business takes, D’Andra said she was “so proud” of her daughter’s achievements — both as an entrepreneur and as a young girl making a big imprint on the world.
“As a parent, what’s really important is that she’s a good person, she’s kind, she’s respectful, a good friend and a good big sister,” D’Andra said.
Mikaila started her business in part to raise money for bee preservation groups. Its wild success has taught her one very important lesson.
“You don’t have to be an adult to solve problems,” Mikaila said.

Me & the Bees Lemonade Raises $810k from Football Players and Advisors

Press Release Jul. 14, 2017 at 10:56 am









        More 












AUSTIN and HOUSTON, TX (July 13, 2017) – Me & the Bees Lemonade, a startup ready to drink bottled line of lemonade launched by “Kidpreneur” Mikaila Ulmer 8 years ago when she was only 4, has attracted a sweet investment deal from high profile Angels and Beelievers. The company announced today that a group of 12 angel investors comprised of 10 professional football players and two advisors has contributed $810,000 in funding to support the growth of the company’s distribution channels and to increase production.

Me & the Bees Lemonade is a privately held company based in Austin, Texas, that has grown over 100 percent each year since 2014. Four varieties of the lemonade are being distributed nationally at Whole Foods Market, Wegman’s, as well as regional and local stores and hotels such as the W Hotel in Austin.
Theo Ulmer, chief operating officer of Me & the Bees Lemonade and father of founder Mikaila Ulmer, listed the angel investors and their affiliation as follows:

Omar Bolden – Safety, Chicago Bears and Denver Broncos
Duane A. Brown – Offensive Tackle, Houston Texans
Arian Foster – former Running Back, Houston Texans and Miami Dolphins
Jonathan Grimes – Running Back, Houston Texans, New York Jets, Jacksonville Jaguars
Malik B. Jackson – Defensive Tackle, Denver Broncos, Jacksonville Jaguars
Lameck Humble Lukanga –  Certified Financial Planner for athletes, entertainers and executives; founder of Life Line Financial Group
E.J. Manuel – Quarterback, Oakland Raiders, Buffalo Bills
Nick Martin – Vice President, SVP, Strategic Partnerships McLaren
Sharrick McManis –  Cornerback, Houston Texans, Chicago Bears
Glover Quin Jr. – Safety, Houston Texans, Detroit Lions
Darius Slay – Cornerback, Detroit Lions
Bobby Wagner – Linebacker, Seattle Seahawks

Foster and Quin participated in a press conference last week in Houston to demonstrate their commitment to and involvement with Mikaila, her parents D’Andra Ulmer and Theo Ulmer, and Me & the Bees Lemonade.  Earlier in the day, Foster and Quin presented with Mikaila in the Bee Brilliant Entrepreneur Workshop that was co-hosted with Lemonade Day Houston at the Holthouse Boys & Girls Club. The workshop was focused on teaching 100 underserved youth in grades 3rd through 5th how to start and run their own lemonade businesses.  Mikaila had participated in Lemonade Day Austin in 2010 where she won awards for her flaxseed lemonade made with local Austin honey.
Me & the Bees Lemonade is buzzing with activity:  the company has increased distribution by over 104%  from 2016 year to 2017 year; Cascadia Managing Brands is actively engaged as a national brand Manager, charged with expanding sales, distribution and marketing throughout the United States; prominent Beelievers such as Foster and Quin are stepping up with funding and endorsements; Mikaila has appeared on Shark Tank and was featured on the 20/20 episode honoring Shark Tank that aired on Feb. 24, 2017; she has been invited to The White House and has met President Barack Obama three times; and she is a nationally recognized speaker.
“Everyone is as busy as bees, working to increase the number of stores where my lemonade is being sold. If it’s not already in your neighborhood store, please ask your local retailer or restaurant to carry Me & the Bees Lemonade.” Said Mikaila
More About Mikaila and Me & the Bees Lemonade
Me & the Bees Lemonade is a bottled all natural lemonade product with an interesting back story. While preparing for a children’s business competition at the age of 4, Mikaila found her Great Granny Helen’s flaxseed lemonade recipe in a 1940’s family cookbook.  She also was stung by a bee twice in the same week, which Mikaila admits was a very uncomfortable experience. Encouraged by her parents to overcome her fear of bees, Mikaila began to study bees and their role in the ecosystem. She learned that bees pollinate about a third of the foods that humans consume and that the bee population is decreasing.
“I became fascinated with bees.  I realized that I could use local honey from bees to sweeten my Great Granny Helen’s flaxseed lemonade recipe, and that is how Me & the Bees was born. Now, I want to see Me & the Bees distributed worldwide.  My goal is to offer a wide range of lemonade products and to one day expand beyond lemonade.  With a larger audience and the launch of a non-profit organization in the near future, my team and I can make a greater impact on saving the bees,” commented Mikaila Ulmer, 12, founder and CEO of Me & the Bees. Mikaila is a full-time, straight A student and resides with her family in Austin.
“I also want Me & the Bees to inspire kids to start and run their own companies,” Mikaila added.

Arian Foster, Glover Quin invest in 12-year-old's lemonade company

1 / 9


Back to Gallery
















Retired from the NFL, former Texans Pro Bowl running back Arian Foster looks for strategic investments.
And Foster liked the idea of getting involved with Me & The Bees Lemonade, a startup company founded by a budding businesswoman, 12-year-old Mikaila Ulmer. Ulmer has appeared on Shark Tank and Good Morning America.
"She's so humble," Foster said Thursday at "Been Brilliant Entrepreneur Day" at Holthouse Boys & Girls Club in Houston. "You always have to be open and willing to learn, and she is. I'm learning from her, too. It's a cycle. You have to keep an open mind and continue to grow."



The company was launched by Ulmer and her family after she got started selling her great grandmother's flaxseed lemonade recipe at a stand in her hometown of Austin. The privately held business has grown more than 100 percent each year since 2014. The product, which includes several flavors, is sold at Whole Foods, Wegman's and other local storees.
A total of $810,00 has been invested through Foster along with Detroit Lions safety Glover Quin, Texans offensive tackle Duane Brown, former Texans running back Jonathan Grimes, other NFL players, including safety Omar Bolden, linebacker Bobby Wagner, cornerback Darius Slay, cornerback Sharrick McManis, quarterback EJ Manuel, defensive tackle Malik Jackson, SVP vice president Nick Martin and financial planner Lameck "Humble" Lukanga.
"It's awesome that I get to work with and around these two," Ulmer said while sitting next to Foster and Quin. "They're very smart. I learned a lot from them in the past couple of hours. I'm very happy that I'm able to work with them and they invested in my company and them helpnig us and mentoring us and believing in our mission. I think we have a better chance of achieving our goals. That keeps me pumped and excited every day."
The company wants to increase distribution while also saving bees.

"Of course, anytime you invest in anything you look at if it's going to be profitable," Foster said. "We look for companies that match our main focus of developing a good product, but are also good people and do it for the right reasons. It's more than about money to us. We believe that investing in small black businesses is extremely important."
Ulmer signed up for two youth entrepreneur events when she was four and has continued to educate herself about the business world.
"She's super smart," Quin said. "She's very special. Obviously, she has a bright future. Hopefully, I can be a part of it and nourish it and watch her grow. The sky is the limit. I'm very impressed with her."

11-year-old entrepreneur's sweet success story

 Mikaila Ulmer is only 11 years old but she's all about the business of bees. 
 She's a social entrepreneur, public speaker, philanthropist and a savvy 6th-grader from Austin, Texas whose signature venture, "Me & The Bees" lemonade — developed from her great-grandmother's 1940 recipe — is now a thriving national business. 
 After securing $60,000 on the hit TV show "Shark Tank," last year, Mikaila's lemonade will now be sold in 55 Whole Food stores — the world’s leader in natural and organic foods — in states including Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and Florida. 
 While accepting her honors as one of the Movement50 (MVMT50) Top 10 Innovators of the Year at the South by Southwest festival, Mikaila also announced expanded distribution through UNFI (United Natural Foods), a leading national distributor of natural foods and beverages.

 Mikaila, who started her lemonade business in 2009, said the operation takes organization, commitment and energy. 
 "I work on the business after school, after I do my homework, and on weekends and during spring breaks," Mikaila said in an interview with NBCBLK. "There are not too many times when I feel stressed." 
 But Mikaila didn't always like bees. 
 "When I was four years old, I got stung by two bees in one week," she said. "It was painful. I was terrified of bees." 
 Mikaila said her mother, D'Andra, turned the scary experience into an insect research assignment where Mikaila learned that bees could possibly become extinct in the years to come. 
 "And then it clicked!" she said. 
 Mikaila decided to create a lemonade business and sweeten her lemonade with honey instead of sugar or artificial sweetener, which would be healthier, save the bees, and support beekeepers.

 For Mikaila, her enterprise is an environmental and social mission. She donates a portion of the profits from the sale of her lemonade to local and international organizations that are trying to save the honeybees. 
 Honey bees pollinate more than $15 billion of crops each year, about one-third of American food groups, including cherries and apples. 
 "Last year, beekeepers lost 40 percent of all their hives," Mikaila said. "Bees are dying.” She quoted Albert Einstein who said: "If the bee disappeared off the surface of the globe then man would only have four years of life left." 
 Today, Mikaila leads workshops on how to save the honeybees, and she participates in social entrepreneurship panels. 
 "I think she is a pretty hard worker," D'Andra Ulmer, Mikaila's mother, told NBCBLK. "I'm impressed with how she gets her homework done during her travels. She has a gift for public speaking but what makes me very proud is that she is not only a smart entrepreneur but she's a good person and she's kind to people. That's more important than business."

 Mikaila said when she first started her lemonade operation, her friends were skeptical. 
 "At first, they didn't believe me," she said. "Now I am helping my friends start their own businesses." 
 But Mikaila is busy for a school-age girl. 
 She appeared on the television show "Shark Tank" where she was poised during her presentation. 
 "I was nervous and excited," she said. "Not everyone gets an opportunity to pitch their products in front of millions of people and make a deal so I was excited and grateful." 
 FUBU CEO Daymond John, an investor on "Shark Tank," said he was pleased to join Mikaila's team. 
 "Partnering with Mikaila made perfect sense," John said in a statement. "She's a great kid with a head for business and branding," 
 Mikaila also attended the White House Kids' State Dinner last year where she met President Barack Obama. 
 "The President said 'sorry to crash the party!' It was very cool," Mikaila said.

 She will return to the White House in April for the annual White House Easter Egg Roll. 
 And in June, Mikaila will travel to Cape Town, South Africa to speak to young girls about entrepreneurship. 
 "I'm very excited," she said. 
 In the meantime, Mikaila said she is moving forward with creating new lemonade flavors as her business continues to expand. 
 "I want to help save the bees," she said, "and use my great-grandmother Helen's lemonade recipe."

Our Sweet Story
Let our founder, Mikaila, explain the origin of Me & the Bees Lemonade:
When I was just four, my family encouraged me to make a product for a Children's business competition (the Acton Children’s Business Fair) and Austin Lemonade Day. So I put on my thinking cap. I thought about some ideas. While I was thinking, two big events happened.  

I got stung by a bee. Twice.  
Then my Great Granny Helen, who lives in Cameron, South Carolina, sent my family a 1940's cookbook, which included her special recipe for Flaxseed Lemonade.  

I didn't enjoy the bee stings at all. They scared me. But then something strange happened. I became fascinated with bees. I learned all about what they do for me and our ecosystem. So then I thought, what if I make something that helps honeybees and uses my Great Granny Helen's recipe? 
That's how Me & the Bees Lemonade was born. It comes from my Great Granny Helen's flaxseed recipe and my new love for bees. So that's why we sweeten it with local honey. And today my little idea continues to grow. 
It was a sweet success from the start. Year-after-year, Mikaila, sells-out of her Me & the Bees Lemonade at youth entrepreneurial events while donating a percentage of the profits from the sale of her lemonade to local and international organizations fighting hard to save the honeybees. That is why she touts: Buy a Bottle…Save a Bee.
Now at age 12, when not at her lemonade stand telling all the digestive benefits of flaxseed, you can find Mikaila leading workshops on how to save the honeybees, and participating in social entrepreneurship panels. Mikaila launched her own Facebook page, where visitors can ‘Like’ interesting facts about bees, honey and Me & the Bees Lemonade. 
Today, the award-winning Me & the Bees Lemonade is buzzing off the shelves of Whole Foods Market, the world’s leader in natural and organic foods, and available at a growing number of restaurants, food trailers and natural food delivery companies.

MIKAILA ULMER SCORES $810,000 INVESTMENT DEAL FOR ‘ME AND THE BEES’ LEMONADE COMPANY

Mikaila Ulmer just keeps winning! The 12 year old recently received a huge business investment from Arian Foster and several other NFL players who put $810,000 into Mikaila's Me & the Bees Lemonade company.
"Of course, any time you invest in anything you look at if it’s going to be profitable," Arian told media. "We look for companies that match our main focus of developing a good product, but are also good people and do it for the right reasons. It’s more than about money to us. We believe that investing in small black businesses is extremely important."





 #TBT // Last Thursday we celebrated Thanksgiving; a time to reflect on being thankful, but I don’t think we should limit being grateful to one day, we should show it everyday! I recently lost my Great Granny Helen, whose flaxseed lemonade recipe was the inspiration behind Me & the Bees Lemonade. Join me in showing my love and appreciation with a few days of "Granny Gratitude." I'll be sharing my favorite recipes, best quotes and special moments from our forever Queen Bee, Granny Helen. ❤️🐝🍋 - Mikaila | #GrannyGratitude #Savethebees #grateful #QueenBee #loveandlemonade #lemonde #granny
A post shared by Me & the Bees Lemonade (@mikailasbees) on Dec 1, 2016 at 3:45pm PST



The NFL star wasn't the only one who deemed Mikaila's company a gold mine. Many may recall the 12-year-old taking her idea of wholesome lemonade to investors on the hit show, Shark Tank last year. The tween and her father were so convincing in their explanation of the concept that Daymond John offered $60,000 in investment seed. He was not disappointed in his business deal with Mikaila as the tween's BeeSweet lemonade product scored a deal with Whole Foods grocery chain shortly thereafter.

Now, with nearly $1 million in recent investments, there's no telling how far Mikaila will take her company. "I’m very happy that I’m able to work with them and they invested in my company and them helping us and mentoring us and believing in our mission," the 12-year-old said of Adrian and his fellow players' seed money. "I think we have a better chance of achieving our goals. That keeps me pumped and excited every day."

Nine-year-old Mikaila Ulmer might be adorable, but you’d be a fool to underestimate her. This is a girl on a mission who’s already the owner of a thriving bottled-lemonade business with product on the shelves at Whole Foods Market and devoted customers all over Austin. Oh, and she aims to save the American honeybee, too.
Several years ago, Mikaila was stung by bees twice in one summer. Her parents, D’Andra and Theo, encouraged her to conquer her fear of bees by making a recipe with honey. Since Mikaila was already signed up for the Acton Academy’s Children’s Business Fair and had plans to sell lemonade there, she decided to incorporate local honey into the recipe and BeeSweet Lemonade was born. 
After customers tasted Mikaila’s divine concoction of tart, freshly squeezed lemons with the up-front notes of sweet, musky, floral, aromatic honey, they demanded more. Ever the perfectionist, the tiny entrepreneur went back to the kitchen to tinker with, and perfect, the recipe. To help with recipe development, Mikaila’s paternal great-grandmother handed down her own dog-eared, well-loved cookbook from the 1940s, and in its pages Mikaila discovered a lemonade recipe made with flaxseeds, which intrigued her. The family’s garden was overflowing with mint at the time, and all of the elements suddenly came together to form Mikaila’s signature drink: mint and flaxseed lemonade sweetened with honey.
Over the next several years, Mikaila participated in Austin’s Lemonade Day and continued to sell BeeSweet at the Acton Children’s Business Fair, but soon she had visions of doing more. In Tillery Park one day, the Ulmer family ran into Michael Freid, the owner of East Side Pies—a local pizza restaurant with a reputation for sourcing high-quality local ingredients. Freid was impressed with the product and with Mikaila’s determination. He encouraged her to switch from plastic to glass bottles and offered to carry BeeSweet at all four of his locations. 
Mikaila tapped her father’s financial background to understand profit margins, costs and scaling, and with a background in strategic marketing, her mother has been able to help share BeeSweet’s story. And while her parents offer guidance and support, the business is all Mikaila’s. She has the final say on everything from product quality to pitching retailers, and has worked hard to educate herself about every aspect of the business. She often sits down with her father to get a better understanding of financials; she took a beekeeping class with Round Rock Honey, and she spends a good bit of time sharing the importance of saving the honeybee with kids and adults.
Mikaila often asks people to list everything they’ve eaten on a given day, then puts a check mark next to each item that was bee-pollinated. Oftentimes, people discover they wouldn’t have had a single thing to eat that day if it weren’t for bees. “If bees left the surface of the earth,” she says with authority, “humans would have four years to live…and that’s from Albert Einstein.” 
Mikaila believes in using honey to remedy this. She’s convinced that her product will encourage more people to fall in love with honey, and that her mission-based outreach and messaging will encourage them to take action to save bees and help bring change. She shares with her audiences the importance of buying organic—not just for our own health, but to limit the amount of pesticides in the environment that contribute to colony collapse disorder. She encourages everyone she meets to plant bee-friendly flowering plants, and donates a portion of her profits to organizations working to save the honeybee (Heifer International and Texas Beekeepers Association). “Saving the bees is fun,” she says. “And I know it’s something I should be doing.”
Mikaila’s secret to success is her passion. With visions of additional flavors, wide availability in retail locations and even a BeeSweet store, she’d love to expand her lemonade empire, but one thing she won’t sacrifice is quality. On a recent visit to a co-packing operation that would allow her to increase production, the facility manager tried to convince her to do away with the fresh mint, the local honey and the freshly squeezed juice that are her signature ingredients. Mikaila would have none of it. “These ingredients are what make people like my lemonade,” she says. “I’ll just wait until I can find the right place to work with…someone who understands what’s important to me.” She’s got time—she’s only nine, after all—but our guess is that she won’t wait for long.
