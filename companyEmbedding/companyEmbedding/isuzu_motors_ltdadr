How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Beyond Tesla: 7 stocks driving the autonomous car revolution
              
              Look at these component manufacturers rather than the car companies, says Jeff Reeves.

These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform
              
              It wasn’t Trump’s “movement” that lifted stocks late last year, says Jeff Reeves. It was the promise of lower corporate tax rates.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.              
              
            

3:47 p.m. July 28, 2017






Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.

Technical Chart        When first displayed, a Technical Chart contains six months' worth of Daily price activity with the open, high, low, and close for each bar presented in a display box above the chart. Each data point can be viewed by moving your mouse through the chart. The vertical bars below the chart represent Volume and are color-coded to indicate market activity for the day:  An up day (where the price is greater than the previous price) will show a green bar. A down day (where the price is less than the previous price) will show a red bar. When the price is unchanged compared to the previous price, Volume will show as a blue bar.  On futures charts, the horizontal purple line above the Volume bars represents Open Interest. Technical Charts have the option to create Spread Charts , with the ability to choose from a number of common spreads (such as Corn 1-2, Soybeans Crush, and Wheat Butterfly), or allowing you to enter your own custom spread calculation (supporting all futures, equities, index and forex symbols). Chart Settings A chart form resides below the chart. This is where you can change the symbol, style, time frame, and other chart settings. If you are logged in to your My Barchart account, you will also see a drop-down list for any Chart Templates you've previously saved. Simply select one from the list and the settings on the template will be applied to the current chart. Basic Chart  Bar Type - choose from OHLC Bars, Candlesticks, Hollow Candlesticks, Line or Area Volume On - displays or hides the volume for the symbol. Time Frame - determines the period (Frequency) and amount of data that will be displayed on the chart (Time Period and Start/End Dates).  For Frequency, choose from Intraday, Daily, Weekly, or Monthly. for Commodity Contracts, you may also select a chart for the Contract, Nearest Futures Contract, or a Continuation chart Nearest Futures and Continuation Charts Commodity charts have three additional frequencies for Daily, Weekly and Monthly data: Contract, Nearest, and Continuation.  Daily/Weekly/Monthly Contract will plot prices for that specific contract   Daily/Weekly/Monthly Nearest Futures will use whatever contract was the Nearest Futures contract on the date of the given bar. The Price Box at the top shows the contract that was used to build the corresponding bar Daily/Weekly/Monthly Continuation Chart will always use the same MONTH specified in the chart form to build the given bar. The Price Box at the top shows the contract that was used (in this case, December, or Z)  The information is back-dated to the start of the period, so on a 5-minute chart information in the period dated 12:45 includes all trades between 12:45 and 12:49 inclusive. A trade at 13:00 would be included within the next bar dated 13:00.     A default Time Period is set based on your Frequency setting. For example, an Intraday chart will use a Time Period of 3 Days, while a Daily chart uses a Time Period of 6 Months. You may change the Time Period to increase or decrease the density of the bars displayed on the chart. The longer the time frame, the closer together the individual bars. The shorter the time frame, the more distance between the bars. You may override or further define the Time Period, or generate a historical chart, by entering a Start and End Date for the data. For example, you can get a Daily chart with 6 months of data from one year ago by entering an End Date from one year back.     Display Settings - further define what the chart will look like.  Price Box - when checked, displays a "Data View" window as you mouse-over the chart, showing OHLC for the bar, and all indicator values for the given bar.  Price Scale - when on, scale on the right of the chart shows prices. % Change Scale - when on, scale on the right of the chart shows the percent change from the open. Linear Scale - when on, scaling will calculate the most intelligent scale using the high, the low and a series of acceptable divisors for possible scales. Logarithmic Scale - when on, uses logarithmic scaling instead of the linear scaling.    Spread Chart Spread Charts allow you to choose from a number of common commodity spread chart calculations. You may also create your own custom spread chart by selecting up to three commodity contracts and multipliers, or by entering your own custom spread expression. The calculated results are displayed as a line chart. Expression: shows the calculation used to create the chart. When you select a Common Spread from the drop-down list, or when you create a Futures Spread using the fields on the form, the Expression is built automatically for you.  If you want to create your own custom Expression, you can enter the calculation directly into the Expression field. Valid syntax for an Expression calculation includes the use of addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*) and division (/) between each leg. Calculations are performed from left to right, unless you change the order of the calculation using parentheses. Examples:  IBM-DELL subtracts the last price of DELL from IBM. 2*IBM+DELL multiplies IBM by two, then adds the price of DELL. 2*DELL/3+IBM multiplies DELL by two, then divides by three, then adds IBM. (2*DELL)/(3+IBM) multiplies DELL by two, then divides the result by the sum of three plus IBM. $DXY-$SPX subtracts the S&P 500 Index from the Dollar Index. ^USDCAD+^CADAUD adds the Canadian Dollar/Australian Dollar to the US Dollar/Canadian Dollar.  Note for Futures Contracts: Barchart's charting application commonly uses the * symbol on futures contracts as a shortcut to specify the month. For example, ZC*1 will return the front month, ZC*2 returns the second month out, ZC*3 returns the third month out, etc. When creating a custom expression using futures contracts, you must use parentheses to group the order of the calculation in the expression:  (ZC*1+ZC*2+ZC*3)/3 will add the front, second and third months for Corn, then divide the result by three. (ZCZ0+ZCH11+ZCK11)/3 will add December 2010 Corn, March 2011 Corn and May 2011 Corn together, then divide the results by three. (ZC*1)*2+(ZC*3)*2 will multiply the front month for Corn by 2, then add the result to the (third month out for Corn multiplied by two). ZC*2*4 will take the second month out for Corn and multiply the price by 4.   Common Spreads: choose from a number of common commodity spreads. (the expression will be displayed once you've made a selection from the list.)  Create a Futures Spread: select up to three different commodities, including the month, year, multiplier and function (+ - / *) between the second and third leg. The expression will be built and displayed in the Expression field as you enter the different legs of the spread.   Comparison Chart  Select up to three symbols to compare against. This will generate a chart with the price data of the symbols overlayed. To produce a chart of percent changes between symbols, check the Percent Change box. The colors of the boxes (green, purple, red) indicate the color of the line that will be drawn on the chart for the symbol. You may also indicate whether to display that symbol's price scale on the left side of the chart (by default, prices will all display on the right side). Studies / Parameters Select the indicators you wish to add to the chart. To remove an indicator, click the red "delete" icon. To change an indicator's parameters, click on the indicator name.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
