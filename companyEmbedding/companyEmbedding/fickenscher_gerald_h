NYSE:SXI 







  "Gerry Fickenscher and Christian Storch are outstanding additions to the Standex board" 



    SALEM, N.H.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 8, 2004--Standex International Corporation (NYSE:SXI) today reported that Gerald H. Fickenscher and Christian Storch were elected directors at the Company's Annual Meeting. Fickenscher was elected for a one-year term and Storch was elected for a two-year term. They are replacing two directors who resigned, John Bolten, Jr., a co-founder of the Company, who had been a director since 1955 and C. Kevin Landry, who had been a director since 1975. In addition, David R. Crichton, a director since 1992 whose term expired on the date of the annual meeting, did not stand for reelection.  "Gerry Fickenscher and Christian Storch are outstanding additions to the Standex board," said Nick Muller, chairman of the nominating/corporate governance committee of the board. "Both bring important experience to their new directorships. Gerry is ideally suited to help guide the Company through its next phase of growth and international development given his more than 35 years of experience spanning a wide range of industries and assignments throughout Europe, Latin America and the United States. Christian has distinguished himself since joining Standex in 1999. His leadership and contributions led us to name him chief financial officer of Standex in 2001."  "At the same time, we wish to thank two of the Company's longest standing directors. Both John Bolten, Jr. and Kevin Landry have made enormous contributions during their respective tenures, for which we are most appreciative. Also, we want to acknowledge the important leadership role of Dave Crichton, who served as executive vice president of operations from 1989 until his retirement in 2002 and as a director for 12 years," Muller added.  Fickenscher most recently served as vice president - Europe, Middle East and Africa for Crompton Corporation, a New York Stock Exchange-listed specialty chemicals manufacturer based in Middlebury, Connecticut, following its acquisition of Uniroyal Chemical Corporation in 1994. From 1986 to 1994, he served as chief financial officer of Uniroyal Chemical during which time he participated in negotiating and structuring a management-led leveraged buyout of the company, and operating it as a standalone business until shortly before it was acquired by Crompton. Prior to joining Uniroyal in 1980, Fickenscher held positions with GTE International and with Hulytego SAIC, a plastics and rubber manufacturer in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He holds an MBA and a Ph.D. in Economics from Catholic University in Buenos Aires.  Storch joined Standex as manager of corporate audit in 1999. In addition to being named chief financial officer in November 2001, he also became treasurer in November 2003. Prior to joining Standex, he served as corporate controller and group finance director of Vossloh AG. Based in Werdohl, Germany, Vossloh AG is a publicly traded (Frankfurt stock exchange) global technology company operating in the railway and transportation and lighting industries. Storch also served as senior manager at Deloitte & Touche in Dusseldorf, Berlin and Boston. He holds a graduate business degree from the University of Passau (Germany) and is a Certified Tax Advisor in Germany, a Certified Public Accountant in the U.S., and a member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.  About Standex  Standex International Corporation is a multi-industry manufacturer in five broad business segments: Food Service Equipment, Consumer, Air Distribution Products, Engraving Group and Engineered Products with operations in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, Singapore, Mexico, Brazil and China.
