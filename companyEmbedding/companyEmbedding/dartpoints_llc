For Building Owners











HomeFor Building Owners
















For Building Owners
On-site, at No Cost to You
Put a professionally built-and-managed micro data center, fully compliant with the most rigorous industry and regulatory certifications, on-site, at no cost to you.
1. Make yourself more attractive to tenants and prospective tenants.
More than just a bullet point on your buildings list of features, an on-site and professionally built-and-managed micro data center will jump appeal tech-savvy businesses looking for leased space.
They will immediately realize that with a DartPoints micro data center on site, you can save them significant capital on IT infrastructure build-outs and decrease the ongoing operational costs and high costs of compliance.
DartPoints is like a technology parking garage for your tenant’s mission-critical IT equipment. That’s not just an incentive for your tenants, but a unique advantage: a cutting-edge, fully compliant, on-site data center that gives them greater power, financial savings, and the additional incentive to stay with you.
2. Save yourself money by eliminating the drain on your resources.
When your tenants move in, they may require certain customizations and tenant improvement dollars to accommodate their tech needs. Often needing special critical infrastructure, custom flooring, and access to building resources to power and cool their equipment. Don’t underestimate the many hidden costs here:

Build-outs delay move-ins. Accelerate their move-in and save IT dollars.
IT rooms tax your HVAC system. DartPoints’ environmentally green data centers are more efficient by offering a lower PUE than most data centers.
Uniquely architected space burdens you with useless rooms that are difficult to lease again without major renovations.

3. Take advantage of it yourself.
Your tenants are not the only ones who stand to benefit by having cutting-edge data centers located on-site. You can reap the exact same rewards of greater convenience, lower cost of ownership and optimized performance for your own building systems and IT equipment.
Learn more about our technical capabilities, about our expertise or contact us directly for immediate answers to your questions.






 Data Center Users

DartPoints Brings Edge Data Centers to New Markets with Schneider Electric.

 By admin May 4th, 2017      Blog    Add new comment


ANDOVER, Mass., April 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Schneider Electric, the global specialist in energy management and automation, today announced the expansion of its relationship with colocation provider DartPoints to support the company as it branches into five new U.S. markets. Since beginning the relationship in 2014, Schneider Electric custom solutions and technology implementations have helped DartPoints grow its business model and take advantage of new opportunities brought on by the growing demand for edge data center solutions.
Edge Drivers
The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data have increased demand for connectivity, speed and processing power, pushing the need for these capabilities closer to the customer and where data is generated, out at the network edge.
Founded on edge infrastructure, DartPoints’ colocation offering consists of customized micro edge data center solutions powered by Schneider Electric technology. With this approach, DartPoints ensures uptime and speed at a lower price and enables clients—from small and medium-sized businesses to Fortune 500 organizations—to deploy the capabilities they need today, with room to expand in the future. This alleviates common physical infrastructure concerns around underutilized square footage, cooling costs and power consumption, while managing IT needs.
“Our key business driver is going wherever the customer is located and bringing applications there to drive latency down and reduce cost,” said Hugh Carspecken, CEO, DartPoints. “Schneider Electric’s edge solutions enable us to easily build to a user’s needs without the compatibility issues that full customization requires, while streamlining design and construction for quick deployment, flexibility and scale. Furthermore, the resiliency and reliability of their products withstands the hardest of infrastructure challenges and makes it possible for us to maintain and even exceed our service standards and service level agreements.”
To provide clients with highly flexible and resilient infrastructure that is easy to replicate and scale based on customer demand in as little as 45 days, DartPoints leverages Schneider Electric micro edge data center products and solutions, including:
Symmetra™ PX 100 UPS: A scalable, fault-tolerant three-phase uninterruptible power supply (UPS) offering high efficiency, performance and availability.
InRow Cooling: Significantly improves cooling efficiency by reducing power consumption while also increasing capacity and offering the ability to support higher rack density.
EcoAisle Containment: Increases data center cooling efficiency while protecting critical IT equipment and data center personnel from thermal events.
StruxureWare™ Data Center Expert: Provides centralized management and reporting at every level of the infrastructure, including temperature, airflow, humidity and security.
From vision to reality
Initially commissioned with Schneider Electric as a Dallas-based proof of concept facility in 2014, the DartPoints model has moved from idea to reality, resulting in significant growth within just a few years.
“When DartPoints first came to us, they were looking to bring a model to market that was different from the traditional colocation business, offering the same economies of scale as the larger data centers but with a smaller footprint,” said Mike Hagan, Vice President, Sales – IT Division, Schneider Electric. “It was a challenge, but one we were confident could be achieved working together through our integrated product set and services.”
Throughout more than two years of testing, DartPoints has successfully delivered fully redundant 100kW systems—either on-premise within a building or on-site at a campus of buildings in its 24/7 colocation offering. Across deployed customers, DartPoints’ edge model has delivered a 30–40 percent reduction in total cost of ownership. A savings that is expected to be even greater as time goes on, with an estimated three-year total cost of ownership savings of 35–45 percent.
As demand for its colocation services continues to grow, DartPoints plans to expand into five new markets, including Phoenix, Las Vegas, St. Paul, Minnesota, Kansas City, Kansas, and the Greater New York area. It also expects to double in revenue and size in 2017.

Mobile Edge Computing Creates ‘Tiny Data Centers’ at the Edge

 By admin May 3rd, 2017      Blog    Add new comment


Comments on the article from DartPoints CEO Hugh Carspecken:
“The key that we are seeing here, now, is the vast amount of data that is
being “produced” at the edge. We have been comfortable with this, since
the smartphone. The key shift, here, is the vast amount of data that
will need to be “processed” at the edge. DartPoints is working with MEC
to create interconnected environments to allow their platforms to grow.”

The Future of the Edge is Edge Data

Comments on the article from DartPoints CEO Hugh Carspecken:
“DartPoints is seeing more and more users placing their data at the edge, for their particular, corporate needs. They are doing so for performance reasons or security reasons or both. What is interesting is that this growing presence of Edge Data is quickly evolving and being adopted into exactly the real-time apps that will birth technology of tomorrow, such as self-driving cars.”

70% of Respondents Said They Plan on Deploying CORD in the CO

Comments on the article from DartPoints CEO Hugh Carspecken:
“I find the premise that access (to the customer) lines that feed into Central Offices represent the next-hop to a micro cloud node very interesting. Though a potential logistical challenge for carriers, their customers need (downstream AND upstream) for better performance is clearly driving this thought process.”

Colocation Goes to the Edge

DartPoints Brings Schneider Electric Edge Data Center Solutions to Where You Are
Executive Summary
Leveraging Schneider Electric’s edge data center solutions, Dallas-Fort Worth based DartPoints offers customized edge infrastructure solutions with site-specific colocation capabilities for businesses.
When starting a company, especially one that’s disrupting a traditional business model, the market often responds with skepticism at first. This includes not only prospective customers but potential technology partners as well.
Hugh Carspecken, CEO of DartPoints, who has history as an entrepreneur, understood this when he launched a new type of colocation company in 2012. That’s why he first created a strong proof-of-concept and then focused on finding a provider that was willing to partner through the ups and downs of building out the offerings. It’s why he chose Schneider Electric.

Posted by Prayson Pate on March 17, 2016
We just announced the use of Ensemble Orchestrator and Connector in DartPoints’ micro data center deployments. This deployment is generating a lot of interest because it’s a bold use of network functions virtualization (NFV) for service delivery. While everyone’s talking about NFV and service innovation, DartPoints is deploying it. The DartPoints use case is really interesting, so let me tell you a little bit about it.
DartPoints is deploying micro data centers that are co-located with their customers. DartPoints’ customers are typically small- to medium-sized businesses that are looking for cost-effective ways to create data centers that can be customized for their particular business needs. By co-locating with DartPoints, a business gets exactly what it needs at a fraction of the cost of developing a data center on its own. Why is co-location so valuable for customers? Why is NFV important for this application – and why is the micro data center application important for NFV? To answer those questions, let’s take a look at how things were done before.

DartPoints* is a data center innovator, having pioneered micro data centers aimed at small and medium businesses that need a highly convenient data center that offers tier-1 services. After a successful company launch, DartPoints turned to Intel® Network Builders partner ADVA Optical Networking* for a turnkey network functions virtualization (NFV) solution to help scale its business nationwide and expand the service offerings. 
Challenge
To offer its customers the best performance at the most competitive prices, DartPoints has created the industry’s first “NFV-enabled micro data center,” an innovative concept that places data center and colocation (colo) facilities in the same building where its customers are located. Colocating private cloud services improves scale and management of individual cloud instances, while enabling low latency, high-bandwidth, and secure connectivity without crossconnects— all of which are key differentiators of DartPoints’ micro data centers. But the micro data center offers the same computing, data recovery, and other services as millionsquare- foot, tier-1 competitors with equivalent service levels and reliability, including complete compliance and security and carrier-neutral access to Internet or WAN services.

ADVA and DartPoints Define a Realistic Model for Distributed NFV Data Centers

 By admin March 12th, 2016      Blog    Add new comment














When ADVA bought Overture Networks, one of the six companies who I believe has a full-spectrum NFV solution that can make a business case, I was critical of the fact that they seemed to be positioning Overture as a limited extension to the carrier Ethernet business.  Now they’ve made their positioning clearer with an announcement that DartPoints, a supplier of on-premises micro-datacenters, has selected the ADVA Ensemble NFV products as a key element in their service plans.  This goes a long way toward establishing ADVA’s commitment to NFV, and it makes an important point about NFV too.
One of the most difficult challenges that NFV, in its vCPE guise, faces is getting out of the CPE edge device and into the cloud.  The business case for deploying agile CPE is only slightly related to that of NFV, and the technology for NFV is overkill if all your VNFs are going to do is squat in the customer edge device and wait to be changed around.  NFV technology is valuable when VNFs have to be more spread around.

The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

For Data Center Users
A solution that addresses all pain points
DartPoint’s on-site, distributed micro data center structure puts the power back in your hands, without the costs; and we can start today.
DartPoints has created a solution that addresses all pain points – cost, convenience and control – with a network of localized, distributed micro data centers. This nimble network sheds unnecessary fees while employing cutting-edge technology and maintaining the most rigorous industry and regulatory certifications.
Continue reading below for more details, or contact us directly for immediate answers to your questions.
Convenience   |   Customization   |   Continuity   |   Cost Optimization   |   Compliance
Convenience.
Having cultivated relationships with building owners nationwide, DartPoints data centers are built and operated at or near your current location (and that includes locations not traditionally served by data centers), instead of forcing you to deploy your IT equipment elsewhere. No more driving across the city or, worse, across state lines. And 24/7 access to your IT equipment is only the beginning of the many benefits of staying local: you can optimize your network and eliminate distance-related lag and performance issues.If you have a particular city or region where you’d like a data center, just tell us. We’ll find the location.[Return to top]
Customization.
Small size does not mean small power. Because DartPoints can customize the power and connectivity to your cabinet, you can deploy the system you need without worrying about future growth. With the ability to support cabinets with over 25kW+ of redundant power, DartPoints data centers excel at providing scalable environments for High-Powered Computing architectures. Whether you have special power, cooling or Internet access carrier needs, DartPoints can bring it all together within 90 days at a highly competitive price.[Return to top]
Continuity.
According to the Boston Consulting Group, over 60% of companies that lose their data will shut down within 6 months of the disaster. You must have confidence that your data center won’t go down and take your critical business operations with it. Our micro data centers offer a stable, secure environment for your infrastructure and our interconnected network of data centers provide a ready-made foundation for disaster recovery planning.

Performance continuity: DartPoints’ proactive network monitoring services and redundant Onshore NOCs (network operations center) provide timely alerts and online access to view the health of critical infrastructure and network, giving you insight and control.
Site continuity: DartPoints can meet Tier III data center specifications with comprehensive redundancies – redundant power, connectivity, cooling, and IT equipment – and offers a 100% SLA commitment.
Business continuity: DartPoints’ distributed data center network is inherently connected and constantly growing. We have constructed a powerful system that easily allows customers to have off-site disaster recovery sites in multiple locations.

[Return to top]

Cost Optimization.
We shoulder the capital expenditures, lighten the operational dollars and absorb the upkeep and maintenance. Our customers enjoy significant operational and capital benefits over other alternatives.

No critical infrastructure costs
No data center build-out costs
No cross-connect charges
No wasted or lost square footage

[Return to top]

Compliances.
The DartPoints level of convenience does not come at the cost of government or industry compliances. Every DartPoints SSAE-16 SOC1 & SOC2 certified data center is built to meet or exceed the most demanding industry and government standards, satisfying your needs for data center compliance requirements like HIPAA (healthcare) and PCI (financial industry).[Return to top]
How and why you use DartPoints is completely within your control and can change over time. Learn more about our technical capabilities and specifications , our company or contact us for immediate answers.

The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.
