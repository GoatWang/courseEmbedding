I-PASS™ Patient Safety Institute, Inc. Announces Preferred Share 
      Offering




Funding to allow for execution of long-term growth strategy






December 05, 2016 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--I-PASS™ Patient Safety Institute, Inc. (“I-PASS Institute”), a provider 
      of expert training services and software solutions to reduce medical 
      errors and improve patient safety in hospitals, today announced that it 
      has entered into an agreement with a group of private investors which 
      has raised gross proceeds of $1.5 million through the issuance of 
      preferred shares. Additional terms of the offering are not disclosed.
    


      “We are pleased our investors recognize the value of I-PASS Institute as 
      we continue our mission to provide world class training and education to 
      medical professionals to improve patient safety and reduce medical 
      errors and associated overall medical costs,” said I-PASS Institute 
      President and CEO William Floyd.
    

      I-PASS Institute will utilize the new round of funding to execute its 
      long-term growth strategy, to deliver innovative services and 
      software-enabled solutions to improve patient safety as the company 
      expands its market share and continues to develop its technologies.
    

      “Hospitals are always looking for ways to improve patient care, minimize 
      medical errors and reduce costs,” stated Christopher Landrigan, M.D., 
      M.P.H., the Principal Investigator of the original I-PASS Study, and a 
      member of the I-PASS Patient Safety Institute. “With the I-PASS 
      Institute, hospitals can implement the proven I-PASS program in a 
      fraction of the time they would spend doing it themselves, with far 
      fewer resources.”
    

About I-PASS


      I-PASS is a package of interventions created to improve communications 
      during patient handoffs. Handoffs occur at all changes of shift and 
      whenever a patient changes location in a hospital. I-PASS is the most 
      validated and effective method for handoffs in the hospital. In a large 
      multicenter study published in 2014 in the New 
      England Journal of Medicine, injuries due to medical 
      errors fell 30 percent following implementation of I-PASS. No 
      other handoff approach has such strong evidence of effectiveness. Over 
      the past seven years, the program has been extensively refined, tested 
      and adapted for use across specialties and disciplines, where it has 
      been well-integrated into workflow patterns.
    

      I-PASS is now being successfully used by more than 50 leading hospitals 
      in the US. Implementing I-PASS requires training and changes in oral and 
      written communication processes that are followed day in and day out in 
      a sustained manner. Implementing I-PASS is a significant task, requiring 
      staff training, changes to written and spoken communication processes, 
      ongoing measurement and longitudinal sustainment efforts. Its successful 
      implementation, however, has been shown to sharply reduce medical 
      errors, a top priority for hospitals that has the potential to save 
      lives and millions of dollars.
    

About I-PASS Patient Safety Institute, Inc.


      The I-PASS Patient Safety Institute, Inc. (I-PASS Institute) provides 
      hospitals with customized training, expert consultation and 
      implementation tools to facilitate adoption of I-PASS and ensure 
      long-term sustainment.
    

      The I-PASS Institute was founded in April 2016, following seven years of 
      research into improving handoffs that was funded by $7 million in 
      federal and foundation grant support. The research was conducted by a 
      study group of researchers, hospitalists and medical education 
      specialists who developed the I-PASS handoff process and studied its 
      impact. In 2014, I-PASS was selected as one of four finalists, out of 
      nearly 500 entrants, in the Harvard Business School – Harvard Medical 
      School Health Acceleration Challenge. The selection into that program 
      led to the creation of the I-PASS Institute, to achieve widespread 
      adoption and sustainment of I-PASS. For more information, visit www.ipassinstitute.com.

News and Events Insights Multicenter patient-safety study reduces injuries from hospital medical errors by 30% with improved handoff communicationsI-PASS bundle improves safety, quality of care at nine medical centers BOSTON (Nov. 6, 2014) – Improvements in verbal and written communication between health care providers during patient handoffs can reduce injuries due to medical errors by 30 percent, according to a multicenter study led by researchers from Boston Children's Hospital. Reported Nov. 6 in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), study results show that I-PASS—an original system of bundled communication and training tools for handoff of patient care between providers—can greatly increase patient safety without significantly burdening existing clinical workflows.
Medical errors in hospitals such as diagnostic delays, preventable surgical complications and medication overdoses are a leading cause of death and injury in the U.S. An estimated 80 percent of the most serious medical errors can be linked to communication between clinicians, particularly during patient handoffs. For example, a handoff-related medical error could occur if information about a critical diagnostic test is not communicated correctly between providers at shift change; the result could be a potentially harmful delay in patient care.
"Miscommunications and handoff errors are two of the most significant causes of medical errors in hospitals in the U.S.," said the study’s principal investigator and senior author, Christopher Landrigan, MD, MPH, of Boston Children's Division of General Pediatrics. "This is the first multicenter handoff improvement program that has been found to reduce injuries due to medical errors.”
 A multicenter team led by Landrigan and the study's lead author, Amy Starmer, MD, MPH, designed I-PASS with the goal of improving patient safety and reducing or eliminating the most common source of medical errors through improved provider-to-provider communication. I-PASS consists of:

standardized communication and handoff training
a verbal handoff process organized around the verbal mnemonic "I-PASS" (Illness severity, Patient summary, Action list, Situational awareness and contingency planning, and Synthesis by receiver)
computerized handoff tools to share patient information between providers using an I-PASS structure
engagement of supervising attending physicians to observe and oversee handoff communications
a campaign promoting the adoption of I-PASS as part of institutional process and culture

"We recognized that it would take a great deal of work to make the handoff program a sustainable system and encourage its adoption across hospitals," Starmer said. "We partnered with experts in research, curriculum development and administration, as well as local faculty and executives at the nine centers, to develop a comprehensive and multi-faceted handoff and communication program. Now the new I-PASS program works seamlessly with existing tools and is part of each institution's culture."
In the NEJM paper, Landrigan, Starmer and their colleagues report on the results of implementing I-PASS through the pediatric residency programs of nine hospitals:

Benioff Children’s Hospital, University of California San Francisco
Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati
Doernbecher Children’s Hospital, Oregon Health Sciences University
The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto
Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital, Stanford University
Primary Children’s Hospital, University of Utah
St. Louis Children’s Hospital, Washington University St. Louis
St. Christopher’s Hospital for Children, Drexel University
Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences

Boston Children's Hospital served as the lead site for the study, while Brigham and Women's Hospital served as the data-coordinating center.
At each participating hospital, patient handoffs by residents were monitored and assessed for a six-month pre-intervention period. During the six-month intervention phase, residents were trained on I-PASS handoff processes and required to use the system going forward. An additional six months of monitoring and assessment followed the intervention.
Across the participating centers, the overall rate of medical errors decreased by 23 percent—from 24.5 to 18.8 errors per 100 admissions—after the introduction of I-PASS. Preventable adverse events (injuries due to medical errors) decreased by 30 percent—from 4.7 to 3.3 errors per 100 admissions. The research team's data covered a total of 10,740 patient admissions.
Time-motion analyses of providers' activities showed that implementing I-PASS did not add time to patient handoffs or decrease time spent at patient bedsides or on other tasks. The researchers noted significant improvements in residents' verbal and written communications at every center and a significant increase in residents' satisfaction with the quality of their patient handoffs after I-PASS implementation, according to a post-study survey.
"We took basic principles of patient safety and as a team found ways to integrate them into the normal workflow of hospital residents,” Landrigan said. "We hope I-PASS will remain an embedded system within these institutions going forward."
“Because we know that miscommunications so commonly lead to serious medical errors, and because the frequency of handoffs in the hospital is increasing, there is no question that high-quality handoff improvement programs need to be a top priority for hospitals,” says Starmer. “It’s tremendously exciting to finally have a comprehensive and rigorously tested training program that has been proven to be associated with safer care and that meets this need for our patients."
Landrigan and Starmer note that while the I-PASS bundle has been focused thus far on inpatient pediatric care, the principles are applicable to care in any hospital inpatient setting. And while not documented in the study, they believe that the safety improvements supported by I-PASS adoption could lead to substantial reductions in medical error-related health care costs.
The I-PASS curriculum is available to the public online at no cost: ipasshandoffstudy.com. For consultation and ongoing support with program implementation for institutions, email ipass.study@childrens.harvard.edu.
The study was supported primarily by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (grant number R18AE000029), as well as the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (grant number K12HS019456), the Medical Research Foundation of Oregon, Physician Services Incorporated Foundation and Pfizer (unrestricted medical education grant), as well as input from the Initiative for Innovation in Pediatric Education and the Pediatric Research in Inpatient Settings Network.

Better handoffs.
Safer care.

The mission of the I-PASS Study Group is to improve patient safety by standardizing provider communication, with a specific focus on improving transitions of care. Members of the I-PASS Study Group include health services researchers, medical education experts, patients and families, nurses, and clinicians.  The I-PASS Study Group oversees research projects regarding communication and patient safety.  
To achieve widespread adoption and sustainment of the evidence-based I-PASS Handoff program, members of the I-PASS Study Group co-founded the I-PASS Institute, a company dedicated to providing hospitals with assistance implementing I-PASS.   For help implementing the I-PASS handoff program in your institution, please visit the I-PASS Institute website at www.ipassinstitute.com or email info@ipassinstitute.com. 
 The work of the I-PASS Study Group focuses on the following:


The I-PASS Study was a landmark multi-site research communication and patient safety study involving nine institutions in the US and Canada. In that study, we found that implementation of a bundle of interventions to improve resident physician communication during handoffs of patient care (called the I-PASS Handoff Bundle) was associated with a 30% reduction in preventable adverse events—medical errors that result in harm to patients. Implementation was also associated with improvements in verbal and written communication without a negative impact on provider workflow or handoff duration. The curricular materials developed for use in the I-PASS Study are all available free of charge by visiting the materials request section of this website.

The I-PASS Handoff Bundle is the award-winning intervention tested in the I-PASS Study.  It includes resources and information about and is actively being adapted for use in multiple different hospital settings and types of patient care handoff and transitions.

The I-PASS Consultation Program offers mentored implementation of I-PASS Handoff curricular materials on a consultative basis. The primary goal of the consultation program is to assist departments, hospitals and health systems in implementing the I-PASS Handoff method to improve patient safety using a train-the-trainer approach.  Consultation arrangements range from 1 day consultations to ongoing support of 18 months or longer.

The I-PASS Mentored Implementation Program is a collaboration with the Society for Hospital Medicine funded by AHRQ.The goal of the program is to facilitate implementation of the I-PASS Handoff Bundle in internal medicine and pediatric residency programs at a select group of 32 hospitals across the United States. Each site will be paired with a team of mentors from the I-PASS Study Group to help guide them in implementing I-PASS Handoff techniques.

The Patient and Family Centered I-PASS Study is a multi-site research study funded by  PCORI with the goal of improving patient safety by enhancing the quality of communication between physicians, nurses, and families and to better integrate families into all aspects of daily decision making in hospitals. In the study we will test the effectiveness of a bundle of communication interventions based on the original I-PASS Study – Family-Centered I-PASS. Our hypothesis is that more effective communication between health care team members and families will significantly improve both patient safety and the patient and family experience.

Announces Preferred Share OfferingBusiness WireDecember 5, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareBOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--I-PASS™ Patient Safety Institute, Inc. (“I-PASS Institute”), a provider of expert training services and software solutions to reduce medical errors and improve patient safety in hospitals, today announced that it has entered into an agreement with a group of private investors which has raised gross proceeds of $1.5 million through the issuance of preferred shares. Additional terms of the offering are not disclosed.“We are pleased our investors recognize the value of I-PASS Institute as we continue our mission to provide world class training and education to medical professionals to improve patient safety and reduce medical errors and associated overall medical costs,” said I-PASS Institute President and CEO William Floyd.I-PASS Institute will utilize the new round of funding to execute its long-term growth strategy, to deliver innovative services and software-enabled solutions to improve patient safety as the company expands its market share and continues to develop its technologies.“Hospitals are always looking for ways to improve patient care, minimize medical errors and reduce costs,” stated Christopher Landrigan, M.D., M.P.H., the Principal Investigator of the original I-PASS Study, and a member of the I-PASS Patient Safety Institute. “With the I-PASS Institute, hospitals can implement the proven I-PASS program in a fraction of the time they would spend doing it themselves, with far fewer resources.”About I-PASSI-PASS is a package of interventions created to improve communications during patient handoffs. Handoffs occur at all changes of shift and whenever a patient changes location in a hospital. I-PASS is the most validated and effective method for handoffs in the hospital. In a large multicenter study published in 2014 in the New England Journal of Medicine, injuries due to medical errors fell 30 percent following implementation of I-PASS. No other handoff approach has such strong evidence of effectiveness. Over the past seven years, the program has been extensively refined, tested and adapted for use across specialties and disciplines, where it has been well-integrated into workflow patterns.I-PASS is now being successfully used by more than 50 leading hospitals in the US. Implementing I-PASS requires training and changes in oral and written communication processes that are followed day in and day out in a sustained manner. Implementing I-PASS is a significant task, requiring staff training, changes to written and spoken communication processes, ongoing measurement and longitudinal sustainment efforts. Its successful implementation, however, has been shown to sharply reduce medical errors, a top priority for hospitals that has the potential to save lives and millions of dollars.About I-PASS Patient Safety Institute, Inc.The I-PASS Patient Safety Institute, Inc. (I-PASS Institute) provides hospitals with customized training, expert consultation and implementation tools to facilitate adoption of I-PASS and ensure long-term sustainment.The I-PASS Institute was founded in April 2016, following seven years of research into improving handoffs that was funded by $7 million in federal and foundation grant support. The research was conducted by a study group of researchers, hospitalists and medical education specialists who developed the I-PASS handoff process and studied its impact. In 2014, I-PASS was selected as one of four finalists, out of nearly 500 entrants, in the Harvard Business School – Harvard Medical School Health Acceleration Challenge. The selection into that program led to the creation of the I-PASS Institute, to achieve widespread adoption and sustainment of I-PASS.
