Current Annualized Distribution Rate is the Fund’s most recent distribution, expressed as an annual percentage of the Fund’s current market price per share. The Fund’s most recent distribution
    was $0.0950 per share. A breakdown of the Fund’s most recent distribution can be found on the 
        Convertible Opportunities and Income Fund Fact Sheet
    . Estimates are calculated on a tax basis rather than on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, but should not be used for tax
    reporting purposes. Distributions are subject to re-characterization for tax purposes after the end of the fiscal year. This information is not legal or tax advice. Consult a professional regarding your
    specific legal or tax matters. Under the Fund’s level rate distribution policy, distributions paid to common shareholders may include net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains and
    return of capital. When the net investment income and net realized short-term capital gains are not sufficient, a portion of the level rate distribution will be a return of capital. In addition, a
    limited number of distributions per calendar year may include net realized long-term capital gains. Distribution rate may vary.
    
Past Performance 
    
        Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. You can purchase or sell common
        shares daily. Like any other stock, market price will fluctuate with the market. Upon sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value.
    

Important Fund Information 
    
        The Fund may invest up to 100% of its assets in foreign securities and invest in an array of security types and market-cap sizes, each of which has a unique risk profile. As a result of political or
        economic instability in foreign countries, there can be special risks associated with investing in foreign securities. These include fluctuations in currency exchange rates, increased price volatility,
        and difficulty obtaining information.
        
        There are certain risks associated with an investment in a convertible bond such as default risk—that the company issuing a convertible security may be unable to repay principal and interest, and
        interest rate risk—that the convertible may decrease in value if interest rates increase.
        
        Investments by the Fund in lower-rated securities involve substantial risk of loss and present greater risks than investments in higher-rated securities, including less liquidity and increased price
        sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment.
        
        Fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk; as interest rates go up, the value of debt securities in the Fund’s portfolio generally will decline.
        
        The Fund may invest in derivative securities, including options. The use of derivatives present risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in
        traditional securities. There is no assurance that any derivative strategy used by the Fund will succeed. One of the risks associated with purchasing an option is that the Fund pays a premium whether
        or not the option is exercised.
        
        The Fund may seek to purchase index put options to help reduce downside exposure. However, the effectiveness of the Fund’s index option-based risk management strategy may be reduced if the Fund’s
        equity portfolio does not correlate to the performance of the underlying option positions. The Fund also risks losing all or part of the cash paid for purchasing index options. Unusual market conditions
        or a lack of a ready market of any particular option at a specific time may reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s options strategies, and for these and other reasons the Fund’s options strategies may
        not reduce the Fund’s volatility to the extent desired. From time to time, the Fund may reduce its holdings of put options, resulting in an increased exposure to a market decline.
        
        The goal of the level-rate distribution policy is to provide investors a predictable, though not assured, level of cash flow. Monthly distributions paid may include net investment income, net realized
        short-term capital gains, and, if necessary, return of capital. Maintenance of this policy may increase transaction and tax costs associated with the Fund.
        
        Leverage creates risks which may adversely affect return, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares; and fluctuations in the variable rates
        of the leverage financing. The ratio is the percent of borrowing to total assets.
        
        Each fund has specific risks, which are outlined in the respective funds’ prospectuses. The general risks involved in investing in a closed end fund include market volatility risk, dividend and
        income risk, and loss of investment risk. Please refer to each fund’s prospectus, annual and semi-annual reports at www.calamos.com for complete information on the fund’s performance, investments and
        risks.

Estimates are calculated on a tax basis rather than on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, but should not be used for tax reporting purposes. Distributions may be subject to re-characterization for tax purposes after the end of the fiscal year. Individual (non-corporate) shareholders with taxable accounts will receive written notification regarding the components and tax treatment for distributions via Form 1099-DIV. If your distributions are reinvested in additional shares, you will receive a statement reflecting the reinvestment of the distribution. This information is not legal or tax advice. Consult a professional regarding your specific legal or tax matters.







USING A LEVEL DISTRIBUTION POLICY TO PROMOTE TOTAL RETURN
We understand the importance that investors place on the stability of dividends, along with long-term total return. In June 2005, CHI announced the adoption of a level rate distribution policy. 
The goal is to provide investors with long-term total return, based on our belief that closed-end fund investors consider consistent, dependable distributions to be an important component of total-return.
As a reminder, shareholders can accumulate more shares via the dividend reinvestment plan whether the Fund trades at a premium or discount. If the Fund is trading at a premium, the dividend is reinvested at NAV or at 95% of the market price, whichever is greater. If the Fund is trading at a discount, the dividend is reinvested at the market price.


Current Annualized Distribution Rate is the Fund’s most recent distribution, expressed as an annual percentage of the Fund’s current market price per share. The Fund’s most recent distribution
    was $0.0950 per share. A breakdown of the Fund’s most recent distribution can be found on the 
        Convertible Opportunities and Income Fund Fact Sheet
    . Estimates are calculated on a tax basis rather than on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, but should not be used for tax
    reporting purposes. Distributions are subject to re-characterization for tax purposes after the end of the fiscal year. This information is not legal or tax advice. Consult a professional regarding your
    specific legal or tax matters. Under the Fund’s level rate distribution policy, distributions paid to common shareholders may include net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains and
    return of capital. When the net investment income and net realized short-term capital gains are not sufficient, a portion of the level rate distribution will be a return of capital. In addition, a
    limited number of distributions per calendar year may include net realized long-term capital gains. Distribution rate may vary.
    
Past Performance 
    
        Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. You can purchase or sell common
        shares daily. Like any other stock, market price will fluctuate with the market. Upon sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value.
    

Important Fund Information 
    
        The Fund may invest up to 100% of its assets in foreign securities and invest in an array of security types and market-cap sizes, each of which has a unique risk profile. As a result of political or
        economic instability in foreign countries, there can be special risks associated with investing in foreign securities. These include fluctuations in currency exchange rates, increased price volatility,
        and difficulty obtaining information.
        
        There are certain risks associated with an investment in a convertible bond such as default risk—that the company issuing a convertible security may be unable to repay principal and interest, and
        interest rate risk—that the convertible may decrease in value if interest rates increase.
        
        Investments by the Fund in lower-rated securities involve substantial risk of loss and present greater risks than investments in higher-rated securities, including less liquidity and increased price
        sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment.
        
        Fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk; as interest rates go up, the value of debt securities in the Fund’s portfolio generally will decline.
        
        The Fund may invest in derivative securities, including options. The use of derivatives present risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in
        traditional securities. There is no assurance that any derivative strategy used by the Fund will succeed. One of the risks associated with purchasing an option is that the Fund pays a premium whether
        or not the option is exercised.
        
        The Fund may seek to purchase index put options to help reduce downside exposure. However, the effectiveness of the Fund’s index option-based risk management strategy may be reduced if the Fund’s
        equity portfolio does not correlate to the performance of the underlying option positions. The Fund also risks losing all or part of the cash paid for purchasing index options. Unusual market conditions
        or a lack of a ready market of any particular option at a specific time may reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s options strategies, and for these and other reasons the Fund’s options strategies may
        not reduce the Fund’s volatility to the extent desired. From time to time, the Fund may reduce its holdings of put options, resulting in an increased exposure to a market decline.
        
        The goal of the level-rate distribution policy is to provide investors a predictable, though not assured, level of cash flow. Monthly distributions paid may include net investment income, net realized
        short-term capital gains, and, if necessary, return of capital. Maintenance of this policy may increase transaction and tax costs associated with the Fund.
        
        Leverage creates risks which may adversely affect return, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares; and fluctuations in the variable rates
        of the leverage financing. The ratio is the percent of borrowing to total assets.
        
        Each fund has specific risks, which are outlined in the respective funds’ prospectuses. The general risks involved in investing in a closed end fund include market volatility risk, dividend and
        income risk, and loss of investment risk. Please refer to each fund’s prospectus, annual and semi-annual reports at www.calamos.com for complete information on the fund’s performance, investments and
        risks.

Leverage creates risks which may adversely affect return, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares; and fluctuations in dividend rates on any preferred shares.

The use of swap transactions involves investments techniques and risks that are different from those associated with portfolio security transactions. If Calamos is incorrect in its forecasts of market values, interest rates, and other applicable factors, the investment performance of the Fund will be less favorable than if those techniques had not been used. Those instruments are typically not traded on exchanges. Accordingly, there is risk that the other party to certain of these instruments will not perform its obligations to the Fund or that the Fund may be unable to enter into offsetting positions to terminate its exposure or liquidate its position under certain of these instruments when it wishes to do so. Such occurrences could result in losses to the Fund.

Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value.

Sectors, Securities, and Countries mentioned are presented to illustrate sectors in which the fund may invest. Portfolio holdings are subject to change daily.






Current Annualized Distribution Rate is the Fund’s most recent distribution, expressed as an annual percentage of the Fund’s current market price per share. The Fund’s most recent distribution
    was $0.0950 per share. A breakdown of the Fund’s most recent distribution can be found on the 
        Convertible Opportunities and Income Fund Fact Sheet
    . Estimates are calculated on a tax basis rather than on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, but should not be used for tax
    reporting purposes. Distributions are subject to re-characterization for tax purposes after the end of the fiscal year. This information is not legal or tax advice. Consult a professional regarding your
    specific legal or tax matters. Under the Fund’s level rate distribution policy, distributions paid to common shareholders may include net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains and
    return of capital. When the net investment income and net realized short-term capital gains are not sufficient, a portion of the level rate distribution will be a return of capital. In addition, a
    limited number of distributions per calendar year may include net realized long-term capital gains. Distribution rate may vary.
    
Past Performance 
    
        Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. You can purchase or sell common
        shares daily. Like any other stock, market price will fluctuate with the market. Upon sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value.
    

Important Fund Information 
    
        The Fund may invest up to 100% of its assets in foreign securities and invest in an array of security types and market-cap sizes, each of which has a unique risk profile. As a result of political or
        economic instability in foreign countries, there can be special risks associated with investing in foreign securities. These include fluctuations in currency exchange rates, increased price volatility,
        and difficulty obtaining information.
        
        There are certain risks associated with an investment in a convertible bond such as default risk—that the company issuing a convertible security may be unable to repay principal and interest, and
        interest rate risk—that the convertible may decrease in value if interest rates increase.
        
        Investments by the Fund in lower-rated securities involve substantial risk of loss and present greater risks than investments in higher-rated securities, including less liquidity and increased price
        sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment.
        
        Fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk; as interest rates go up, the value of debt securities in the Fund’s portfolio generally will decline.
        
        The Fund may invest in derivative securities, including options. The use of derivatives present risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in
        traditional securities. There is no assurance that any derivative strategy used by the Fund will succeed. One of the risks associated with purchasing an option is that the Fund pays a premium whether
        or not the option is exercised.
        
        The Fund may seek to purchase index put options to help reduce downside exposure. However, the effectiveness of the Fund’s index option-based risk management strategy may be reduced if the Fund’s
        equity portfolio does not correlate to the performance of the underlying option positions. The Fund also risks losing all or part of the cash paid for purchasing index options. Unusual market conditions
        or a lack of a ready market of any particular option at a specific time may reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s options strategies, and for these and other reasons the Fund’s options strategies may
        not reduce the Fund’s volatility to the extent desired. From time to time, the Fund may reduce its holdings of put options, resulting in an increased exposure to a market decline.
        
        The goal of the level-rate distribution policy is to provide investors a predictable, though not assured, level of cash flow. Monthly distributions paid may include net investment income, net realized
        short-term capital gains, and, if necessary, return of capital. Maintenance of this policy may increase transaction and tax costs associated with the Fund.
        
        Leverage creates risks which may adversely affect return, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares; and fluctuations in the variable rates
        of the leverage financing. The ratio is the percent of borrowing to total assets.
        
        Each fund has specific risks, which are outlined in the respective funds’ prospectuses. The general risks involved in investing in a closed end fund include market volatility risk, dividend and
        income risk, and loss of investment risk. Please refer to each fund’s prospectus, annual and semi-annual reports at www.calamos.com for complete information on the fund’s performance, investments and
        risks.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.

            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years

Nuveen Covered Call Closed-End Funds 
For income-oriented investors who are seeking the growth and diversification potential of equities, but who desire higher income and reduced volatility, covered call closed-end funds (also known as equity option closed-end funds) can be an attractive diversifying portfolio opportunity.



Covered Call Strategies for Today's Income Investors 
Nuveen's covered call closed-end funds have been designed to meet the income, risk, and diversification needs of income-oriented investors. Combining a traditional equity portfolio strategy of persistently selling covered calls, then monetizing the long-term expected total returns into quarterly cash distributions, results in the strong potential for a diversifying, higher-yielding and more stable investment.

What are covered call strategies?
							Covered call strategy funds invest in a portfolio of stocks, and sell call options on either individual stocks or stock indices, for the purpose of enhancing total return, reducing volatility, and providing a measure of downside protection over time.  The fund receives a premium from the buyer of the call option, and must sell or deliver the underlying stock (or cash, in the case of a stock index call option) if the call option is exercised by the buyer.  The value of the stocks that are linked to call options sold, relative to the value of full stock portfolio, is termed the Option Overwrite percentage.

Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.
