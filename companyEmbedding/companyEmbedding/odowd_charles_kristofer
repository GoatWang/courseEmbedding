2011 NFL Draft Prospect Scouting Report:

person

Kristofer O'Dowd, C, USC


		Center is one of the most difficult positions to project in any draft and the 2011 edition is no different. Few centers are drafted in the early rounds of the draft. One has to show a special quality others lack; that quality factor surrounds USC's big Kristofer O'Dowd. Especially because in college football rarely does a true freshman becomes a starter at C in one of the most dominant units in the nation). But O'Dowd did just that, starting three (he saw significant time in four more) games in 2007. Named a full time starter before spring practice 2008, the Tucson, Arizona product started all 14 games for the Trojans. His play earned him All PAC-10 team honors.     
O'Dowd is smart and competitive and consistently maximized his talent. He has shown the flexibility to pass block with good leverage against straight-line rushers and can use his hands to lock up defenders. His great awareness and instinct for the position will impress any scout.     
He spent his senior year improving his strength, but can still struggle to hold off against explosive, power rushers. O'Dowd is limited some athletically and can have trouble moving in traffic. O'Dowd had good intangibles and the athletic talent to warrant some consideration in the early part of Day 2. If he is able to show more strength, he could move up.
