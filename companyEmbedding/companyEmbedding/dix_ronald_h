DIX, RONALD H.
Ronald H. Dix, age 74, of Combined Locks, passed away peacefully on Friday, February 25, 2011 with his family by his side at Manor Care in Appleton. He said the Angels were there for him! Ron was born on February 27, 1936 in Kaukauna, the son of the late Herman and Virginia Hamer Dix. On September 1, 1956, he married Shirley Kappell at St. Mary Catholic Church in Appleton. Ron was employed at U.S. Oil Company for 40 years. He graduated from Kimberly High School in 1955 and enjoyed playing football, basketball and umpiring many baseball games. He loved being sarcastic and making people laugh! Ron spent a lot of time with his family, taking them fishing and camping, and going to the park, zoo or cottage. These good times will never be forgotten! 
Ron is survived by his wife: Shirley Dix; children: Dave Pam Dix; Jean Santos Anaya: Tom Tina Dix; Jim Gail Dix; Joe Julie Remmel Dix and Mark Brenda Dix; fifteen grandchildren: Tiffany Shane, Juanita Andy, Mario Lindsey, Tommy Lindsey, Trenton, Jon, Rob, Mike, Olivia, Ali, Ashley, Missy Kurry, Chad, Breanna and Tony and six great grandchildren. He is further survived by a brother: Dan Dix; four sisters-in-law: Bonnie Leroy Gorges; Gerry Al Demers; Janice Emmett Clark and Margie Kappell; also many nieces, nephews, other relatives and friends.
Ron was preceded in death by his sister, Janet Dick Cotnoir; sister-in-law, Marlene Porkie Brooks; brother-in-law, Jack Kappell; and father and mother-in-law: Raymond and Genevieve Kappell.
The funeral service for Ronald will be held at 7:00 pm on Tuesday, March 1, 2011 at JANSEN FARGO FUNERAL HOME. A time of visitation and support will be held on Tuesday from 3:00 pm until the time of service. In lieu of flowers, a memorial fund will be established in his name.
The family would like to thank the staff at Manor Care and Heartland Hospice for all your kindness and support.

Obituary



            DIX, RONALD H.

Ronald H. Dix, age 74, of Combined Locks, passed away peacefully on Friday, February 25, 2011 with his family by his side at Manor Care in Appleton.  He said the Angels were there for him!  Ron was born on February 27, 1936 in Kaukauna, the son of the late Herman and Virginia (Hamer) Dix.  On September 1, 1956, he married Shirley Kappell at St. Mary Catholic Church in Appleton.  Ron was employed at U.S. Oil Company for 40 years.  He graduated from Kimberly High School in 1955 and enjoyed playing football, basketball and umpiring many baseball games.  He loved being sarcastic and making people laugh!  Ron spent a lot of time with his family, taking them fishing and camping, and going to the park, zoo or cottage.  These good times will never be forgotten!  

Ron is survived by his wife:  Shirley Dix; children: Dave (Pam) Dix; Jean (Santos) Anaya: Tom (Tina) Dix; Jim (Gail) Dix; Joe (Julie Remmel) Dix and Mark (Brenda) Dix; fifteen grandchildren:  Tiffany (Shane), Juanita (Andy), Mario (Lindsey), Tommy (Lindsey), Trenton, Jon, Rob, Mike, Olivia, Ali, Ashley, Missy (Kurry), Chad, Breanna and Tony and six great grandchildren.  He is further survived by a brother: Dan Dix; four sisters-in-law:  Bonnie (Leroy) Gorges; Gerry (Al) Demers; Janice (Emmett) Clark and Margie Kappell; also many nieces, nephews, other relatives and friends.

Ron was preceded in death by his sister, Janet (Dick) Cotnoir; sister-in-law, Marlene (Porkie) Brooks; brother-in-law, Jack Kappell; and father and mother-in-law: Raymond and Genevieve Kappell.

The funeral service for Ronald will be held at 7:00 pm on Tuesday, March 1, 2011 at JANSEN FARGO FUNERAL HOME.  A time of visitation and support will be held on Tuesday from 3:00 pm until the time of service.  In lieu of flowers, a memorial fund will be established in his name.

The family would like to thank the staff at Manor Care and Heartland Hospice for all your kindness and support.
