Mariners and Marlins both win in trade with David Phelps

Alonzo Mancillas |
Viernes, Julio 21, 2017







David Phelps
As it stands now, the Mariners will go into the stretch drive with one starter (Andrew Moore) who is a mere four games into his major-league career, and another (Yovani Gallardo) who was banished to the bullpen because of poor performance.Jerry Dipoto is making moves again.
Young Mariners closer Edwin Diaz has been on a strong roll recently, with five saves in Seattle's past six games, while Nick Vincent, Steve Cishek, Tony Zych and lefty specialist Marc Rzepczynski have also pitched well. Phelps is owed the balance of a $4.6 million salary for 2017, and he's not eligible for free agency until after the 2018 season. He faces the knowledge that his fan base is hungering for October relevance. MLB.com first reported Sandoval's pending return.Seattle is sitting at.500 (48-48) entering a four-game series at home against the Yankees (48-45). He has average power potential at best.That all being said, should Seattle be buying right now at all? At 22 years old, he was the sixth round selection of the team in the 2016 draft.Phelps has done a solid job this year out of the Marlins bullpen as one of the team's primary setup options. He currently uses a 3-pitch mix with the changeup still needing refinement.The loss of Hernandez isn't quite as dire considering the emergence of Mitch Haniger, Ben Gamel and Guillermo Heredia at the big-league level, the looming presence of Kyle Lewis and Tyler O'Neill and the improvements of Braden Bishop, Ian Miller and Chuck Taylor.Lopez was unranked-regrettably-in our pre-season top 50. He never really flourished in either, generating a mediocre 4.29 ERA over that span. However, he began to thrive as a nearly full-time reliever last season, putting up a 2.28 ERA, 1.14 WHIP and 3.00 K/BB over 86.2 frames. Finally, they also explain why - regardless of Phelps' numbers - the trade is about more than just adding a reliever.Lopez has displayed great progress since Tommy John surgery sidelined him in 2014. He kind of fits right in that group with those guys. Granted, both could just be victims of cold streaks but if Dipoto is intent on adding a reliever, the fact that he's settling for Phelps is just plain and simple desperation.

GREEN BAY, Wis., July 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Nicolet Bankshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:    NCBS) ("Nicolet") announced second quarter 2017 net income of $8.3 million and earnings per diluted common share of $0.83, compared to $6.2 million and $0.69 for first quarter 2017, and $3.3 million and $0.39 for second quarter 2016, respectively.  Annualized quarterly return on average assets was 1.27%, 1.11% and 0.66%, for second quarter 2017, first quarter 2017 and second quarter 2016, respectively.








Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $14.5 million and earnings per diluted common share were $1.53, compared to $5.9 million and $0.91, respectively, for the first half of 2016.  Annualized return on average assets for the first six months of 2017 and 2016 was 1.19% and 0.74%, respectively.   
"We have delivered another strong quarter of results, with an annualized return on average assets of 1.27%, return on average common equity of 10.15% and return on average tangible common equity of 15.64%," said Bob Atwell, Chairman and CEO of Nicolet.  "The opportunities associated with completing three acquisitions since the start of 2016 were real, and we executed swiftly to realize savings, capital efficiency and growth."  
"We have clear expectations for each acquisition and are particularly pleased to see the fruits of strategy flow so quickly into our income statement in the second quarter," Atwell said. "That said, there may be variability in our numbers over the next few quarters as we continue to work through acquired impaired loans and the integration."  
The acquisition of First Menasha was consummated on April 28, 2017, adding $479 million in assets, $351 million in loans, $375 million in deposits, $4 million of core deposit intangible, and $40 million of goodwill. Pursuant to the agreed upon terms, the final purchase price consisted of issuing 1.3 million shares of common stock (given the final stock-for-stock exchange ratio of 3.126) valued at $62 million and $19 million in cash.  
The timing of the 2016 acquisitions (Baylake Corp. and a financial advisory business acquisition each completed in April 2016) and the April 2017 First Menasha transaction impact financial comparisons.  Certain income statement results, average balances and related ratios for the first half of 2017 include full period contributions from the 2016 acquisitions plus two months of First Menasha operations, versus two months of Baylake and no contribution of First Menasha in the comparable 2016 period.   Given the activity of multiple mergers, quarterly results in 2017 and 2016 have included non-recurring other direct merger and integration pre-tax expenses of $0.3 million and $0.2 million in the second and first quarters of 2017, respectively, and $2.1 million and $0.4 million in the second and first quarters of 2016, respectively.      
Net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, was $8.3 million, up $2.1 million or 34% over $6.2 million for first quarter 2017. Notably, between the linked quarters, net interest income increased by $3.2 million or 15%. The increase was largely due to the inclusion of First Menasha for two months and a higher proportion of earning assets in loans given the strong loan growth, as each quarter included approximately $1.8 million of larger recovered discount income on favorably resolved purchased credit impaired loans.  Between the linked quarters, noninterest income increased $2.3 million or 34%, led by net mortgage income up $0.6 million on higher volumes, income from equity in a data processing company interest up $0.3 million, card interchange fees and brokerage fees each up $0.2 million, and a $0.8 million favorable swing in net gains on sale or write-down of assets mostly from vacated branch and other real estate property disposals.  Noninterest expense in total increased $2.0 million or 11%, with personnel costs up $1.1 million or 11% on the expanded workforce and the remainder attributable to the larger operating base consistent with the inclusion of First Menasha for two months. 
Net income for the first six months of 2017 was $14.5 million, up $8.6 million or 146% over $5.9 million for the first half of 2016.  The increase is largely attributable to the timing of adding the acquisitions as previously noted, benefits from strong loan growth, effective cost management, and $2.0 million lower direct merger-related costs between the comparable six month periods.
Since December 31, 2016, total assets increased by $0.5 billion or 23% to $2.8 billion, with approximately 20% attributable to the acquisition of First Menasha and 3% to net organic growth.  Excluding the impact of First Menasha, loans increased $90 million or 6% since year end 2016, and deposits increased $45 million or 2% organically.
Asset quality metrics remain strong and and continues to improve.  Nonperforming assets were $19 million, representing 0.66% of total assets at June 30, 2017, down favorably from 0.97% at year-end 2016 and 1.21% at June 30, 2016.  The provision for loan losses was $0.9 million compared to net charge offs of $0.1 million for the first six months of 2017, in support of the organic loan growth experienced.  The allowance for loan losses was $12.6 million, representing 0.63% of total loans at June 30, 2017, compared to 0.75% at year-end 2016 and 0.70% at June 30, 2016, mainly a result of recording acquired loans at their fair value with no carryover of allowance.  
Total capital was $352 million at June 30, 2017, comprised entirely of common equity.  Common equity increased $76 million since December 31, 2016, mostly due to stock issued in connection with the 2017 acquisition, as well as increases from net income and option exercises exceeding stock repurchases.  During the second quarter of 2017, Nicolet resumed its common stock repurchase program, utilizing $3.7 million to repurchase and cancel approximately 73,600 shares at a weighted average price per share of $49.94.   There remains $12.2 million authorized under the repurchase program which Nicolet may from time to time repurchase shares in the open market or through block transactions as market conditions warrant or in private transactions as an alternative use of capital.

GREEN BAY, Wis., Nov. 4, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Nicolet Bankshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:    NCBS) ("Nicolet") and First Menasha Bancshares, Inc. (OTCQX: FMBJ) ("First Menasha") today jointly announce the execution of a definitive merger agreement, pursuant to which Nicolet will acquire First Menasha and its wholly owned banking subsidiary, The First National Bank- Fox Valley ("FNB-Fox Valley").  The move will expand Nicolet's presence in the Fox Valley and open new markets in Neenah, Menasha, and Oshkosh.










 









 

 
 



Based on the financial results as of September 30, 2016, the combined company would have pro forma total assets of $2.7 billion, deposits of $2.3 billion and loans of $1.9 billion.  
Bob Atwell, CEO and Chairman of Nicolet said, "We continue to grow in the areas where we can make an impact.  We have known FNB-Fox Valley for some time and respect their commitment to community banking.  We are pleased to welcome them to the Nicolet family."
"The combination of Nicolet and FNB-Fox Valley makes perfect sense," said Peter Prickett, President and CEO of FNB-Fox Valley.  "We are both customer-first, service-driven cultures.  It is a great fit for our customers and the community. The combined institution will be the largest community bank in each of the Green Bay and Fox Cities markets and provides the size and scale needed today to provide stability, depth of resources, and great value to our customers, communities, and shareholders," Prickett continued.
Mike Daniels, President and CEO of Nicolet National Bank said, "We work to make a difference in the communities we serve.  To do this effectively, we want to be the lead-local community bank.  This breakout move puts us in that position in the Fox Valley.  Now, our job is to focus on a smooth transition for employees and customers."
Under the terms of the merger agreement, Nicolet will acquire First Menasha with Nicolet being the surviving corporation. In the merger, First Menasha shareholders shall have the right to receive, at the election of each holder and subject to proration, cash of $131.50 per share of First Menasha common stock and/or 3.411 shares of Nicolet common stock for each share of First Menasha common stock, with the total consideration to consist of between 25% cash/75% stock and 40% cash/60% stock. Based on Nicolet's closing price of $38.09 as of Thursday, November 3, 2016, the merger consideration is valued at approximately $76.6 million. 
The merger agreement outlines proration procedures if the cash consideration is over- or undersubscribed.  Further, the merger agreement provides for a cap and collar to re-set the exchange ratio should the Nicolet Common Stock Price, as defined in the merger agreement, rise or fall, by $5.00 or more per share from $38.55.  
Nicolet intends to appoint two members of First Menasha's current board of directors to the boards of directors of Nicolet and Nicolet National Bank upon the completion of the transaction. 
The estimated transaction value is a 1.65 multiple of First Menasha's tangible book value as of September 30, 2016. Nicolet estimates high single-digit EPS accretion in 2018 and an estimated tangible book earn-back period of less than five years.
The transaction has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of both companies.  It is subject to First Menasha shareholder approval, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close in second quarter 2017.  Upon consummation of the transaction, all branch offices of FNB-Fox Valley are expected to open as Nicolet National Bank branches, while Nicolet's existing branch at 2400 S. Kensington Drive in Appleton will close.
Bryan Cave LLP served as legal counsel to Nicolet in this transaction. Stephens Inc. served as financial advisor and provided a fairness opinion to First Menasha, and Reinhart Boerner Van Deuren s.c. served as legal counsel.

Forward Looking Statements "Safe Harbor" Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which Congress passed in an effort to encourage companies to provide information about their anticipated future financial performance. This act protects a company from unwarranted litigation if actual results are different from management expectations. This report reflects the current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance, and financial results of the management of Nicolet and First Menasha. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties which could cause Nicolet's, First Menasha's or the combined company's actual results and experience to differ from the anticipated results and expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements, and such differences may be material. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and neither Nicolet nor First Menasha assumes any duty to update forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements.
In addition to factors previously disclosed in Nicolet's reports filed with the SEC and those identified elsewhere in this report, these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about (i) the expected benefits of the transaction between Nicolet and First Menasha and between Nicolet National Bank and The First National Bank - Fox Valley , including future financial and operating results, cost savings, enhanced revenues and the expected market position of the combined company that may be realized from the transaction, and (ii) Nicolet's and First Menasha's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements contained in this report that are not historical facts. Other statements identified by words such as "expects," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "targets," "projects" or words of similar meaning generally are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of Nicolet's and First Menasha's management and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond their respective control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. Actual results may differ from those indicated or implied in the forward-looking statements and such differences may be material.
The following risks, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: (1) the businesses of Nicolet and First Menasha may not integrate successfully or the integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; (2) the expected growth opportunities and cost savings from the transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; (3) revenues following the transaction may be lower than expected as a result of losses of customers or other reasons, including issues arising in connection with integration of the two banks; (4) deposit attrition, operating costs, customer loss and business disruption following the transaction, including difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, may be greater than expected; (5) governmental approvals of the transaction may not be obtained on the proposed terms or expected timeframe; (6) the terms of the proposed transaction may need to be modified to satisfy such approvals or conditions; (7) First Menasha's shareholders may fail to approve the transaction; (8) reputational risks and the reaction of the companies' customers to the transaction; (9) diversion of management time on merger related issues; (10) changes in asset quality and credit risk; (11) the cost and availability of capital; (12) customer acceptance of the combined company's products and services; (13) customer borrowing, repayment, investment and deposit practices; (14) the introduction, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives; (15) the impact, extent, and timing of technological changes; (16) severe catastrophic events in our geographic area; (17) a weakening of the economies in which the combined company will conduct operations may adversely affect its operating results; (18) the U.S. legal and regulatory framework, including those associated with the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, could adversely affect the operating results of the combined company; (19) the interest rate environment may compress margins and adversely affect net interest income; and (20) competition from other financial services companies in the companies' markets could adversely affect operations. Additional factors that could cause Nicolet's results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in Nicolet's reports (such as Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K) filed with the SEC and available at the SEC's website (www.sec.gov). All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning Nicolet, First Menasha or the proposed merger or other matters and attributable to Nicolet, First Menasha or any person acting on either of their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above. Nicolet and First Menasha do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made.
