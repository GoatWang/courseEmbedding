        Parnassus Fund

        Investor Shares






                Objective:

                Capital appreciation.

                Strategy

                The Parnassus Fund invests across the capitalization spectrum with high conviction in approximately 40 holdings. The Fund focuses on identifying companies with:                
            

Wide moats or strong competitive advantages that protect market share and profitability
Relevancy over the long term, which provides a compounding growth component
                
Quality management teams that will act in the best interest of shareholders 
                
Stocks trading at a significant discount to their intrinsic value
                


                The Fund's contrarian approach seeks to invest in companies that are currently out of favor with the majority of investors. The Fund strives to outperform the S&P 500 index with a high active share. The Fund avoids companies engaged in the extraction, exploration, production, manufacturing, or refining of fossil fuels.
            

                Risks

                The Funds share price may change daily based on the value of its security holdings.
                Stock markets can be volatile, and stock values fluctuate in response to the asset
                levels of individual companies and in response to general U.S. and international
                market and economic conditions. In addition to large-cap companies, the Fund may
                invest in small- and/or mid-cap companies, which can be more volatile than large-cap
                firms. Security holdings in the fund can vary significantly from broad market indexes.

Avg. Weighted Mkt. Cap ($Bin)
                            The average capitalization of all stocks in the portfolio, weighted by each holding's
                            size in the portfolio. Capitalization, or market value of an entire company, is
                            calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the price per share.

                            (or "trailing" 12 months). This gives us an idea of how "expensive" a stock may
                            be. For a fund, the price/earnings ratio is the weighted average P/E ratio of the
                            stocks it holds.

Alpha
                            A coefficient measuring risk-adjusted performance, considering the risk due to the
                            specific security, rather than the overall market. A large alpha indicates that
                            the stock or mutual fund has performed better than would be predicted, given its
                            beta.

Beta
                            A measurement of a fund's trailing 36-month returns in relation with the market
                            as a whole. A beta of 1 means that the share price moves exactly inline with the
                            market. A beta over 1 suggests that the share price will typically be more volatile
                            than the market, and conversely, a beta below 1 indicates that the share price will
                            typically be less volatile than the market.

        The Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index (also known as “the S&P
        500 Index”) is a widely recognized index of common stock prices. An individual cannot
        invest directly in an index. An index reflects no deductions for fees, expenses
        or taxes, but mutual fund returns do.

 The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds,
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with
at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population
for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for
variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and
rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5%
receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The
Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures
associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year
rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total
returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns.
While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent
three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Parnassus Fund
was rated against the following numbers of Large Growth Funds over the following time periods: 1,277 funds in the
last three years, 1,152 funds in the last five years, and 803 funds in the last ten years. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. Morningstar Rating is for the Investor class only; other classes may have different
performance characteristics.

        Effective date: 4/3/2017
    

        Parnassus Investments or Parnassus Funds (collectively, "Parnassus", "We", "Us", or "Our") is committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and security of personal information entrusted to us by current and potential financial service customers. We have always treated personal information as confidential and want you to be aware of our privacy policies.
    
Online Privacy Practices
How we collect and use your nonpublic personal information online

        We obtain the personal information below about you from the following sources: information we receive from you on online applications or other forms and information about your transactions with us, our affiliates or others. We use this information to verify your identity and open your account with the Parnassus Funds.
    

        We allow the ability to opt-out of all subscribed, promotional postal and email mailings by contacting us by email or phone. For email messages, there is a hyperlink at the bottom to unsubscribe.
    
How your information is not shared with others
We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.
How you can update your information

        Upon request Parnassus Investments will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information.  You can change your address
            online by first logging into your online account, and then selecting Update
        Your Mailing Address under the Update Your Info link. You can also change your address

How we protect and secure your privacy online

        The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive
        information (such as your social security number) online on our registration or
        other forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology, SSL,
        so unauthorized parties cannot view the information during secure transmission (look
        for the padlock icon on your browser). Find out more about SSL certificates and technology. Also,
        your protected online account information resides on the secure portion of our website,
        and to access your account information online, a unique user name and password is
        required. In addition to the secure practices in the above section for our mutual funds, we use firewalls and other security technology at all times to protect our network and systems from external attacks.
    

        We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information
        submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission
        over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore,
        while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information,
        we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security
        on our Web site, please contact us.
    
How we use tracking technologies

        We Parnassus Investments and our partners use technologies such as cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.

If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any Web site you visit.
    
How we notify you of changes to this privacy policy

        If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy policy, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
    

        We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page prior to the change becoming effective.
    
Privacy Policy and Practices
Parnassus is committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and security of personal information entrusted to us by current and potential shareholders. We have always treated personal information as confidential and want you to be aware of our privacy policies.
What Information We Collect

        We may collect and maintain the following nonpublic personal information about you:
    

information we receive from you on applications or other forms, such as your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, social security number or Tax ID number, assets, income and date of birth; and
information about your transactions with us, our affiliates or others, such as your account number, balance, positions, activity, history, cost basis information and other financial information.

What Information We Disclose

        In certain situations, Parnassus Investments may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.  We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our shareholders or former shareholders to any third parties, except as permitted or required by law. We are permitted by law to share any of the information we collect, as described above, with our affiliates. Parnassus will share information with affiliates if the information is required to provide a product or service you have requested. In addition, we may share such information with non-affiliated third parties to the extent necessary to effect, process, administer or enforce a transaction that you request or authorize, in connection with maintaining or servicing your account, as requested by regulatory authorities or as otherwise permitted or required by law. For example, we may provide such information to third parties in the course of servicing your account, such as identity-verification service providers. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. Relationships with these parties shall be pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement, protecting the release of shareholder information.
We may also disclose information to non-affiliated parties if compelled by law, such as responding to a subpoena, preventing fraud or complying with an inquiry by a government agency or regulator.
    
How We Protect Your Information

        We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those persons who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of your nonpublic personal information. We will continue to adhere to the privacy policies and practices in this notice even if your account is closed or becomes inactive.
    
Additional Rights
You may have other privacy protections under applicable state laws. To the extent those state laws apply, we will comply with them with respect to your nonpublic personal information.

        Performance data quoted represent past performance and are no guarantee of future
        returns. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted.
        Current performance information to the most recent month-end is available on the
        Parnassus website (www.parnassus.com). Investment return and principal value will
        fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less
        than their original principal cost.

        Before investing, an investor should carefully consider the investment objectives,
        risks, charges and expenses of a fund and should carefully read the prospectus or summary prospectus, which contains this and other information and can be found in our Forms and Documents
        section. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor’s
        shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original principal cost,
        and you could lose money.
