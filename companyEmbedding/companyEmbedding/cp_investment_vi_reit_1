Invest in 1031 Eligible PropertiesDefer Capital Gains on Your Real Estate Investment.Become a 1031 Investor 







What is a 1031 Exchange?
A 1031 exchange is a powerful wealth management tool. Real estate investors can defer their capital gains tax on the sale of a property if they reinvest the proceeds in another qualifying property under the Internal Revenue Code Section 1031.


 










1031 Exchange Benefits:


Defer capital gains taxes on the sale of your property.
Invest in cash flowing properties and look to receive monthly distributions.
Ensure certainty of closing and avoid property management headaches.
Diversify your portfolio with a broad range of geography and property types.



 









1031 Exchange Risks:


A 1031 Exchange is a complicated transaction. Investors should consult their tax professionals.
The underlying investments in Real Estate are Illiquid Investments.
Investors who fail to complete their 1031 exchange in the allowable time (typically 180 days) lose their capital gains tax protection.
Each investment has its own risks and the investor should review offering materials for a full review of those risks.

MogulREIT I FAQs

What is MogulREIT?

MogulREIT I is a limited liability company formed to invest in and manage a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate investments, such as loans, equity in commercial real estate ventures, and other real estate-related assets.
MogulREIT I is a registered, non-traded REIT. That means that it is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but is not traded on a stock exchange. MogulREIT I intends to qualify as a REIT beginning with its taxable year ending December 31, 2016.

What types of properties or investments go into MogulREIT?

MogulREIT can invest in a variety of property types, including but not limited to, multi-family, office, industrial, self-storage, retail, medical office, and hospitality. The fund can invest in various commercial real estate-related equity and debt securities across these different property types.

Who can invest in MogulREIT? 

MogulREIT is available to both accredited and non-accredited investors. Non-accredited investors must have net worth and annual income greater than $10,000. 

What is the minimum amount I can invest in MogulREIT?

The minimum investment is $1,000.

Can I invest in MogulREIT I using a SDIRA (Self-Directed IRA) or other type of retirement account?

Yes. We have added the ability to take retirement funds into MogulREIT I. This means you can use your SDIRA to make investments.

How liquid is an investment in MogulREIT?

In the first quarter of 2017 we updated our Redemption Plan (now referred to as the Share Repurchase Program) to allow for a higher repurchase rate, faster. Share Repurchases from MogulREIT I are generally allowed on a quarterly basis, subject to the share repurchase rights and limitations outlined in the Offering Circular.

How is investing in MogulREIT different from other investment opportunities offered on the RealtyMogul.com Platform?

The RealtyMogul.com Platform offers individual real property-related investments as private placements to accredited investors only. The RealtyMogul.com Platform allows accredited investors to review due diligence materials for individual transactions and invest in one transaction at a time. Investing in MogulREIT is different since investment decisions are made by our Manager and you are investing in a diversified portfolio and not a specific transaction or property. Additionally, MogulREIT is accessible to both accredited and non-accredited investors and offers a lower investment minimum than some of the transactions offered on the RealtyMogul.com Platform.

Who is on the Manager team of MogulREIT?

RealtyMogul.com has a highly experienced team of real estate finance professionals, led by Jilliene Helman, its Chief Executive Officer. Many of the senior executives and loan origination professionals at RealtyMogul.com have deep experience in the commercial real estate sector and have been in leadership roles at financial services institutions for many years. Collectively, these professionals have approximately 200 years of combined direct experience in the commercial real estate business, and have managed more than $4 billion of originations and more than $8.5 billion in underwritings in commercial real estate loans and equity investments. The Company benefits from the knowledge and industry contacts, experience and judgment that these professionals have accumulated over numerous real estate cycles. Learn more.
The credit team of RealtyMogul.com is very experienced in reviewing and underwriting commercial real estate investments. RealtyMogul.com’s Chief Credit Officer, Megan Goodfellow, has been involved in institutional finance for three decades, specializing in the analysis of real estate capital structures and financial strategies.  Ms. Goodfellow has assembled a strong team of credit and underwriting professionals whose expertise has been honed in the service of RealtyMogul.com, and which will be brought to bear for MogulREIT’s benefit.

What services will the Manager perform?

The Manager performs the following services: investment advisory and acquisition services (including performing due diligence on our investments), offering services, asset management services, accounting and other administrative services, shareholder services, financing services, and disposition services.

How does RealtyMogul.com decide which investments go into the fund and which don’t?

MogulREIT I pursues the investment strategy using the criteria described in its Offering Circular. Some opportunities may arise which could be allocated to either MogulREIT I or the RealtyMogul.com Platform. In these instances, any potential debt investment exceeding $1,000,000 and equity investment exceeding $1,500,000 will first be made available to MogulREIT I. If the fund chooses not to invest and the investment opportunity meets the investment criteria for Realty Mogul, then those investment opportunities will be made available to other investors through the RealtyMogul.com Platform. MogulREIT I may, where the investment committee of its Manager determines that the size of an investment would create undue concentration in its portfolio or that the entire investment would otherwise be unsuitable for the fund, permit a portion of an investment to be sold on the RealtyMogul.com Platform.

Canadian Fund to Buy Houston REIT in $1.2B Deal





























Canadian Fund to Buy Houston REIT in $1.2B Deal
CPPIB will be acquiring Parkway Inc., which has a strong local presence, with an office portfolio of about 8.7 million square feet across 19 properties.

Hilary Spann, managing director & head of U.S. Real Estate Investments for CPPIB
It might be mid-summer in North America, but that didn’t chill the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board’s interest in moving (a big chunk of its money) to Houston. For $1.2 billion, or $23.05 per share, CPPIB will be acquiring Parkway Inc., a Houston-based REIT with a major presence in its home city, the two companies announced last Friday.
The per-share consideration consists of $19.05 per share plus a $4.00 special dividend to be paid prior to closing and represents a premium of about 14.3 percent versus Parkway’s 30-day volume-weighted average price ended June 29.
The transaction is not subject to a financing condition and is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Parkway’s board unanimously approved the agreement. TPG Capital and its affiliates, which own about 9.8 percent of Parkway’s outstanding common stock, have agreed to vote in favor of the transaction.
Parkway’s strong local presence
“We believe there are still some near-term headwinds in the office sector for Houston, but the implied asset valuation of this transaction shows CPPIB’s appreciation for the high-quality portfolio we have assembled and the near-term stability it provides during the current downturn in the market,” James Heistand, Parkway’s president & CEO, said in a prepared statement.
Parkway owns the largest office portfolio in Houston, totaling about 8.7 million square feet across 19 properties. Located in the Westchase, Greenway and Galleria submarkets, the high-quality office properties are 87.6 percent leased and reportedly are anchored by “a broad mix of strong tenants in financial services, technology and commodities businesses.”
“Parkway fits well with CPPIB’s long-term real estate strategy to hold stable, high-quality assets in large U.S. markets,” Hilary Spann, managing director & head of U.S. Real Estate Investments for CPPIB, said in the prepared statement. “Through this investment, CPPIB gains additional scale in Houston.”
CPPIB declined to comment further on the transaction.
CPPIB’s Holdings
In a $141 million transaction earlier this year, CPPIB acquired a 24.5 percent stake in a Houston office portfolio sold by a Parkway affiliate, which retained a 51 percent stake. The other 24.5 percent of the 11-building, 5 million-square-foot Greenway Portfolio was purchased by a joint venture of TH Real Estate and Silverpeak Real Estate Partners.
CPPIB also has a 40 percent stake in Alden Bridge Village Center, a grocery-anchored retail center in The Woodlands, a Houston suburb, a spokesperson told Commercial Property Executive.
CPPIB invests funds not needed by the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) to pay current benefits on behalf of its 20 million contributors and beneficiaries. At the end of the first quarter, the CPP Fund totaled C$316.7 billion (US$244.7 billion).

According to a new report from Deloitte, REITs could offer a potential avenue for infrastructure investment.
“Coming out of the economic downturn, private investors are seeking new avenues to generate tax-efficient returns on their invested funds,” reads the report, titled “REITs and Infrastructure Projects: The Next Investment Frontier” It continues on to say that the infrastructure sector continues to attract private investor interest, particularly as more governments look to public-private partnerships to provide funding. 
From highways and public transportation to waste disposal and water supply to energy and modes of communication, U.S. infrastructure is in sore need of repair, as well as expansion to accommodate the country’s mushrooming population. While the federal government has allotted $35 billion through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for highway and public transportation improvements alone, as Deloitte notes in the report, the American Society of Civil Engineers’ 2009 Report Card for American Infrastructure estimates that $2.2 trillion is needed to sufficiently upgrade the system. REITs, according to Deloitte, could pick up the financial slack for these projects. It’s all about private capital and public-private partnerships. 
“In recent years, private investors have expressed interest in adding infrastructure assets to their investment portfolios,” it asserts. “In general, private investments are often made via flow-through investment vehicles, such as limited liability corporations. However, recent Internal Revenue Service private letter rulings may now allow investors to use REITs as an alternative investment structure.”
According to Deloitte, the topic of private investments in infrastructure has grown amongst politicians and financial professionals, with the use of a public-private partnership structure in use in countries including Australia, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom. Through these partnerships, the public sector grants a private-sector party or consortium a long-term concession for responsibility for some or all of the design, construction, financing, operations and maintenance of a publicly owned asset. In the U.S., however, these partnerships are relatively new and at some points have created controversy. 
That said, Deloitte notes that several high-profile transactions in the U.S. have reported significant financial benefits. 
“These successes, combined with a growing need to spend trillions of dollars repairing and constructing roads and bridges, airports, and electric, gas and water distribution systems, as well as hospitals, courthouses, and prisons,” the report reads, “are causing supporters to believe that increased access to (public-private partnerships) would be a welcome complement to traditional infrastructure financing using tax-exempt bonds.”
The report lists several advantages of REIT investments in infrastructure transactions: liquidity, incremental scalability, capital market access, and taxation.
“In short, REITs offer certain advantages over partnerships in their ability to raise capital from diverse sources, particularly foreign investors,” the report notes. “In addition, expanding the investor base to individual investors may increase the availability of equity capital for infrastructure projects.”
While there are pluses to the infrastructure REIT concept for public-private projects, there are also a few drawbacks. The majority of public-private partnership endeavors will produce sizeable tax losses in the initial 10 to 15 years of operation, losses that would not pass through to REIT shareholders. Additionally, relying on a REIT as an investment vehicle for infrastructure projects would also present income test barriers. However, Deloitte points to a couple of feasible solutions to that obstacle. 
One option would be new legislation creating Infrastructure Investment Trusts that would allow for the classification of revenues from public-private partnership infrastructure participation–including rent from real property–as qualifying income, thereby eliminating the test barriers. Another solution would be the incorporation of a new system that would permit infrastructure assets to be owned or leased by a Taxable REIT Subsidiary without the existing restrictions on the total value of the REIT.

Invest in 1031 Eligible PropertiesDefer Capital Gains on Your Real Estate Investment.Become a 1031 Investor 







What is a 1031 Exchange?
A 1031 exchange is a powerful wealth management tool. Real estate investors can defer their capital gains tax on the sale of a property if they reinvest the proceeds in another qualifying property under the Internal Revenue Code Section 1031.


 










1031 Exchange Benefits:


Defer capital gains taxes on the sale of your property.
Invest in cash flowing properties and look to receive monthly distributions.
Ensure certainty of closing and avoid property management headaches.
Diversify your portfolio with a broad range of geography and property types.



 









1031 Exchange Risks:


A 1031 Exchange is a complicated transaction. Investors should consult their tax professionals.
The underlying investments in Real Estate are Illiquid Investments.
Investors who fail to complete their 1031 exchange in the allowable time (typically 180 days) lose their capital gains tax protection.
Each investment has its own risks and the investor should review offering materials for a full review of those risks.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI US REIT Index (RMS G) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is comprised of equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) that are included in the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, with the exception of specialty equity REITs that do not generate a majority of their revenue and income from real estate rental and leasing operations. The Index represents approximately 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
