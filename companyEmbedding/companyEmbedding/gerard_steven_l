CLEVELAND, Aug. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- CBIZ, Inc. (NYSE:    CBZ) today announced that the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) recently recognized Steven L. Gerard as an NACD Board Leadership Fellow. 








The NACD Fellowship is The Gold Standard Director Credential™ – a comprehensive and continuous program of study that empowers governance professionals with the latest insights, intelligence, and leading boardroom practices, year after year. NACD Fellows have proved that they stand among the highest echelon of directors and governance professionals in their commitment to excellence in the boardroom.  
All CBIZ directors are members of NACD and share a dedication to strong corporate governance. Last year, NACD honored CBIZ Director Sherrill Hudson by naming him to its esteemed 2015 Directorship 100 list in recognition of his commitment to the highest principles of board leadership.
Gerard said, "I am honored to join the distinguished and diverse group of individuals who make up the NACD Fellow community and who are committed to advancing the highest standards of boardroom excellence. The resources, insights, and connections I've developed through the NACD Fellowship program will be key assets to the companies I serve, as well as to my professional growth as a director." 
"We are proud to announce that Steven L. Gerard has joined NACD's credentialed directors and has taken the next step in the pursuit of boardroom excellence," said Ken Daly, CEO of NACD. "NACD Fellows help advance the highest standards for those who serve in the boardroom, to strengthen their companies and drive director professionalism. The impact of this program is unmatched, and they should be commended for their ongoing commitment to strong corporate governance and their own professional development."
Gerard was elected Chairman of the Board of CBIZ, Inc. in October 2002. He was appointed Chief Executive Officer and Director in October 2000, and served as CEO until his retirement on March 9, 2016.  He continues in his role as non-executive Chairman of the CBIZ Board, and serves as Director on the Boards of Lennar Corporation, Joy Global, Inc. and Las Vegas Sands Corporation.

            I primarily see men and women who are dealing with problems relating to anxiety and/or depression.  Many of the people I treat are dealing with overwhelming life issues.  During therapy we process these issues and practice strategies designed to give you coping skills you can use for your current and future situations.  I am trained to provide relief on a wide variety of pressures, including, but not limited to anger and communication difficulties, grief and loss, history of trauma, adult recovery from child  abuse, divorce, change of life issues,
relationship conflict and men's and women's issues.
        

            Depression and anxiety do not occur in a vacuum.  They occur within a larger context of genetics, relationships, life events and our interpretations of these events.
If we interpret events accurately, or at least neutrally, our resulting moods and feeling will be accurate, producing appropriate and life-enhancing behavior.
        

            It is my goal to provide effective and affordable therapy.  It is your right and not a privelege to be content and growing.
   
 -Compassionate and Confidential-    

I have immediate availability. I look 
      forward to working with you.
