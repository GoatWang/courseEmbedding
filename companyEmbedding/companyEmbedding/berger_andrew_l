                            Did you spend a lot of time in the waiting room at this psychologist's office?
                        

                            No, my appointment started at the scheduled time
                        

                            Was this provider's office too loud?
                        

                            Not at all, it was very peaceful and quiet
                        

                            Would you refer this provider to a family or friend?
                        

                            Yes
                        

                            Does this provider leave you on hold for a long time when you call?
                        

                            Never! I don't think I've ever been put on hold here for a long time
                        

                            Did this provider promise services he/she couldn't provide?
                        

                            No, they were able to provide everything they said they would
