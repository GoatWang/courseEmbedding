OriginWhen the New York Times launched its first web presence, new CTO Andres Rodriguez faced a major challenge – how to scale web services from 10,000 internal users to millions of subscribers. Andres’ IT team could have purchased racks of web servers and load balancers. But building out The Times’ data center wouldn’t withstand the massive number of hits to its site when a major story broke. Instead, Andres turned to Akamai, whose use of the internet to replicate and cache content globally provided scale a single enterprise couldn’t match. His early use of what is now considered a cloud service was a huge success.
As The Times’ began digitizing more of its content and production workflows, Andres soon encountered his next big challenge – how to store, protect, and manage the files that were doubling in size and number every year. He could have purchased racks of NetApp NAS devices, backup solutions, and disaster recovery infrastructure. But this hardware-based model could no longer support the magnitude of file growth. A new file services approach uniting the performance and access of NetApp with the scalability, stability, and global reach of Akamai was needed. Andres’ idea for “NAS Unified” – Nasuni – was born.
Leveraging the “New Disk”Andres foresaw cloud object storage as the “new disk” – unlimited, durable, georedundant, and economical. His first company after The Times – Archivas – pioneered object storage in the cloud. Acquired by HDS, Archivas is now the Hitachi Content Platform (HCP).
But, how to get files – the world’s fastest growing type of data – into these cloud object stores? A file system was the answer. Specifically, a next-generation global file system that could support a unified set of enterprise file services. Andres decided to start Nasuni, short for “NAS unified.”
Paul Flanagan became Nasuni’s first investor. Paul shared Andres’ vision and passion for a new type of global file infrastructure so fervently he later joined Nasuni as its president.
A File System in the Cloud?Nasuni’s key innovation – now patented – moves the inode structures of a file system from hardware to the cloud. The result is the world’s first cloud-native global file system, Nasuni UniFS®. As the power behind the Nasuni platform, UniFS is enabling us to stay true to our founding beliefs that enterprise file services should:

Scale to fit all files globally
Require no separate backup or DR solution
Offer access from any location
Support any level of performance
Allow customers to use any cloud they want
Provide centralized, single pane of glass management

Primary NASNasuni is the modern, cloud-native solution for primary NAS consolidation and refresh initiatives 
Primary NAS ChallengesOn-premises Network Attached Storage (NAS) arrays have long been the solution for enterprise file sharing. Project directories, group shares, and user home drives with NAS for primary storage, backup infrastructure for data protection, and replication or remote access for cross-site sharing have been the standard formula. However, continuing the cycle of NAS refresh, forklift upgrades, backup, replication, and dedicated DR sites can no longer keep pace with the growth rate of unstructured data. Cost and complexity are too great, and digital transformation objectives are not being met.
The Nasuni SolutionNasuni, in combination with a hot tier of cloud object storage (e.g. Amazon S3 Standard, Azure Hot GRS/LRS, IBM Cloud Object Storage), is the modern solution to your NAS refresh and consolidation challenges.
Nasuni breaks the expensive NAS refresh cycle, saving IT budget and staff time. By using durable, scalable cloud object storage in place of disk; on-premises edge appliances for fast access to active files; and the world’s first global file system that scales beyond the bounds of any individual storage array, Nasuni is quickly becoming the new scalable NAS standard.
High performance file access, built-in data protection, unlimited scalability, comprehensive security, and support for any public or private cloud object store are all included at significantly lower cost than legacy NAS infrastructure.
Leading Scalable NAS CapabilitiesNasuni addresses the need for scalable file storage with world-class features:

Cloud-native file system — Nasuni UniFS, the first global file system designed to reside in the cloud, stores the authoritative gold copy of every file in your preferred public or private cloud object store. File storage can scale without limits and is accessible from all locations because data is no longer bound to, or limited by, a “master” storage device.
Unlimited capacity — Primary storage capacity scales in the cloud to any level required. Increasing space is simple and immediate.
High performance edge caches – Nasuni Edge Appliances cache active files locally so users can access data without delay. Any number of physical or virtual appliances can be deployed in any location and sized to meet business needs. The “cache-from-cloud” architecture makes files readily available without having to deploy full-sized NAS arrays in every site. The Edge Appliances support standard NAS protocols, including SMB/CIFS or NFS, enabling project shares, group directories, and user home drives to be accessed using the local network, without changing automation scripts or drive mappings.
Integrated backup and recovery — Nasuni Continuous File Versioning transmits every file change to the cloud as space-efficient data “shards.” Not only does this eliminate the cost and overhead of third party file backup, but it also provides virtually unlimited recovery points. Self-service and IT recovery options provide accelerated restore times as well.
Integrated disaster recovery (DR) — Nasuni’s cloud object storage partners automatically keep multiple copies of file data in different geographic locations to protect against regional disasters. Combined with Nasuni’s ability to create Edge Appliances in minutes using the file system metadata stored in the cloud, any location in the world that has power and cloud connectivity can now become a DR site. The costs of dedicated DR sites and replication bandwidth can be eliminated.
Strong security — All data stored in the cloud is strongly encrypted with customer-controlled keys that are not available to Nasuni or the cloud vendor. Data is encrypted and decrypted locally in the Edge Appliances. Each Edge Appliance joins the organization’s Active Directory domain to take advantage of existing on-premises security. Access controls are encrypted in the cloud and can be seamlessly migrated to Nasuni along with the file data for data migration and DR purposes.

How Nasuni is Different from Traditional NAS Traditional NAS infrastructure has many drawbacks:

Continuous investments must be made in hardware and datacenter footprint, adding cost, complexity and management overhead as unstructured data requirements grow.
Forklift upgrades are needed every 3-5 years to replace existing arrays with newer, bigger models.
Making files accessible in other locations requires costly MPLS bandwidth and duplicate NAS arrays to allow for replication, or WAN acceleration to provide remote access.
Backing up files requires third party backup software and tape or disk backup targets.
Dedicated sites with more duplicate NAS infrastructure are needed for DR.

Nasuni overcomes these drawbacks:

Nasuni’s global file system stores “gold copies” of all files in your preferred private or public cloud object store. Nasuni Edge Appliances located on-premises provide high performance cached access to the active files without needing full-sized NAS arrays in all locations.
Capacity can be increased at any time with a few clicks. Edge Appliances don’t have to be upgraded as capacity is added, since only the active files are stored on-premises.
Global file access is provided by deploying Edge Appliances in any location and leveraging Nasuni’s use of the internet to propagate data changes.
Backup and recovery is built-in with Nasuni Continuous File Versioning.
DR is built-in leveraging georedundant cloud storage and Nasuni’s ability to instantiate Edge Appliances in any location that can connect to the cloud.

Nasuni Primary NAS BenefitsReduce CostsNasuni and cloud storage shift heavy, up-front NAS CapEx to predictable, pay-as-you-grow OpEx. Cloud storage scales in place without limits, eliminating costs related to storage refreshes, forklift upgrades, and data migrations. Nasuni eliminates the costs of backup, DR, and replication.
Increase AgilityThere is no more guessing about how much primary file storage will be needed for the future. Adding more capacity can be performed on demand with a simple license update.
Reduce RiskBackup is built-in. Recovery points can be tight enough to mitigate everything from Ransomware to accidental deletions. Recovery times can be as fast as your business needs mandate.
Ensure Business ContinuityProvide access to files no matter how many locations are impacted by a disaster or IT outage. Any office with power and cloud connectivity can become a DR site in minutes.

Our global file lock prevents multiple authors from making simultaneous edits and causing version conflict.  
Your Choice of CloudPick the public or private cloud that makes the most sense for your business.  Or, use multiple clouds to meet specific regional requirements. With Nasuni, you’re not locked into the one cloud your key file-generating applications support.
Safe and SecureLocally, file access is controlled by the same Active Directory and LDAP authentication you use today. In transit, your data is encrypted with keys you control. In the cloud, it’s secured using your providers’ stringent compliance and privacy tools and procedures.
Pay-As-You-GrowOur licensing model is standard Software as a Service (SaaS).  You only pay for what you need, when you need it.  High up-front capital costs become lower, more predictable operational costs.

Nasuni Corporation Announces Sales Results for Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2016
Feb 7 17
Nasuni Corporation announced that the record sales results for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Subscription revenue grew by 92% over the same period in 2015, driven by global enterprises' critical need to solve the problems associated with exponential file growth.


Nasuni Refreshes Edge Appliances with Higher Capacity Across the Entire Line, Adds New All-Flash Filer
Sep 7 16
Nasuni announced a refresh of its entire line of hardware devices, which includes the company's standardization on Dell. Nasuni has standardized on Dell'sPowerEdge Tower and Rackmount XDXL servers which includes both extended time periods with committed locked components and five-year warranties. Customers can enjoy not only improved price performance for the entire line, but they will also benefit from Dell's remote management capabilities and its worldwide support, with a four-hour guaranteed part replacement virtually anywhere on the globe. From the smallest device – the new NF-60 (based on T130xl) with a 2 TB cache, to the NF-440 (based on R730xdxl) with an up to 36 TB cache, to the new all solid-state NF-600 (based on R630xl) with an up to 35 TB cache, Nasuni has engineered faster performance and higher capacity up and down the line. Nasuni does not sell these hardware devices as standalone products. Instead, they act as edge appliances for Nasuni's Enterprise File Services. For a per-terabyte subscription fee, organizations get fast access to files from any location (including mobile devices), automatic data protection, unlimited capacity and central management. Nasuni also now includes its new enterprise file sync and share (EFSS) capability at no extra charge. It comes with an easy-to-use app, making it easy to share files outside the organization, but with the control and security IT needs without creating a separate infrastructure.

Vendor: Nasuni Corp. Category: Primary cloud NAS Product: Nasuni Filer Why it makes our list: Trying to bring primary data to the cloud with uptime guarantees








Nasuni is trying to stand out among cloud gateway vendors by offering service-level agreements (SLAs) for uptime, reliability and security that go far beyond those of service providers. Nasuni sells a NAS gateway, available as an appliance or as software that customers can run on their own hardware. Either as a hardware or virtual appliance, the Nasuni Filer provides an interface to cloud service providers and handles transfer of data to and from the cloud. Nasuni has close to 100 customers, according to CEO Andres Rodriguez, whose previous startup Archivas was acquired by Hitachi Data Systems in 2007. Nasuni has $23 million in venture capital funding and came out of stealth in 2009. Its biggest challenge is to convince customers to trust primary data to a startup and a cloud storage model.

network-attached storage (NAS) customers to get the best of both cloud storage and on-premise data storage by automatically caching active data while bulk data stays with a service provider.








Nasuni is emerging from stealth with founder and CEO Andres Rodriguez (formerly chief technology officer at Archivas, which was bought by Hitachi Data Systems in Feb. 2007) at the helm. Its first product, the Nasuni Filer, is a virtual appliance that runs on VMware. It can be downloaded from the Web and resides in a server at an end user's data center. It offers an interface to cloud data storage services using the CIFS standard file network protocol, rather than requiring customers to provide their own application integration into a Web services-based cloud data storage service.

Meanwhile, the customer can either manage a relationship with one of Nasuni's cloud storage service partners – Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3), the Rackspace Cloud, Iron Mountain's cloud data storage services, and Nirvanix Inc.'s Storage Delivery Network – or have its relationship managed by a channel partner.

Rodriguez said Nasuni can offer customers the option of a fixed $250 per month fee for unlimited capacity with one of the cloud service providers if the customer has either Nasuni or one of its channel partners handle the provider relationship, in addition to Nasuni's licensing costs (the company has not publicly disclosed pricing for the product yet).
Once data goes to the Nasuni Filer, the appliance handles the transfer of data to and from the cloud service provider. "There's a natural bridge between the NAS and cloud archiving worlds," Rodriguez said. "Snapshots are that bridge."
The Nasuni Filer treats the cloud as if it's raw disk. It sends it chunks of data based on incremental snapshots of the local file system, which are compressed and encrypted for transfer over the Internet. A copy of the overall file system structure, along with the files and metadata, is also stored in the cloud in case the primary appliance fails. The snapshots are made as soon as hourly or as far apart as 12 hours.
The original files also remain in the local repository for awhile, but files that haven't been recently used will move off to the cloud to make room for active data.
The appliance isn't meant for large enterprises or high-performance data sets, as there's some latency involved in bringing files down from the cloud should there be a "cache miss." Rodriguez said Nasuni is targeting customers with at least 500 GB of total data (at least 100 GB of it file based), with between 200 and 2,000 employees.
Nasuni plans to make the Nasuni Filer generally available this spring, with Version 2.0 coming in the second half of the year. In future releases, Rodriguez said Nasuni will offer the ability to mirror data between cloud data storage back ends at different service providers. An encryption key escrow option with a third party will also be added to later versions of the product. The first version of the Nasuni Filer supports Windows files only, while support for other operating systems remains a roadmap item.

Cost concerns have one user going to the cloud
Nasuni doesn't offer service-level agreements (SLAs) for the back-end storage capacity managed by cloud data storage providers. Still, one alpha tester said he plans to deploy the Nasuni Filer in production to avoid rising storage costs.
"It's always a concern, but the value provided by applications and storage in the cloud is so significant for an organization of our size and technical reach that we're willing to take our chances," said John De Souza, director of IT and systems at South Bend, Ind.-based Cressy & Everett Real Estate. "Even if there's an outage, at 2 or 3 a.m. on a Sunday, I'd rather have a couple thousand engineers working on it than me and my flashing cell phone."
Cressy & Everett has approximately 4 TB of total data and about 150 employees. During alpha testing, De Souza said he put about 30 GB of data on the Nasuni Filer and attached five users to the Nasuni filer instead of the company's existing local NAS storage. "The users aren't aware of the NAS storage to begin with, and from their point of view it's the same experience," he said.
In future releases, De Souza said he's hoping to see more detailed billing and consumption reports so he can rationalize the cost of cloud storage space and keep track of who's using what. "We back up using Jungle Disk," he said. "And we'll sometimes get a $20 or $30 bill from Amazon and be saying, 'Really? Why?' I want to be able to sit down and look at what's going on."
One channel partner that has already signed on, Fred Nix, CTO at Syscom Technologies, said he heard about the company through industry colleagues and has been involved since "the whiteboard architecture stage" of the product in getting it to market. Nix said he's excited about Nasuni's roadmap, but admits the cloud storage market hasn't really taken off at this point. "There's been a lot of buzz, but there hasn't been a whole lot of cloud activity – that's the biggest challenge right now," he said. "Everyone's kind of waiting to see who goes first."

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Nasuni is a privately held cloud storage company.[1] The company has its headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts[2] and was founded in 2008.[3]
The firm's storage product uses cloud-based NAS technology,[4] local Filer appliances, and the company's proprietary UniFS global file system.[5] The primary storage infrastructure uses public cloud storage platforms, such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.[6] Such public cloud storage platforms provide an object-based storage infrastructure, on top of which UniFS creates a complete versioned file system.[7] The service stores customer data as a sequence of snapshots that include every version of every file. The firm has demonstrated the ability to store more than one billion objects in a single storage volume.[8]
Nasuni Filers run in virtual environments (including VMware and Microsoft Hyper-V), on hardware appliances, and as a Microsoft Azure and Amazon EC2 virtual appliance. Hardware appliance choices include systems with solid-state drives.[9]
Nasuni publishes an annual report on the performance, availability, and scalability of the major cloud storage providers.[10][11][12][13]

Nasuni is a privately held cloud storage company.[1] The company has its headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts[2] and was founded in 2008.[3]
The firm's storage product uses cloud-based NAS technology,[4] local Filer appliances, and the company's proprietary UniFS global file system.[5] The primary storage infrastructure uses public cloud storage platforms, such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.[6] Such public cloud storage platforms provide an object-based storage infrastructure, on top of which UniFS creates a complete versioned file system.[7] The service stores customer data as a sequence of snapshots that include every version of every file. The firm has demonstrated the ability to store more than one billion objects in a single storage volume.[8]
Nasuni Filers run in virtual environments (including VMware and Microsoft Hyper-V), on hardware appliances, and as a Microsoft Azure and Amazon EC2 virtual appliance. Hardware appliance choices include systems with solid-state drives.[9]
Nasuni publishes an annual report on the performance, availability, and scalability of the major cloud storage providers.[10][11][12][13]
