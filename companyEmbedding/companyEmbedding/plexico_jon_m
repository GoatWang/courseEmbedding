Three years later, Mr. Plexico saw Ms. Zimand again, at a cocktail party."I was able to set the record straight," he said.That night, Ms. Zimand told him that the other Stephanie, a friend of hers, had described him as having had a "deer in the headlights" look when he walked through the restaurant door and said she knew immediately that he had asked out the wrong woman. Ms. Zimand told him she had held onto his business card for a year and a half, wondering why he didn't call.Time and love healed all, and the other Stephanie was a guest at the wedding.

      Management, LLC. Previously, he served as managing director, healthcare, 
      and before that vice president, healthcare, of Merriman Curhan Ford, a 
      publicly traded financial services company. Earlier, Plexico was 
      director of business development of Chemdex Corporation and prior to 
      that he was national sales manager for Quidel Corporation’s autoimmune & 
      complement division. Plexico earned a bachelor of arts degree in 
      political science from Colgate University.
    

      “Jon brings to Zila’s board of directors a broad perspective, gained as 
      a professional money manager, investment banker and healthcare 
      executive,” said David Bethune, Zila’s chairman and chief executive 
      officer. “As a long-term shareholder of Zila, he supports the company’s

      restructuring over the past year,” said Plexico. “We are strong 
      believers in the company’s oral cancer screening product, ViziLite® 
      Plus, and trust it not only has excellent growth potential but, most 
      importantly, can help save lives. I’m personally delighted to be working 
      with the entire board and management team to help advance this mission.”
