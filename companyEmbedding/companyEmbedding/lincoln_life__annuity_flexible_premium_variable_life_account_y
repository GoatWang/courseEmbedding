Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Assets under management refers to general account investments and separate account assets.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

26% of U.S. adults (18-64) say someone in their household had problems or inability to pay medical bills in the past year.1








Hospital Insurance
A trip to the hospital can be overwhelming. Aflac Hospital Insurance takes the pressure off hospital expenses not covered by major medical, so finances are one less thing you have to worry about.
Aflac Hospital Insurance is available through worksite payroll deduction only.

One Day PaySM †
With Aflac, qualified claims are paid in just a day.







Here's how it works.2
Medical expenses don’t always come from an accident or critical illness; sometimes it starts with a visit to an urgent care clinic because of a sharp pain in your side. While health insurance typically covers some of the expense, you will likely be responsible for a portion of the bill. Aflac Choice helps with those unexpected hospital expenses that may not be covered by health insurance. That way, you may not have to sacrifice your vacation budget for those unexpected medical costs.







Trouble strikes.






You suddenly experience a sharp pain in your side and go to an urgent care clinic, where you’re diagnosed with appendicitis.





You find yourself in the emergency room.






You’re taken by ambulance to the emergency room, where lab tests and diagnostic exams report back that you need surgery right away.





Aflac helps take the sting out.






After a 3-day stay in the hospital you’re feeling much better, but hospital bills add up quickly. Cash benefits are paid directly to you (unless otherwise assigned), which can help ease the financial stress of your illness.





You get your money fast.






Claims made on your Aflac Choice policy are eligible for One Day Pay℠.† Now that's fast.

Disability caused by a Pre-existing Condition or reinjuries to a Pre-existing Condition will not be covered unless it begins more than 12 months after the Effective Date of coverage. Aflac will not pay benefits for a Disability that is being treated outside the territorial limits of the United States. Aflac will not pay benefits whenever coverage provided by the policy is in violation of any U.S. economic or trade sanctions. If the coverage violates U.S. economic or trade sanctions, such coverage shall be null and void. Aflac will not pay benefits whenever fraud is committed in making a claim under this coverage or any prior claim under any other Aflac coverage for which you received benefits that were not lawfully due and that fraudulently induced payment. Aflac will not pay benefits for a Disability that is caused by or occurs as a result of any bacterial, viral, or micro-organism infection or infestation, or any condition resulting from insect, arachnid, or other arthropod bites or stings as a Disability due to an Injury; such disability will be covered to the same extent as a Disability due to Sickness.
Aflac will not pay benefits for a disability that is caused by or occurs as a result of your:

Pregnancy or childbirth within the first ten months of the Effective Date of coverage (Complications of Pregnancy will be covered to the same extent as a Sickness);
Using any drug, narcotic, hallucinogen, or chemical substance (unless administered by a Physician and taken according to the Physician’s instructions), or voluntarily taking any kind of poison or inhaling any kind of gas or fumes;

Participating in, or attempting to participate in, an illegal activity that is defined as a felony (“felony” is as defined by the law of the jurisdiction in which the activity takes place); or being incarcerated in any detention facility or penal institution;

The policy will pay, however, for covered disabilities resulting from Alzheimer’s disease, or similar forms of senility or senile dementia, first manifested while coverage is in force.

Benefits will be paid for only one Disability at a time, even if the Disability is caused by more than one Sickness, more than one Injury, or a Sickness and an Injury.
PRE-EXISTING CONDITION LIMITATIONS: A “Pre-existing Condition” is an illness, disease, infection, disorder, condition or injury for which, within the 12-month period before the Effective Date of coverage, medical advice, consultation, or treatment was recommended or received, or for which symptoms existed that would ordinarily cause a prudent person to seek diagnosis, care, or treatment. Disability caused by a Pre-existing Condition or reinjuries to a Pre-existing Condition, including deliveries for children conceived prior to the Effective Date of coverage, will not be covered unless it begins more than 12 months after the Effective Date of coverage.
Limitations and Exclusions for residents of Idaho: 
Disability caused by a Pre-existing Condition will not be covered unless it begins more than 12 months after the Effective Date of coverage.

Having dental treatment, except as a result of Injury;

          3. This is a deferred variable annuity; investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will actuate depending on market performance.
	
    

          4. Clients are eligible for an annual fee of 0.10% if (1) the contract is purchased with an initial purchase payment of $1,000,000 or more on or after September 7, 2010, or (2) the contract value has accumulated to $1,000,000 or more on or after September 7, 2010, and at that time we are offering the contract to new applicants for 0.10%. See prospectus for additional details.
	
    

          5. Certain funds transferred or withdrawn in less than 60 days of purchase will be assessed a 1% fee, which is retained by the funds. See individual fund prospectus for additional details.
	
    

          6. Some deferred fixed annuities have a market value adjustment (MVA), which generally applies if a client surrenders the contract or withdraws funds in excess of the free withdrawal amount before the end of the guarantee period. The amount the client receives will be adjusted based on interest rate conditions at that time.
	
    

          7.
	
	
	       Deferred Income Annuity contracts are irrevocable, have no cash surrender value and no withdrawals are permitted prior to the income start date.

			Annuities can be used to help you increase your savings, protect what you've saved, or generate a stream of income.

Have Us Call You








Annuities generally fall into two categories: deferred and income. Each works differently and offers unique advantages.
 Tax-deferred annuities: for retirement savings 
Deferred annuities can be a good way to boost your retirement savings once you've made the maximum allowable contributions to your 401(k) or IRA.1 Like any tax-deferred investment, earnings compound over time, providing growth opportunities that taxable accounts lack.
Deferred annuities have no IRS contribution limits,2 so you can invest as much as you want for retirement. You can also use your savings to create a guaranteed3 stream of income for retirement. Depending on how annuities are funded, they may not have minimum required distributions (MRDs).
Bear in mind that withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax, and, if taken before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty. Annuities also come with annual charges not found in mutual funds, which will affect your returns.
Deferred variable annuities have funds that may have the potential for investment growth. However, this can involve some market risk and could result in losses if the value of the underlying investments falls. Variable annuities are usually appropriate for those with longer time horizons or those who are better able to handle market fluctuations. Some variable annuities allow you to protect your investment against loss, while still participating in potential market growth.
Deferred fixed annuities offer a guaranteed3 rate of return for a number of years. Fixed deferred annuities may be more suitable for conservative investors or for those interested in protecting assets from market volatility. In this way, they’re similar to certificates of deposit (CDs).
However, deferred fixed annuities differ from CDs in that:

Annuities are not FDIC-insured.
Withdrawals from annuities prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty.
Deferred fixed annuities may offer more access to assets than a CD.
Annuity earnings compound on a tax-deferred basis.

 Income annuities: for income in retirement 
Income annuities may be appropriate for investors in or near retirement because they offer guaranteed3 income for life or a set period of time. They may allow you to be more aggressive with other investments in your portfolio, since they provide a lifetime income stream.
Keep in mind that you may have limited or no access to the assets used to purchase income annuities.
Immediate fixed income annuities offer a guaranteed,3 predictable payment for life, or for a certain period of time. Your guaranteed income payment cannot be affected by market volatility, helping shield your retirement income from market risk.
A cost-of-living increase is available at an additional cost to help your buying power keep pace with inflation.
Deferred income annuities4 are fixed income annuities that have a deferral period before income payments start. Because of the deferral period, you may get a higher income payment amount than you would from a comparable immediate fixed income annuity with the same initial investment. The cost-of-living increase is also available at an additional cost for deferred income annuities.

          1. Each individual's situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested. Although variable annuities offer tax-deferral, if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the variable annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantages, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration.
	
    

          2. Insurance companies reserve the right to limit contributions.
	
    

          3. Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims-paying ability and financial strength.


          4. Deferred Income Annuity contracts are irrevocable, have no cash surrender value and no withdrawals are permitted prior to the income start date.


Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss—investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.


Fidelity insurance products are issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (FILI), 100 Salem Street, Smithfield, RI 02917, and in New York, by Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company,® New York, N.Y. FILI is licensed in all states except New York. Other insurance products available at Fidelity are issued by third party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. A contract's financial guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.


Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Call or write to Fidelity or visit Fidelity.com for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Please read the prospectus and consider this information carefully before investing. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

 Lincoln Life & Annuity Variable Annuity Account H
 American Legacy III

Supplement dated September 1, 2005
 to the Prospectus dated May 1, 2005

Please keep this Supplement with your current American Legacy III Prospectus and
retain it for reference. This Supplement replaces the discussion currently in   
your prospectus regarding the death benefits available under i4LIFE(R)          
Advantage. No action is required on your part unless you wish to elect the      
i4LIFE(R) Advantage.                                                            

Effective on or about September 1, 2005 (depending on state availability), the  
i4LIFE(R) Advantage Guarantee of Principal death benefit will be available to   
owners of both qualified (IRA and Roth IRA) and non-qualified contracts who     
elect i4LIFE(R) Advantage. The i4LIFE(R) Advantage Guarantee of Principal death 
benefit option is not available to existing contractowners if the Account Value 
death benefit was in force prior to electing i4LIFE(R) Advantage. The i4LIFE(R) 
Advantage Enhanced Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit (EGMDB) is available to     
existing contractowners only if the EGMDB (or more expensive death benefit '    
option) was in force prior to electing i4LIFE(R) Advantage.                     

Once i4LIFE(R) Advantage begins, any prior death benefit election will          
terminate. The death benefit proceeds under the new death benefit may be less   
than the amount that would have been paid under the death benefit in effect     
before i4LIFE(R) Advantage began. The death benefit options described in this   
supplement are only available during the Access Period.                         

Effective Date                                                                  

If the benefit is elected after the contract is issued (by sending a            
written request to our home office), the benefit will be effective on the next  
valuation date following approval by us.                                        

Charges                                                                         

If you elect i4LIFE(R) Advantage, your Separate Account Annual Expenses (as a   
percentage of average daily net assets in the subaccounts) will be:

For a complete listing of charges, see Expense tables in the prospectus.        

i4LIFE(R) Advantage Account Value death benefit. The i4LIFE(R)Advantage Account 
Value death benefit is available for both qualified and non-qualified annuity   
contracts. This benefit is equal to the Account Value as of the valuation date  
on which we approve the payment of the death claim. The charge under this death 
benefit is equal to an annual rate of 1.65% (or 2.15% if the Guaranteed Income  
Benefit is elected) of the net asset value of the Account Value in the VAA. You 
may not change this death benefit once it is elected.                           

i4LIFE(R) Advantage Guarantee of Principal death benefit. The i4LIFE(R)         
Advantage Guarantee of Principal death benefit is available for both qualified  
and non-qualified contracts. This benefit will be equal to the greater of:      

o the Account Value as of the valuation date we approve the payment of the      
claim; or                                                                   
o the sum of all purchase payments, minus all death benefit reductions          
where:                                                                      
   o   each death benefit reduction of purchase payments for a regular
          income payment will be for the dollar amount of the regular income
payment; and                                            
   o   each death benefit reduction of purchase payments for all other
            withdrawals will be deducted in the same proportion that withdrawals
reduce the contract or Account value.                   

In a declining market, withdrawals deducted in the same proportion that         
withdrawals reduce the contract or Account Value may have a magnified effect on 
the reduction of the death benefit payable. All references to withdrawals       
include deductions for applicable charges and premium taxes, if any.            

The charge under this death benefit is equal to an annual rate of 1.70% (or     
2.20% if the Guaranteed Income Benefit is elected) of the net asset value of the
Account Value in the VAA.                                                       

During the Access Period, contracts with the i4LIFE(R)Advantage Guarantee of    
Principal death benefit may elect to change to the i4LIFE(R) Advantage Account  
Value death benefit. We will effect the change in death benefit on the valuation
date we receive a completed election form at our Home office, and we will begin 
deducting the lower i4LIFE(R) Advantage charge at that time. Once the change is 
effective, you may not elect to return to the i4LIFE(R) Advantage Guarantee of  
Principal death benefit.                                                        

i4LIFE(R) Advantage EGMDB. If you own a non-qualified annuity contract, you may 
also elect the i4LIFE(R) Advantage EGMDB. (This benefit is not available with   
qualified contracts.) The benefit is the greatest of:                           
o        the Account Value as of the valuation date on which we approve the     
payment of the claim; or                                      
o        the sum of all purchase payments, minus all death benefit reductions   
where                                                   
   o   each death benefit reduction of purchase payments for a regular
          income payment will be for the dollar amount of the regular income
payment; and                                            
   o   each death benefit reduction of purchase payments for all other
withdrawals will be deducted in the same proportion that
withdrawals reduce the contract or Account value; or    
o        the highest Account Value or contract value which the contract attains 
 on any contract anniversary date (including the inception date)
    (determined before the allocation of any purchase payments on that
       contract anniversary) prior to the 81st birthday of the deceased. The
  highest Account Value or contract value is increased by purchase
      payments and is decreased by regular income payments and withdrawals
       subsequent to the anniversary date on which the highest Account Value
        or contract value is obtained. Regular income payments and withdrawals
      are deducted in the same proportion that regular income payments and
withdrawals reduce the Account Value.                         

In a declining market, withdrawals deducted in the same proportion that         
withdrawals reduce the Account Value may have a magnified effect on the         
reduction of the death benefit payable. All references to withdrawals include   
deductions for applicable charges and premium taxes, if any.                    

Upon the death of any contractowner or joint owner who was not a contractowner  
on the effective date of the i4LIFE(R) Advantage EGMDB death benefit, the death 
benefit will be equal to the Account Value as of the date we approve the death  
claim for payment (unless the change occurred because of the death of a         
contractowner or joint owner). If any contractowner or joint owner is changed   
due to a death and the new contractowner or joint owner is age 81 or older when 
added to the contract, then the death benefit for this new contractowner or     
joint owner will be equal to the Account Value as of the date we approve the    
death claim subsequent to the new contractowner's death.                        

The charge under this death benefit is equal to an annual rate of 1.95% (or     
2.45% if the Guaranteed Income Benefit is elected) of the net asset value of the
Account Value in the VAA.                                                       

During the Access Period, contracts with the i4LIFE(R)Advantage EGMDB may elect 
to change to the i4LIFE(R) Advantage Guarantee of Principal death benefit or    
Account Value death benefit. We will effect the change in death benefit on the  
valuation date we receive a completed election form at our Home office, and we  
will begin deducting the lower i4LIFE(R) Advantage charge at that time. Once the
change is effective, you may not elect to return to the i4LIFE(R) Advantage     
EGMDB.                                                                          

General Provisions                                                              

For non-qualified contracts, upon the death of the contractowner, joint owner or
annuitant, the contractowner (or beneficiary) may elect to terminate the        
contract and receive full payment of the death benefit or may elect to continue 
the contract and receive regular income payments. Upon the death of the         
secondary life, no death benefit is paid.                                       

If you are the owner of an IRA annuity contract, and you die during the Access  
Period, the i4LIFE(R) Advantage will terminate. A spouse beneficiary may start a
new i4LIFE(R) Advantage program.                                                

The value of the death benefit will be determined as of the valuation date we   
approve the payment of the claim. Approval of payment will occur upon our       
receipt of all the following:                                                   

     1. proof (e.g. an original certified death certificate), or any other
proof of death satisfactory to us; and                    
2. written authorization for payment; and                       
      3. all required claim forms, fully completed (including selection of a
settlement option).                                       

Notwithstanding any provision of this contract to the contrary, the             
payment of death benefits provided under this contract must be made in          
compliance with Code Section 74(s) or 401(a)(9) as applicable, as amended from  
time to time. Death benefits may be taxable. See Federal tax matters in the     
prospectus.                                                                     

If the contract is continued, upon notification to Lincoln Life of the death,   
regular income payments may be suspended until the death claim is approved. Upon
approval, a lump sum payment for the value of any suspended payments will be    
made as of the date the death claim is approved, and regular income payments    
will continue. The excess, if any, of the death benefit over the Account Value  
will be credited into the contract at that time.                                

If a lump sum settlement is elected, the proceeds will be mailed within seven   
days of approval by us of the claim subject to the laws, regulations and tax    
code governing payment of death benefits. This payment may be postponed as      
permitted by the Investment Company Act of 1940.                                

For both qualified and non-qualified contracts, following the Access Period,    
there is no death benefit.

Supplement to the Prospectus Dated May 1, 2005

This supplement describes two new features that are applicable to your variable 
annuity. No action is required on your part. Please refer to your product       
prospectus if you need further information on additional features of your       
annuity.                                                                        

The contracts - Surrenders and withdrawals. Beginning October 15, 2005, all     
surrender requests must be submitted on the Lincoln Life Surrender Form         
available from the Home Office. This form can be obtained by calling the        
toll-free customer service number listed in your prospectus, or by logging into 
your account at www.lfg.com.                                                    

The contracts - SecureLine(R) Account                                           

The SecureLine(R) account is a special service that we offer in which your death
benefit or surrender proceeds are placed into an interest-bearing account.      
Instead of mailing you (or the recipient of the death proceeds) a check, we will
send a checkbook so that you (or the death proceeds recipient) will have access 
to the account simply by writing a check for all or any part of the proceeds.   
The SecureLine(R) account is part of our general account. It is not a bank      
account and it is not insured by the FDIC or any other government agency. As    
part of our general account, it is subject to the claims of our creditors. We   
receive a benefit from all amounts left in the SecureLine(R) account.           

If you request a lump sum surrender and your surrender value is over $10,000,   
your money will be placed into the account in your name. You are the owner of   
the account, and are the only one authorized to transfer proceeds from the      
account. You may choose to leave the proceeds in this account, or you may begin 
writing checks immediately.                                                     

In the case of a death of one of the parties to the annuity contract, if the    
recipient of the death benefit has elected a lump sum settlement and the        
contract value is over $10,000, the proceeds will be placed into the            
interest-bearing account in the recipient's name as the owner of the account.   
The SecureLine(R) account allows the recipient additional time to decide how    
to manage death benefit proceeds with the balance earning interest from the day 
the account is opened.

Item 28. Indemnification                                                        

(a) Brief description of indemnification provisions.                  

  In general, Article VII of the By-Laws of Lincoln Life & Annuity Company
   of New York provides that Lincoln New York will indemnify certain persons
   against expenses, judgments and certain other specified costs incurred by
 any such person if he/she is made a party or is threatened to be made a
  party to a suit or proceeding because he/she was a director, officer, or
    employee of Lincoln New York, as long as he/she acted in good faith and in
    a manner he/she reasonably believed to be in the best interests of, or act
opposed to the best interests of, Lincoln New York. Certain additional
conditions apply to indemnification in criminal proceedings.          

 In particular, separate conditions govern indemnification of directors,
  officers, and employees of Lincoln New York in connection with suits by,
or in the right of, Lincoln New York.                                 

 Please refer to Article VII of the By-Laws of Lincoln New York (Exhibit
no. 6 hereto) for the full text of the indemnification provisions.    
 Indemnification is permitted by, and is subject to the requirements of,
New York law.                                                         

   (b) Undertaking pursuant to Rule 484 of Regulation C under the Securities
Act of 1933:                                                        

 Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities
Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling   
persons of the Registrant pursuant to the provisions described in Item
28(a) above or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the 
   opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is
against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore,      
   unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such
    liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred
    or paid by a director, officer, or controlling person of the Registrant in
    the successful defense of any such action, suit or proceeding) is asserted
by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the
    securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of
  its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit
to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such      
    indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and
will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.             

Item 29. Principal Underwriter

Lincoln Annuities
	Lincoln Financial Group (the marketing name for Lincoln National Corporation) is a full-service financial company offering insurance, investment and fund management services. Its headquarters are in Radnor, PA. It offers annuities through its affiliates, the Lincoln National Life Insurance Company and the Lincoln Life & Annuity of New York, which rank near the top in sales of variable annuities. The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company is one of the largest and most successful life-insurance companies in the U.S. The Life Insurance Market Research Association’s (LIMRA) annual survey declared it #1 in life insurance sales for 2007.

	In the third quarter of 2006, DALBAR ranked the Lincoln Financial Group Web site #2 in its quarterly ranking of customer-friendly Web sites. In 2005, the company ranked among the 100 best companies for working mothers for the 19th time in the previous 20 years, according to Working Mother magazine.

	History

	The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company began operations on June 11, 1905, in Fort Wayne, IN. Its 33 founding investors chose the name “Lincoln” in honor of President Abraham Lincoln, to denote dependability and honesty. Robert Todd Lincoln, the President’s only surviving son, gave permission for his father’s name and likeness to be used by the company. In 1931, the company started the Lincoln Historical Research Foundation. The Foundation opened a museum containing Lincoln artifacts, documents and memorabilia in Fort Wayne in 1931. The museum still exists.

	The company grew rapidly. By 1911, it had $6.5 million in life insurance in force. Between 1914 and 1940, it added an additional $250 million. Its growth rate between 1905 and 1955 was the largest of any American life-insurance company; by 1955, it was the 9th-largest insurance company in the country. In 1968, Lincoln National Corporation became the first U.S. insurance holding company. In 1973, the company began offering mutual funds and investment-advisory services.

	After 1990, Lincoln Financial Group dropped its property and casualty insurance lines and reinsurance operations. In 1995, it acquired the prestigious Delaware Investments to beef up its investment operation. As the century dawned, the holding company purchased the life insurance and annuity operations of CIGNA and Aetna. IN 2006, it merged with Jefferson National Pilot to produce the financial powerhouse of today.

	Lincoln Annuities

	Lincoln annuities include fixed, indexed, immediate and variable annuities. Its fixed-annuity product is a single-premium deferred annuity. Its three indexed fixed annuities include both single-premium and flexible-premium products. Its two immediate annuities, both single-premium products, include an inflation-indexed annuity. Lincoln Financial Group produces two suites of variable annuities, each containing 10 distinct variable-annuity products. (The company’s New York affiliate offers annuity products modeled on the foregoing, but with terms modified in accordance with New York law.)

	In 2008, the Morningstar Annuity Research Center ranked the company #1 in non-captive sales of variable annuities for the first half of the year. (Non-captive sales are executed by independent agents who are not bound exclusively to the products of one insurance company.)

	Financial-Strength Ratings of Companies Issuing Lincoln AnnuitiesThe four major ratings services rate the financial strength of Lincoln National Life Insurance Company and the Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York. According to the company Web site, those ratings are as follows:


		A.M. Best: A+ (2nd-highest of 16 categories)

		Standard & Poor’s: AA- (4th-highest of 21)

		Moody’s: A2 (6th-highest of 21)

		Fitch: A+ (5th-highest of 21)


	News

	On July 10, 2009, Lincoln Financial Group announced the successful completion of its $2.1 billion capital-acquisition program. The money was raised by issuing common and preferred stock and taking on debt. The group contributed $1 billion to the capital base of the Lincoln National Life Insurance Company. $950 million was obtained by issuing preferred stock to the federal government as part of the U.S. Treasury’s Capital Purchase program, which is designed to promote economic growth.

	On June 25, 2009, the Federal District Court upheld a jury verdict on favor of Lincoln Financial Group in its patent-infringement suit against Transamerica Life Insurance Company. The suit involved the use of a computerized system for administering variable annuity accounts - specifically, those accounts containing products that offered guaranteed minimum payments combined with systematic withdrawal programs.

Contracts, one

Fund for each Subaccount (the "Subaccount"); and                                

  WHEREAS, CRMC, by virtue of an Investment Advisory and Service Agreement
between CRMC and the Series, will serve as the investment adviser to the Series,
as the term "investment adviser" is defined in the 1940 Act.                    

  NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of mutual covenants
and conditions set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration,  
the Company, the Account, the Series and CRMC hereby agree as follows:          

1.     The Series and CRMC each represents and warrants to the Company
that:                                                                           
          (i) a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 (the
"1933 Act") and under the 1940 Act with respect to the Series has been
 filed with the SEC in the form previously delivered to the Company, and
   copies of any and all amendments thereto will be forwarded to the Company
at the time that they are filed with the SEC;                         

          (ii) the Series is, and shall be at all times while this Agreement
   is in force, lawfully organized, validly existing, and properly qualified
as an open-end management investment company; and                     

          (iii) the Series registration statement and any further amendments
     or supplements thereto (the "Prospectus") will, when they become effective,
  conform in all material respects to the requirements of the 1933 Act and
     the 1940 Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and will
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the  
statement therein not misleading; provided, however, that this        
    representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions
made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in 
writing to the Series by the Company expressly for use therein;       

     (iv) the Series currently qualifies as a Regulated Investment
     Company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
    (the "Code") and that it will make every effort to continue to qualify and
to maintain such qualification (under Subchapter M or any successor or
  similar provision), and that it will notify the Company immediately upon
     having a reasonable basis for believing that it has ceased to so qualify or
that it might not so qualify in the future; and                       

           (v) the Series will comply with Section 817(h) of the Code, and all
regulations issued thereunder.                                        

2.     The Company represents and warrants that:                      
         (i) the Contracts are registered under the 1933 Act or will be so
registered before the issuance thereof, unless exempt;                

       (ii) the Contracts will be issued in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable federal and state laws;                  

P-->EX-99.8.K3rd�Page�of�16TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�3rd
          (iii) it has registered or will register, prior to the issuance of
   any Contracts, each Account (unless exempt) as a unit investment trust in
accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act;                       

            (iv) the Contracts are currently and at the time of issuance will be
treated as annuity contracts or life insurance policies, under the    
   applicable provisions of the Code. The Company shall make every effort to
     maintain such treatment and shall notify the Series immediately upon having
  a reasonable basis for believing that the Contracts have ceased to be so
treated;                                                              

      (v) any information furnished in writing by the Company to the
    Series for use in the registration statement of the Series will not result
     in the registration statement's failing to conform in all material respects
to the requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act and the rules and
     regulations thereunder, nor will contain any untrue statement of a material
fact nor will omit a material fact required to be stated therein or   
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and          

         (vi) The Company and its affiliates shall make no representations
  concerning the Series' shares except those contained in the then current
prospectus of the Series, and in such printed information subsequently
issued on behalf of the Series or other funds managed by CRMC as      
 supplemental to the appropriate Prospectus, or in materials approved by
American Funds Distributors, Inc. ("AFD") as provided in the Business 
 Agreement in effect among the Company, AFD and CRMC dated as of July 1,
2003.                                                                 

     3.     The Series will furnish to the Company such information with respect
to the Series in such form and signed by such of its officers as the Company may
reasonably request, and will warrant that the statements therein contained when 
so signed will be true and correct. The Series will advise the Company          
immediately of: (a) any request by the SEC (i) for amendment of the registration
statement relating to the Series or (ii) for additional information; (b) the    
issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the       
registration statement of the Series or the initiation of any proceeding for    
that purpose; (c) the institution of any proceeding, investigation or hearing   
involving the offer or sale of the Contracts or the Series of which it becomes  
aware; or (d) the happening of any material event, if known, which makes untrue 
any statement made in the registration statement of the Series or which requires
the making of a change therein in order to make any statement made therein not  
misleading.                                                                     

     4.     The Series will use best efforts to register for sale under the 1933
Act and, if required, under state securities laws, such additional shares of the
Series as may reasonably be necessary for use as the funding vehicle for the    
Contracts.                                                                      

     5.     The Series has made and agrees to make Class 1 and Class 2 shares of
the Funds available to the Contracts. To the extent the Company uses Class 2    
shares, it or an affiliate will be entitled to receive a fee from the Series, to
be accrued daily and paid monthly in arrears, of 0.25% per annum of Class 2     
assets attributable to the Contracts for personal services and account          
maintenance services for Contract owners for as long as the Series' Rule 12b-1  
plan remains in effect.                                                         

P-->EX-99.8.K4th�Page�of�16TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�4th
     6.     Fund shares to be made available to Accounts for the Contracts shall
be sold by the Series and purchased by the Company for a given Account at the   
net asset value (without the imposition of a sales load) next computed after    
receipt of each order by the Series or its designee, as established in          
accordance with the provisions of the then current Prospectus of the Series. For
purposes of this Paragraph 6, the Company shall be a designee of the Series for 
receipt of such orders from each Account, and receipt by such designee by 4:00  
p.m. New York time (or such other time as the Board of Trustees of the Series   
shall designate) shall constitute receipt by the Series, provided that the      
Series receives notice of such order by 10:00 a.m. New York time on the         
following business day ("Next Business Day"). "Business Day" shall mean any day 
on which the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") is open for trading and on which  
the Series calculates the net asset values of each class of shares of each Fund 
pursuant to the rules of the SEC. The Series will make the shares of each class 
available indefinitely for purchase at the applicable net asset value per share 
on those days on which the Series calculates its net asset value pursuant to the
rules of the SEC, and the Series shall use its best efforts to calculate such   
net asset value on each day on which the NYSE is open for trading. The Series   
shall make the net asset value per share for each class of each of the Funds    
available to the Company (using a mutually agreed upon format) on a daily basis 
as soon as reasonably practical after the Series calculates such net asset      
values per share, and the Series shall use its best efforts to make such net    
asset values per share available by 6:00 p.m. New York time. The Series will    
notify the Company if the Series cannot communicate the net asset value per     
share by 6:00 p.m. New York time. Any material errors in the calculation of the 
net asset value shall be reported immediately upon discovery to the Company. The
Series and its investment adviser are responsible for maintaining net asset     
values for the Funds in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act and its
current Prospectus. Shares of particular Funds shall be ordered in such         
quantities and at such times as determined by the Company to be necessary to    
meet the requirements of the Contracts. The Company will pay for shares on the  
same day the Series receives notice of the purchase request. Payment for shares 
purchased shall be made to the Series in federal funds initiated by wire by 2:00
p.m. New York time, to be received by the close of business, as long as the     
banking system is open for business. If the banking system is closed, payment   
will be transmitted the next day that the banking system is open for business.  
If payment is not received by the Series on such Business Day, the Company      
shall, upon the Series' request, promptly reimburse the Series for any charges, 
costs, fees, interest or other expenses incurred in connection with any         
advances, borrowing, or overdrafts. The Series will confirm receipt of each     
trade (ending share balance by the Account and the Fund) (using a mutually      
agreed upon format) by 1:00 p.m. New York time on the Business Day the trade is 
placed with the Series.                                                         

    The Series reserves the right to temporarily suspend sales if the Board of
Trustees of the Series deems it appropriate and in the best interests of the    
Series or in response to the order of an appropriate regulatory authority.      

   7.     The Company shall use its best efforts and shall cooperate, to the
extent permitted under its Contracts, with the Series to enforce policies stated
in the Series' Prospectus regarding transactions in shares, particularly those  
related to market timing. The Company acknowledges that the Series has the right
to refuse any purchase order for any reason, particularly if the Series         
determines that a Fund would be unable to invest the money effectively in       
accordance with its investment policies or would be otherwise adversely affected
due to the size of the transaction,                                             

P-->EX-99.8.K5th�Page�of�16TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�5th
frequency of trading by the Account or other factors.                           

8.     The Contracts funded through each Account will provide for the 
allocation of net amounts among certain Subaccounts for investment in such      
shares of the Funds as may be offered from time to time in the Contracts. The   
selection of the particular Subaccount is to be made by the Contract owner and  
such selection may be changed in accordance with the terms of the Contracts.    

    9.     Transfer of the Series' shares will be by book entry only. No stock
certificates will be issued to the Account. Shares ordered from a particular    
Fund will be recorded by the Series as instructed by the Company in an          
appropriate title for the corresponding Account or subaccount.                  

 10.    The Series shall furnish notice promptly to the Company (using a
mutually agreed upon format) of any dividend or distribution payable on any     
shares underlying Subaccounts. The Company hereby elects to receive all such    
dividends and distributions as are payable on shares of a Fund recorded in the  
title for the corresponding Subaccount in additional shares of that Fund. The   
Series shall notify the Company of the number of shares so issued. The Company  
reserves the right to revoke this election and to receive all such income       
dividends and capital gain distributions in cash. Any material errors in the    
calculation of the dividends or distributions shall be reported immediately upon
discovery to the Company.                                                       

   11.    The Series shall redeem its shares in accordance with the terms of
its then current prospectus. For purposes of this Paragraph 11, the Company     
shall be a designee of the Series for receipt of requests for redemption from   
each Account, and receipt by such designee by 4:00 p.m. New York time (or such  
other time as the Board of Trustees of the Series shall designate) shall        
constitute receipt by the Series; provided that the Series receives notice of   
such request for redemption by 10:00 a.m. New York time on the Next Business    
Day. The Company shall purchase and redeem the shares of Funds offered by the   
then current Prospectus of the Series in accordance with the provisions of such 
Prospectus. The Series agrees to redeem, upon the Company's request, any full or
fractional shares of the designated portfolio held by the Company. The Series   
will pay for shares on the same day the Series receives notice from Company for 
the redemption request. Payment for shares shall be made to the Company in      
federal funds initiated by wire by 2:00 p.m. New York time, to be received by   
the close of business, as long as the banking system is open for business. If   
the banking system is closed, payment will be transmitted the next day that the 
banking system is open for business. If payment is not received by the Company  
on such Business Day, the Series shall, upon the Company's request, promptly    
reimburse the Company for any charges, costs, fees, interest or other expenses  
incurred in connection with any advances, borrowing, or overdrafts. The Series  
will confirm receipt of each trade (ending share balance by the Account and the 
Fund) (using a mutually agreed upon format) by 1:00 p.m. New York time on the   
Business Day the trade is placed with the Series.                               

12.    The Series shall pay all expenses incidental to its performance
under this Agreement. The Series shall see to it that all of its shares are     
registered and authorized for issue in accordance with applicable federal and   
state laws prior to their purchase for the Accounts. The Series shall bear the  
expenses for the cost of registration of its shares, preparation of prospectuses
(and supplements thereto) and statements of additional information (and         

P-->EX-99.8.K6th�Page�of�16TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�6th
supplements thereto) to be sent to existing Contract owners (upon request in the
case of the statement of additional information), proxy statements and related  
materials, and annual and semi-annual shareholder reports, the printing and     
distribution of such items to each Contract owner who has allocated net amounts 
to any Subaccount, the preparation of all statements and notices required from  
it by any federal or state law, and taxes on the issue or transfer of the       
Series' shares subject to this Agreement. The Series will provide to the        
Company, at least once a year, with enough copies of its statement of additional
information to be able to distribute one to each Contract owner or prospective  
Contract owner who requests such statement of additional information.           

 13.    The Company shall bear the expenses for the cost of printing and
distribution of Series prospectuses (and supplements thereto) and statements of 
additional information (and supplements thereto) to be sent to prospective      
Contract owners. The Series shall provide, at its expense, such documentation   
(in camera ready or other mutually agreeable form) and other assistance as is   
reasonably necessary in order for the Company once each year (or more frequently
if the prospectus for the Series is amended) to have the prospectus or          
prospectuses for the Contracts and the Series prospectus printed together in one
or more documents. With respect to any Series prospectus that is printed in     
combination with any one or more Contract prospectus (the "Prospectus Booklet"),
the Series shall bear the costs of printing and mailing the Prospectus Booklet  
to existing Contract owners based on the ratio of the number of pages of the    
Series prospectuses included in the Prospectus Booklet to the number of pages in
the Prospectus Booklet as a whole. With respect to any Series annual and        
semi-annual shareholder report that is printed in combination with any one or   
more such reports of investment options for the Contracts (the "Report          
Booklet"), the Series shall bear the costs of printing and mailing the Report   
Booklet to existing Contract owners based on the ratio of the number of pages of
the Series report included in the Report Booklet to the number of pages in the  
Report Booklet as a whole.                                                      

    14.    Shares of the Series may be offered to separate accounts of various
insurance companies in addition to the Company. The Series shall comply with the
provisions of Section 817 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended and   
the regulations thereunder ("Section 817"). No shares will be sold to the       
general public.                                                                 

   15.    The parties to this Agreement recognize that due to differences in
tax treatment or other considerations, the interests of various Contract owners 
participating in one or more Funds might, at some time, be in conflict. Each    
party shall report to the other party any potential or existing conflict of     
which it becomes aware. The Board of Trustees of the Series shall promptly      
notify the Company of the existence of irreconcilable material conflict and its 
implications. If such a conflict exists for which the Company is responsible as 
determined by the Board of Trustees, the Company will, at its own expense, take 
whatever action it deems necessary to remedy such conflict; in any case,        
Contract owners will not be required to bear such expenses.                     

     16.    The Company agrees to indemnify and hold the Series and CRMC and any
officer, trustee, director, employee or agent of the foregoing, harmless against
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities or litigation (including       
reasonable legal and other expenses) to which they may be subject under any     
statute, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages,   
liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) or settlements arising  
as a result of the Company: (a) making untrue statements of material facts or   
omitting material facts                                                         

P-->EX-99.8.K7th�Page�of�16TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�7th
in the registration statement, prospectus or sales literature of the Contracts  
and/or Accounts; (b) making untrue statements of material facts that the Series 
includes in its materials, provided the Series relies on information supplied by
the Company; (c) engaging in unlawful conduct with respect to the sale of the   
Contracts or Fund shares; and (d) materially breaching this Agreement or a      
representation or warranty.                                                     

    No party shall be entitled to indemnification if such loss, claim, damage,
liability or expense is due to the willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross        
negligence or reckless disregard of duty by the party seeking indemnification.  

  17.    The Series and CRMC each agrees to indemnify and hold the Company
and any officer, trustee, director, employee or agent of the foregoing, harmless
against, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities or litigation         
(including reasonable legal and other expenses) to which the Company may be     
subject under any statute, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses,  
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) or     
settlements arising as a result of the Series' or CRMC's (a) making untrue      
statements of material facts or omitting material facts in the registration     
statement, prospectus or sales literature of the Series; (b) making untrue      
statements of material facts that the Company includes in its materials,        
provided the Company relies on information supplied by or on behalf of the      
Series; (c) engaging in unlawful conduct with respect to the sale of the        
Contracts or Fund shares; (d) materially breaching this Agreement or a          
representation or warranty; and (e) failing to comply with the requirements of  
Section 817 and regulations thereunder.                                         

    No party shall be entitled to indemnification if such loss, claim, damage,
liability or expense is due to the willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross        
negligence or reckless disregard of duty by the party seeking indemnification.  

18.    The Company shall be responsible for assuring that the Accounts
provide pass-through voting privileges to Contract owners so long as and to the 
extent that the SEC continues to interpret the 1940 Act to require pass-through 
voting privileges for the Contracts.                                            

    19.    The parties understand that there is no intention to create a joint
venture in the subject matter of this Agreement. Accordingly, the right to      
terminate this Agreement and to engage in any activity not inconsistent with    
this Agreement is absolute. This Agreement will terminate:                      

         (i)   by any party at any time upon six months' written notice to
the other parties;                                      

        (ii)  at the option of the Company, CRMC or the Series, upon ten
      calendar days' prior written notice to the other parties, if a
           final non-appealable administrative or judicial decision is entered
  against any other party which has a material impact on the
Contracts;                                              

         (iii) at the option of the Company, upon ten calendar days' prior
            written notice to the other parties, if shares of the Series are not
reasonably available;                                   

P-->EX-99.8.K8th�Page�of�16TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�8th
           (iv)  at the option of the Company, immediately upon written notice
     to the other parties, if the Series or CRMC fails to meet the
    requirements for either diversification under Section 817 or
          registered investment company status or if the Board of the Series
          terminates the Class 2 Plan of Distribution pursuant to Rule 12b-1
under the 1940 Act;                                     

 (v)   immediately in the event the Series' shares are not
      registered, issued or sold in accordance with applicable state
       and/or federal law or such law precludes the use of such shares
     as an underlying investment for the Contracts issued or to be
         issued by the Company; in such event prompt notice shall be given
by the Company or the Series to the other parties;      

      (vi)  at the Company's option by written notice to CRMC or the
           Series if Company shall determine in its sole judgment exercised in
          good faith, that either CRMC or the Series has suffered a material
          adverse change in its business, operations, financial condition or
       prospects since the date of this Agreement or is the subject of
material adverse publicity; or                          

          (vii) at CRMC's or the Series' option by written notice to Company
  if CRMC or the Series shall determine in its sole judgment
     exercised in good faith, that Company has suffered a material
          adverse change in its business, operations, financial condition or
       prospects since the date of this Agreement or is the subject of
material adverse publicity.                             

  The effective date for termination pursuant to any notice required under
this Paragraph shall be calculated beginning with the date of receipt of such   
notice to all other parties.                                                    

  20.  All notices, consents, waivers, and other communications under this
Agreement must be in writing, and will be deemed to have been duly received (a) 
when delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt), (b) when sent by 
facsimile (with written confirmation of receipt), provided that a copy is mailed
by registered mail, return receipt requested, or (c) the day after it is sent by

Contracts existing as of the effective date of termination (under the same terms
and conditions as were in effect prior to termination of this Agreement with

satisfaction for the Series for any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or     
litigation in respect of this Agreement, the Company and the Accounts shall also
have recourse against CRMC, which shall be jointly and severally liable for all

   24.  This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the

Participation and Protection: With No Annual Fees




When planning for retirement, you can’t risk everything and you can’t protect everything.
But there is a way to have some of both.










A Shield Annuity from Brighthouse Financial can help you use a portion of your assets to take advantage of market
            growth with a level of downside protection that other options may not provide. Shield is designed to provide
            some protection in an unpredictable endeavor — investing.





Protect your retirement assets
A Brighthouse Shield Annuity is designed to provide a level of protection that, when markets inevitably turn volatile,
            ensures your losses are limited.



Participate in growth opportunities
With a Shield Annuity, balance is built-in. This means that even with the protection you enjoy, you can still take
            advantage of growth opportunities in the market up to a certain percentage.



Pay no annual fees
Unlike many financial products, you pay no annual fees with a Shield Annuity.

Annuities




Building a brighter future begins with knowing what you’ll have in retirement. Annuities can help you grow and protect what you’ve saved. They provide guaranteed¹ income for you and your loved ones regardless of market performance. And because one size doesn’t fit all, Brighthouse Financial annuities are flexible enough to meet your unique saving and investing goals.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Brighthouse Financial, an operating segment of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE: MET), announced on March 6, 2017 that it is now offering its suite of life insurance and annuity products under the Brighthouse Financial brand. 
*Data as of March 31, 2017. Assets under management refers to general account investments and separate account assets.

Ratings as of May 2017. Operating entities collectively rated include Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (BLIC), NELICO, and Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY (BLNY); note, Moody’s and Fitch do not rate BLNY.
A.M. Best’s Financial Strength Rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. A Financial Strength Rating is not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and does not address any other risk, including, but not limited to, an insurer’s claims-payment policies or procedures; the ability of the insurer to dispute or deny claims payment on grounds of misrepresentation or fraud; or any specific liability contractually borne by the policy or contract holder. A Financial Strength Rating is not a recommendation to purchase, hold, or terminate any insurance policy, contract or any other financial obligation issued by an insurer, nor does it address the suitability of any particular policy or contract, for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.ambest.com.
Fitch’s Insurer Financial Strength Rating provides an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and contract holder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Ratings explanations can be found at www.fitchratings.com.
Moody’s Insurance Financial Strength Rating is an opinion of the ability of an insurance company to pay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations and also reflect the expected financial loss suffered in the event of default. Specific obligations are considered unrated unless they are individually rated because the standing of a particular insurance obligation would depend on an assessment of its relative standing under those laws governing both the obligation and the insurance company. Ratings explanations can be found at www.moodys.com.
S&P Global Insurer Financial Strength Rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. This opinion is not specific to any particular policy or contract, nor does it address the suitability of a particular policy or contract for a specific purpose or purchaser. Ratings explanations can be found at www.standardandpoors.com.

One Day PaySM †
With Aflac, qualified claims are paid in just a day.







Here's how it works.2
Medical expenses don’t always come from an accident or critical illness; sometimes it starts with a visit to an urgent care clinic because of a sharp pain in your side. While health insurance typically covers some of the expense, you will likely be responsible for a portion of the bill. Aflac Choice helps with those unexpected hospital expenses that may not be covered by health insurance. That way, you may not have to sacrifice your vacation budget for those unexpected medical costs.







Trouble strikes.






You suddenly experience a sharp pain in your side and go to an urgent care clinic, where you’re diagnosed with appendicitis.





You find yourself in the emergency room.






You’re taken by ambulance to the emergency room, where lab tests and diagnostic exams report back that you need surgery right away.





Aflac helps take the sting out.






After a 3-day stay in the hospital you’re feeling much better, but hospital bills add up quickly. Cash benefits are paid directly to you (unless otherwise assigned), which can help ease the financial stress of your illness.





You get your money fast.






Claims made on your Aflac Choice policy are eligible for One Day Pay℠.† Now that's fast.

Answer a few questions to get started



















Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.



          1.
	
	
	       
        
Guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.



          2. Fidelity Personal Retirement Annuity (Policy Form No. DVA-2005, et al.) is issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (FILI), and, for New York residents, Personal Retirement Annuity (Policy Form No. EDVA-2005, et al.) is issued by Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company®, New York, N.Y. FILI is licensed in all states except New York. Fidelity Brokerage Services, Member NYSE, SIPC, and Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc., are the distributors.
	
    

          3. This is a deferred variable annuity; investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will actuate depending on market performance.
	
    

          4. Clients are eligible for an annual fee of 0.10% if (1) the contract is purchased with an initial purchase payment of $1,000,000 or more on or after September 7, 2010, or (2) the contract value has accumulated to $1,000,000 or more on or after September 7, 2010, and at that time we are offering the contract to new applicants for 0.10%. See prospectus for additional details.
	
    

          5. Certain funds transferred or withdrawn in less than 60 days of purchase will be assessed a 1% fee, which is retained by the funds. See individual fund prospectus for additional details.
	
    

          6. Some deferred fixed annuities have a market value adjustment (MVA), which generally applies if a client surrenders the contract or withdraws funds in excess of the free withdrawal amount before the end of the guarantee period. The amount the client receives will be adjusted based on interest rate conditions at that time.
	
    

          7.
	
	
	       Deferred Income Annuity contracts are irrevocable, have no cash surrender value and no withdrawals are permitted prior to the income start date.


          8. Restrictions may apply. Please refer to product materials for additional details.
	
    

          9. Minimum subsequent premium amounts and limitations to when they are allowed prior to income start date may apply.
	
    

          10. Restrictions may apply depending on payment option and/or contract type selected. The new income amount will be determined by the issuing insurance company. Please refer to the product materials for additional details.

After age 59½, an early access withdrawal or any withdrawal (including applicable Market Value Adjustment and surrender charges) that exceeds your GLWB amount will reduce your income guarantees.
	
    

          14. Fixed annuities available at Fidelity are issued by third-party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company.

Annuities Overview

			Annuities can be used to help you increase your savings, protect what you've saved, or generate a stream of income.

Annuities generally fall into two categories: deferred and income. Each works differently and offers unique advantages.
 Tax-deferred annuities: for retirement savings 
Deferred annuities can be a good way to boost your retirement savings once you've made the maximum allowable contributions to your 401(k) or IRA.1 Like any tax-deferred investment, earnings compound over time, providing growth opportunities that taxable accounts lack.
Deferred annuities have no IRS contribution limits,2 so you can invest as much as you want for retirement. You can also use your savings to create a guaranteed3 stream of income for retirement. Depending on how annuities are funded, they may not have minimum required distributions (MRDs).
Bear in mind that withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax, and, if taken before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty. Annuities also come with annual charges not found in mutual funds, which will affect your returns.
Deferred variable annuities have funds that may have the potential for investment growth. However, this can involve some market risk and could result in losses if the value of the underlying investments falls. Variable annuities are usually appropriate for those with longer time horizons or those who are better able to handle market fluctuations. Some variable annuities allow you to protect your investment against loss, while still participating in potential market growth.
Deferred fixed annuities offer a guaranteed3 rate of return for a number of years. Fixed deferred annuities may be more suitable for conservative investors or for those interested in protecting assets from market volatility. In this way, they’re similar to certificates of deposit (CDs).
However, deferred fixed annuities differ from CDs in that:

Annuities are not FDIC-insured.
Withdrawals from annuities prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty.
Deferred fixed annuities may offer more access to assets than a CD.
Annuity earnings compound on a tax-deferred basis.

 Income annuities: for income in retirement 
Income annuities may be appropriate for investors in or near retirement because they offer guaranteed3 income for life or a set period of time. They may allow you to be more aggressive with other investments in your portfolio, since they provide a lifetime income stream.
Keep in mind that you may have limited or no access to the assets used to purchase income annuities.
Immediate fixed income annuities offer a guaranteed,3 predictable payment for life, or for a certain period of time. Your guaranteed income payment cannot be affected by market volatility, helping shield your retirement income from market risk.
A cost-of-living increase is available at an additional cost to help your buying power keep pace with inflation.
Deferred income annuities4 are fixed income annuities that have a deferral period before income payments start. Because of the deferral period, you may get a higher income payment amount than you would from a comparable immediate fixed income annuity with the same initial investment. The cost-of-living increase is also available at an additional cost for deferred income annuities.

          1. Each individual's situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested. Although variable annuities offer tax-deferral, if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the variable annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the variable annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantages, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration.
	
    

          2. Insurance companies reserve the right to limit contributions.
	
    

          3. Guarantees apply to certain insurance and annuity products and are subject to product terms, exclusions and limitations and the insurer's claims-paying ability and financial strength.


          4. Deferred Income Annuity contracts are irrevocable, have no cash surrender value and no withdrawals are permitted prior to the income start date.


Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss—investment returns and contract value are not guaranteed and will fluctuate.


Fidelity insurance products are issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (FILI), 100 Salem Street, Smithfield, RI 02917, and in New York, by Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company,® New York, N.Y. FILI is licensed in all states except New York. Other insurance products available at Fidelity are issued by third party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. A contract's financial guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.


Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its investment options. Call or write to Fidelity or visit Fidelity.com for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Please read the prospectus and consider this information carefully before investing. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

More Information about Annuities





What exactly is an Annuity?

                        An annuity is an investment product that provides safe, tax-deferred growth of your
                        retirement nest egg. Annuities are considered low-risk, and can provide guaranteed, monthly
                        income when
                        you retire. There are many types of annuities with varying features & benefits. These include:
                        fixed,
                        variable, immediate, deferred & hybrid. We strongly suggest you consult with a financial
                        professional to
                        help you understand the various types of annuities before you purchase.
                    








Is an Annuity Right for You?

                        Annuities are NOT a good fit for everyone. Annuities are designed for people looking for
                        guaranteed, monthly income when they retire - they are NOT a high-risk / high-return investment.
                        They are considered to be in the mainstream of conservative retirement planning - over $225
                        billion in annuities have been purchased in the past 12 months alone!
                    








What are your Next Steps?

                        The first thing to do is to see if an annuity fits your specific profile and financial
                        situation. This "fit" is based on the amount of retirement savings you currently have, how old
                        you are, and the State you live in. Simply fill in the information above and our system will
                        generate a free, tailor-made Annuity Report that will include annuity rate quotes from A+ rated
                        companies in your area.

Life‌ Insurance‌ Quotes‌ -‌ Help Your‌ Sense‌ of Security
 


Knowing that no matter what your loved ones will be taken care of is the ultimate sense of security. In the case of the unthinkable, you don't want your loved 
		ones left with not only the grief for the loss, but bills to only make it worse. Life insurance can ensure this doesn't happen.

In Tough Times, Why Spend Money on Life Insurance?
Out of all the major insurance types, life insurance quotes are often one of the lowest priced you will find. If money is tight for your family, imagine how much tighter it would be without you here. It's the responsible thing to do because none of us will live forever.
You Don't Have To Jump Through Hoops For Life Insurance.
You might think obtaining life insurance is inconvenient, but you have many options. You may feel you don't have the time for an exam or physical to be able to get coverage. There are many policies available that require few questions and no exams. Options can be quoted for you by licensed agents and compared at your convenience when you fill out our quick form to get your free life insurance quotes.
Life Insurance Quotes - Protect Your Family

In addition to our tool for comparing health insurance quotes, we also believe that finding the best life insurance rates is a crucial part of your ability to provide for your family no matter what happens. Proper coverage will ensure that they have financial security. Don't leave your loved ones in a financial bind after losing you—ensure their needs are taken care of even after you're gone. Now is the time to consider which type of life insurance will be best for your needs.
Reasons Life Insurance Is Important
For most people, financial difficulties force them to cut back on costs in various areas of life. Often, this can force you to live without the certain luxuries in order to prepare for the future. When you shop around for life insurance quotes online, you can make quote comparisons in order to find a policy that will take care of your family's financial needs. Life insurance is necessary for various expenses and you'll want to understand the many coverage options before you can decide how much coverage you'll need. For example, the death benefit will most likely be used for expenses like funeral costs, outstanding medical bills, education expenses, cost of living, and other financial obligations that will exist after your passing. When gathering information, it's important to realize the many types of coverage available before choosing a specific policy.
Life Insurance Options
Most people assume acquiring life insurance can be a tedious and challenging process. With USInsuranceOnline.com, it is easier than ever before. You'll be able to request quotes for various types of coverage. Find options like short term life insurance, no exam life insurance, term life insurance, and whole life insurance quotes.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
