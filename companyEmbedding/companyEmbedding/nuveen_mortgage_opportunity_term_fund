Objective
To generate attractive total returns through opportunistic investments in mortgage-backed securities (MBS).


Highlights
The fund is designed to offer retail investors:
Opportunity to capitalize on the potential for recovery in the U.S. residential and commercial real estate markets
Access to an opportunistic institutional market strategy seeking attractive total returns by investing at historically attractive prices and yields
Limited 10 year term from inception
Combined closed-end fund expertise of Nuveen Investments and mortgage securities expertise of Wellington Management



Investment Strategy
The fund invests at least 80% of its managed assets in MBS, primarily non-agency residential MBS and commercial MBS. The fund uses leverage, and has a 10-year term and intends to liquidate and distribute its then-current net assets to shareholders on or before November 30, 2019.

			The chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made on the date indicated. Original Investment & Cumulative Distributions is the original investment value added to the cash flow received from distributions. The total returns are not adjusted to reflect the effects of taxation and assume reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.
		

			Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

RISKSInvestment, Market, and Price Risk: Closed-end fund shares are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest.  Common shares frequently trade at a discount to their NAV.  At any point in time, your common shares may be worth less than you paid, even after considering the reinvestment of fund distributions.Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) Risk: Investing in MBS entails various risks, including credit risks inherent in the underlying collateral, the risk that the servicer fails to perform its duties, liquidity risks, interest rate risks, structure risks, and geographical concentration risks.Credit Risk: Debt or preferred securities held by the fund may fail to make dividend or interest payments when due.  Investments in securities below investment grade credit quality are predominantly speculative and subject to greater volatility and risk of default.  Unrated securities are evaluated by fund managers using industry data and their own analysis processes that may be similar to that of a nationally recognized rating agency; however, such internal ratings are not equivalent to a national agency credit rating. Counterparty credit risk may arise if counterparties fail to meet their obligations, should the fund hold any derivative instruments for either investment exposure or hedging purposes.Interest Rate Risk: Fixed-income securities such as bonds, preferred, convertible and other debt securities will decline in value if market interest rates rise.Leverage Risk: The fund’s use of leverage may cause higher volatility for the fund’s per share NAV, market price, and distributions.  Leverage typically magnifies the total return of the fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative. Leverage is intended to increase common share net income, but there is no assurance that the fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.  Different forms of leverage, including swaps, may introduce additional credit or interest rate risk. Leverage may also increase a fund’s liquidity risk, as the fund may need to sell securities at inopportune times to stay within fund or regulatory limits.Limited Term Risk: It is anticipated that the fund will terminate and liquidate its assets and return the proceeds to its shareholders on or before a specific date, although it could terminate sooner or later under certain conditions.  The fund may be required to sell portfolio securities at times when market conditions are not favorable, negatively affecting its value.Hedging Risk: The fund may use derivative instruments for hedging purposes, but there is no assurance that the fund’s hedging strategy will be successful.  Derivatives may involve a high degree of financial risk, including the risk that the loss on a derivative may be greater than the principal amount invested.MBS Prepayment Risk: MBS represent an interest in a pool of mortgages. These mortgages typically permit borrowers to prepay amounts owing, often with no penalty.  In periods of falling interest rates, the rate of prepayments tends to increase, forcing a fund to reinvest in lower-yielding securities.  However, prepayment risk for a MBS may not be the same as call risk for a corporate bond of similar maturity, making this risk difficult to estimate.Illiquid Securities Risk: The fund may not be able to sell securities in its portfolio at the time or price the fund desires.
NOTES


					** The premium/discount is calculated as (most recent price/most recent NAV) -1.






†† Cash-flow Based Distribution

				Historical distribution sources have included net investment income, realized gains and return of capital. If a distribution includes anything other than net investment income, the fund provides a notice of the best estimate of its distribution sources at that time which may be viewed at nuveen.com/CEFdistributions. These estimates may not match the final tax characterization (for the full year’s distributions) contained in shareholders’ 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year. You should not draw any conclusions about a fund’s past or future investment performance from its current distribution rate.
			

				Distribution rates represent the latest declared regular distribution, annualized, relative to the most recent market price and NAV. Special distributions, including special capital gains distributions, are not included in the calculation.

1 In U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2016. Source Ameriprise Q2 Earnings Release. Includes all assets managed by entities in the Columbia and Threadneedle group of companies. Contact us for more current data.
2Source: ICI as of December 31, 2016 for Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC.
3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.

Disclosures

1 In U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2016. Source Ameriprise Q2 Earnings Release. Includes all assets managed by entities in the Columbia and Threadneedle group of companies. Contact us for more current data.
2Source: ICI as of December 31, 2016 for Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC.
3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.
