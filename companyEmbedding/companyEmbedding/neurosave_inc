NeuroSave



































































The potential for better brain coolingIn a clinical trial with patients undergoing cardiac surgery, NeuroSave therapy demonstrated brain cooling that was:







FastCooling the brain by 3°C in less than 15 minutes







TargetedKeeping the brain at least 3°C below core body temperature







DeepDecreasing the brain temperature by 3.5 - 7.5°C  Our goal Our goal is to rapidly deliver the benefits of therapeutic hypothermia to the brain while protecting the body from the negative effects of cooling.   Potential BenefitsFastIn a clinical trial, NeuroSave cooled the brain more than 10 times faster than non-surgical technology used in hospitals today.TargetedNeuroSave is designed to cool primarily the brain, potentially reducing the risks associated with body cooling. DeepIn a clinical trial, NeuroSave cooled the brain by more than 3.5°C. SIMPLENeuroSave employs a non-surgical approach with techniques and equipment familiar to physicians, nurses and paramedics.MobileThe core NeuroSave design is versatile and small enough to be used inside and outside the hospital.   Potential Applications 







Cardiac Arrest







Stroke
