But could machines ever turn out to be superior beings to us? The answer is obviously ‘yes’, at least in numerous things where our brains used to be the unchallenged champion of creativity and intelligence. One such software is Clarifai, an AI-powered image and video recognising software.Deep learning is a huge opportunity right now because it enables developers to create applications in a way that was never possible before. Neural networks are a new way of programming computers … It’s a new way of handling data.Clarifai uses neural networks -- or data algorithms that imitate the human brain -- to apply intelligence to images and video. Clarifai's tech can recognize objects in videos in milliseconds, much faster than a human could. Brands, advertisers and social media firms can use this to understand and better target consumers.Neural networks are a huge leap over traditional computer vision methods, since they learn directly from the data they are fed.We’ve glimpsed the future of online search, and here it is: a 17-second video of a puppy brought to you by Clarifai, a startup that specializes in artificial intelligence.Pricing | Clarifai DeveloperAPI PricingFreeStart building amazing stuff, no credit card required.Get your free API keySearch and predict5,000 free operations per month10,000 free inputsTrain your own model10 free custom conceptsStandardOutgrown the free tier?

In the rare case that it does not, please don't hesitate to contact us. Hey, we may even add your new question to this FAQ. We are always looking to self-improve.Also be sure to check out our Pricing Overview page for a further explanation of these terms and accompanying examples.GeneralWhat is the difference between an Operation and an Input?An Input is a piece of data (image) that you feed into the Clarifai API. You conduct Operations on an input. There are four different types of Operations: Upload, Predict, Search, and Train. The first three are done on Inputs (images) and the last is done on a Custom Model that you have created from scratch.So does this mean that if I upload 5,000 images to my collection, my free operations will be used up for that month?Yep. When you upload an Input into the Clarifai API you are charged for an operation.Is this the same pricing for video recognition?At the moment video is only done on our v1 API, which has a different pricing structure. The default is to analyze 1 frame per second, meaning that if your video is 60 seconds long it will essentially incur 60 operations.If you do want to analyze videos please let us know and we will be in touch.Are there any academic discounts for students?We don't have a formal policy for this yet but we'd love to hear about your project! Please let us know about it here.Do I get charged for X operations when I batch Y images together in one call, or does it count as one?If you batch predict 32 local files or URLs in one call, you will be charged for 32 operations. It will always be one operation charged per image analyzed.Signing UpDo I need a credit or debit card to sign up for the FREE plan?Nope, you do not need a credit or debit card to sign up for the FREE plan.Do I need a credit or debit card to sign up for a paid plan?Yup, you need a credit or debit card for a paid plan. That's how we charge you.Can I use PayPal, Venmo, Bitcoin or anything other than a credit/debit card?At this point in time, the answer is no. We are thinking about offering this, so if this would make you happy please let us know. The more we hear from people the higher we can prioritize this.Do you offer a free trial before committing to a paid plan?If you'd like to try before you buy, go ahead and sign up for the FREE plan. Once you fall in love with our API you can upgrade at any time to a paid plan. You'll just need to add a credit or debit card. That's how we charge you.Wait, so I can stay on the FREE plan forever?Yes you can. Just as long as you stay below the limits of the plan. But we know you. We know you have plans for world domination. Just know that as your app catches fire and that rocket ship blasts into space, we'll be right there with you offering a plan size that fits your needs. Did we mention we even support billions of units per month?PaymentWhen I sign up for a paid plan, when do you charge my credit card?We charge your card after the first month of usage.Are monthly plans recurring? Do you charge my card automatically every month?When you sign up for the paid plan, we charge your card every month on the anniversary of your sign up date. So if you signed up on August 5, we'll charge you next on September 5, then October 5 and so on.What happens if I signed up on the 31st of a month? What do you do then??Wow you've got us. Hmm okay. It turns out this problem is not quite P = NP and some of our resident PhD mathematicians actually solved it. So the short answer is: yes we'll charge you every month on the last day of the month.What if I have a huge backlog of images? Can I do a one-time payment to process those?On the paid plan, you only pay for what you use, so you can just go ahead and process your backlog as usual.Can I pay annually up front?Not yet. We have had some conversations internally about this though. We even added it as a backlog item. But it just sits there every month, never moving up. So if you want this, please let us know. The more people that ask for it the higher we'll prioritize it. That's how customer-driven development works.Canceling PlansOkay so now that I've cancelled, can I get a refund?After you cancel, we’ll go ahead and send you one last bill to settle up for the current month.I've cancelled my plan. Why can I still use your API?Remember that awesome free plan we offer?
