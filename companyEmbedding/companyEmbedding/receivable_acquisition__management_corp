(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The following management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company's historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the notes thereto. The management's discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. When used, the words "believe," "plan," "intend," "anticipate," "target," "estimate," "expect" and the like, and/or future tense or conditional constructions ("will," "may," "could," "should," etc.), or similar expressions, identify certain of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements in this quarterly report. The Company's actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this quarterly report.  Overview  On May 15, 2013, Receivable Acquisition & Management Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company") completed the acquisition of Cornerstone Program Advisors LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Cornerstone") and Sustainable Energy Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Sustainable"), and the Company assumed the operations of each of these entities (the "Merger").  Results of Operations  During the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, the Company had net (losses) of ($8,722) and ($21,688) on revenues of $240,812 and $714,844, respectively, versus net (losses) of ($24,243) and ($25,276) on revenues of $316,444 and $874,581, respectively, in the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015. The results in the third fiscal quarter of 2016 showed a narrowing of the loss due to a more rapid decline in expenses on consulting contractors than the decline in revenues.  Revenue  In the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, revenues showed an 18% decrease as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. The revenue decrease for the period is a consequence of an expected temporary hiatus on one client's activity.  Operating Expenses  Total operating expenses for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 were $249,534 and $736,532, respectively, versus $340,687 and $899,857, respectively, during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015.  Consulting Expenses  The Company outsources a significant portion of its project management, oversight and advisory activities to a carefully selected group of small firms, individuals and subcontractors with expertise specific to the projects underway.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had working capital (that is, total current assets minus total current liabilities) of $63,115 versus a working capital deficit of ($119,672) as of year ended December 31, 2015. This change is principally due to a change in the accounting treatment of a contingent obligation (see Note 4).  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had net cash of $38,282 versus $119,167 at December 31, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided (used) by operating activities was ($85,885) versus $44,268 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The change in net cash used by operating activities for the nine month period in 2015 to net cash provided by operating activities in the recent nine month period resulted largely from an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accounts payable.  For the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, no cash was expended by investing activities.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there was $5,000 net cash provided by financing activities versus $17,500 net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The earlier period result was due primarily to a cash infusion by an investor, and the recent period result was principally due to cash infusions received from investors.  The Company believes that funds generated from operations, together with existing cash and cash infusions by major stockholders, will be sufficient to finance its operations for the next twelve months, but are likely to be insufficient to fund its contractual obligation discussed below and to fund growth. The Company has begun exploring options and alternatives for raising additional capital to cover any working capital needs and its contractual obligation, and to fund growth initiatives in its identified markets. However, there can be no assurance that any new debt or equity financing arrangement will be available to the Company when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. The continued operations of the Company are dependent on its ability to collect its receivables and increase revenues.  Income Taxes  The Company did not record any income tax provision for the three or nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, and does not expect any material income tax liability for the period.  Contractual Obligation  As previously disclosed and described in Note 4 to the financial statements, the Company has entered into a renewable 20-year Technology Agreement with a third party licensor (the "Licensor") that developed engines capable of converting low grade heat into other forms of energy. Under the terms of the Technology Agreement, the Company obtained certain exclusive license rights in the engines developed by the Licensor which will permit the Company to develop, manufacture and integrate such engines into its projects. An upfront payment of $200,000 and escalating volume-related quarterly payments are contractually required in order to maintain certain exclusive markets. The payments, taken as whole, are expected to obligate the Company to amounts of $250,000 to $400,000 per year depending upon the growth in revenue from this source. If the expected revenues do not materialize, the Company may elect not to pay these sums, and in the event of non-payment, the Company retains a non-exclusive license subject to royalty fees.  As previously disclosed by the Company, and as discussed in Note 4 to the Financial Statements herein, the Company learned that the Licensor was administratively dissolved for failure to pay franchise taxes, and that the Licensor's two U.S. patents in connection with the License Agreement expired.  Critical Accounting Policy & Estimates  Our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section discusses our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, accrued expenses, financing operations, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates as to the appropriate carrying value of certain assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources. These accounting policies are described at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis and in the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.  Nov 14, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

Consensus Ratings for Receivable Acquisition & Management Corp (NASDAQ:CSEI) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

SWOT Analysis
SWOT, which stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats, is an analytical framework that identifies the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable for a company.

Enhanced SWOT Analysis
Enhanced SWOT is a 3Ã3 grid that arranges strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats into one scheme:

How to use the strengths to take advantage of the opportunities?
How to use the strengths to reduce likelihood and impact of the threats?
How to overcome the weaknesses that obstruct taking advantage of the opportunities? 
How to overcome the weaknesses that can make the threats a reality?

Upon answering these questions a company can develop a project plan to improve its business performance.

PESTEL Analysis
PESTEL (also termed as PESTLE) is an ideal tool to strategically analyze what influence different outside factors â political, economic, sociocultural, technological, environmental and legal â exert on a business to later chart its long term targets.
Being part of the external analysis when carrying out a strategic assessment or performing a market study, PESTEL gives an overview of diverse macro-environmental factors that any company should thoughtfully consider. By perceiving these outside environments, businesses can maximally benefit from the opportunities while minimizing the threats to the organization.
Key Factors Examined by PESTEL Analysis:

Political â What opportunities and pressures are brought by political bodies and what is the degree of public regulationsâ impact on the business?
Economic â What economic policies, trends and structures are expected to affect the organization, what is this influenceâs degree?
Sociological â What cultural and societal aspects will work upon the demand for the businessâs products and operations?
Technological â What impact do the technological aspects, innovations, incentives and barriers have on the organization?
Environmental â What environmental and ecological facets, both locally and farther afield, are likely to predetermine the business?
Legal â What laws and legislation will exert influence on the style the business is carried out?


IFE, EFE, IE Matrices
The Internal Factor Evaluation matrix (IFE matrix) is a strategic management tool helping audit or evaluate major weaknesses and strengths in a businessâs functional areas. In addition, IFE matrix serves as a basis for identifying and assessing relationships amongst those areas. The IFE matrix is utilised in strategy formulation.
The External Factor Evaluation matrix (EFE matrix) is a tool of strategic management that is typically utilised to assess current market conditions. It is an ideal instrument for visualising and prioritising the threats and opportunities a firm is facing.
The essential difference between the above mentioned matrices lies in the type of factors incorporated in the model; whilst the latter is engaged in internal factors, the former deals exceptionally with external factors â those exposed to social, political, economic, legal, etc. external forces. 
Being a continuation of the EFE matrix and IFE matrix models, the Internal External matrix (IE matrix) rests upon an investigation of external and internal business factors integrated into one suggestive model. 

Porter Five Forces Analysis
The Porterâs five forces analysis studies the industry of operation and helps the company find new sources of competitive advantage. The analysis surveys an industry through five major questions:

What composes a threat of substitute products and services?
Is there a threat of new competitors entering the market?
What is the intensity of competitive rivalry?
How big is the bargaining power of buyers?
How significant is the bargaining power of suppliers?


VRIO Analysis
VRIO stands for Value, Rarity, Imitability, Organization. This analysis helps to evaluate all companyâs resources and capabilities and bring them together into one aggregate table that includes:

Tangible resources
Financial
Physical
Technological
Organizational

Intangible resources
Human
Innovation and Creativity
Reputation

Organizational capabilities

The result of the analysis gives a clear picture of companyâs competitive and economic implications, answering the questions if the resources mentioned above are:

Valuable?
Rare? 
Costly to imitate? 
Organized properly?

Â 

1.
Organization and Nature of Business

Â 

Receivable
Acquisition and Management Corporation (the âCompanyâ
or âRAMCOâ), a public reporting entity, was in the
business to purchase, manage and collect defaulted consumer
receivables. RAMCO ceased investments in distressed consumer credit
portfolios in September 2007 and subsequently ran off existing
portfolios.

Â 

Sustainable
Energy LLC (âSustainable LLCâ) is a New York limited
liability company formed on July 26, 2010. Sustainable LLC is
involved in developing and improving the efficiency of energy
infrastructure using a combination of traditional and advanced
technologies. On March 29, 2013, Sustainable LLC contributed
certain assets and liabilities into a newly formed entity,
Sustainable Energy Industries, Inc. (âSustainableâ). At
the time, Sustainable LLC had a license agreement with a third
party involving manufacturing and licensing, and limited assets,
liabilities and operations.

Â 

Cornerstone
Program Advisors LLC, (âCornerstoneâ) is a Delaware
limited liability company formed on January 5, 2009. Cornerstone is
an energy infrastructure project management company focused on
healthcare and higher learning institutions.

Â 

As a
result of a reverse merger acquisition between the Company,
Cornerstone, and Sustainable during 2013, the Company adopted a
business plan to build on the businesses of Cornerstone and
Sustainable in energy infrastructure and alternative
energy.

Â 

The
Company currently does business as Cornerstone Sustainable
Energy.

Â 

2.
Significant Accounting Policies

Â 

Basis of
Presentation and Use of Estimates

Â 

The
Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America which requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Some of the more
significant estimates required to be made by management include
recognition of income for work completed and unbilled to customers,
the allowance for doubtful accounts, and the valuation of the
License Agreement. Â Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Â 

The
Company believes that funds generated from operations, together
with existing cash and cash infusions by major stockholders, will
be sufficient to finance its operations for the next twelve months,
but are likely to be insufficient to fund its contractual
obligations and to fund growth. Â The Company expects to seek
additional capital to cover any working capital needs and its
contractual obligations, and to fund growth initiatives in its
identified markets. Â However, there can be no assurance that
any new debt or equity financing arrangement will be available to
the Company when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. Â The
continued operations of the Company are dependent on its ability to
raise funds, collect accounts receivable, and receive
revenues.

Â 

Unaudited
Financial Statements

Â 

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for
financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. They
do not include all information and footnotes required by United
States generally accepted accounting principles for complete
financial statements. The unaudited financial statements should be
read in conjunction with those financial statements included in the
Companyâs Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Â In the opinion of Management, all adjustments considered
necessary for a fair presentation, consisting solely of normal
recurring adjustments, have been made. Operating results for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending
December 31, 2016.

Â 

Notes to
Financial Statements

September

(Unaudited)

Â 

Cash

Â 

The
Company continually monitors its positions with, and the credit
quality of, the financial institutions it invests with. From time
to time, however briefly, the Company maintains balances in
operating accounts in excess of federally insured
limits.

Â 

Accounts
Receivable

Â 

Receivables
are stated at the amount management expects to collect from
outstanding balances. Management provides for probable
uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to
a valuation allowance based on its assessment of the current status
of individual accounts. At September 30, 2016, no allowance for
doubtful accounts has been provided.

Â 

Income
Recognition

Â 

The
Company recognizes income for the sale of services and products
when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have
been rendered or delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or
determinable and the collectability of the related income is
reasonably assured.

Â 

The
Company principally derives income from fees for services generated
on a project-by-project basis. Prior to the commencement of a
project, the Company reaches agreement with the client on rates for
services based upon the scope of the project, staffing requirements
and the level of client involvement. It is the Companyâs
policy to obtain written agreements from new clients prior to
performing services. In these agreements, the clients acknowledge
that they will pay based upon the amount of time spent on the
project or an agreed upon fee structure. Income for services
rendered is recognized on a time and materials basis or on a
fixed-fee or capped-fee basis in accordance with accounting and
disclosure requirements for income recognition.

Â 

Fees for
services that have been performed, but for which the Company has
not invoiced the customers are recorded as unbilled
receivables.

Â 

Income for
time and materials contracts are recognized based on the number of
hours worked by the Companyâs subcontractors at an agreed
upon rate per hour, and are recognized in the period in which
services are performed. Income for time and materials contracts is
billed monthly or in accordance with the specific contractual terms
of each project.

Â 

Fixed
Assets

Â 

Fixed
assets are being depreciated on the straight line basis over a
period of five years.

Â 

License
Agreement

Â 

The cost
of the license agreement (see Note 4) is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over 20 years. The license agreement is tested
annually for impairment or earlier if an indication of impairment
exists. Â The Company believes that the license agreement has
not been impaired.

Â 

Income
Taxes

Â 

The
Company recognizes the tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only
where the position is âmore likely than notâ to be
sustained assuming examination by the tax authorities. Management
has analyzed the Companyâs tax positions, and has concluded
that no liability for unrecognized tax benefits should be recorded
related to uncertain tax positions taken on returns filed for open
tax years (2012 - 2015).

Â 

Basic and
Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Share

Â 

The
Company computes income (loss) per share in accordance with
âASC-260â, âEarnings per Shareâ which
requires presentation of both basic and diluted income (loss) per
share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic income
(loss) per share is computed by dividing net income available to
common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding
common shares during the period. Diluted income (loss) per share
gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding
during the period. Dilutive income (loss) per share excludes all
potential common shares if their effect is
anti-dilutive.

Â 

The
Company has no potential dilutive instruments and accordingly basic
income (loss) and diluted income per share are the same.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

Â 

In May
2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09: âRevenue from
Contracts with Customersâ (Topic 606) (âASU
2014-09â). ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive new revenue
recognition model requiring a company to recognize revenue to
depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount
reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for
those goods or services. In adopting ASU 2014-09, companies may use
either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach.
ASU 2014-09 is effective for the first interim period within annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early
adoption is not permitted. The Company will adopt ASU 2014-09
during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Management is evaluating
the provisions of this statement and has not determined what impact
the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company's financial
position or results of operations.

Â 

In August
2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15:
âPresentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic
205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entityâs
Ability to Continue as a Going Concernâ (âASU
2014-15â). In connection with preparing financial statements
for each annual and interim reporting period, an entityâs
management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events,
considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the
entityâs ability to continue as a going concern within one
year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or
within one year after the date that the financial statements are
available to be issued when applicable). Managementâs
evaluation should be based on relevant conditions and events that
are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the financial
statements are issued (or at the date that the financial statements
are available to be issued when applicable). Substantial doubt
about an entityâs ability to continue as a going concern
exists when relevant conditions and events, considered in the
aggregate, indicate that it is probable that the entity will be
unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year
after the date that the financial statements are issued (or
available to be issued). The term probable is used consistently
with its use in Topic 450, Contingencies. The amendments in this
Update are effective for the annual period ending after December
15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter.
Early application is permitted.

Â 

All other
accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB
that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected
to have a material impact on the financial statements upon
adoption.

4. License
Agreement

Â 

On
November 15, 2012, Sustainable LLC entered into a renewable 20-year
engine technology license agreement (the âTechnology
Agreementâ) with a third party licensor (the
âLicensorâ) that developed engines capable of
converting low grade heat into other forms of energy. Â Under
the terms of the Technology Agreement, Sustainable LLC obtained
certain exclusive license rights in the engines developed by the
Licensor which would permit Sustainable LLC to develop, manufacture
and integrate such engines into its projects.

Â 

The
exclusive market rights of the Technology Agreement provide that
Sustainable LLC make a cash payment of $200,000 for this
exclusivity and issue common stock in Sustainable representing a
small minority ownership position in the Company, along with
periodic quarterly payments of $25,000 commencing six months after
the initial $200,000 payment. Â These payments reset to $50,000
per quarter after three payments, and are subject to further resets
to up to $100,000 depending on engine sales volume.
Â 

Â 

On May 15,
2013, in connection with the Merger (see Note 1), the Company,
after acquiring 100% ownership interest in Sustainable, issued
2,435,430 shares to the Licensor which represents a small minority
position in the Company as required under the terms of the
Technology Agreement. Â At the time of issuance, these shares
were valued at $48,709 representing the fair value of the RAMCO
shares.

Â 

In
addition, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, the
Company made payments of $13,000 that were applied against the
required initial $200,000 cash payment as stated under the terms of
the Technology Agreement.

Â 

At
September 30, 2016, the Technology Agreement had accumulated
amortization of $40,300. Â 

Â 

In the
event the Company elects not to pay for exclusivity under the
Technology Agreement, no cash payment or periodic increasing
payments are due. At September 30, 2016, management has considered
the nature of the $187,000 exclusive payment and determined that a
more accurate presentation on the balance sheet is to net the
contingent liability with the license agreement asset. Thus the
contingent amount due, $187,000, has been netted against the
amortized value of the value of the license, $208,409, arriving at
a net asset value of $21,409. The comparative 2015 presentation
continues to reflect the asset and contingent liability on a gross
basis.

Â 

In
connection with a November 5, 2013, proceeding commenced by the
Securities Division of the Arizona Corporation Commission (the
âACCâ) the Company learned that the Licensor had been
classified as
