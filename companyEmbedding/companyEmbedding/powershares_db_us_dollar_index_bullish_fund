Charting a slow-motion summer breakout, S&P 500 confirms bull trend
Technically speaking, the U.S. benchmarks’ slow-motion summer uptrend continues to grind higher.  Consider that the S&P 500 has tagged a fractional all-time high early Tuesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has rallied within striking distance of a corresponding record.  The latest breakout attempt is underway.

Nasdaq tags uncharted territory, small- and mid-cap breakout attempt also underway
U.S. stocks are higher early Wednesday, rising after a mixed batch of quarterly earnings reports, and amid recently persistent crude-oil price strength.  In the process, the Nasdaq Composite has belatedly reached record territory, while the small- and mid-cap benchmarks have registered fractional all-time highs early Wednesday.  A rotational July breakout attempt remains underway.

S&P 500 maintains the 2,405 breakout point (again), lifts on solid jobs report
U.S. stocks are higher early Friday, rising after a better-than-expected monthly U.S. jobs report.  In the process, the S&P 500 has registered its latest successful test of major support — the 2,405 breakout point — rising from this week’s low, two points higher.  (The Dow industrials have concurrently reversed from a week-to-date low of 21,305, also matching support.) 

Jul. 7, 2017 at 11:53 a.m. ET
by Michael Ashbaugh









S&P 500 nails the 2,405 support amid volatile second-quarter conclusion
Technically speaking, the U.S. benchmarks are concluding the second quarter against a slightly bending, but still bullish, bigger-picture backdrop.  Consider that the S&P 500 has nailed the breakout point — S&P 2,405 — and rallied respectably, preserving its uptrend.  Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite has been more firmly pressured, edging under its 50-day moving average, currently 6,154, and the retest remains underway.

S&P 500, Dow nail near-term support, absorb ECB-fueled June downdraft
Technically speaking, the U.S. benchmarks have absorbed a second June whipsaw, in this case fueled by possibly inadvertent ECB policy language.  In the process, the S&P 500 and Dow industrials have more or less nailed the range bottom — S&P 2,416 and Dow 21,305 — rising respectably from support early Wednesday.

Jun. 28, 2017 at 11:15 a.m. ET
by Michael Ashbaugh









Charting the latest technical breakout, S&P 500 confirms bull trend
Technically speaking, the major U.S. stock benchmarks have concurrently reached uncharted territory, confirming the primary bull trend.  Moreover, the prevailing breakout been statistically unusual — punctuated by an S&P 500 close atop the 20-day volatility bands — signaling that longer-term bullish momentum is firmly intact.

Charting a technically aggressive downdraft:  S&P 500 knifes (straight) through notable support
The major U.S. benchmarks are slightly higher early Thursday, rising in the wake of this week’s technically aggressive market downdraft. Consider that the S&P 500 has reversed sharply from record highs, established this week, to a nearly immediate violation of the 50-day moving average.  Deeper support, circa 2,351, has initially held early Thursday.

Charting a bullish technical tilt:  S&P 500’s pulling-teeth breakout attempt underway
Technically speaking, the S&P 500’s pulling-teeth breakout attempt remains underway against a bullish bigger-picture backdrop. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite continues to pace the 2017 bull trend — breaking more decisively to record territory — while the Dow industrials lag slightly behind.

S&P 500 lifts from coiled spring, rattles cage on record territory
U.S. stocks are higher early Monday, rising amid surging crude oil prices after Saudi Arabia and Russia endorsed extending the production cut agreement originally set to expire in June.  In the process, the Nasdaq Composite has reached its latest all-time high, while the S&P 500 is vying for a record close, and its first-ever close atop the 2,400 mark. 

May. 15, 2017 at 11:40 a.m. ET
by Michael Ashbaugh









S&P 500 holds the range, slow-motion breakout attempt still underway
U.S. stocks are mixed early Friday, treading water despite a better-than-expected monthly jobs report ahead of Sunday’s French presidential election.  Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 is traversing an increasingly familiar range, even amid consequential commodities price action, including crude oil’s technical breakdown.

Charting a flat response to the Fed, major U.S. benchmarks hold first support
U.S. stocks are mixed early Thursday, treading water after a Federal Reserve policy statement that signaled a generally positive view of the U.S. economy.  Against this backdrop, each major U.S. benchmark has maintained first support, and remains within striking distance of record territory.

Nasdaq extends spike to uncharted territory, S&P 500 breakout attempt underway
Technically speaking, the major U.S. benchmarks have diverged slightly against a firmly bullish bigger-picture backdrop.

Shares of UUP Now Oversold






ETFChannel.com




Jun 29, 2017 3:52 PM EDT













 
















































 In trading on Thursday, shares of the PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund ETF ( UUP) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $24.71 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.   In the case of PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund, the RSI reading has hit 29.5 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 48.5.  START SLIDESHOW:Find out what 9 other oversold stocks you need to know about »  A bullish investor could look at UUP's 29.5 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.  Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), UUP's low point in its 52 week range is $24.32 per share, with $26.83 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $24.73. PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund shares are currently trading off about 0.4% on the day.

Index funds could help lower long-term costs
Get the high quality and low costs you'd expect from the company that introduced indexing to individual investors.
What are index mutual funds?



Instead of hiring fund managers to actively select which stocks or bonds the fund will hold, an index fund buys all (or a representative sample) of the securities in a specific index, like the S&P 500 Index.The goal of an index fund is to track the performance of a specific market benchmark as closely as possible. That's why you may hear it referred to as a "passively managed" fund.

Index funds offer built-in benefits








Low costs
Because index funds hold investments until the index itself changes, they generally have lower management and transaction costs.
 




Lower risk through broader diversification
Some index funds give you exposure to potentially thousands of securities in a single fund.
 




Tax efficiency
Broad index funds generally don't trade as much as actively managed funds might, so they're typically generating less taxable income, which reduces the drag on your investments.
 
Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds 

Could actively managed funds help you beat the market?

Read more about what you should consider when choosing an index fund


You can get an index fund anywhere—why Vanguard?








We started the indexing revolution
Vanguard launched the first index fund for individual investors in 1976, and we've been fine-tuning both our benchmark selections and tracking skills ever since.Today, we have more than 60 unique funds that track indexes across the bond and stock markets, both U.S. and international, as well as sector-specific areas of the markets.
See a complete list of Vanguard index funds 

 




We've made it our business to keep your costs low
The average Vanguard index fund expense ratio is 71% less than the industry average.*

Low-cost investing for everyone



Our passion for low costs will always be our driving force. When others take notice, expense ratios fall more broadly. Everyone wins!

How would index funds fit into your portfolio?



Because of their low costs, broader diversification, and tax efficiency, index funds could be appropriate for any portion of your portfolio. In fact, the right balance of four of our broadest index funds could give you a complete portfolio, with full exposure to U.S. and international stock and bond markets.Get details on:

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments. Investments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.
	Vanguard provides services to the Vanguard funds and ETFs at cost.

              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

A quarter of S&P 500’s 2017 climb due to five stocks (yes, those five)
              
              Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.

Amazon earnings fall 77%, shares drop
              
              Amazon.com Inc.  reported much lower earnings than expected Thursday, and shares declined more than 2% in late trading. The e-commerce giant reported net income of $197 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $38 billion, a profit decline of 77% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $1.41 a share on sales of $37.2 billion. The company's spending cut into profit, as fulfillment costs -- the amount Amazon spends to fulfill customers' orders on its e-commerce platform -- rose about 33% from a year ago and spending on technology and content increased by about 43%. Amazon stock traded at all-time highs this week, making Amazon the fourth U.S. company with a market capitalization of $500 billion and briefly giving Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the title of richest man in the world, but shares declined about 2% in immediate after-hours action.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.
