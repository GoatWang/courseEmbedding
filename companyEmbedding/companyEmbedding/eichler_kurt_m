MILFORD, Mass., Aug. 17, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics for the treatment of viral infections, today announced the appointment of Martin Driscoll as President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Driscoll is a seasoned health care executive with more than three decades of experience successfully leading biopharmaceutical companies through the clinical development and commercialization of innovative therapies.  He replaces Douglas J. Jensen, who is leaving Spring Bank to pursue other opportunities.  Mr. Driscoll has also been elected to the Company's Board of Directors.  
The Company also announced today that Kurt M. Eichler has been elected to the Company's Board of Directors.
"I am delighted to welcome Martin Driscoll as our new President and CEO as Spring Bank embarks on its next stage of growth," said Guy Macdonald, Chairman of Spring Bank's Board of Directors and President and CEO of Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc. "Marty has a proven track record of growing public and private life sciences companies, with deep insight into both product and business development strategy. We would like to thank Doug Jensen for his many contributions to Spring Bank over the past 13 years."
Mr. Macdonald continued, "We also welcome Kurt Eichler to our Board of Directors. Kurt's broad experience in providing strategic guidance to emerging companies will lend an important perspective to the Board and management during this important period for the Company."
"Spring Bank represents an exciting opportunity, with a novel chemistry platform that has already produced an innovative clinical compound, SB 9200, being developed for the treatment of hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and other viruses," said Mr. Driscoll. "Furthermore, in addition to SB 9200, we have a broad pre-clinical pipeline with programs in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and broad spectrum antivirals, as well as other earlier stage programs. I look forward to working alongside Spring Bank's talented management team and experienced Board to advance our exciting product development programs and build significant company value." 
Mr. Driscoll's diverse experience includes leadership roles in general management, research and development, commercial operations and business development for both privately-held and publicly-traded life sciences commercial- and development-stage companies. Mr. Driscoll most recently served as CEO of Asmacure Ltée, a venture-backed clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company which he joined in late 2010.

In 2007, Mr. Driscoll co-founded Pear Tree Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a privately-held developer of women's healthcare products. Mr. Driscoll has been involved with or led the commercialization of several important therapies, the direct negotiation of numerous licensing and M&A transactions, multiple private and public capital fundraising efforts, and the successful submission of major product regulatory filings. Mr. Driscoll also has served as a director on the boards of four private and public biopharmaceutical development companies and currently serves on the board of MetaStat, Inc., a molecular diagnostics company based in Boston. Mr. Driscoll holds a B.Sc. in communications from the University of Texas at Austin. He is a board member of the Barn for the Poorest of the Poor, a non-profit food pantry based in New Jersey.

About Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals
Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of a novel class of orally bioavailable therapeutics based on its proprietary small molecule nucleic acid hybrid, or SMNH, chemistry platform. SMNH compounds are small segments of nucleic acids that we design to selectively target and modulate the activity of specific proteins or enzymes implicated in various disease states. The Company is developing its most advanced SMNH product candidate, SB 9200, for the treatment of viral diseases. SB 9200 has been designed to selectively activate the host cellular proteins, RIG I and NOD 2, which have been implicated in the body's immune response to viral infections. Spring Bank believes that SB 9200 can play an important role in antiviral therapy by modulating host immune response to fight viral infections such as HBV, HCV and RSV.

What are analysts saying about CA stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about CA stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period." (7/17/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "CA announced the acquisition of privately held Veracode for $614M in cash. Veracode provides SaaS-based application security for integration across the software development lifecycle. The deal value represents about 6.0-8.0x NTM revenue, which we view as reasonable, and discuss in more detail below. We believe providing security at the application level will become even more important over time given the ever increasing distributed nature of IT infrastructures." (3/7/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for CA (NASDAQ:CA) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Sell Ratings, 7 Hold Ratings, 5 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.13)Consensus Price Target: $34.85 (12.07% upside)
