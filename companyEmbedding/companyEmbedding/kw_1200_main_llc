		Used and New Diesel Generators  
                 


				WPP offers a wide selection of quality diesel generators in sizes ranging from 20kW – 2500kW. Whether you seek portable or stationary diesel generators―for prime, continuous or standby usage―we can ensure you find what you are looking for.
The simplest explanation of a generator’s function: it provides electrical power. A diesel generator is the combination of a diesel engine with an alternator (also called a generator end) to generate electrical energy.   This alternator houses electrical conductors which react to the engine’s mechanical energy and convert it into useful electrical power.
We have many informative articles describing how generators work and which to choose for a particular application.

 Water and Air Ring Pelletizing Systems 
  
 Davis-Standard’s universal underwater system – the Pelletor®_ offers everything you need to produce high-quality, uniform pellets. We offer several options to conventional, micro or macro pellet production using unique designs. These designs assure perfect knife-to-die plate alignment regardless of thermal or mechanical variation of the feed equipment. Very broad product viscosity ranges may be easily achieved.
The Pelletor works in either underwater, water or air ring cutting methods or both. Solution oriented options and features allow ease of operation, highest processing performance, and highest product quality. Since we offer a full range of model sizes, you have the freedom to build your pelletizing line around the system components that meet your exact criteria. All subsystem and support equipment such as screen changers, diverter valves, heating systems, classifiers, dryers, water systems and control panels may be included to provide a total system concept. The end result is superior quality and highly reliable machine lines that turn pellets into bigger profits for you.

KW Series Loudspeakers






QSCLive SoundProductsLoudspeakersPowered LoudspeakersKW Series





KW Series
















Building on the success of our K Series, the KW Series represents the next evolutionary step in wood enclosure loudspeakers. Our system engineers have created the KW Series to feature all the groundbreaking electronic attributes of our popular K Series while at the same time designing a product that is both smaller and significantly lighter than previous wood enclosure models.









High Output


Like K Series, each of the four KW Series models features a QSC designed, 1000 watt (2 x 500 W continuous) Class D power module. And continuing in the K Series tradition, every model is fitted with the identical high-output 1.75" HF device (full-range models) and woofers of the same high quality design, regardless of speaker size.




Defined Coverage Area


Directivity Matched Transition (DMT™) provides for matched LF and HF coverage across the entire listening area, eliminating unnatural "dead" or "hot" frequency zones.




DSP


Extensive signal processing is employed throughout, providing levels of sonic clarity and total output that defy all expectations for a product in this category: Intrinsic Correction™, first featured in our high-end line array products maps 65-75 spatially-averaged measurements to IIR and FIR filters that actively adjust time, frequency and amplitude response to a maximally flat bandpass target. The result is a speaker that behaves equally well across the entire sound field. DEEP™ and excursion limiting allow for extended low-frequency response by actively managing low-frequency transients without degradation of the underlying signal or adjacent frequencies. GuardRail™ protection, first introduced on our GX Series amplifiers protects both the amplifier module and your performance from unnatural and destructive clipping. 




Connectivity


KW Series features a four-position mic / line gain switch that allows for connection of a wide variety of devices. Combo XLR and 1/4" TRS inputs accept both mic and line level input while a set of RCA phono inputs (except KW181) allow additional connectivity to portable MP3 players, CD players and line-level mixers. Up to three audio sources can be mixed internally and summed to a balanced output for "daisy-chaining" of multiple units. Separate direct outputs are also provided on each channel for additional output flexibility.







Control


On-board switches provide preset EQ settings. The HF setting (full-range models) can be set to VOCAL BOOST for additional presence in the critical mid-frequency area or FLAT for accurate reproduction of the incoming signal. The LF switch can be set to NORM, DEEP™ for additional bass extension, or EXT SUB (full-range models) for use with an external subwoofer. The rear panel LED switch can be set to POWER, illuminating the front-mounted LED when the unit is powered on, OFF for applications where it is not desirable to illuminate the front LED, or LIMIT which indicates to the system operator that the clip limiter circuit has been engaged during operation.




Tilt-Direct™


The KW122 and KW152 feature a unique Tilt-Direct™ pole cup mounting system. A simple turn of the dial engages a 7.5 degree downward tilt of the speaker allowing acoustic energy to be kept on the audience and off reflective surfaces for applications where maximum coverage from a high-positioned speaker is desired.




Remote Gain


Remote gain control capability is offered via a potentiometer (not included) connected to the on-board Phoenix-Style connector. In an installed application, multiple KW Series speakers can be "daisy-chained" for total gain control from a single remote pot. Auto-standby mode is engaged after 5 minutes of inactivity.




Premium-grade materials


KW Series is designed to withstand the rigors of professional use. Advanced construction processes, premium-grade Baltic birch cabinetry, ergonomic, cast aluminum handles, low-noise casters (KW181) and a highly protective steel grille provide for ease of transport and long term durability. Integrated M10 suspension points allow for flown applications with a KW M10 KIT (sold separately) and a threaded pole receptacle (KW181) provides for a positive, wobble free connection to a threaded speaker pole (included).

What are some common reasons for changing your legal name? 

Personal Choice.  You may simply not like your name or may want a name that is more easily spelled or pronounced. With TotalLegal, you can change your last name, first name and/or middle name.
Change a Child's Name.  The absence of a parent in a child's life, changes in parental rights/custody, and paternity determinations are among the most common reasons to change a child's name.
Share a Last Name.  Couples may want to create a hyphenated or entirely new last name for themselves.
Divorce.  If you took your spouse's last name upon marriage, you may want to resume a former name if you separate or divorce. In most states, it is easy to include a name change in your Divorce Decree.


Fraud and Name Changes.  The court will not grant a name change that 
		is requested for a fraudulent or illegal purpose such as evading criminal 
		prosecution or a civil lawsuit, avoiding creditors, or identity theft. 
TotalLegal™ has helped over 1 million people nationwide make essential documents themselves.

PowerDyne™ Resistors are the most rugged in the industry.   They are fully supported across their entire length within the air stream by stainless steel support rods which are insulated with heavy-duty, high-temperature ceramic insulators.  Change in resistance is minimized by maintaining conservative resistor designs.    
KW Load Capacity
The LD Series of Radiator/Duct mounted load banks is available in any size range from 10 KW through 1000 KW at any available single phase and three phase Voltage (up to 600 Volts AC).  They are intended for use as a supplemental load to the generator set and are typically sized at 50% of the generator KW rating.  
Cooling
The Load Bank is directly mounted In-Line with the Engine Radiator Cooling Fan which delivers the required airflow volume (CFM) for cooling the resistor load elements.
Control Power  
An external 120 Volt AC, 1-phase, 60 Hertz power source is necessary for control circuit operation.  When 120 VAC control power is not readily available, units can be provided with a control power transformer.  
 
Operator Protection | When Safety Matters
 
LD Series Radiator Duct Mounted Load Banks comes equipped with an Operator Control Panel.  The Emergency-Stop push button allows the operator to take the unit off-line should a critical hard-stop condition occur.  Branch circuit fuse protection provides short-circuit fault protection of all load steps eliminating the potential for catastrophic failure.  Over-temperature circuits disable all load steps during a fault condition with illuminated indicator.  The Load Dump circuit provides the operator visual indication if all load steps have been removed.
 
Operator Controls

Illuminated Main Power On/Off switch
Master Load On/Off switch
Individual Load Step Switches
Fault condition smart indicators provide operator display and load disconnect during Overtemperature, and Load Dump

Automatic Load Dump circuit provides user interface provisions to the generator controls, automatic transfer switch, or building management system, to disconnect and disable all load steps from a normally closed (NC) set of auxiliary contacts.  In the event of an actual power failure, all load bank load is removed from the source under test.
Remote Indication and Alarm contact closure [form-c-type normally open and normally closed] provides user interface to your building management system for indication, detection, and alarm of “Over-Temperature”, and “Load Dump”.

Power Factor Correction Scam Review
Power Factor Correction for reducing electric power bills of residential customers (home owners) is a scam. At most, each unit is worth a few cents as an investment. Power factor correction does make sense for some commercial / industrial customers or for rare situations where you pay for current (amps) or are connected to a gas/diesel generator.
if you are reading this because you saw a nice video on YouTube showing how these devices save money, watch again and you will see them showing you the current (amps) being reduced when the power factor device is switched on. This is correct, except that you are billed in kilowatt hours (kWh) not amps. If they set their meters to show kWh instead of amps, there would have been no change at all and it would have become the perfect demonstration of how these devices are useless for reducing power bills.
The KVAR Power Factor Optimizer from Save Energy LLC is a typical example of this scam. Others to look out for are KVAR Energy Saving Systems, KVAR EC, KVAR Energy Controller KEC PU1200, Nevvus Powerguard, Power-Save 1200, Power Saver HOME, Kilowatt Nanny, PowerwoRx-e3, Power Saver Enersonic and SurgeXpro. 
Update: There is now a definitive debunking from a source you should trust; the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of   the U.S. Commerce Department. NIST Team Demystifies Utility of Power Factor Correction Devices and the much more detailed technical report NIST Technical Note 1654, Regarding Electric Energy Savings, Power Factors, and Carbon Footprints: A Primer.

The power factor of a toaster or ordinary incandescent light bulb is 1 (one). Devices with coils or capacitors (like pumps, fans and florescent light bulb ballasts) have power factors less than one. When the power factor is less than 1, the current and voltage are out of phase. This is due to energy being stored and released into inductors (motor coil) or capacitors on every AC cycle (usually  50 or 60 times per second). Graphically, the voltage and current used by your toaster would looks like this.

 The meter below is measuring the power factor of a small aquarium pump, and is showing a power factor of 0.28. If you were to graph the voltage and current used by the pump, you would see that the red and green lines (the voltage and current) are shifted relative to each other compared to the graph above, like this:


There are three terms you will encounter when dealing with alternating (AC) power (as opposed to DC or batteries). The first is the kilowatt, abbreviated kW, and it represents real power. Real power can perform work. Power company utility meters on the side of your house measure this quantity and charge you for it.
The second term is reactive power, and it is measured in KVAR which is short for kilo volt amp reactive. Unlike kW, it cannot perform work. Residential customers do not pay for KVAR, and utility meters on houses do not record it.
The third term is apparent power, referred to as KVA. If you hook up two multimeters to measure current and voltage and then multiply the readings together, you get apparent power in volt amps, or VA. To distinguish it from real power, VA is used instead of W. 
In the special case of resistive loads (like baseboard heaters or an electric stove element or old fashioned incandescent light bulb), the current and voltage are in phase. Real power equals apparent power, and reactive power equals zero.
These three quantities are related by the Power Triangle. 

The cosine of the angle above is also equal to KW ÷ KVA so you can think of the power factor as the ratio of real power to what you measure with a volt and amp meter (apparent power). If they are equal, then your power factor is one.
Reactive power is not a problem for a motor  and is required for its operation. It is a problem for the electric utility company when they charge for KW only. If two customers both use the same amount of real energy but one has a power factor of 0.5, then that customer also draws double the current. This increased current requires the power company to use larger transformers, wiring and related equipment. To recover these costs, industrial customers are charged a price premium for low power factors. Residential customers (homes) in North America are never charged extra.
While power factor  correction is useful for many industrial customers who use large amounts of power, it is a deception when marketed to home owners (often for several hundred dollars installed) as a way to save money on their electric bill.
What happens when you install it?
The diagram below shows the result of correcting the power factor. The air conditioner (which has a large compressor motor) is still consuming reactive power but it is being supplied by a nearby capacitor (which is what is in those "KVAR" boxes). If you were to mount it at the air conditioner and switch it on with the air conditioner plus you sized the capacitor  perfectly, then there would be no reactive power on the line going back to the fuse panel. If the wire between your fuse panel is very long and undersized, reducing the current would result in it running cooler and having a higher voltage at the air conditioner. These savings due to cooler wiring is minimal.

 
A further complication is that if you install the "KVAR" unit at the fuse panel, it does nothing for the heat losses except for the two feet of huge wire between the fuse panel and the utility meter. Many KVAR units are marketed as boxes that you install at a single location. If your power factor box is too large, then it will be providing reactive power for something else, perhaps your neighbor.
In summary, there are multiple problems:

The KVAR unit should be mounted near the motor and switched with the motor. This means you need switches and multiple units. It makes far more sense for modern appliances to be designed so that the power factor is close to one, and in fact, this is where the industry is headed.
The KVAR needs to be sized perfectly to balance the inductive loads. Since your motors cycle on and off and you don't use the air conditioner in the winter, there is no way to get it sized properly unless you have something to monitor the line and switch it on and off capacity (capacitors) as necessary.
Adding a capacitor can increase the line voltage to dangerous levels because it interacts with the incoming power transmission lines.
Adding a capacitor to a line that has harmonic frequencies (created by some electronic equipment) on it can result in unwanted resonance and high currents.

If you are an Industrial customer, this is not a problem. You can hire an engineer to do a power study, look at issues like harmonic distortion, voltage sags, equipment location, capacity of existing wiring, potential locations for the correction equipment, determine how many units are required and the values of the capacitors, and then develop a potential solution. The study will determine if the project makes financial sense -- even for industrial customers who get a price break for good power factor, it is not always economical. The result will be a custom solution, not an off-the-shelf box and it will be expensive.

Here is one that is clearly being marketed to households and therefore a scam:



For a more comprehensive review of the subject, go to Wikipedia - Power Factor Correction.
This article is excellent: Lessons In Electric Circuits -- Volume II Power Factor


The following is from ENERGYSTAR. This statement is no longer to be found now that they have reorganized their website, however, there is an archived copy here.
Do Power Factor Correction Devices (sometimes called Amp Reduction Units or KVAR) really save money? Can they earn the ENERGY STAR label?
ENERGY STAR does not qualify any Power Factor Correction Devices. Please send us an email at logomisuse@energystar.gov if you see one that claims to be ENERGY STAR certified.
Power Factor Correction Devices claim to reduce residential energy bills and to prolong the productive life cycles of motors and appliances by reducing the reactive power (kVAR) that is needed from the electric utility.
We have not seen any data that proves these types of products for residential use accomplish what they claim. Power factor correction devices improve power quality but do not generally improve energy efficiency (meaning they won't reduce your energy bill). There are several reasons why their energy efficiency claims could be exaggerated. First, residential customers are not charged for KVA-hour usage, but by kilowatt-hour usage. This means that any savings in energy demand will not directly result in lowering a residential user's utility bill. Second, the only potential for real power savings would occur if the product were only put in the circuit while a reactive load (such as a motor) were running, and taken out of the circuit when the motor is not running. This is impractical, given that there are several motors in a typical home that can come on at any time (refrigerator, air conditioner, HVAC blower, vacuum cleaner, etc.), but the unit itself is intended for permanent, unattended connection near the house breaker panel.
For commercial facilities, power factor correction will rarely be cost-effective based on energy savings alone. The bulk of cost savings power factor correction can offer is in the form of avoided utility charges for low power factor. Energy savings are usually below 1% and always below 3% of load, the higher percentage occurring where motors are a large fraction of the overall load of a facility. Energy savings alone do not make an installation cost effective. 
End of Quote
Still not convinced?
One of the more surprising comments I have received lately was that this kind of analysis is "Rubbish" or that it doesn't address the "fact" that some acquaintance of theirs is saving money using a power factor correction device. This is unfortunate. I don't dispute that you may have seen a reduced power bill, just the "fact" that this reduction is due to the "device" and not other factors that were overlooked.
Electrical theory is not some "theory" that might or might not be true. This is an area that has been well understood for more than a century and concepts like resistance, impedance and reactive current are accepted as reality -- something which you ignore at your peril. Even if future understandings of particle physics were to give us new insights to old laws -- these old laws are for all practical purposes, perfect for predicting an outcome in household situations.
Despite this, people install devices like this and become convinced that any reduction in their power bill is due to the device. Remember that if you want to test something like this with the intention of proving that it defies our current engineering knowledge, you are going to have to use calibrated test equipment and carry out carefully controlled experiments. The temperature (degree days) vary greatly from year to year, habits change (longer or shorter showers) and a host of other things will vary your monthly power bills significantly from any chosen month from one year to the next. Even thinking about your energy saving device causes behavior changes -- like turning off lights when you leave a room, running the water less, etc. Therefore, your monthly power bill is in no way a controlled experiment, and the savings you are hoping to measure are very small compared to regular variations. Comparing power bills is useful, but only verifies significant savings such as switching from electricity to natural gas, changing high flow to low flow shower heads or other major changes.

If your experiments lead you to conclude that you actually save significant percentages of power using one of these devices, you need to re-evaluate your controls. Since these results would be violating the laws of physics, nobody will believe them unless they can repeat them. If nobody can duplicate your results (which is extremely likely) then you must re-evaluate your experiment. Finally, very few people who can set up a proper experiment are going to be willing to spend their hard earned money to purchase a device and then spend time conducting an experiment to prove that their purchase was a waste of money. And even if they did, would you believe them?
-- January 2009 --
I will post any feedback received below. I have left out names and e-mail addresses (unless the authors request it) so that they don't get spammed.

Great analysis. Particularly your point about connecting the  power factor correction capacitor(s) directly across the inductive  motor so that they are only in the circuit when the motor is switched  on. Now, multiply that exercise for every inductive motor in the home  -the compressor motors for the ac and the refrigerator(s), dishwasher,  hot water circulating pump(s), etc. Every one of these appliances needs  its own capacitor. It thus becomes obvious why these devices are not  even remotely cost effective for residential applications. And  certainly not in the way the manufacturers recommend that they be  installed, that is, permanently connecting them at the main panel.  Doing that drags the power factor capacitive when the inductive motors  are off and could create some real problems with ringing voltages.


Thank you so much for your article on the PFC devices.  I have been an electrician for 30 years and worked for electrical engineering firms for 10 of those years, specializing in power quality and  diagnostic testing.  I was researching for a friend as I've run across these PFC scams before. I passed your link on to him and he just saved a lot of money by not being duped.  Very well done! -- Mike Cole

First let me say that your article on power factor is the best I have found.  Second, I am an electrical engineer - electronics not power - but I do remember power factor calculations from Freshman circuit theory.  I agree and am convinced that as an energy consumer getting one of these KVAR units is a waste of money but I was wondering if they might be useful as an energy producer.  In other words we know that power companies do save money by power factor correction in their distribution grid.  Since I am now a very small power producer with my PV system can a KVAR unit help me improve the delivery of the power that I am producing?  I expect the answer is no but I have not found this specific question answered anywhere yet. -- Burt Wagner
Hello Burt,
The answer is yes. There are a few situations where it might help you. Power companies have to use larger diameter wiring and bigger transformers to carry the reactive power, so they encourage factories with low power factors to improve it by demanding penalties. This reduces their infrastructure costs.
You PV system has similar issues. You inverter is very expensive and is rated in VA (volt amps). The same goes for a computer uninterruptable power supply. A Tripplite brand 1200W UPS is rated as 1500VA. The 1500VA is the real limit. The 1200W assumes a 0.80 power factor. If you were plugging in a toaster instead, it could support 1500W.
So, if you connect a large power factor correction unit to your PV systems inverter, you would do the following: 1) accomplish nothing in terms of resistive losses -- for that you would have had to connect the PF correction directly to things like the washing machine 2) reduce the size of the inverter required. The latter is analogous to what the power company sees -- increase the power factor close to 1.0, eliminate the reactive power and save money by reducing the size and capacity of equipment. For you, power delivery is about the batteries, cables to the inverter, inverter, charge controller etc. For them it is the size of wire on the poles and the size of the pole transformers, fuse capacities, size of utility poles to support the weight etc.

Even if the existing PV inverter is paid for, a power factor of 1.0 should allow it to run cooler and be less likely to overload when you have too many appliances on. You would probably want to get a PF meter and verify the real power factor. There are some cheap units for 100V that you can plug in the wall, but the best thing would be to borrow something like this:
Extech Power Analyzer. If you have an expensive inverter, perhaps these measurements are built in. 

It might be difficult to prove if you would save money in premature inverter failures, but it would certainly be an interesting question to answer. Does a $3000 inverter run at half capacity last longer, perhaps it has internal fans that don't start up until it approaches 80% capacity etc. 

If you decide to experiment with this, please let me know how it works out.


Here is an analogy from Burt that is rather creative:

I did one more search on power factor correction and finally found a non-technical analogy that I can use to explain this whole thing to the person trying to sell it to me:Think of a bag of potato chips.
You open the bag and it just doesn't seem full enough.
Then you look at the label and it says it's packaged by weight, not by volume.
Yes you only eat the chips. The extra air in the bag is not a scam. It's just an unavoidable and normal part of packaging and delivery.
The ratio of weight to volume would be like "power factor" of packaging and delivery.
Utility power is like that bag of potato chips.
"Real" power (watts) is like the chips. Real power is the only power your motor (or fridge, or hair dryer, or TV, or light fixture...) can "eat."
The "imaginary" or "reactive" power is just "air" in the wires, an unavoidable part of what it takes to deliver the watts.
Plugging something into a receptacle to reduce power factor is like "vacuum packing" the bag. You get more "chips" (watts) in the same size "bag" (volt-amps).
The most common device for "vacuum packing" power is a capacitor.
The most common thing that blows more air into the bag is a motor.
So connecting a capacitor in parallel with a motor helps deliver more chips per bag (watts per volt-amp) to that motor.
By getting rid of the air in the bag you do not save any money since you are only being charged for the chips!
BUT the power company does care about the air in the bags since the larger bags require larger "trucks" to deliver the bags.
What do you think?  I think this just may convince him. -- Burt 

comments = I just reviewed your article on Power Factor Correction. I  agree with your conclusions BUT I think other factors might be  resulting in the savings some people claim.
I would respectively suggest that all electricity meters are not measuring ONLY real   power. The very old meters certainly tried to do this but with some newer electronic meters I'm not so sure.
The  most popular E-Meter chips are from Analog Devices, one of the latest  is the ADE7757. Notice that PF error is quoted as a spec for this chip  but is not mentioned in earlier chips.  However notice that Harmonic  distortion is not a meter spec, nor is AC-Line Noise rejection.
http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/application_notes/81462932AN679_a.pdf

http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/tech_articles/17011149511795ANALOG_PAGE_68-71.pdf

Also notice that power is recorded as a pulse (usually optically  isolated). This suggests that any unusual Power line  condition that  results in a reading error can only cause a meter Increment (there is  NO Meter decrement function), so unlike old meters there is no way to  make the meter run backwards. Even if you actually source power such as  from a solar cell array.
 OK so what are the PFC caps doing 

AC Line filtering  right at the meter (removes aliasing, important for very high Harmonic  distortion loads, such as a load with lots of PC's)
AC  couples Line and Neutral, so large transient voltages on the Line are  not seen by the meter chip (become "common mode")(kind of like PSRR /  CMRR system spec, (remember meter only increments)
 Filtering out-of-band AC signals, Broadband PLC modems, Narrowband PLC modems, X10 signals.

 BTW:  although Analog Devices certainly knows what they are doing, many  second tier semiconductor companies, that also try to do these meter  chips, really don't have a clue, result all measurement errors are  extra "real power" for the consumer
If my assumptions are correct than the correct system location for the PFC cap is directly across the meter, not at the load.
How can the measurement error occur:
Most E-meter's use an ADC  (analog to digital converter) based on Audio Sigma Delta technology. If  you want the power of the meter chip to be very low than you reduce the  "over sample ratio" (If all signal content was at 50Hz (line freq) than  in theory a second order sigma delta with a 10 times over sample ratio  (sample frequency = 500Hz) would be adequate. Unfortunately 500Hz is  only the 10th harmonic so a LOT of (switched mode power supplies) SMPS  especially under light load, will consume a lot of their power at the  10th harmonic of the Line frequency (60Hz in the US), this could be  completely misread by a low sampling frequency ADC.
For Narrow Band PLC (auto matic meter reading) the signal on the  AC-line can be as high as 10Vp-p typically around 140Khz this is WAY  out of band and needs to be removed before the ADC by an RC filter,  many cheaper systems failed to use such a filter. As a result the Sigma  Delta will often lock to this as some sort of "residual clock" remember  these meter chips are typically a spin-off from Audio converters (In  the case of Audio, aliasing to DC the residual Clock,from some cheap  DAC, is a very good feature to have) In the case of a E-Meter chip it  could mean a +-5% error.
Most of the problems I have mentioned would be significantly  reduced by a nice big cap right across the E-meter, hence my assumption  that this is in reality what the PFC caps are doing.
note: On re-reading the post I noticed that it seems to imply that Analog  Devices is complicit in some sort of conspiracy against consumers,  which I do not believe, at all.







Updates:
I have removed comments I had earlier from promoters of these scams because it became apparent that their arguments were adding nothing to the discussion and making this article more tedious to read. The arguments are always the same, namely a) my bills are lower, why don't you want to see them b) it's NASA approved c) recommended by the governments and universities but without links d) I don't know what I am talking about e) various promotional press releases and when that doesn't work, Ad hominem attacks. 
I have contacted NASA for their opinion and position on the so called "NASA approved" claim, based on what looks like an old interoffice memorandum and will post their reply here when I get one.
I also encourage everyone to report these scams using the FTC so that they can track them. Unless many people complain, nothing will be done to crack down on types of scams. A good way to approach it is to quote the DOE/ENERGYSTAR site "We have not seen any data that proves these types of products for residential use accomplish what they claim. Power factor correction devices improve power quality but do not generally improve energy efficiency (meaning they won't reduce your energy bill)." and then point out that these people are claiming 25-30% savings for residential (not commercial) customers. Reviewers at the FTC will probably take the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy as a trusted source even if they don't understand the technology. The gulf between the governmental source "they won't reduce your energy bill" and the scammer's "Save 30% on your electric bill" will be a clear indication of fraud worthy of investigation. 
Additionally, anytime you see one of these products claiming to be ENERGYSTAR qualified or displaying the logo, please consider this: "ENERGY STAR does not qualify any Power Factor Correction Devices. Please send us an email at logomisuse@energystar.gov if you see one that claims to be ENERGY STAR certified. "
