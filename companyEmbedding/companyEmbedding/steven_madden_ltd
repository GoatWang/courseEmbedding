Life and career[edit]
Madden was born in Far Rockaway, Queens, and has Irish and Jewish ancestry.[1] He grew up in adjoining Lawrence and graduated from the local high school[2][3] in Nassau County, New York.[4][5] The youngest of three brothers, he started the company with $1,100 in 1990 by selling shoes out of the trunk of his car.
Criminal conviction[edit]
Madden's financial affairs were closely entangled with Long Island "pump and dump" brokerage house Stratton Oakmont, cofounded by Madden's childhood friend Danny Porush.
In June 2000, a class action lawsuit was filed against Madden for issuing materially false and misleading statements during the Class Period.[6] A settlement of $9,000,000 was reached in 2004.[7] In 2001, the SEC filed charges against Madden in Federal Court in New York state, alleging SEC violations.[8] Because the violations were not criminal in nature, the SEC was seeking to recover $1,637,000 in a combination of illegally avoided losses, interest, and a civil penalty.
In 2002, Madden was convicted of stock manipulation, money, and securities fraud. He was sentenced to 31 months in prison, and was made to resign as CEO from Steven Madden, Ltd. and from the board of directors.[9] Shortly after resigning as CEO, Madden set himself up as a creative consultant with Steven Madden, Ltd., a position for which he drew $700,000 even when he was in prison.[9]
Madden served time in the Federal Prison Camp, Eglin, at Eglin Air Force Base, and later the Coleman Federal Correctional Complex, near Ocala, Florida. Madden was released from prison in April 2005.[10] He then attended a New York City halfway house.[11] Madden's attorney, Joel Winograd, said that Madden would stay at the house for 60 days.[12] After his release from a halfway house, he was restricted to home confinement for a period.[13]
Post-Release[edit]
Since Madden was released from prison in 2005, the company quickly rebounded, increasing revenue by nearly $100 million in 2006 to $475.1 million.[14] That same year, Steven Madden, Ltd. was named ‘Company of the Year’ for the second time at the Footwear News Achievement Awards. [15]
With Madden currently serving as the founder and design chief, the company continues to show growth year-over-year reporting $1.41 billion in revenue for FY2015.[16]
Madden has also contributed to various charities and organizations, including the The Doe Fund, which helps develop and implement cost-effective, holistic programs that meet the needs of a diverse population working to break the cycles of homelessness, addiction and criminal recidivism.[17]
In popular culture[edit]
Steve Madden (played by Jake Hoffman) is featured in the Martin Scorsese film The Wolf of Wall Street, which is based on the Jordan Belfort memoir of the same name. In the movie, Madden is seen visiting Stratton Oakmont, where Belfort gives the brokers a rousing pep talk about pushing Madden's stock.[18] After viewing the film, Madden criticized the portrayal of him as "too nerdy."[19]
Personal life[edit]
Madden married Wendy Ballew, his former director of operations, in 2005 after he was released from prison. The couple have three children, twins Jack and Stevie Madden,[20] and Goldie Ryan Madden.[21] The couple divorced in 2015.[22]

Life and career[edit]
Madden was born in Far Rockaway, Queens, and has Irish and Jewish ancestry.[1] He grew up in adjoining Lawrence and graduated from the local high school[2][3] in Nassau County, New York.[4][5] The youngest of three brothers, he started the company with $1,100 in 1990 by selling shoes out of the trunk of his car.
Criminal conviction[edit]
Madden's financial affairs were closely entangled with Long Island "pump and dump" brokerage house Stratton Oakmont, cofounded by Madden's childhood friend Danny Porush.
In June 2000, a class action lawsuit was filed against Madden for issuing materially false and misleading statements during the Class Period.[6] A settlement of $9,000,000 was reached in 2004.[7] In 2001, the SEC filed charges against Madden in Federal Court in New York state, alleging SEC violations.[8] Because the violations were not criminal in nature, the SEC was seeking to recover $1,637,000 in a combination of illegally avoided losses, interest, and a civil penalty.
In 2002, Madden was convicted of stock manipulation, money, and securities fraud. He was sentenced to 31 months in prison, and was made to resign as CEO from Steven Madden, Ltd. and from the board of directors.[9] Shortly after resigning as CEO, Madden set himself up as a creative consultant with Steven Madden, Ltd., a position for which he drew $700,000 even when he was in prison.[9]
Madden served time in the Federal Prison Camp, Eglin, at Eglin Air Force Base, and later the Coleman Federal Correctional Complex, near Ocala, Florida. Madden was released from prison in April 2005.[10] He then attended a New York City halfway house.[11] Madden's attorney, Joel Winograd, said that Madden would stay at the house for 60 days.[12] After his release from a halfway house, he was restricted to home confinement for a period.[13]
Post-Release[edit]
Since Madden was released from prison in 2005, the company quickly rebounded, increasing revenue by nearly $100 million in 2006 to $475.1 million.[14] That same year, Steven Madden, Ltd. was named ‘Company of the Year’ for the second time at the Footwear News Achievement Awards. [15]
With Madden currently serving as the founder and design chief, the company continues to show growth year-over-year reporting $1.41 billion in revenue for FY2015.[16]
Madden has also contributed to various charities and organizations, including the The Doe Fund, which helps develop and implement cost-effective, holistic programs that meet the needs of a diverse population working to break the cycles of homelessness, addiction and criminal recidivism.[17]
In popular culture[edit]
Steve Madden (played by Jake Hoffman) is featured in the Martin Scorsese film The Wolf of Wall Street, which is based on the Jordan Belfort memoir of the same name. In the movie, Madden is seen visiting Stratton Oakmont, where Belfort gives the brokers a rousing pep talk about pushing Madden's stock.[18] After viewing the film, Madden criticized the portrayal of him as "too nerdy."[19]
Personal life[edit]
Madden married Wendy Ballew, his former director of operations, in 2005 after he was released from prison. The couple have three children, twins Jack and Stevie Madden,[20] and Goldie Ryan Madden.[21] The couple divorced in 2015.[22]

Life and career[edit]
Madden was born in Far Rockaway, Queens, and has Irish and Jewish ancestry.[1] He grew up in adjoining Lawrence and graduated from the local high school[2][3] in Nassau County, New York.[4][5] The youngest of three brothers, he started the company with $1,100 in 1990 by selling shoes out of the trunk of his car.
Criminal conviction[edit]
Madden's financial affairs were closely entangled with Long Island "pump and dump" brokerage house Stratton Oakmont, cofounded by Madden's childhood friend Danny Porush.
In June 2000, a class action lawsuit was filed against Madden for issuing materially false and misleading statements during the Class Period.[6] A settlement of $9,000,000 was reached in 2004.[7] In 2001, the SEC filed charges against Madden in Federal Court in New York state, alleging SEC violations.[8] Because the violations were not criminal in nature, the SEC was seeking to recover $1,637,000 in a combination of illegally avoided losses, interest, and a civil penalty.
In 2002, Madden was convicted of stock manipulation, money, and securities fraud. He was sentenced to 31 months in prison, and was made to resign as CEO from Steven Madden, Ltd. and from the board of directors.[9] Shortly after resigning as CEO, Madden set himself up as a creative consultant with Steven Madden, Ltd., a position for which he drew $700,000 even when he was in prison.[9]
Madden served time in the Federal Prison Camp, Eglin, at Eglin Air Force Base, and later the Coleman Federal Correctional Complex, near Ocala, Florida. Madden was released from prison in April 2005.[10] He then attended a New York City halfway house.[11] Madden's attorney, Joel Winograd, said that Madden would stay at the house for 60 days.[12] After his release from a halfway house, he was restricted to home confinement for a period.[13]
Post-Release[edit]
Since Madden was released from prison in 2005, the company quickly rebounded, increasing revenue by nearly $100 million in 2006 to $475.1 million.[14] That same year, Steven Madden, Ltd. was named ‘Company of the Year’ for the second time at the Footwear News Achievement Awards. [15]
With Madden currently serving as the founder and design chief, the company continues to show growth year-over-year reporting $1.41 billion in revenue for FY2015.[16]
Madden has also contributed to various charities and organizations, including the The Doe Fund, which helps develop and implement cost-effective, holistic programs that meet the needs of a diverse population working to break the cycles of homelessness, addiction and criminal recidivism.[17]
In popular culture[edit]
Steve Madden (played by Jake Hoffman) is featured in the Martin Scorsese film The Wolf of Wall Street, which is based on the Jordan Belfort memoir of the same name. In the movie, Madden is seen visiting Stratton Oakmont, where Belfort gives the brokers a rousing pep talk about pushing Madden's stock.[18] After viewing the film, Madden criticized the portrayal of him as "too nerdy."[19]
Personal life[edit]
Madden married Wendy Ballew, his former director of operations, in 2005 after he was released from prison. The couple have three children, twins Jack and Stevie Madden,[20] and Goldie Ryan Madden.[21] The couple divorced in 2015.[22]
Awards and honors[edit]

Footwear News Person of the Year Award (December 2011)[23]
NASDAQ Honors Steve Madden & 20 Year Anniversary (June 2010)[24]
Two Ten Foundation Honors Steve Madden (June 2010)[25]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Life and career[edit]
Madden was born in Far Rockaway, Queens, and has Irish and Jewish ancestry.[1] He grew up in adjoining Lawrence and graduated from the local high school[2][3] in Nassau County, New York.[4][5] The youngest of three brothers, he started the company with $1,100 in 1990 by selling shoes out of the trunk of his car.
Criminal conviction[edit]
Madden's financial affairs were closely entangled with Long Island "pump and dump" brokerage house Stratton Oakmont, cofounded by Madden's childhood friend Danny Porush.
In June 2000, a class action lawsuit was filed against Madden for issuing materially false and misleading statements during the Class Period.[6] A settlement of $9,000,000 was reached in 2004.[7] In 2001, the SEC filed charges against Madden in Federal Court in New York state, alleging SEC violations.[8] Because the violations were not criminal in nature, the SEC was seeking to recover $1,637,000 in a combination of illegally avoided losses, interest, and a civil penalty.
In 2002, Madden was convicted of stock manipulation, money, and securities fraud. He was sentenced to 31 months in prison, and was made to resign as CEO from Steven Madden, Ltd. and from the board of directors.[9] Shortly after resigning as CEO, Madden set himself up as a creative consultant with Steven Madden, Ltd., a position for which he drew $700,000 even when he was in prison.[9]
Madden served time in the Federal Prison Camp, Eglin, at Eglin Air Force Base, and later the Coleman Federal Correctional Complex, near Ocala, Florida. Madden was released from prison in April 2005.[10] He then attended a New York City halfway house.[11] Madden's attorney, Joel Winograd, said that Madden would stay at the house for 60 days.[12] After his release from a halfway house, he was restricted to home confinement for a period.[13]
Post-Release[edit]
Since Madden was released from prison in 2005, the company quickly rebounded, increasing revenue by nearly $100 million in 2006 to $475.1 million.[14] That same year, Steven Madden, Ltd. was named ‘Company of the Year’ for the second time at the Footwear News Achievement Awards. [15]
With Madden currently serving as the founder and design chief, the company continues to show growth year-over-year reporting $1.41 billion in revenue for FY2015.[16]
Madden has also contributed to various charities and organizations, including the The Doe Fund, which helps develop and implement cost-effective, holistic programs that meet the needs of a diverse population working to break the cycles of homelessness, addiction and criminal recidivism.[17]
In popular culture[edit]
Steve Madden (played by Jake Hoffman) is featured in the Martin Scorsese film The Wolf of Wall Street, which is based on the Jordan Belfort memoir of the same name. In the movie, Madden is seen visiting Stratton Oakmont, where Belfort gives the brokers a rousing pep talk about pushing Madden's stock.[18] After viewing the film, Madden criticized the portrayal of him as "too nerdy."[19]
Personal life[edit]
Madden married Wendy Ballew, his former director of operations, in 2005 after he was released from prison. The couple have three children, twins Jack and Stevie Madden,[20] and Goldie Ryan Madden.[21] The couple divorced in 2015.[22]

LOLO


Play all


        Meet LOLO - the Tennessee-bred singer who has traveled all around the world to find her place, only to have found her voice where she left it: home. Lauren Pritchard, aka LOLO, has been hustling and making a name for herself for over a decade since she started pestering her parents about her desire to become a recording artist and songwriter. LOLO grew up doing regional theatre in her hometown of Nashville before convincing her mother to move to Los Angeles at the age of fifteen. She even found herself living with Lisa Marie Presley and her daughter for a little while before landing the role as the rebel character of Ilse in the hit Broadway musical, Spring Awakening in New York City. In 2010, LOLO moved to London after signing a record deal and released a full-length album under her given name. After realizing she needed to go back to her roots, she moved back to the States, landing back at home in Memphis and in Brooklyn to work on new music with guitarist, Josh Hoisington. Together, they recorded and released the Comeback Queen EP last year. Fast forward to March of 2016, where the duo opened up for Ryn Weaver at our Steve Madden Music event at Brooklyn's Music Hall of Williamsburg. We instantly fell in love with them and just had to let LOLO pour out her emotions and tell her story to us in our NYC showroom.

TORI KELLY


Play all


        When she was 14, Tori Kelly started writing songs in the bedroom of her Southern California home. Within years she began sharing those songs online, and quickly won over Internet audiences with her sweetly soaring vocals, graceful guitar-playing, and knack for blending breezy melodies with boldly heart-on-sleeve lyrics. A musical purist who began singing at age three and learned to play drums and guitar by the time she was 16, Kelly forgoes over-the-top production in favor of laying bare her natural musicianship and ingenuity in songwriting. The daughter of two musicians, Kelly was raised with a deep love of music.While she lists artists as eclectic as Lauryn Hill, Jill Scott, Jeff Buckley, and Maxwell as key inspirations, Kelly credits her early exposure to gospel singers like Crystal Lewis and J. Moss as a crucial influence on her moving and masterful vocal work.Upon taking part in her first singing competition at age six, Kelly decided to dedicate her life to making music. For much of her early- to mid-teen years, Kelly focused on honing her songwriting and experimenting with self-production with the help of her computer's GarageBand app. During that time she began to gain a globe-spanning following through YouTube, thanks to her faithful posting of inspired covers and original songs that showcased her ethereal vocals and subtly confident guitar-playing.In the past year alone, Kelly has sold out shows in several major cities, headlined a nine-city sold-out U.S. tour, and supported Jewel and Ed Sheeran on tour. She has also graced the pages of Elle, Glamour, and Teen Vogue. But for Kelly, the fact that her evolution from Internet sensation to "It girl" took years of effort is a major point of pride.

Life and career[edit]
Madden was born in Far Rockaway, Queens, and has Irish and Jewish ancestry.[1] He grew up in adjoining Lawrence and graduated from the local high school[2][3] in Nassau County, New York.[4][5] The youngest of three brothers, he started the company with $1,100 in 1990 by selling shoes out of the trunk of his car.
Criminal conviction[edit]
Madden's financial affairs were closely entangled with Long Island "pump and dump" brokerage house Stratton Oakmont, cofounded by Madden's childhood friend Danny Porush.
In June 2000, a class action lawsuit was filed against Madden for issuing materially false and misleading statements during the Class Period.[6] A settlement of $9,000,000 was reached in 2004.[7] In 2001, the SEC filed charges against Madden in Federal Court in New York state, alleging SEC violations.[8] Because the violations were not criminal in nature, the SEC was seeking to recover $1,637,000 in a combination of illegally avoided losses, interest, and a civil penalty.
In 2002, Madden was convicted of stock manipulation, money, and securities fraud. He was sentenced to 31 months in prison, and was made to resign as CEO from Steven Madden, Ltd. and from the board of directors.[9] Shortly after resigning as CEO, Madden set himself up as a creative consultant with Steven Madden, Ltd., a position for which he drew $700,000 even when he was in prison.[9]
Madden served time in the Federal Prison Camp, Eglin, at Eglin Air Force Base, and later the Coleman Federal Correctional Complex, near Ocala, Florida. Madden was released from prison in April 2005.[10] He then attended a New York City halfway house.[11] Madden's attorney, Joel Winograd, said that Madden would stay at the house for 60 days.[12] After his release from a halfway house, he was restricted to home confinement for a period.[13]
Post-Release[edit]
Since Madden was released from prison in 2005, the company quickly rebounded, increasing revenue by nearly $100 million in 2006 to $475.1 million.[14] That same year, Steven Madden, Ltd. was named ‘Company of the Year’ for the second time at the Footwear News Achievement Awards. [15]
With Madden currently serving as the founder and design chief, the company continues to show growth year-over-year reporting $1.41 billion in revenue for FY2015.[16]
Madden has also contributed to various charities and organizations, including the The Doe Fund, which helps develop and implement cost-effective, holistic programs that meet the needs of a diverse population working to break the cycles of homelessness, addiction and criminal recidivism.[17]
In popular culture[edit]
Steve Madden (played by Jake Hoffman) is featured in the Martin Scorsese film The Wolf of Wall Street, which is based on the Jordan Belfort memoir of the same name. In the movie, Madden is seen visiting Stratton Oakmont, where Belfort gives the brokers a rousing pep talk about pushing Madden's stock.[18] After viewing the film, Madden criticized the portrayal of him as "too nerdy."[19]
Personal life[edit]
Madden married Wendy Ballew, his former director of operations, in 2005 after he was released from prison. The couple have three children, twins Jack and Stevie Madden,[20] and Goldie Ryan Madden.[21] The couple divorced in 2015.[22]
Awards and honors[edit]

Life and career[edit]
Madden was born in Far Rockaway, Queens, and has Irish and Jewish ancestry.[1] He grew up in adjoining Lawrence and graduated from the local high school[2][3] in Nassau County, New York.[4][5] The youngest of three brothers, he started the company with $1,100 in 1990 by selling shoes out of the trunk of his car.
Criminal conviction[edit]
Madden's financial affairs were closely entangled with Long Island "pump and dump" brokerage house Stratton Oakmont, cofounded by Madden's childhood friend Danny Porush.
In June 2000, a class action lawsuit was filed against Madden for issuing materially false and misleading statements during the Class Period.[6] A settlement of $9,000,000 was reached in 2004.[7] In 2001, the SEC filed charges against Madden in Federal Court in New York state, alleging SEC violations.[8] Because the violations were not criminal in nature, the SEC was seeking to recover $1,637,000 in a combination of illegally avoided losses, interest, and a civil penalty.
In 2002, Madden was convicted of stock manipulation, money, and securities fraud. He was sentenced to 31 months in prison, and was made to resign as CEO from Steven Madden, Ltd. and from the board of directors.[9] Shortly after resigning as CEO, Madden set himself up as a creative consultant with Steven Madden, Ltd., a position for which he drew $700,000 even when he was in prison.[9]
Madden served time in the Federal Prison Camp, Eglin, at Eglin Air Force Base, and later the Coleman Federal Correctional Complex, near Ocala, Florida. Madden was released from prison in April 2005.[10] He then attended a New York City halfway house.[11] Madden's attorney, Joel Winograd, said that Madden would stay at the house for 60 days.[12] After his release from a halfway house, he was restricted to home confinement for a period.[13]
Post-Release[edit]
Since Madden was released from prison in 2005, the company quickly rebounded, increasing revenue by nearly $100 million in 2006 to $475.1 million.[14] That same year, Steven Madden, Ltd. was named ‘Company of the Year’ for the second time at the Footwear News Achievement Awards. [15]
With Madden currently serving as the founder and design chief, the company continues to show growth year-over-year reporting $1.41 billion in revenue for FY2015.[16]
Madden has also contributed to various charities and organizations, including the The Doe Fund, which helps develop and implement cost-effective, holistic programs that meet the needs of a diverse population working to break the cycles of homelessness, addiction and criminal recidivism.[17]
In popular culture[edit]
Steve Madden (played by Jake Hoffman) is featured in the Martin Scorsese film The Wolf of Wall Street, which is based on the Jordan Belfort memoir of the same name. In the movie, Madden is seen visiting Stratton Oakmont, where Belfort gives the brokers a rousing pep talk about pushing Madden's stock.[18] After viewing the film, Madden criticized the portrayal of him as "too nerdy."[19]
Personal life[edit]
Madden married Wendy Ballew, his former director of operations, in 2005 after he was released from prison. The couple have three children, twins Jack and Stevie Madden,[20] and Goldie Ryan Madden.[21] The couple divorced in 2015.[22]

SHOO - Stock Valuation Report
 Trade 

Shares of Steven Madden Ltd. (SHOO) broke into a new 52-week high yesterday, hitting a peak of $41.70. 
Shares closed at $41.60 after opening at $41.25 for a move of 1.09%. The company now has a market cap of $2.47 billion.

Investors and traders can learn a lot about a stock’s momentum when it sets a new 52-week high. As an example, bullish investors view a company hitting its highest price in a year as a sign of 
momentum and may interpret it as a signal to buy. On the other hand, bearish investors could view a new 52-week high as a signal of the end of a strong run, with the stock possibly peaking out 
before an impending period of decline.


For Steven Madden Ltd., the new 52-week high came on volume of 355,006. The stock has a float of 59.45 million shares and average daily volume of $463,514. It has a

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Steve Madden Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth           Celebrity Net Worth  Search Random  Steve Madden Net WorthHow much is Steve Madden Worth? in Richest Businessmen › DesignersShare on FacebookShare on TwitterRandom CelebritySteve Madden net worth:$120 Million Steve Madden, founder and CEO of the shoe company Steve Madden Ltd., had a net worth of $120 million. In addition to his net worth, he's earned the pride that comes from heading one of America's most successful companies, a company which has earned "Company of the Year" Award at the Footwear News Achievement Awards in 2006.  But Madden hasn't been free of the kind of dirty business that often plagues successful businessmen and CEOs. In 2001, Madden had charges filed against him by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the nature of which was related to the "pump and dump" financial firm Stratton Oakmont. A year later, in 2002, Madden was sentenced to 41 months in prison for stock manipulation and securities fraud, among other charges. During his stint in prison, Madden had to resign as CEO of Steve Madden Ltd., but shortly after he accepted a position with the company as a "creative consultant." This position allowed him to continue drawing a salary of $700,000 a year while in prison! After this prison sentence had been served, Madden had to live in a halfway house for 60 days, in New York City, after which he remained under house confinement for a given period.
