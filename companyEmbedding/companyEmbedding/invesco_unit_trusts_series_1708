Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Build America Bonds Income Trust (BABS0034)
	
		





Objective
		  	
		
		Build America Bonds are new taxable municipal bonds created from the $787 billion stimulus package passed in 2009 by Congress. The purpose of the bonds is to build and repair America's roads, bridges, transit and rail systems, schools, ports and inland waterways, and other infrastructure, while stimulating the U.S. economy and job growth. Van Kampen Unit Trusts provide investors with convenient access to a diversified portfolio of taxable municipal bonds with a low minimum investment, consistent monthly income, daily liquidity and transparency.




Investment objective The trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital. The trust invests in a portfolio of long-term taxable municipal bonds, primarily consisting of "Build America Bonds". As of the date of deposit, the trust will invest at least 80% of its assets in Build America Bonds, and may include other taxable municipal bonds for purposes of diversification.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.The trust is more susceptible to political, economic, regulatory, or other factors affecting issuers of California municipal securities than a trust that does not limit its investment to such issues. The state of California is currently in the midst of a severe economic recession.

1The S&P and Moody's ratings apply to the bonds held by the trust, and not the trust itself.   A Standard & Poor's credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.


1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.

About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.The trust is more susceptible to political, economic, regulatory, or other factors affecting issuers of California municipal securities than a trust that does not limit its investment to such issues. The state of California is currently in the midst of a severe economic recession.

For individual series that have terminated, performance data quoted is from the deposit date through the termination date.Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Returns With Sales Charge reflect the maximum sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data
Returns Without Sales Charge do not reflect any sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.
There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. Certain trusts are unmanaged and their portfolios are not intended to change during the trusts' lives except in limited circumstances. Certain trusts are passively managed and seek to track their target index during the trust's life. For a more complete discussion of the risks of investing in this trust, click on the Fact Card.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.

There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.The trust is more susceptible to political, economic, regulatory, or other factors affecting issuers of California municipal securities than a trust that does not limit its investment to such issues. The state of California is currently in the midst of a severe economic recession.

Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc.

It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

		Performance quoted is past performance and cannot guarantee comparable future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Investment return and principal value will vary so that you may have a gain or a loss when you sell shares. 


		
		Performance figures reflect reinvested distributions and changes in net asset value (NAV) and the effect of the maximum sales charge unless otherwise stated.


		
		Class Y shares have no sales charge; therefore, performance is at NAV. Class Y shares are closed to most investors. Please see the prospectus for more details.


Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, returns would have been lower.


		
		Class Y share's inception date is October 3, 2008; returns since that date are historical returns. All other returns are blended returns of historical Class Y share performance and restated Class A share performance (for periods prior to the inception date of Class Y shares) at net asset value and reflect the Rule 12b-1 fees applicable to Class A shares. Class A shares inception date is October 31, 2005.

Fact Sheet








 About risk
			 


Allocation Risk. The Fund’s investment performance depends, in part,
on how its assets are allocated among the underlying funds or asset
classes. The Adviser’s evaluations and assumptions regarding the asset
classes or the underlying funds in which the Fund invests may be incorrect,
causing the Fund to be invested (or not invested) in one or more asset
classes or underlying funds at an inopportune time, which could negatively
affect the Fund’s performance.

Depositary Receipts Risk. Investing in depositary receipts involve the
same risks as direct investments in foreign securities. In addition, the
underlying issuers of certain depositary receipts are under no obligation to
distribute shareholder communications or pass through any voting rights
with respect to the deposited securities to the holders of such receipts. An
underlying fund may therefore receive less timely information or have less
control than if it invested directly in the foreign issuer.

 Derivatives Risk. The value of a derivative instrument depends largely on
(and is derived from) the value of an underlying security, currency,
commodity, interest rate, index or other asset (each referred to as an
underlying asset). In addition to risks relating to the underlying assets, the
use of derivatives may include other, possibly greater, risks, including
counterparty, leverage and liquidity risks. Counterparty risk is the risk that
the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay
an underlying fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the
derivative contract. Derivatives create leverage risk because they do not
require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning
the derivative. As a result, an adverse change in the value of the underlying
asset could result in an underlying fund sustaining a loss that is
substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative, which may
make an underlying fund’s returns more volatile and increase the risk of
loss. Derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional
investments and an underlying fund may be unable to sell or close out its
derivative positions at a desirable time or price. This risk may be more acute
under adverse market conditions, during which an underlying fund may be
most in need of liquidating its derivative positions. Derivatives may also be
harder to value, less tax efficient and subject to changing government
regulation that could impact an underlying fund’s ability to use certain derivatives or their cost. Also, derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit
exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected
benefits, particularly during adverse market conditions.

 Dividend Paying Security Risk. Securities that pay high dividends as a
group can fall out of favor with the market, causing such companies to
underperform companies that do not pay high dividends. Also, changes in
the dividend policies of the companies in an underlying fund’s underlying
index and the capital resources available for such companies’ dividend
payments may affect an underlying fund.

 Emerging Markets Securities Risk. Emerging markets (also referred to
as developing markets) are generally subject to greater market volatility,
political, social and economic instability, uncertain trading markets and more
governmental limitations on foreign investment than more developed
markets. In addition, companies operating in emerging markets may be
subject to lower trading volume and greater price fluctuations than
companies in more developed markets. Securities law and the enforcement
of systems of taxation in many emerging market countries may change
quickly and unpredictably. In addition, investments in emerging markets
securities may also be subject to additional transaction costs, delays in
settlement procedures, and lack of timely information.

 Exchange-Traded Fund Industry Concentration Risk. In following its
methodology, an underlying exchange-traded fund’s underlying index from
time to time may be concentrated to a significant degree in securities of
issuers located in a single industry or sector. To the extent that an
underlying fund’s underlying index concentrates in the securities of issuers
in a particular industry or sector, an underlying fund will also concentrate its
investments to approximately the same extent. By concentrating its
investments in an industry or sector, an underlying fund faces more risks
than if it were diversified broadly over numerous industries or sectors. Such
industry-based risks, any of which may adversely affect the companies in
which an underlying fund invests, may include, but are not limited to, the
following: general economic conditions or cyclical market patterns that could
negatively affect supply and demand in a particular industry; competition for
resources, adverse labor relations, political or world events; obsolescence of
technologies; and increased competition or new product introductions that
may affect the profitability or viability of companies in an industry. In
addition, at times, such industry or sector may be out of favor and
underperform other industries or the market as a whole.

 Exchange-Traded Funds Risk. In addition to the risks associated with
the underlying assets held by the exchange-traded fund, investments in
exchange-traded funds are subject to the following additional risks: (1) an
exchange-traded fund’s shares may trade above or below its net asset
value; (2) an active trading market for the exchange-traded fund’s shares
may not develop or be maintained; (3) trading an exchange-traded fund’s
shares may be halted by the listing exchange; (4) a passively-managed
exchange-traded fund may not track the performance of the reference
asset; and (5) a passively managed exchange-traded fund may hold
troubled securities. Investment in exchange-traded funds may involve
duplication of management fees and certain other expenses, as the Fund or
an underlying fund indirectly bears its proportionate share of any expenses
paid by the exchange-traded funds in which it invests. Further, certain
exchange-traded funds in which the Fund or an underlying fund may invest
are leveraged, which may result in economic leverage, permitting the Fund
or an underlying fund to gain exposure that is greater than would be the
case in an unlevered instrument, and potentially resulting in greater
volatility.

Financial Services Sector Risk. An underlying fund may be susceptible
to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting the financial
services sector. Financial services companies are subject to extensive
government regulation and are disproportionately affected by unstable
interest rates, each of which could adversely affect the profitability of such
companies. Financial services companies may also have concentrated
portfolios, which makes them especially vulnerable to unstable economic
conditions. 

Foreign Securities Risk. An underlying fund’s foreign investments may
be adversely affected by political and social instability, changes in economic
or taxation policies, difficulty in enforcing obligations, decreased liquidity or
increased volatility. Foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible
seizure, nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits (in
which an underlying fund could lose its entire investments in a certain
market) and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such
as exchange controls. Unless an underlying fund has hedged its foreign
securities risk, foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative
foreign currency rate fluctuations, which may cause the value of securities
denominated in such foreign currency (or other instruments through which
an underlying fund has exposure to foreign currencies) to decline in value.
Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of
time. Currency hedging strategies, if used, are not always successful.

 Fund of Funds Risk. The Fund’s performance depends on that of the
underlying funds in which it invests. Accordingly, the risks associated with
an investment in the Fund include the risks associated with investments in
the underlying funds. The Fund will indirectly pay a proportional share of the
fees and expenses of the underlying funds in which it invests. There are
risks that the Fund will vary from its target weightings (if any) in the
underlying funds, that the underlying funds will not achieve their investment
objectives, that the underlying funds’ performance may be lower than their
represented asset classes, and that the Fund may withdraw its investments
in an underlying fund at a disadvantageous time.

 Geographic Focus Risk. An underlying fund may from time to time
invest a substantial amount of its assets in securities of issuers located in a
single country or a limited number of countries. Adverse economic, political
or social conditions in those countries may therefore have a significant
negative impact on an underlying fund’s investment performance.

Growth Investing Risk. Growth stocks tend to be more expensive relative
to the issuing company’s earnings or assets compared with other types of
stock. As a result, they tend to be more sensitive to changes in, or investors’
expectations of, the issuing company’s earnings and can be more volatile.

 Indexing Risk. An underlying fund is operated as a passively managed
index fund and, therefore, the adverse performance of a particular security
necessarily will not result in the elimination of the security from the
underlying fund’s portfolio. Ordinarily, the underlying fund’s adviser will not
sell the underlying fund’s portfolio securities except to reflect additions or
deletions of the securities that comprise the underlying fund’s underlying
index, or as may be necessary to raise cash to pay underlying fund
shareholders who sell underlying fund shares. As such, the underlying fund
will be negatively affected by declines in the securities represented by its
underlying index. Also, there is no guarantee that the underlying fund’s
adviser will be able to correlate the underlying fund’s performance with that
of its underlying index.

 Investing in the European Union Risk. Investments in certain countries in
the European Union are susceptible to high economic risks associated with
high levels of debt, such as investments in sovereign debt of Greece, Italy
and Spain. Separately, the European Union faces issues involving its
membership, structure, procedures and policies. The exit of one or more
member states from the European Union would place its currency and
banking system in jeopardy. Efforts of the member states to further unify
their economic and monetary policies may increase the potential for the
downward movement of one member state’s market to cause a similar
effect on other member states’ markets.

 Management Risk. An underlying fund is actively managed and depends
heavily on an underlying fund’s adviser’s judgment about markets, interest
rates or the attractiveness, relative values, liquidity, or potential appreciation
of particular investments made for an underlying fund’s portfolio. An
underlying fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be
incorrect. Additionally, legislative, regulatory, or tax developments may
adversely affect management of an underlying fund and, therefore, the
ability of the underlying fund to achieve its investment objective.

Market Risk. The market values of an underlying fund’s investments,
and therefore the value of an underlying fund’s shares, will go up and down,
sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Market risk may affect a single issuer,
industry or section of the economy, or it may affect the market as a whole.
Individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those
of certain other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general
downturn in the financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in
value. When markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific
investments held by an underlying fund will rise in value.

 Market Trading Risk. An underlying exchange-traded fund faces
numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active
market for its shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, and
disruption in the creation/redemption process of an underlying fund. Any of
these factors may lead to an underlying fund’s shares trading at a premium
or discount to an underlying fund’s net asset value (NAV).

 Non-Diversification Risk. An underlying fund is non-diversified and can
invest a greater portion of its assets in the obligations or securities of a
small number of issuers or any single issuer than a diversified fund can. A
change in the value of one or a few issuers’ securities will therefore affect
the value of an underlying fund more than would occur in a diversified fund.

 Preferred Securities Risk. Preferred securities are subject to
issuer-specific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities.
Preferred securities also may be subordinated to bonds or other debt
instruments, subjecting them to a greater risk of non-payment, may be less
liquid than many other securities, such as common stocks, and generally
offer no voting rights with respect to the issuer.

 Sampling Risk. An underlying fund’s use of a representative sampling
approach will result in its holding a smaller number of securities than are in
its underlying index and in the underlying fund holding securities not
included in its underlying index. As a result, an adverse development
respecting an issuer of securities held by the underlying fund could result in
a greater decline in the underlying fund’s NAV than would be the case if all
of the securities in its underlying index were held. An underlying fund’s use
of a representative sampling approach may also include the risk that it may
not track the return of its underlying index as well as it would have if the
underlying fund held all of the securities in its underlying index.

 Sector Focus Risk. An underlying fund may from time to time invest a
significant amount of its assets (i.e. over 25%) in one market sector or
group of related industries. In this event, an underlying fund’s performance
will depend to a greater extent on the overall condition of the sector or
group of industries and there is increased risk that an underlying fund will
lose significant value if conditions adversely affect that sector or group of
industries.

 Small- and Mid-Capitalization Companies Risks. Small- and
mid-capitalization companies tend to be more vulnerable to changing
market conditions, may have little or no operating history or track record of
success, and may have more limited product lines and markets, less
experienced management and fewer financial resources than larger
companies. These companies’ securities may be more volatile and less
liquid than those of more established companies, and their returns may
vary, sometimes significantly, from the overall securities market.

Unique Economic and Political Risks of Investing in Greater China.
Investments in companies located or operating in Greater China involve risks
not associated with investments in Western nations, such as nationalization,
expropriation, or confiscation of property; difficulty in obtaining and/or
enforcing judgments; alteration or discontinuation of economic reforms;
military conflicts, either internal or with other countries; inflation, currency
fluctuations and fluctuations in inflation and interest rates that may have
negative effects on the economy and securities markets of Greater China;
and Greater China’s dependency on the economies of other Asian countries,
many of which are developing countries. Events in any one country within
Greater China may impact the other countries in the region or Greater China
as a whole. Additionally, developing countries, such as those in Greater
China, may subject an underlying fund’s investments to a number of tax rules, and the application of many of those rules may be uncertain.
Moreover, China has implemented a number of tax reforms in recent years,
and may amend or revise its existing tax laws and/or procedures in the
future, possibly with retroactive effect. Changes in applicable Chinese tax
law could reduce the after-tax profits of an underlying fund, directly or
indirectly, including by reducing the after-tax profits of companies in China
in which an underlying fund invests. Uncertainties in Chinese tax rules could
result in unexpected tax liabilities for an underlying fund.

 Value Investing Style Risk. A value investing style subjects an underlying
fund to the risk that the valuations never improve or that the returns on
value equity securities are less than returns on other styles of investing or
the overall stock market.

S&P PowerPicks Portfolio (PICK0162)
	
	




The information shown relates to a trust that is no longer offered for sale. This information does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy units of the trust.
Objective
The portfolio seeks above-average total return. The portfolio seeks to achieve its objective by investing in a portfolio of stocks selected by the Sponsor based upon recommendations made by S&P Capital IQ Equity Research, a division of Standard & Poor's Investment Advisory Services LLC (the "Portfolio Consultant").




The S&P PowerPicks Portfolio harnesses the industry experience of S&P Capital IQ Equity Research ("S&P"), a team of approximately 35 equity analysts. The S&P PowerPicks Portfolio packages the 40 top picks from these analysts into one simple investment.
Each January since 1997, analysts at S&P have identified the stocks they believe will out-perform the market in the following year, known as the S&P PowerPicks list, which are drawn from all 10 of the economic sectors that comprise the S&P 500 Index. Over the years, this list has gained increased media attention, including coverage by the Wall Street Journal. Beginning in 2004, S&P's began publishing a mid-year PowerPicks list. In November 2008, a PowerPicks list was selected between the publication of a mid-year and an annual list for the first time.
 You can now own the S&P PowerPicks list in one simple unit investment trust. 
Potential Advantages of the trust: 


Research Coverage Leadership Since 1941, S&P's has been a global provider of independent investment data, valuation and analysis in the equity, fixed income, foreign exchange and mutual fund markets. S&P's research and ratings are used by both retail and institutional clients. S&P's equity analysts prepare comprehensive semiannual industry surveys that provide a framework for evaluation of the potential prospects in each industry and are used by retail and institutional clients worldwide. 
Disciplined Process S&P's team conducts fundamental security analysis with broad coverage of approximately 1200 issues. Analysis includes visits to companies and with senior management. Individual picks are based on what the analyst believes is a stock's future capital appreciation potential versus the expected performance of the market over a period of 12 months. 
Convenience Through one convenient investment, you can own 40 of the best picks of S&P's analysts, companies they believe will out-perform the market over the next year.

1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.


The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.
The trust should be considered as a part of a long term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer's board of directors and the amount of anydividend may vary over time.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the Portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits and losses.
The portfolio's performance might not sufficiently correspond to published hypothetical performance of the portfolio's investment strategy. This can happen for reasons such as an inability to exactly replicate the weightings of stocks in the strategy or be fully invested, timing of the portfolio offering or timing of your investment, and portfolio expenses. The hypothetical performance presented is not the past performance of the portfolio.

The trust should be considered as a part of a long term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer's board of directors and the amount of anydividend may vary over time.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the Portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits and losses.
The portfolio's performance might not sufficiently correspond to published hypothetical performance of the portfolio's investment strategy. This can happen for reasons such as an inability to exactly replicate the weightings of stocks in the strategy or be fully invested, timing of the portfolio offering or timing of your investment, and portfolio expenses. The hypothetical performance presented is not the past performance of the portfolio.
