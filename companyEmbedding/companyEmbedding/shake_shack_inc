Shake Shack (NYSE: SHAK) is an American fast casual restaurant chain based in New York City. It started out as a food cart inside Madison Square Park in 2004, and its popularity steadily grew. It eventually moved to a stand within the park, expanding its menu from New York-style hotdogs to one with hamburgers, hotdogs, fries and its namesake milkshakes. The company claims to use all-natural 100% Angus beef only[1] and says that its meat has no hormones nor antibiotics.[2]
Since its founding it has been one of the fastest-growing food chains eventually becoming a public company filing for an initial public offering of stock in late 2014. The offering priced on January 29, 2015; the initial price of its shares was at $21 immediately rising by 123% to $47 on their first day of trading.[3][4][5][6]

History[edit]




The original Shake Shack located in Madison Square Park


In 2000, New York City began the rebuilding of Madison Square Park, which had fallen into a state of disrepair and misuse. As part of the redevelopment, restaurateur Danny Meyer helped spearhead the creation of the Madison Square Park Conservancy to help redevelop it. One of the first things the Conservancy did in its goal to improve the park was to host an art exhibit called "I <3 Taxi" inside of the park to raise awareness of the renewal effort.[7] Meyer's Director of operations, Randy Garutti, established a hot dog cart which was run out of the kitchen of Eleven Madison, one of Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group (USHG) operations. Over time the cart became extremely successful, and remained in operation for nearly three years.[8]
In 2004, the city began taking bids to operate a new kiosk-style restaurant within the park; Meyer outlined his idea for the space, and opened the first Shake Shack in July 2004. From its beginning the restaurant was not designed to be a chain, intended to be a single shop location designed specifically for New York City. However, as the original location's sales continued to grow, the group realized that there was a market for expansion.[8]
Since its opening, Shake Shack has grown to be the largest part of the USHG's portfolio. Its average store revenue of US$4 million is more than twice that of McDonald's average store revenue within the United States.[9] Its popularity is such that in the summer at its original location, the wait in line for service can stretch to over an hour, especially on weekends when the weather is pleasant. A webcam on the restaurant's web page shows the current line in real time.[9][10]
In June 2010, Shake Shack opened its first restaurant outside of New York City at the Lincoln Road Mall in Miami Beach's South Beach neighborhood.[11][12][13] In April 2017 the location completed a month-long renovation that added 586 square feet of space, bringing its seating capacity to 106.[14]
On July 12, 2010, Shake Shack restaurants were opened in the Theater District[15] and the Upper East Side.[16][17] The Upper East Side location's opening was significant because it "lifted" East 86th Street, an urban shopping district which had fallen on hard times; the location had been vacant, and even when occupied it was described by a neighbor as "never anything good there...dingy and dilapidated...almost an eyesore."[16]
In July 2011 it was announced that Shake Shack had reached a deal with the MTA to open a location in the lower level of Grand Central Terminal.[18] This project was delayed because the tenant occupying the space Shake Shack was to take over, Mexican eatery Zócalo, refused to vacate after the expiration of their lease and filed suit, arguing that the "bidding process (for retail space in Grand Central) is corrupted."[19] The suit was dismissed and Zócalo appealed. In October 2012 Zócalo filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[20] In early May 2013, Zócalo vacated the space, and the new outlet opened for business on October 5, 2013.[21]
By August 2014, Shake Shack outlets had begun operating in Connecticut, Washington, DC, Florida, Georgia, Chicago, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Texas.[22] That month, reports surfaced that the company was preparing to go public with an IPO and was discussing an underwriting with a number of investment banks, including J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.[22][23]
On January 29, 2015 Shake Shack priced its IPO at $21 per share. On the morning of January 30, 2015 it began trading on the NYSE at $47 per share under the ticker symbol SHAK. In April 2015, shares hit prices of $72, and hit a high of about $90 in May 2015.[24] In its IPO filing, the company stated that it planned to expand its domestic footprint to 450 company-operated stores. While no end date was given for that expansion, the company indicated its intention to open at least 10 restaurants each fiscal year, though it later amended that target to 12 a year and then again later in 2016 to 14 stores a year, a goal that would result in a total of 450 stores in approximately 25 years.[25] Later that May, Shake Shack filed for a trademark for the term "chicken shack" leading to speculation that the company would serve chicken sandwiches.[26] The company temporarily introduced chicken sandwiches to its Brooklyn on July 7, 2015.[27] In January 2016, Shake Shack introduced chicken sandwiches across locations in the United States, having previously started serving them at all Brooklyn Shake Shack locations.[28]
On August 31, 2016, Shake Shack announced it would begin room service at the Chicago Athletic Association Hotel, the first hotel in America to offer in-room Shake Shack.[29]
By March 2017 another opened inside Minute Maid Park in Downtown Houston. By mid-December Delaware opened its very first in New Castle. In February 2017, the first Michigan location was opened in downtown Detroit.[30] On May 10 of that year, Shake Shack opened their first Kentucky location, located at The Summit at Fritz Farm in Lexington.[31] That June, the company announced a location would open in Charlotte, North Carolina in late 2017, becoming the first Shake Shack in the Carolinas.[32]
International[edit]
Shake Shack has outlets in a number of international cities including Seoul, Tokyo, London, Cardiff, Istanbul, Moscow, Muscat, Beirut, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha, Kuwait City, Riyadh, Manama , Tehran and Jeddah.[22][33][34]
Menu[edit]




A "Shack Burger" and crinkle-cut French fries


Shake Shack's eponymous products are its milk shakes, which have been reviewed as some of the best in the industry.[9] As it has grown, the company has also added wine and bottled beers to its beverage menu. In each new location the beverage menu is customized to the local flavors of the city in which it operates.[35]
When the company first began to expand, it became famous for its burgers, which are made from Angus beef.[9] Despite this popularity, New York Times reviewer Pete Wilson stated in his 2012 review of the establishment that the burgers were sometimes insufficiently salted and cooked to an unappealing gray.[36]
The company originally used pre-made, frozen crinkle-cut french fries because its original location was only 400 sq ft (37 m2) in size, and the limited area disallowed any other style of fry product. As the chain grew, it was praised in multiple reviews for its high quality hamburgers, but its fries were routinely criticized as not being on par with its other products. In response, the company developed a new, fresh cut french fry product in 2013. However, consumers preferred the frozen, crinkle-cut fries and the company reverted to those in the fall of 2014.[9]
Collaborations[edit]
Shake Shack has collaborated with other food and design companies and chefs to create products to serve at their restaurants. Foods and beverages include a chocolate bar with Mast Brothers,[37] a coffee stout with La Colombe and Yards Brewing Company,[38] and limited edition burgers with Atlanta chef Ford Fry and Philadelphia chef Marc Vetri.[39]
Merchandising[edit]
The company has collaborated with Staple Design to create Shake Shack T-shirts.[40]

Shake Shack (NYSE: SHAK) is an American fast casual restaurant chain based in New York City. It started out as a food cart inside Madison Square Park in 2004, and its popularity steadily grew. It eventually moved to a stand within the park, expanding its menu from New York-style hotdogs to one with hamburgers, hotdogs, fries and its namesake milkshakes. The company claims to use all-natural 100% Angus beef only[1] and says that its meat has no hormones nor antibiotics.[2]
Since its founding it has been one of the fastest-growing food chains eventually becoming a public company filing for an initial public offering of stock in late 2014. The offering priced on January 29, 2015; the initial price of its shares was at $21 immediately rising by 123% to $47 on their first day of trading.[3][4][5][6]

History[edit]




The original Shake Shack located in Madison Square Park


In 2000, New York City began the rebuilding of Madison Square Park, which had fallen into a state of disrepair and misuse. As part of the redevelopment, restaurateur Danny Meyer helped spearhead the creation of the Madison Square Park Conservancy to help redevelop it. One of the first things the Conservancy did in its goal to improve the park was to host an art exhibit called "I <3 Taxi" inside of the park to raise awareness of the renewal effort.[7] Meyer's Director of operations, Randy Garutti, established a hot dog cart which was run out of the kitchen of Eleven Madison, one of Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group (USHG) operations. Over time the cart became extremely successful, and remained in operation for nearly three years.[8]
In 2004, the city began taking bids to operate a new kiosk-style restaurant within the park; Meyer outlined his idea for the space, and opened the first Shake Shack in July 2004. From its beginning the restaurant was not designed to be a chain, intended to be a single shop location designed specifically for New York City. However, as the original location's sales continued to grow, the group realized that there was a market for expansion.[8]
Since its opening, Shake Shack has grown to be the largest part of the USHG's portfolio. Its average store revenue of US$4 million is more than twice that of McDonald's average store revenue within the United States.[9] Its popularity is such that in the summer at its original location, the wait in line for service can stretch to over an hour, especially on weekends when the weather is pleasant. A webcam on the restaurant's web page shows the current line in real time.[9][10]
In June 2010, Shake Shack opened its first restaurant outside of New York City at the Lincoln Road Mall in Miami Beach's South Beach neighborhood.[11][12][13] In April 2017 the location completed a month-long renovation that added 586 square feet of space, bringing its seating capacity to 106.[14]
On July 12, 2010, Shake Shack restaurants were opened in the Theater District[15] and the Upper East Side.[16][17] The Upper East Side location's opening was significant because it "lifted" East 86th Street, an urban shopping district which had fallen on hard times; the location had been vacant, and even when occupied it was described by a neighbor as "never anything good there...dingy and dilapidated...almost an eyesore."[16]
In July 2011 it was announced that Shake Shack had reached a deal with the MTA to open a location in the lower level of Grand Central Terminal.[18] This project was delayed because the tenant occupying the space Shake Shack was to take over, Mexican eatery Zócalo, refused to vacate after the expiration of their lease and filed suit, arguing that the "bidding process (for retail space in Grand Central) is corrupted."[19] The suit was dismissed and Zócalo appealed. In October 2012 Zócalo filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[20] In early May 2013, Zócalo vacated the space, and the new outlet opened for business on October 5, 2013.[21]
By August 2014, Shake Shack outlets had begun operating in Connecticut, Washington, DC, Florida, Georgia, Chicago, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Texas.[22] That month, reports surfaced that the company was preparing to go public with an IPO and was discussing an underwriting with a number of investment banks, including J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.[22][23]
On January 29, 2015 Shake Shack priced its IPO at $21 per share. On the morning of January 30, 2015 it began trading on the NYSE at $47 per share under the ticker symbol SHAK. In April 2015, shares hit prices of $72, and hit a high of about $90 in May 2015.[24] In its IPO filing, the company stated that it planned to expand its domestic footprint to 450 company-operated stores. While no end date was given for that expansion, the company indicated its intention to open at least 10 restaurants each fiscal year, though it later amended that target to 12 a year and then again later in 2016 to 14 stores a year, a goal that would result in a total of 450 stores in approximately 25 years.[25] Later that May, Shake Shack filed for a trademark for the term "chicken shack" leading to speculation that the company would serve chicken sandwiches.[26] The company temporarily introduced chicken sandwiches to its Brooklyn on July 7, 2015.[27] In January 2016, Shake Shack introduced chicken sandwiches across locations in the United States, having previously started serving them at all Brooklyn Shake Shack locations.[28]
On August 31, 2016, Shake Shack announced it would begin room service at the Chicago Athletic Association Hotel, the first hotel in America to offer in-room Shake Shack.[29]
By March 2017 another opened inside Minute Maid Park in Downtown Houston. By mid-December Delaware opened its very first in New Castle. In February 2017, the first Michigan location was opened in downtown Detroit.[30] On May 10 of that year, Shake Shack opened their first Kentucky location, located at The Summit at Fritz Farm in Lexington.[31] That June, the company announced a location would open in Charlotte, North Carolina in late 2017, becoming the first Shake Shack in the Carolinas.[32]

Shake Shack has outlets in a number of international cities including Seoul, Tokyo, London, Cardiff, Istanbul, Moscow, Muscat, Beirut, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha, Kuwait City, Riyadh, Manama , Tehran and Jeddah.[22][33][34]

EASY.ReplyReplies (5)43AAntoniojust bought calls ha ha!ReplyReplies (2)21ffranzI think the day of reckoning will be when the internal growth slows above the new stores opening. You can't buy revenues for ever- and read the Motley Fool analysis. They are spot on. I say $25 before $50. You decide. Hugs and kisses- its a holiday weekend. I have BJ 90/10 burgers for the grill and my own special sauce. Its yummy and not $8 a burger.ReplyReplies (1)21QQTwo friends want to go out to eat. One wants burgers, while the other wants salad. Instead of going to Shake Shack, they go elsewhere. Shake Shack has lost a sale because they are oppose to adding at least, one healthy option to their menu. This is not good business. and so this is my pointReplyReplies (1)10LLoriThe last time SHAK did something like this it blew up. Ive been struggling with this stock lately. Some of my other trades have been from AWE.some.STOCKS which are working out pretty well.Reply11llouboycott shak, they believe in pride, #$%$..my money talks,....I rather starve or make my own burgers..p.s.  can you imagine if a chain says...we promote pro life...        its not free speech...its censorship.if #$%$ like their sponser, patronize them..and same goes withpeople who don't believe in that lifestyle..biology says...xx or  xycan't change that..its natural!ReplyReplies (1)11QQThe only real thing that matters to investors is the value of their investment.

Look at the chart for the past year: down to $14 today from $36 a year or so ago.

Shake Shack upgraded on growth prospects
Shake Shack Inc.  was upgraded to buy from neutral at Buckingham Research Group now that analysts say the company has passed its toughest "same-Shack" sales comparisons and is set up for growth. Buckingham maintained its $39 price target. The company has gotten past tough comparisons, reset guidance for the year for flat same-store sales versus growth of 2% to 3%, and continues to open restaurants "at very robust volumes," analysts wrote in a Friday note. As a result, they think Shake Shack can return to "the beat-raise pattern that existed prior to fourth-quarter 2016 results." Shake Shack shares are up 1.8% in Friday premarket trading, but down 7.5% for the year to date. The S&P 500 index  is up 6.7% for 2017 so far.

Shake Shack shares plunge as company sales growth slackens
Shares of Shake Shack Inc.  plunged more than 11% late Thursday after the fast-casual restaurant chain reported first-quarter earnings and sales above Wall Street expectations, but same-restaurant sales slackened. Shake Shack earned $2.27 million, or 9 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with $1.46 million, or 7 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusted for one-time items, the company earned 10 cents a share, compared with 8 cents a share a year ago. Revenue increased 41.7% to $76.7 million in the quarter, from $54.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected the company to report adjusted earnings of 8 cents a share on sales of $74.7 million. Same-restaurant sales decreased 2.5% for the quarter, versus 9.9% growth in the first quarter of last year. That decline consisted of a 3.4% decrease in guest traffic offset by a combined increase in price and sales mix of 0.9%, the company said. The analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected same-store sales growth of 0.5% in the quarter. Shake Shack also said it expects flat same-restaurant sales growth for the year, compared with 2016. The stock ended the regular trading session down 2.7%.

Shake Shack (NYSE: SHAK) is an American fast casual restaurant chain based in New York City. It started out as a food cart inside Madison Square Park in 2004, and its popularity steadily grew. It eventually moved to a stand within the park, expanding its menu from New York-style hotdogs to one with hamburgers, hotdogs, fries and its namesake milkshakes. The company claims to use all-natural 100% Angus beef only[1] and says that its meat has no hormones nor antibiotics.[2]
Since its founding it has been one of the fastest-growing food chains eventually becoming a public company filing for an initial public offering of stock in late 2014. The offering priced on January 29, 2015; the initial price of its shares was at $21 immediately rising by 123% to $47 on their first day of trading.[3][4][5][6]

History[edit]




The original Shake Shack located in Madison Square Park


In 2000, New York City began the rebuilding of Madison Square Park, which had fallen into a state of disrepair and misuse. As part of the redevelopment, restaurateur Danny Meyer helped spearhead the creation of the Madison Square Park Conservancy to help redevelop it. One of the first things the Conservancy did in its goal to improve the park was to host an art exhibit called "I <3 Taxi" inside of the park to raise awareness of the renewal effort.[7] Meyer's Director of operations, Randy Garutti, established a hot dog cart which was run out of the kitchen of Eleven Madison, one of Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group (USHG) operations. Over time the cart became extremely successful, and remained in operation for nearly three years.[8]
In 2004, the city began taking bids to operate a new kiosk-style restaurant within the park; Meyer outlined his idea for the space, and opened the first Shake Shack in July 2004. From its beginning the restaurant was not designed to be a chain, intended to be a single shop location designed specifically for New York City. However, as the original location's sales continued to grow, the group realized that there was a market for expansion.[8]
Since its opening, Shake Shack has grown to be the largest part of the USHG's portfolio. Its average store revenue of US$4 million is more than twice that of McDonald's average store revenue within the United States.[9] Its popularity is such that in the summer at its original location, the wait in line for service can stretch to over an hour, especially on weekends when the weather is pleasant. A webcam on the restaurant's web page shows the current line in real time.[9][10]
In June 2010, Shake Shack opened its first restaurant outside of New York City at the Lincoln Road Mall in Miami Beach's South Beach neighborhood.[11][12][13] In April 2017 the location completed a month-long renovation that added 586 square feet of space, bringing its seating capacity to 106.[14]
On July 12, 2010, Shake Shack restaurants were opened in the Theater District[15] and the Upper East Side.[16][17] The Upper East Side location's opening was significant because it "lifted" East 86th Street, an urban shopping district which had fallen on hard times; the location had been vacant, and even when occupied it was described by a neighbor as "never anything good there...dingy and dilapidated...almost an eyesore."[16]
In July 2011 it was announced that Shake Shack had reached a deal with the MTA to open a location in the lower level of Grand Central Terminal.[18] This project was delayed because the tenant occupying the space Shake Shack was to take over, Mexican eatery Zócalo, refused to vacate after the expiration of their lease and filed suit, arguing that the "bidding process (for retail space in Grand Central) is corrupted."[19] The suit was dismissed and Zócalo appealed. In October 2012 Zócalo filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[20] In early May 2013, Zócalo vacated the space, and the new outlet opened for business on October 5, 2013.[21]
By August 2014, Shake Shack outlets had begun operating in Connecticut, Washington, DC, Florida, Georgia, Chicago, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Texas.[22] That month, reports surfaced that the company was preparing to go public with an IPO and was discussing an underwriting with a number of investment banks, including J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.[22][23]
On January 29, 2015 Shake Shack priced its IPO at $21 per share. On the morning of January 30, 2015 it began trading on the NYSE at $47 per share under the ticker symbol SHAK. In April 2015, shares hit prices of $72, and hit a high of about $90 in May 2015.[24] In its IPO filing, the company stated that it planned to expand its domestic footprint to 450 company-operated stores. While no end date was given for that expansion, the company indicated its intention to open at least 10 restaurants each fiscal year, though it later amended that target to 12 a year and then again later in 2016 to 14 stores a year, a goal that would result in a total of 450 stores in approximately 25 years.[25] Later that May, Shake Shack filed for a trademark for the term "chicken shack" leading to speculation that the company would serve chicken sandwiches.[26] The company temporarily introduced chicken sandwiches to its Brooklyn on July 7, 2015.[27] In January 2016, Shake Shack introduced chicken sandwiches across locations in the United States, having previously started serving them at all Brooklyn Shake Shack locations.[28]
On August 31, 2016, Shake Shack announced it would begin room service at the Chicago Athletic Association Hotel, the first hotel in America to offer in-room Shake Shack.[29]
By March 2017 another opened inside Minute Maid Park in Downtown Houston. By mid-December Delaware opened its very first in New Castle. In February 2017, the first Michigan location was opened in downtown Detroit.[30] On May 10 of that year, Shake Shack opened their first Kentucky location, located at The Summit at Fritz Farm in Lexington.[31] That June, the company announced a location would open in Charlotte, North Carolina in late 2017, becoming the first Shake Shack in the Carolinas.[32]
International[edit]
Shake Shack has outlets in a number of international cities including Seoul, Tokyo, London, Cardiff, Istanbul, Moscow, Muscat, Beirut, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha, Kuwait City, Riyadh, Manama , Tehran and Jeddah.[22][33][34]
Menu[edit]




A "Shack Burger" and crinkle-cut French fries


Shake Shack's eponymous products are its milk shakes, which have been reviewed as some of the best in the industry.[9] As it has grown, the company has also added wine and bottled beers to its beverage menu. In each new location the beverage menu is customized to the local flavors of the city in which it operates.[35]
When the company first began to expand, it became famous for its burgers, which are made from Angus beef.[9] Despite this popularity, New York Times reviewer Pete Wilson stated in his 2012 review of the establishment that the burgers were sometimes insufficiently salted and cooked to an unappealing gray.[36]
The company originally used pre-made, frozen crinkle-cut french fries because its original location was only 400 sq ft (37 m2) in size, and the limited area disallowed any other style of fry product. As the chain grew, it was praised in multiple reviews for its high quality hamburgers, but its fries were routinely criticized as not being on par with its other products. In response, the company developed a new, fresh cut french fry product in 2013. However, consumers preferred the frozen, crinkle-cut fries and the company reverted to those in the fall of 2014.[9]
Collaborations[edit]
Shake Shack has collaborated with other food and design companies and chefs to create products to serve at their restaurants. Foods and beverages include a chocolate bar with Mast Brothers,[37] a coffee stout with La Colombe and Yards Brewing Company,[38] and limited edition burgers with Atlanta chef Ford Fry and Philadelphia chef Marc Vetri.[39]
Merchandising[edit]
The company has collaborated with Staple Design to create Shake Shack T-shirts.[40]

Shake Shack (NYSE: SHAK) is an American fast casual restaurant chain based in New York City. It started out as a food cart inside Madison Square Park in 2004, and its popularity steadily grew. It eventually moved to a stand within the park, expanding its menu from New York-style hotdogs to one with hamburgers, hotdogs, fries and its namesake milkshakes. The company claims to use all-natural 100% Angus beef only[1] and says that its meat has no hormones nor antibiotics.[2]
Since its founding it has been one of the fastest-growing food chains eventually becoming a public company filing for an initial public offering of stock in late 2014. The offering priced on January 29, 2015; the initial price of its shares was at $21 immediately rising by 123% to $47 on their first day of trading.[3][4][5][6]

History[edit]




The original Shake Shack located in Madison Square Park


In 2000, New York City began the rebuilding of Madison Square Park, which had fallen into a state of disrepair and misuse. As part of the redevelopment, restaurateur Danny Meyer helped spearhead the creation of the Madison Square Park Conservancy to help redevelop it. One of the first things the Conservancy did in its goal to improve the park was to host an art exhibit called "I <3 Taxi" inside of the park to raise awareness of the renewal effort.[7] Meyer's Director of operations, Randy Garutti, established a hot dog cart which was run out of the kitchen of Eleven Madison, one of Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group (USHG) operations. Over time the cart became extremely successful, and remained in operation for nearly three years.[8]
In 2004, the city began taking bids to operate a new kiosk-style restaurant within the park; Meyer outlined his idea for the space, and opened the first Shake Shack in July 2004. From its beginning the restaurant was not designed to be a chain, intended to be a single shop location designed specifically for New York City. However, as the original location's sales continued to grow, the group realized that there was a market for expansion.[8]
Since its opening, Shake Shack has grown to be the largest part of the USHG's portfolio. Its average store revenue of US$4 million is more than twice that of McDonald's average store revenue within the United States.[9] Its popularity is such that in the summer at its original location, the wait in line for service can stretch to over an hour, especially on weekends when the weather is pleasant. A webcam on the restaurant's web page shows the current line in real time.[9][10]
In June 2010, Shake Shack opened its first restaurant outside of New York City at the Lincoln Road Mall in Miami Beach's South Beach neighborhood.[11][12][13] In April 2017 the location completed a month-long renovation that added 586 square feet of space, bringing its seating capacity to 106.[14]
On July 12, 2010, Shake Shack restaurants were opened in the Theater District[15] and the Upper East Side.[16][17] The Upper East Side location's opening was significant because it "lifted" East 86th Street, an urban shopping district which had fallen on hard times; the location had been vacant, and even when occupied it was described by a neighbor as "never anything good there...dingy and dilapidated...almost an eyesore."[16]
In July 2011 it was announced that Shake Shack had reached a deal with the MTA to open a location in the lower level of Grand Central Terminal.[18] This project was delayed because the tenant occupying the space Shake Shack was to take over, Mexican eatery Zócalo, refused to vacate after the expiration of their lease and filed suit, arguing that the "bidding process (for retail space in Grand Central) is corrupted."[19] The suit was dismissed and Zócalo appealed. In October 2012 Zócalo filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[20] In early May 2013, Zócalo vacated the space, and the new outlet opened for business on October 5, 2013.[21]
By August 2014, Shake Shack outlets had begun operating in Connecticut, Washington, DC, Florida, Georgia, Chicago, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Texas.[22] That month, reports surfaced that the company was preparing to go public with an IPO and was discussing an underwriting with a number of investment banks, including J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.[22][23]
On January 29, 2015 Shake Shack priced its IPO at $21 per share. On the morning of January 30, 2015 it began trading on the NYSE at $47 per share under the ticker symbol SHAK. In April 2015, shares hit prices of $72, and hit a high of about $90 in May 2015.[24] In its IPO filing, the company stated that it planned to expand its domestic footprint to 450 company-operated stores. While no end date was given for that expansion, the company indicated its intention to open at least 10 restaurants each fiscal year, though it later amended that target to 12 a year and then again later in 2016 to 14 stores a year, a goal that would result in a total of 450 stores in approximately 25 years.[25] Later that May, Shake Shack filed for a trademark for the term "chicken shack" leading to speculation that the company would serve chicken sandwiches.[26] The company temporarily introduced chicken sandwiches to its Brooklyn on July 7, 2015.[27] In January 2016, Shake Shack introduced chicken sandwiches across locations in the United States, having previously started serving them at all Brooklyn Shake Shack locations.[28]
On August 31, 2016, Shake Shack announced it would begin room service at the Chicago Athletic Association Hotel, the first hotel in America to offer in-room Shake Shack.[29]
By March 2017 another opened inside Minute Maid Park in Downtown Houston. By mid-December Delaware opened its very first in New Castle. In February 2017, the first Michigan location was opened in downtown Detroit.[30] On May 10 of that year, Shake Shack opened their first Kentucky location, located at The Summit at Fritz Farm in Lexington.[31] That June, the company announced a location would open in Charlotte, North Carolina in late 2017, becoming the first Shake Shack in the Carolinas.[32]
International[edit]
Shake Shack has outlets in a number of international cities including Seoul, Tokyo, London, Cardiff, Istanbul, Moscow, Muscat, Beirut, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha, Kuwait City, Riyadh, Manama , Tehran and Jeddah.[22][33][34]
Menu[edit]




A "Shack Burger" and crinkle-cut French fries


Shake Shack's eponymous products are its milk shakes, which have been reviewed as some of the best in the industry.[9] As it has grown, the company has also added wine and bottled beers to its beverage menu. In each new location the beverage menu is customized to the local flavors of the city in which it operates.[35]
When the company first began to expand, it became famous for its burgers, which are made from Angus beef.[9] Despite this popularity, New York Times reviewer Pete Wilson stated in his 2012 review of the establishment that the burgers were sometimes insufficiently salted and cooked to an unappealing gray.[36]
The company originally used pre-made, frozen crinkle-cut french fries because its original location was only 400 sq ft (37 m2) in size, and the limited area disallowed any other style of fry product. As the chain grew, it was praised in multiple reviews for its high quality hamburgers, but its fries were routinely criticized as not being on par with its other products. In response, the company developed a new, fresh cut french fry product in 2013. However, consumers preferred the frozen, crinkle-cut fries and the company reverted to those in the fall of 2014.[9]
Collaborations[edit]
Shake Shack has collaborated with other food and design companies and chefs to create products to serve at their restaurants. Foods and beverages include a chocolate bar with Mast Brothers,[37] a coffee stout with La Colombe and Yards Brewing Company,[38] and limited edition burgers with Atlanta chef Ford Fry and Philadelphia chef Marc Vetri.[39]
Merchandising[edit]
The company has collaborated with Staple Design to create Shake Shack T-shirts.[40]

Shake Shack (NYSE: SHAK) is an American fast casual restaurant chain based in New York City. It started out as a food cart inside Madison Square Park in 2004, and its popularity steadily grew. It eventually moved to a stand within the park, expanding its menu from New York-style hotdogs to one with hamburgers, hotdogs, fries and its namesake milkshakes. The company claims to use all-natural 100% Angus beef only[1] and says that its meat has no hormones nor antibiotics.[2]
Since its founding it has been one of the fastest-growing food chains eventually becoming a public company filing for an initial public offering of stock in late 2014. The offering priced on January 29, 2015; the initial price of its shares was at $21 immediately rising by 123% to $47 on their first day of trading.[3][4][5][6]

History[edit]




The original Shake Shack located in Madison Square Park


In 2000, New York City began the rebuilding of Madison Square Park, which had fallen into a state of disrepair and misuse. As part of the redevelopment, restaurateur Danny Meyer helped spearhead the creation of the Madison Square Park Conservancy to help redevelop it. One of the first things the Conservancy did in its goal to improve the park was to host an art exhibit called "I <3 Taxi" inside of the park to raise awareness of the renewal effort.[7] Meyer's Director of operations, Randy Garutti, established a hot dog cart which was run out of the kitchen of Eleven Madison, one of Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group (USHG) operations. Over time the cart became extremely successful, and remained in operation for nearly three years.[8]
In 2004, the city began taking bids to operate a new kiosk-style restaurant within the park; Meyer outlined his idea for the space, and opened the first Shake Shack in July 2004. From its beginning the restaurant was not designed to be a chain, intended to be a single shop location designed specifically for New York City. However, as the original location's sales continued to grow, the group realized that there was a market for expansion.[8]
Since its opening, Shake Shack has grown to be the largest part of the USHG's portfolio. Its average store revenue of US$4 million is more than twice that of McDonald's average store revenue within the United States.[9] Its popularity is such that in the summer at its original location, the wait in line for service can stretch to over an hour, especially on weekends when the weather is pleasant. A webcam on the restaurant's web page shows the current line in real time.[9][10]
In June 2010, Shake Shack opened its first restaurant outside of New York City at the Lincoln Road Mall in Miami Beach's South Beach neighborhood.[11][12][13] In April 2017 the location completed a month-long renovation that added 586 square feet of space, bringing its seating capacity to 106.[14]
On July 12, 2010, Shake Shack restaurants were opened in the Theater District[15] and the Upper East Side.[16][17] The Upper East Side location's opening was significant because it "lifted" East 86th Street, an urban shopping district which had fallen on hard times; the location had been vacant, and even when occupied it was described by a neighbor as "never anything good there...dingy and dilapidated...almost an eyesore."[16]
In July 2011 it was announced that Shake Shack had reached a deal with the MTA to open a location in the lower level of Grand Central Terminal.[18] This project was delayed because the tenant occupying the space Shake Shack was to take over, Mexican eatery Zócalo, refused to vacate after the expiration of their lease and filed suit, arguing that the "bidding process (for retail space in Grand Central) is corrupted."[19] The suit was dismissed and Zócalo appealed. In October 2012 Zócalo filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[20] In early May 2013, Zócalo vacated the space, and the new outlet opened for business on October 5, 2013.[21]
By August 2014, Shake Shack outlets had begun operating in Connecticut, Washington, DC, Florida, Georgia, Chicago, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Texas.[22] That month, reports surfaced that the company was preparing to go public with an IPO and was discussing an underwriting with a number of investment banks, including J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.[22][23]
On January 29, 2015 Shake Shack priced its IPO at $21 per share. On the morning of January 30, 2015 it began trading on the NYSE at $47 per share under the ticker symbol SHAK. In April 2015, shares hit prices of $72, and hit a high of about $90 in May 2015.[24] In its IPO filing, the company stated that it planned to expand its domestic footprint to 450 company-operated stores. While no end date was given for that expansion, the company indicated its intention to open at least 10 restaurants each fiscal year, though it later amended that target to 12 a year and then again later in 2016 to 14 stores a year, a goal that would result in a total of 450 stores in approximately 25 years.[25] Later that May, Shake Shack filed for a trademark for the term "chicken shack" leading to speculation that the company would serve chicken sandwiches.[26] The company temporarily introduced chicken sandwiches to its Brooklyn on July 7, 2015.[27] In January 2016, Shake Shack introduced chicken sandwiches across locations in the United States, having previously started serving them at all Brooklyn Shake Shack locations.[28]
On August 31, 2016, Shake Shack announced it would begin room service at the Chicago Athletic Association Hotel, the first hotel in America to offer in-room Shake Shack.[29]
By March 2017 another opened inside Minute Maid Park in Downtown Houston. By mid-December Delaware opened its very first in New Castle. In February 2017, the first Michigan location was opened in downtown Detroit.[30] On May 10 of that year, Shake Shack opened their first Kentucky location, located at The Summit at Fritz Farm in Lexington.[31] That June, the company announced a location would open in Charlotte, North Carolina in late 2017, becoming the first Shake Shack in the Carolinas.[32]
International[edit]
Shake Shack has outlets in a number of international cities including Seoul, Tokyo, London, Cardiff, Istanbul, Moscow, Muscat, Beirut, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha, Kuwait City, Riyadh, Manama , Tehran and Jeddah.[22][33][34]
Menu[edit]




A "Shack Burger" and crinkle-cut French fries


Shake Shack's eponymous products are its milk shakes, which have been reviewed as some of the best in the industry.[9] As it has grown, the company has also added wine and bottled beers to its beverage menu. In each new location the beverage menu is customized to the local flavors of the city in which it operates.[35]
When the company first began to expand, it became famous for its burgers, which are made from Angus beef.[9] Despite this popularity, New York Times reviewer Pete Wilson stated in his 2012 review of the establishment that the burgers were sometimes insufficiently salted and cooked to an unappealing gray.[36]
The company originally used pre-made, frozen crinkle-cut french fries because its original location was only 400 sq ft (37 m2) in size, and the limited area disallowed any other style of fry product. As the chain grew, it was praised in multiple reviews for its high quality hamburgers, but its fries were routinely criticized as not being on par with its other products. In response, the company developed a new, fresh cut french fry product in 2013. However, consumers preferred the frozen, crinkle-cut fries and the company reverted to those in the fall of 2014.[9]
Collaborations[edit]
Shake Shack has collaborated with other food and design companies and chefs to create products to serve at their restaurants. Foods and beverages include a chocolate bar with Mast Brothers,[37] a coffee stout with La Colombe and Yards Brewing Company,[38] and limited edition burgers with Atlanta chef Ford Fry and Philadelphia chef Marc Vetri.[39]
Merchandising[edit]
The company has collaborated with Staple Design to create Shake Shack T-shirts.[40]

SHACK|2O®
Stay hydrated with our natural spring water.  We’re a proud member of 1% for the Planet which means 1% of every bottle sold supports the cleanup of water sources around the globe.  Now that’s refreshing.














Beer and Wine

Meet ShackMeister® Ale, otherwise known as the ShackBurger’s best friend.  Our team collaborated with Brooklyn Brewery to create this stellar beer.  We think it’s a brew surely worthy of our eats with its deep golden color, bright citrus aroma, slight bitterness and bready malt flavor.  If wine’s more your style, our incredible house red and white (made exclusively for Shake Shack by Napa Valley’s celebrated Frog’s Leap) are patiently waiting for you to take notice.

Our Story

Shake Shack sprouted from a hot dog cart in Madison Square Park in Manhattan to support the Madison Square Park Conservancy’s first art installation. The cart was quite the success, with Shack fans lined up daily for three summers.

This modern day “roadside” burger stand serves up the most delicious burgers, hot dogs, frozen custard, shakes, beer, wine and more. An instant neighborhood fixture, Shake Shack welcomed people from all over the city, country and world who gathered together to enjoy fresh, simple, high-quality versions of the classics in a majestic setting.

About
Madison Square Park, NYC

Behold the mothership! Shake Shack was born from a hot dog cart in Madison Square Park to support the Madison Square Park Conservancy’s first art installation “I ♥ Taxi.” The cart was a success and lines formed daily, so we re-opened for an additional two summers in 2002 and 2003.
On June 12, 2004, Shake Shack officially opened; after being awarded the contract from New York City’s Department of Parks & Recreation and the Madison Square Park Conservancy to create a permanent food kiosk in the park.
The original Shack (along with many of its siblings) was designed by the architecture firm SITE Environmental Design to be harmonious with the park and its surroundings. People from all over the world join us to enjoy great food in an incredible outdoor setting.

You can now pre-order and pick up your faves at most U.S. Shacks with our mobile ordering Shack App for Android and iOS.

Shake Shack (NYSE: SHAK) is an American fast casual restaurant chain based in New York City. It started out as a food cart inside Madison Square Park in 2004, and its popularity steadily grew. It eventually moved to a stand within the park, expanding its menu from New York-style hotdogs to one with hamburgers, hotdogs, fries and its namesake milkshakes. The company claims to use all-natural 100% Angus beef only[1] and says that its meat has no hormones nor antibiotics.[2]
Since its founding it has been one of the fastest-growing food chains eventually becoming a public company filing for an initial public offering of stock in late 2014. The offering priced on January 29, 2015; the initial price of its shares was at $21 immediately rising by 123% to $47 on their first day of trading.[3][4][5][6]

History[edit]




The original Shake Shack located in Madison Square Park


In 2000, New York City began the rebuilding of Madison Square Park, which had fallen into a state of disrepair and misuse. As part of the redevelopment, restaurateur Danny Meyer helped spearhead the creation of the Madison Square Park Conservancy to help redevelop it. One of the first things the Conservancy did in its goal to improve the park was to host an art exhibit called "I <3 Taxi" inside of the park to raise awareness of the renewal effort.[7] Meyer's Director of operations, Randy Garutti, established a hot dog cart which was run out of the kitchen of Eleven Madison, one of Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group (USHG) operations. Over time the cart became extremely successful, and remained in operation for nearly three years.[8]
In 2004, the city began taking bids to operate a new kiosk-style restaurant within the park; Meyer outlined his idea for the space, and opened the first Shake Shack in July 2004. From its beginning the restaurant was not designed to be a chain, intended to be a single shop location designed specifically for New York City. However, as the original location's sales continued to grow, the group realized that there was a market for expansion.[8]
Since its opening, Shake Shack has grown to be the largest part of the USHG's portfolio. Its average store revenue of US$4 million is more than twice that of McDonald's average store revenue within the United States.[9] Its popularity is such that in the summer at its original location, the wait in line for service can stretch to over an hour, especially on weekends when the weather is pleasant. A webcam on the restaurant's web page shows the current line in real time.[9][10]
In June 2010, Shake Shack opened its first restaurant outside of New York City at the Lincoln Road Mall in Miami Beach's South Beach neighborhood.[11][12][13] In April 2017 the location completed a month-long renovation that added 586 square feet of space, bringing its seating capacity to 106.[14]
On July 12, 2010, Shake Shack restaurants were opened in the Theater District[15] and the Upper East Side.[16][17] The Upper East Side location's opening was significant because it "lifted" East 86th Street, an urban shopping district which had fallen on hard times; the location had been vacant, and even when occupied it was described by a neighbor as "never anything good there...dingy and dilapidated...almost an eyesore."[16]
In July 2011 it was announced that Shake Shack had reached a deal with the MTA to open a location in the lower level of Grand Central Terminal.[18] This project was delayed because the tenant occupying the space Shake Shack was to take over, Mexican eatery Zócalo, refused to vacate after the expiration of their lease and filed suit, arguing that the "bidding process (for retail space in Grand Central) is corrupted."[19] The suit was dismissed and Zócalo appealed. In October 2012 Zócalo filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[20] In early May 2013, Zócalo vacated the space, and the new outlet opened for business on October 5, 2013.[21]
By August 2014, Shake Shack outlets had begun operating in Connecticut, Washington, DC, Florida, Georgia, Chicago, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Texas.[22] That month, reports surfaced that the company was preparing to go public with an IPO and was discussing an underwriting with a number of investment banks, including J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.[22][23]
On January 29, 2015 Shake Shack priced its IPO at $21 per share. On the morning of January 30, 2015 it began trading on the NYSE at $47 per share under the ticker symbol SHAK. In April 2015, shares hit prices of $72, and hit a high of about $90 in May 2015.[24] In its IPO filing, the company stated that it planned to expand its domestic footprint to 450 company-operated stores. While no end date was given for that expansion, the company indicated its intention to open at least 10 restaurants each fiscal year, though it later amended that target to 12 a year and then again later in 2016 to 14 stores a year, a goal that would result in a total of 450 stores in approximately 25 years.[25] Later that May, Shake Shack filed for a trademark for the term "chicken shack" leading to speculation that the company would serve chicken sandwiches.[26] The company temporarily introduced chicken sandwiches to its Brooklyn on July 7, 2015.[27] In January 2016, Shake Shack introduced chicken sandwiches across locations in the United States, having previously started serving them at all Brooklyn Shake Shack locations.[28]
On August 31, 2016, Shake Shack announced it would begin room service at the Chicago Athletic Association Hotel, the first hotel in America to offer in-room Shake Shack.[29]
By March 2017 another opened inside Minute Maid Park in Downtown Houston. By mid-December Delaware opened its very first in New Castle. In February 2017, the first Michigan location was opened in downtown Detroit.[30] On May 10 of that year, Shake Shack opened their first Kentucky location, located at The Summit at Fritz Farm in Lexington.[31] That June, the company announced a location would open in Charlotte, North Carolina in late 2017, becoming the first Shake Shack in the Carolinas.[32]
International[edit]
Shake Shack has outlets in a number of international cities including Seoul, Tokyo, London, Cardiff, Istanbul, Moscow, Muscat, Beirut, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha, Kuwait City, Riyadh, Manama , Tehran and Jeddah.[22][33][34]
Menu[edit]




A "Shack Burger" and crinkle-cut French fries


Shake Shack's eponymous products are its milk shakes, which have been reviewed as some of the best in the industry.[9] As it has grown, the company has also added wine and bottled beers to its beverage menu. In each new location the beverage menu is customized to the local flavors of the city in which it operates.[35]
When the company first began to expand, it became famous for its burgers, which are made from Angus beef.[9] Despite this popularity, New York Times reviewer Pete Wilson stated in his 2012 review of the establishment that the burgers were sometimes insufficiently salted and cooked to an unappealing gray.[36]
The company originally used pre-made, frozen crinkle-cut french fries because its original location was only 400 sq ft (37 m2) in size, and the limited area disallowed any other style of fry product. As the chain grew, it was praised in multiple reviews for its high quality hamburgers, but its fries were routinely criticized as not being on par with its other products. In response, the company developed a new, fresh cut french fry product in 2013. However, consumers preferred the frozen, crinkle-cut fries and the company reverted to those in the fall of 2014.[9]
Collaborations[edit]
Shake Shack has collaborated with other food and design companies and chefs to create products to serve at their restaurants. Foods and beverages include a chocolate bar with Mast Brothers,[37] a coffee stout with La Colombe and Yards Brewing Company,[38] and limited edition burgers with Atlanta chef Ford Fry and Philadelphia chef Marc Vetri.[39]
Merchandising[edit]
The company has collaborated with Staple Design to create Shake Shack T-shirts.[40]

Shake Shack (NYSE: SHAK) is an American fast casual restaurant chain based in New York City. It started out as a food cart inside Madison Square Park in 2004, and its popularity steadily grew. It eventually moved to a stand within the park, expanding its menu from New York-style hotdogs to one with hamburgers, hotdogs, fries and its namesake milkshakes. The company claims to use all-natural 100% Angus beef only[1] and says that its meat has no hormones nor antibiotics.[2]
Since its founding it has been one of the fastest-growing food chains eventually becoming a public company filing for an initial public offering of stock in late 2014. The offering priced on January 29, 2015; the initial price of its shares was at $21 immediately rising by 123% to $47 on their first day of trading.[3][4][5][6]

History[edit]




The original Shake Shack located in Madison Square Park


In 2000, New York City began the rebuilding of Madison Square Park, which had fallen into a state of disrepair and misuse. As part of the redevelopment, restaurateur Danny Meyer helped spearhead the creation of the Madison Square Park Conservancy to help redevelop it. One of the first things the Conservancy did in its goal to improve the park was to host an art exhibit called "I <3 Taxi" inside of the park to raise awareness of the renewal effort.[7] Meyer's Director of operations, Randy Garutti, established a hot dog cart which was run out of the kitchen of Eleven Madison, one of Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group (USHG) operations. Over time the cart became extremely successful, and remained in operation for nearly three years.[8]
In 2004, the city began taking bids to operate a new kiosk-style restaurant within the park; Meyer outlined his idea for the space, and opened the first Shake Shack in July 2004. From its beginning the restaurant was not designed to be a chain, intended to be a single shop location designed specifically for New York City. However, as the original location's sales continued to grow, the group realized that there was a market for expansion.[8]
Since its opening, Shake Shack has grown to be the largest part of the USHG's portfolio. Its average store revenue of US$4 million is more than twice that of McDonald's average store revenue within the United States.[9] Its popularity is such that in the summer at its original location, the wait in line for service can stretch to over an hour, especially on weekends when the weather is pleasant. A webcam on the restaurant's web page shows the current line in real time.[9][10]
In June 2010, Shake Shack opened its first restaurant outside of New York City at the Lincoln Road Mall in Miami Beach's South Beach neighborhood.[11][12][13] In April 2017 the location completed a month-long renovation that added 586 square feet of space, bringing its seating capacity to 106.[14]
On July 12, 2010, Shake Shack restaurants were opened in the Theater District[15] and the Upper East Side.[16][17] The Upper East Side location's opening was significant because it "lifted" East 86th Street, an urban shopping district which had fallen on hard times; the location had been vacant, and even when occupied it was described by a neighbor as "never anything good there...dingy and dilapidated...almost an eyesore."[16]
In July 2011 it was announced that Shake Shack had reached a deal with the MTA to open a location in the lower level of Grand Central Terminal.[18] This project was delayed because the tenant occupying the space Shake Shack was to take over, Mexican eatery Zócalo, refused to vacate after the expiration of their lease and filed suit, arguing that the "bidding process (for retail space in Grand Central) is corrupted."[19] The suit was dismissed and Zócalo appealed. In October 2012 Zócalo filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[20] In early May 2013, Zócalo vacated the space, and the new outlet opened for business on October 5, 2013.[21]
By August 2014, Shake Shack outlets had begun operating in Connecticut, Washington, DC, Florida, Georgia, Chicago, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Texas.[22] That month, reports surfaced that the company was preparing to go public with an IPO and was discussing an underwriting with a number of investment banks, including J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.[22][23]
On January 29, 2015 Shake Shack priced its IPO at $21 per share. On the morning of January 30, 2015 it began trading on the NYSE at $47 per share under the ticker symbol SHAK. In April 2015, shares hit prices of $72, and hit a high of about $90 in May 2015.[24] In its IPO filing, the company stated that it planned to expand its domestic footprint to 450 company-operated stores. While no end date was given for that expansion, the company indicated its intention to open at least 10 restaurants each fiscal year, though it later amended that target to 12 a year and then again later in 2016 to 14 stores a year, a goal that would result in a total of 450 stores in approximately 25 years.[25] Later that May, Shake Shack filed for a trademark for the term "chicken shack" leading to speculation that the company would serve chicken sandwiches.[26] The company temporarily introduced chicken sandwiches to its Brooklyn on July 7, 2015.[27] In January 2016, Shake Shack introduced chicken sandwiches across locations in the United States, having previously started serving them at all Brooklyn Shake Shack locations.[28]
On August 31, 2016, Shake Shack announced it would begin room service at the Chicago Athletic Association Hotel, the first hotel in America to offer in-room Shake Shack.[29]
By March 2017 another opened inside Minute Maid Park in Downtown Houston. By mid-December Delaware opened its very first in New Castle. In February 2017, the first Michigan location was opened in downtown Detroit.[30] On May 10 of that year, Shake Shack opened their first Kentucky location, located at The Summit at Fritz Farm in Lexington.[31] That June, the company announced a location would open in Charlotte, North Carolina in late 2017, becoming the first Shake Shack in the Carolinas.[32]
International[edit]
Shake Shack has outlets in a number of international cities including Seoul, Tokyo, London, Cardiff, Istanbul, Moscow, Muscat, Beirut, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha, Kuwait City, Riyadh, Manama , Tehran and Jeddah.[22][33][34]
Menu[edit]




A "Shack Burger" and crinkle-cut French fries


Shake Shack's eponymous products are its milk shakes, which have been reviewed as some of the best in the industry.[9] As it has grown, the company has also added wine and bottled beers to its beverage menu. In each new location the beverage menu is customized to the local flavors of the city in which it operates.[35]
When the company first began to expand, it became famous for its burgers, which are made from Angus beef.[9] Despite this popularity, New York Times reviewer Pete Wilson stated in his 2012 review of the establishment that the burgers were sometimes insufficiently salted and cooked to an unappealing gray.[36]
The company originally used pre-made, frozen crinkle-cut french fries because its original location was only 400 sq ft (37 m2) in size, and the limited area disallowed any other style of fry product. As the chain grew, it was praised in multiple reviews for its high quality hamburgers, but its fries were routinely criticized as not being on par with its other products. In response, the company developed a new, fresh cut french fry product in 2013. However, consumers preferred the frozen, crinkle-cut fries and the company reverted to those in the fall of 2014.[9]
Collaborations[edit]
Shake Shack has collaborated with other food and design companies and chefs to create products to serve at their restaurants. Foods and beverages include a chocolate bar with Mast Brothers,[37] a coffee stout with La Colombe and Yards Brewing Company,[38] and limited edition burgers with Atlanta chef Ford Fry and Philadelphia chef Marc Vetri.[39]
Merchandising[edit]
The company has collaborated with Staple Design to create Shake Shack T-shirts.[40]

Our Story

Shake Shack sprouted from a hot dog cart in Madison Square Park in Manhattan to support the Madison Square Park Conservancy’s first art installation. The cart was quite the success, with Shack fans lined up daily for three summers.








We Wrote the Book on Burgers!
Order our debut cookbook, Shake Shack: Recipes & Stories.









Rise and Shack
Breakfast is cookin’ at Madison Square Park, JFK, Fulton Center, Grand Central, Penn Station, Union Station and Dubai Airport.










In 2004, a permanent kiosk opened in the park: Shake Shack was born. This modern day “roadside” burger stand serves up the most delicious burgers, hot dogs, frozen custard, shakes, beer, wine and more. An instant neighborhood fixture, Shake Shack welcomed people from all over the city, country and world who gathered together to enjoy fresh, simple, high-quality versions of the classics in a majestic setting. The rest, as they say, is burger history.

Good Ingredients
100% all-natural Angus beef, vegetarian fed, humanely raised and source verified. No hormones or antibiotics – EVER. We pride ourselves on sourcing incredible ingredients from like-minded artisanal producers.


Good 'n' Green
Every Shack recycles all bottles and plastics, whether you sort or we do the sorting post-collection. It’s the most efficient way to make sure ZERO recyclable material ends up in landfills. Our cooking oil is reused to produce clean energy and our kitchen food is composted where locally possible.


Good Bones
Each Shack is constructed thoughtfully and purposefully to fit its unique environment, using a creative design approach that creates places and experiences like nowhere else. All good in the wood!


Good Neighbors
We’re all about our hood! We strive to be the best employers and citizens of each community we call home. Whether partnering with Share Our Strength or working with local charitable organizations to donate 5% of sales of a specific concrete – the Shack is committed to giving back.
