OPAL
ISLAND ACQUISITION CORPORATION 

Notes to
Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements

NOTE 1
NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

NATURE OF
OPERATIONS

Opal
Island Acquisition Corporation (the "Company") was incorporated on
April 4, 2016 under the laws of the state of Delaware to engage in
any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to,
selected mergers and acquisitions. The Company has been in the
developmental stage since inception and its operations to date have
been limited to issuing shares to its original shareholders. The
Company will attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity
for the combination of that target company with Opal Island. The
combination will normally take the form of a merger,
stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets exchange. In most
instances the target company will wish to structure the business
combination to be within the definition of a tax-free
reorganization under
Section 351 or Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. No assurances can be given that the Company will be
successful in locating or negotiating with any target company. The
Company has been formed to provide a method for a foreign or
domestic private company to become a reporting company with a class
of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934.

BASIS OF
PRESENTATION

The
summary of significant accounting policies presented below is
designed to assist in understanding the Company's unaudited
condensed financial statements. Such unaudited condensed financial
statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the
Company's management, who are responsible for their integrity and
objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("GAAP") in all material respects, and have been consistently
applied in preparing the accompanying unaudited condensed financial
statements.

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual
financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("U.S. GAAP") were omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
The results for the period from April 4, 2016 (Inception) to
September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results
to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.

USE OF
ESTIMATES

The
preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the condensed financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

CASH

Cash and
cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking
institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments
with original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company did not
have cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016.

CONCENTRATION
OF RISK

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places its
cash with high quality banking institutions. The Company did not
have cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation limit as of September 30, 2016.

INCOME
TAXES

Under ASC
740, "Income Taxes," deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. Valuation allowances are established when it is more
likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. As of September 30, 2016 there were no deferred
taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating
loss or carry forward prior to expiration.

LOSS PER
COMMON SHARE

Basic loss
per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net
loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted loss per common share reflect the
potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into
common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then
shared in the loss of the entity. As of September 30, 2016, there
are no outstanding dilutive securities.

FAIR VALUE
OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The
Company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements
of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value
measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed
at fair value in the unaudited condensed financial statements on a
recurring basis. Additionally, the Company adopted guidance for
fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are
recognized and disclosed at fair value in the unaudited condensed
financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The guidance
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy
gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements)
and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant
unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the
fair value hierarchy are as follows:

Level 1
inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to
access at the measurement date.

Level 2
inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly.

Level 3
inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The
carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their
fair values because of the short maturity of these
instruments.

RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

On
November 20, 2015, FASB issued ASU-2015-17-Income Taxes. The Board
is issuing this Update as part of its initiative to reduce
complexity in accounting standards (the Simplification Initiative).
The objective of the Simplification Initiative is to identify,
evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced
while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information
provided to users of financial statements. Current GAAP requires an
entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into
current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of
financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income
taxes, the amendments in this Update require that deferred tax
liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified
statement of financial position. The amendments in this Update
apply to all entities that present a classified statement of
financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax
liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be
offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the
amendments in this Update. For public business entities, the
amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements
issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and
interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is
permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or
annual reporting period. The Company is still in the process of
evaluating future impact of adopting this standard.

On June
12, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-10-Technical Corrections
and Improvements. The amendments in this Update cover a wide range
of Topics in the Codification. The amendments in this Update
represent changes to make minor corrections or minor improvements
to the Codification that are not expected to have a significant
effect on current accounting practice or create a significant
administrative cost to most entities. This Accounting Standards
Update is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update
2014-240-Technical Corrections and Improvements, which has been
deleted. Transition guidance varies based on the amendments in this
Update. The amendments in this Update that require transition
guidance are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December
15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an
interim period. All other amendments will be effective upon the
issuance of this Update. Management is in the process of assessing
the impact of this ASU on the Company's financial
statements.

ISLAND ACQUISITION CORPORATION
Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements

On April
30, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-06 Earnings Per Share
(Topic 260):
Effects on Historical Earnings per Units of Master Limited
Partnership Dropdown Transactions. Under Topic 260, Earnings Per
Share, master limited partnerships (MLPs) apply the two-class
method to calculate earnings per unit (EPU) because the general
partner, limited partners, and incentive distribution rights
holders each participate differently in the distribution of
available cash. When a general partner transfers (or "drops down")
net assets to a master limited partnership and that transaction is
accounted for as a transaction between entities under common
control, the statements of operations of the master limited
partnership are adjusted retrospectively to reflect the dropdown
transaction as if it occurred on the earliest date during which the
entities were under common control. The amendments in this Update
specify that for purposes of calculating historical EPU under the
two-

PART I            

Item 1.  Business                                                               

Opal Island Acquisition Corporation ("Opal Island" or the           
"Company") was incorporated on April 4, 2016 under the laws of                  
the State of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking,            
including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions.               
The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception                 
and its operations to date have been limited to issuing shares to               
its original shareholders and filing a registration statement.                  
The Company has been formed to provide a method for a foreign or                
domestic private company to become a reporting company with a                   
class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act                
of 1934.                                                                        

The Company registered its common stock on a Form 10                  
registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange                
Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and Rule 12(g) thereof.  The                   
Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission periodic              
and current reports under Rule 13(a) of the Exchange Act, including             
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports Form 10-K.                    

The Company has no employees and two officers, directors and          
shareholders.                                                                   

The president of the Company is also the president, director and        
shareholder of Tiber Creek Corporation.  Tiber Creek Corporation assists        
companies in becoming public companies and assists companies with               
introductions to the financial community.  Such services may include,           
when and if appropriate, the use of an existing reporting company such          
as the Company.                                                                 

Tiber Creek will typically enter into an agreement with a private     
company to assist it in becoming a public reporting company and for             
its introduction to brokers and market makers.  A private company may           
become a public reporting company by effecting a business combination           
with an existing public reporting company such as the Company or by a           
filing registration pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 (typically           
a Form S-1) or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Form 10).                   

There is no agreement nor contractual relationship between Opal       
Island and Tiber Creek to perform or provide services to the other.             
However, as a non-operating blank check company, Opal Island is available       
for use by a client of Tiber Creek which wishes to use a reporting company      
incident to the process of registering its securities and becoming a            
reporting company.                                                              

A combination will normally take the form of a merger, stock-for-stock
exchange or stock-for-assets exchange.  In most instances the target            
company will wish to structure the business combination to be within the        
definition of  a tax-free reorganization under Section 351 or Section 368       
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.                               

Once a change of control of the Company has been effected, if at all,     
new management may issue shares of its stock prior to filing a registration     
statement for the registration of its shares pursuant to the Securities Act     
of 1933 and such shares will be governed by the rules and regulations of        
the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the sale of unregistered       
securities.                                                                     

As of December 31, 2016, the Company had not generated revenues and   
had no income or cash flows from operations since inception.  At December
31, 2016, the Company had sustained net loss of $2,062 and an accumulated       
deficit of $2,062.                                                            

The Company's independent auditors have issued a report raising       
substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going            
concern.  At present, the Company has no operations and the continuation        
of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon financial support           
from its stockholders, its ability to obtain necessary equity financing         
to continue operations and/or to successfully locate and negotiate with         
a business entity for the combination of that target company with               
the Company.                                                                    

Management of the Company will pay all expenses incurred by the       
Company until a  change in control of the Company is effected.                  
Management does not expect any repayment for such paid expenses.                

There is no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable.     

Item 2.  Properties
The Company has no properties and at this time has no                 
agreements to acquire any properties.  The Company currently uses               
the offices of Management at no cost to the Company.  The Company               
expects this arrangement to continue until the Company completes                
a change in control.                                                            

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings                                                      

There is no litigation pending or threatened by or against the        
Company.                                                                        

Management is aware that certain current and prior blank check  
companies of which Messrs. Cassidy and McKillop were the officers and           
directors have received subpeonas for documents in regard to a formal           
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (In the matter          
HO-12590) requesting documentation regarding the share ownership of             
those companies.  Management has no independent knowledge or information        
regarding these subpeonas but believes it is part of a wider review by          
the SEC.  Management of the Company has also received subpoenas in              
regard to certain ofthe transactions and filings for the past five years        
of certain of its blank check companies.  Management has no independent         
knowledge or information as to the intent or purpose of such subpoenas.         

Item 4.  Mine Safety Disclosures.                                               

Not applicable.                                                     

PART II             

Item 5.  Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder             
Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities             

There is currently no public market for the Company's securities.   

Following a business combination, a target company will normally      
wish to cause the Company's common stock to trade in one or more United         
States securities markets.  The target company may elect to take the            
steps required for such admission to quotation following the business           
combination or at some later time.                                              

At such time as it qualifies, the Company may choose to apply for     
quotation of its securities on the OTC Bulletin Board.                          

The OTC Bulletin Board is a dealer-driven quotation service.          
Unlike the Nasdaq Stock Market, companies cannot directly apply to be           
quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, only market makers can initiate               
quotes, and quoted companies do not have to meet any quantitative               
financial requirements.  Any equity security of a reporting company not         
listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market or on a national securities exchange is       
eligible.                                                                       

As such time as it qualifies, the Company may choose to apply for     
quotation of its securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market.                       

In general there is greatest liquidity for traded securities on       
the Nasdaq Capital Market and less on the OTC Bulletin Board.  It is            
not possible to predict where, if at all, the securities of the Company         
will be traded following a business combination.                                

Since inception, the Company has sold securities which                
were not registered as follows:

(1)  James M. Cassidy, the president and a director of the Company,             
is the sole shareholder and director of Tiber Creek Corporation,                
a Delaware corporation, which company has agreed to assist the                  
Company in registering its stock and introductions to the brokerage             
community.                                                                      

Item 6.  Selected Financial Data.                                               

There is no selected financial data required to be filed for    
a smaller reporting company.                                                    

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition            
and Results of Operations
The Company has no operations nor does it currently engage in any         
business activities generating revenues.  The Company's principal               
business objective is to achieve a business combination with a target           
company.                                                                        

A combination will normally take the form of a merger, stock-for-stock
exchange or stock-for-assets exchange.  In most instances the target            
company will wish to structure the business combination to be within the        
definition of  a tax-free reorganization under Section 351 or Section 368       
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.                               

No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in     
locating or negotiating with any target company.                                

The most likely target companies are those seeking the perceived          
benefits of a reporting corporation.  Such perceived benefits may include       
facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing        
may be sought, providing liquidity for incentive stock options or similar       
benefits to key employees, increasing the opportunity to use securities         
for acquisitions, providing liquidity for shareholders and other factors.       
Business  opportunities may be available in many different industries and       
at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of            
comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities           
difficult and complex.                                                          

The search for a target company will not be restricted to any specific    
kind of business entities, but may acquire a venture which is in its            
preliminary or development stage, which is already in operation, or in          
essentially any stage of its business life.  It is impossible to predict        
at this time the status of any business in which the Company may become         
engaged, whether such business may need to seek additional capital, may         
desire to have its shares publicly traded, or may seek other perceived          
advantages which the Company may offer.                                         

In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition, the    
Company may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization,          
joint venture, licensing agreement or other arrangement with another            
corporation or entity.  On the consummation of a transaction, it is likely      
that the present management and shareholders of the Company will no longer      
be in control of the Company.  In addition, it is likely that the officer       
and director of the Company will, as part of the terms of the business          
combination, resign and be replaced by one or more new officers and             
directors.                                                                      

As of December 31, 2016, the Company had not generated revenues       
and had no income or cash flows from operations since inception.  At            
December 31, 2016, the Company had sustained net loss of $2,062.                

The Company's independent auditors have issued a report raising         
substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going            
concern.  At present, the Company has no operations and the continuation        
of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon financial support           
from its stockholders, its ability to obtain necessary equity financing         
to continue operations and/or to successfully locate and negotiate with         
a business entity for the combination of that target company with               
the Company.                                                                    

Management will pay all expenses incurred by the Company until a      
change in control is effected.  There is no expectation of repayment            
for such expenses.                                                              

The president of the Company is the president, director and           
shareholder of Tiber Creek Corporation.  Tiber Creek Corporation assists        
companies in becoming public reporting companies and with introductions         
to the financial community.                                                     

2016 Year-End Analysis                                                          

The Company has received no income, has had no operations           
nor expenses, other than Delaware state fees and accounting fees                
as required for incorporation and for the preparation of the                    
Company's financial statements.                                                 

Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data                            

The financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016         
are attached hereto.                                                            

Item 9.   Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on                      
Accounting and Financial Disclosure                         

There were no changes in or disagreements with accountants on         
accounting and financial disclosure for the period covered by this              
report.                                                                         

Item 9A.   Controls and Procedures                                              

Pursuant to Rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission.    
the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design        
and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to             
Exchange Act Rules.  This evaluation  was done as of the end of the fiscal      
year under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's          
principal executive officer (who is also the principal financial officer).      
There have been no significant changes in internal controls or in other         
factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to         
the date of the evaluation.  Based upon that evaluation, he believes that       
the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective in gathering,    
analyzing and disclosing information needed to ensure that the information      
required to be disclosed by the Company in its periodic reports is recorded,    
summarized and processed timely.  The principal executive officer               
is directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Company.               

Management's Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting                

The Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining           
adequate internal control over financial reporting in accordance with           
the Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company's           
officer, its president, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness            
of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of                
December 31, 2016, based on the criteria establish in Internal                  
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring              
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this evaluation,            
management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial         
reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2016, based on those             
criteria. A control system can provide only reasonably, not absolute,           
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and no              
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control          
issues have been detected.                                                      

KCCW Accountancy Corp., the independent registered public accounting    
firm of the Company, has not issued an attestation report on the                
effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.       

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting                            

There have been no changes in the Company's internal controls over  
financial reporting  during its fourth fiscal quarter that have materially      
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal           
control over financial reporting.                                               

Item 9B.  Other information                                                     

Not applicable.                                                     

PART III              

Item 10.  Directors, Executive Officers, and Corporate Governance;              

The Directors and Officers of the Company are as follows:             

Name                Age       Positions and Offices Held            
-----------------    -----------                                      
James Cassidy         81       President, Secretary, Director         
James McKillop        57       Vice President, Director               

Management of The Company
The Company has no full time employees.  James Cassidy and            
James McKillop are the officers and directors of the Company and                
its shareholders.  Mr. Cassidy, as president of the Company, and                
Mr. McKillop as vice president, will allocate a limited portion of              
time to the activities of the Company without compensation.                     
Potential conflicts may arise with respect to the limited time                  
commitment by management and the potential demands of the                       
activities of the Company.                                                      

There are no agreements or understandings for the officer or          
director to resign at the request of another person and the above-              
named officer and director is not acting on behalf of nor will act              
at the direction of any other person.                                           

Set forth below are the names of the directors and officers of        
the Company, all positions and offices with the Company held, the               
period during which they have served as such, and the business                  
experience during at least the last five years:                                 

James Cassidy, Esq., LL.B., LL.M., serves as a director,                
president and secretary of the Company.  Mr. Cassidy received a                 
Bachelor of Science in Languages and Linguistics from Georgetown                
University in 1960, a Bachelor of Laws from The Catholic University             
School of Law in 1963, and a Master of Laws in Taxation from The                
Georgetown University School of Law in 1968.  From 1963-1964, Mr.               
Cassidy was law clerk to the Honorable Inzer B. Wyatt of the United             
States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  From              
1964-1965, Mr. Cassidy was law clerk to the Honorable Wilbur K.                 
Miller of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of                
Columbia.  From 1969-1975, Mr. Cassidy was an associate of the law              
firm of Kieffer & Moroney and a principal in the law firm of Kieffer            
& Cassidy, Washington, D.C. From 1975 to date, Mr. Cassidy has been a           
principal in the law firm of Cassidy & Associates, and its predecessors,        
specializing in securities law and related corporate and federal                
taxation matters.  Mr. Cassidy is a member of the bars of the District          
of Columbia and the State of New York, and is admitted to practice              
before the United States Tax Court and the United States Supreme Court.         
The Company believes Mr. Cassidy to have the business experience                
necessary to serve as a director of the Company as it seeks to enter            
into a business combination.  As a lawyer involved in business                  
transactions and securities matters, Mr. Cassidy has  had ample                 
experience in evaluating companies and management, understanding                
business plans,  assisting in capital raising  and determining                  
corporate structure and objectives.                                             

James McKillop serves as a director and vice president of               
the Company. Mr. McKillop began his career at Merrill Lynch. Mr.                
McKillop has also been involved in financial reporting and did a                
daily stock market update for KPCC radio in Pasadena, California.               
Mr. McKillop is the founder of MB Americus LLC which specializes                
in consulting and public relations. Mr. McKillop has provided                   
consulting services to Tiber Creek Corporation for more than five               
years.  Mr. McKillop has written articles for various publications              
on financial matters. He has been a past member of the World Affairs            
Council. Mr. McKillop received his Bachelor of Arts in Economics                
in 1984 from the University of California at Los Angeles.  With his             
background in financial and securities matters, the Company believes            
Mr. McKillop to have experience and knowledge that will serve                   
the Company in seeking, evaluating and determining a suitable                   
target company.                                                                 

There are no agreements or understandings for the above-named         
officers or directors to resign at the request of another person and            
the above-named officers and directors are not acting on behalf of              
nor will act at the direction of any other person.                              

Recent Blank Check Companies                                                    

James Cassidy, the president and a director of the Company and        
James McKillop, vice president and a director of the Company, are               
involved with other existing blank check companies, and in creating             
additional similar companies.  The initial business purpose of each             
of these companies was or is to engage in a business combination with           
an unidentified company or companies and each were or will be classified        
as a blank check company until completion of a business combination.            

Conflicts of Interest                                                           

The officers and directors of the Company have organized and expect     
to organize other companies with an identicial structure, purpose,              
officers, directors and shareholders.  As such management believes there        
is no conflict of interest in these companies.                                  

The blank check companies with which management (including          
the directors) is involved are identical except for the name.  As and           
when created, no one blank check company offers management any more             
favorable terms than the others.  Thus no conflict of interest                  
arises for management between any of the blank check companies.                 

Mr. Cassidy and/or Mr. McKillop may become associated with            
additional blank check companies prior to the time that the Company             
has effected a business combination.                                            

Mr. Cassidy is the principal of Cassidy & Associates, a securities    
law firm.  As such, demands may be placed on the time of Mr. Cassidy            
which will detract from the amount of time he is able to devote to              
the Company.  Mr. Cassidy intends to devote as much time to the activities      
of the Company as required.  However, should such a conflict arise, there       
is no assurance that Mr. Cassidy would not attend to other matters prior        
to those of the Company.                                                        

There are no binding guidelines or procedures for resolving           
potential conflicts of interest. Failure by management to resolve               
conflicts of interest in favor of the Company could result in                   
liability of management to the Company.  However, any attempt by                
shareholders to enforce a liability of management to the Company                
would most likely be prohibitively expensive and time consuming.                

Code of Ethics.  The Company has not at this time adopted a           
Code of Ethics pursuant to rules described in Regulation S-K.  The              
Company has two persons who are the only shareholders and who serve as          
the directors and officers. The Company has no operations or business and       
does not receive any revenues or investment capital.  The adoption of an        
Ethical Code at this time would not serve the primary purpose of such a         
code to provide a manner of conduct as the development, execution and           
enforcement of such a code would be by the same persons and only                
persons to whom such code applied.  Furthermore, because the Company            
does not have any activities, there are activities or transactions              
which would be subject to this code.  At the time the Company enters            
into a business combination or other corporate transaction, the current         
officers and directors will recommend to any new management that such a         
code be adopted.  The Company does not maintain an Internet website on          
which to post a code of ethics.                                                 

Corporate Governance.  For reasons similar to those described         
above, the Company does not have a nominating nor audit committee of the        
board of directors.  At this time, the Company consists of two shareholders     
who serve as the corporate directors and officers. The Company has no           
activities, and receives no revenues.  At such time that the Company enters     
into a business combination and/or has additional shareholders and a larger     
board of directors and commences activities, the Company will propose           
creating committees of its board of directors, including both a nominating      
and an audit committee.  Because there are only two shareholders of the         
Company, there is no established process by which shareholders to the           
Company can nominate members to the Company's board of directors.               
Similarly, however, at such time as the Company has more shareholders and       
an expanded board of directors, the new management of the Company may           
review and implement, as necessary, procedures for shareholder nomination       
of members to the Company's board of directors.                                 

Item 11.  Executive Compensation
The Company's officers and directors do not receive any               
compensation for services rendered to the Company, nor have they                
received such compensation in the past.  The officers and directors             
are not accruing any compensation pursuant to any agreement with the            
Company.                                                                        

No retirement, pension, profit sharing, stock option or               
insurance programs or other similar programs have been adopted by               
the Company for the benefit of its employees.                                   

The Company does not have a compensation committee for                
the same reasons as described above.                                            

Item 12.  Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and                   
Management and Related Stockholder Matters                  

The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2016, each         
person known by the Company to be the beneficial owner of five                  
percent or more of the Company's common stock and the director and              
officer of the Company.  The Company does not have any compensation             
plans and has not authorized any securities for future issuance.                
Except as noted, the holder thereof has sole voting and investment              
power with respect to the shares shown.

Item 13.  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and                    
Director Independence
The Company has issued a total of 20,000,000 shares of common             
stock pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for services               
performed for the Company with a valuation of an aggregate of $2,000.           

As the organizers and developers of the Company, James M. Cassidy       
and James McKillop may be considered promoters.  Mr. Cassidy has provided       
services to the Company without charge consisting of preparing and filing       
the charter corporate documents and preparing this registration statement.      

The Company is not currently required to maintain an independent          
director as defined by Rule 4200 of the Nasdaq Capital Market nor does          
it anticipate that it will be applying for listing of its securities on         
an exchange in which an independent directorship is required. It is likely      
that neither Mr. Cassidy nor Mr. McKillop would not be considered               
independent directors if it were to do so.                                      

Item 14.  Principal Accounting Fees and Services.
The Company has no activities, no income and no expenses        
except for independent audit and Delaware state fees.  The Company's            
president has donated his time in preparation and filing of all                 
state and federal required taxes and reports.                                   

Audit Fees                                                                      

The aggregate fees incurred for each of the last two years for  
professional services rendered by the independent registered public             
accounting firm for the audits of the Company's annual financial                
statements and review of financial statements included in the Company's         
Form 10-K and Form 10-Q reports and services normally provided in               
connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements were            
as follows:

Audit-Related Fees          $ 1,750                                   

The Company does not currently have an audit committee serving  
and as a result its board of directors performs the duties of an audit          
committee.  The board of directors will evaluate and approve in advance,        
the scope and cost of the engagement of an auditor before the auditor           
renders audit and non-audit services.  The Company does not rely on pre-        
approval policies and procedures.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM           

To the Board of Directors                                                       
Opal Island Acquisition Corporation                                             

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Opal Island Acquisition       
Corporation (the "Company") as of December 31, 2016, and the related statements 
of operations, changes in stockholders' deficit and cash flows for the Period   
from April 4, 2016 (Inception) to December 31, 2016.  These financial           
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our              
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based     
on our audit.                                                                   

We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company       
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we     
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the     
financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company was not     
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal      
control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal  
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an  
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial   
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit includes          
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures     
in the financial statements. Our audit also includes assessing the accounting   
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as        
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our    
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.                              

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,      
in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of           
December 31, 2016 and the results of its operations and its cash flows          
from April 4, 2016 (Inception) to December 31, 2016 in conformity               
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of           
America.                                                                        

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the      
Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the         
financial statements, the Company has had no revenues and income since          
inception. These conditions, among others, raise substantial doubt about        
the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans        
concerning these matters are also described in Note 2, which includes the       
raising of additional equity financing or merger with another entity. The       
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from      
the outcome of this uncertainty.

OPAL ISLAND ACQUISITION CORPORATION           
Notes to Financial Statements           

NOTE 1   NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    
NATURE OF OPERATIONS                                                            

Opal Island Acquisition Corporation ("Opal Island" or "the Company") was        
incorporated on April 4, 2016 under the laws of the state of Delaware           
to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited       
to, selected mergers and acquisitions. The Company has been in the              
developmental stage since inception and its operations to date have been        
limited to issuing shares to its original shareholders. The Company will        
attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination      
of that target company with Opal Island. The combination will normally take     
the form of a merger, stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets exchange.    
In most instances the target company will wish to structure the business        
combination to be within the definition of a tax-free reorganization under      
Section 351 or Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as             
amended. No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful         
in locating or negotiating with any target company. The Company has been        
formed to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to         
become a reporting company with a class of securities registered under the      
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.                                                

BASIS OF PRESENTATION                                                           

The summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed      
to assist in understanding the Company's financial statements. Such financial   
statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the Company's      
management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These      
accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in      
the United States of America ("GAAP") in all material respects, and have        
been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying financial statements.   
The Company has not earned any revenue from operations since inception.         
Accordingly, the Company's activities have been accounted for as those of       
a "Development Stage Enterprise" as set forth in ASC 915, "Development          
Stage Entities." Among the disclosures required by ASC 915, are that the        
Company's financial statements be identified as those of a development stage    
company, and that the statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash   
flows disclose activity since the date of the Company's inception.  The Company 
chose December 31 as its fiscal year end.                                       

USE OF ESTIMATES                                                                

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires        
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported           
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and       
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts   
of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results could    
differ from those estimates.                                                    

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS                                                       

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking        
institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments with original  
maturities of 90 days or less. The Company did not have cash equivalents as     
of December 31, 2016.                                                           

CONCENTRATION OF RISK                                                           

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations    
of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places its cash with    
high quality banking institutions. The Company did not have cash balances       
in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit as of December 31,
2016.

OPAL ISLAND ACQUISITION CORPORATION           
Notes to Financial Statements           

INCOME TAXES 

Under ASC 740, "Income Taxes," deferred tax assets and liabilities are          
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary            
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing        
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets      
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to       
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected   
to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when it is     
more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be    
realized.  As of December 31, 2016 there were no deferred taxes due to the      
uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior     
to expiration.                                                                  

LOSS PER COMMON SHARE                                                           

Basic loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing       
net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding            
during the period. Diluted loss per common share reflect the potential          
dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common      
stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the          
issuance of common stock that then shared in the loss of the entity.  As        
of December 31, 2016, there are no outstanding dilutive securities.             

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS                                             
The Company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of      
financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements      
of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the     
financial statements on a recurring basis. Additionally, the Company adopted    
guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are      
recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a         
nonrecurring basis. The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that        
prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.      
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active  
markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the      
lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs       
(Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as     
follows:                                                                        

 Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the         
measurement date.                                                               

Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1  
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.  

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.          
The carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their fair    
values because of the short maturity of these instruments.                      

NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN                                                          
The Company has not yet generated any revenue since inception to date and       
has sustained operating losses of $2,062 during the period ended December 31,
2016. The Company had a working capital deficit of $750 and an accumulated      
deficit of $2,062 as of December 31, 2016.  The Company's continuation as a     
going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows     
from operations to meet its obligations and/or obtaining additional financing   
from its members or other sources, as may be required.

OPAL ISLAND ACQUISITION CORPORATION           
Notes to Financial Statements           

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the      
Company will continue as a going concern; however, the above condition          
raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to do so. The financial    
statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future        
effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and   
classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to  
continue as a going concern.                                                    

In order to maintain its current level of operations, the Company will require  
additional working capital from either cash flow from operations or from the    
sale of its equity.  However, the Company currently has no commitments          
from any third parties for the purchase of its equity. If the Company is unable 
to acquire additional working capital, it will be required to significantly     
reduce its current level of operations.                                         

NOTE 3 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS                                       

In November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-18,      
"Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash" ("ASU 2016-18").         
The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice by adding or       
clarifying guidance on classification and presentation of changes in            
restricted cash on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective        
for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early         
adoption is permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied          
retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company is currently              
evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-18, which will only impact           
the Company if it has restricted cash in the future.                            

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic    
230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments" ("ASU 2016-    
15"). ASU 2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and     
cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.      
ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.    
The new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it       
is impracticable to apply, in which case it would be required to apply the      
amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company       
is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on its      
condensed financial statements.                                                 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial     
Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties         
about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern". This standard is     
intended to define management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is     
substantial doubt about an organization's ability to continue as a going        
concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. Under U.S. GAAP,           
financial statements are prepared under the presumption that the reporting      
organization will continue to operate as a going concern, except in limited     
circumstances. Financial reporting under this presumption is commonly           
referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern         
basis of accounting is critical to financial reporting because it               
establishes the fundamental basis for measuring and classifying assets and      
liabilities. Currently, U.S. GAAP lacks guidance about management's             
responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the         
organization's ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related     
footnote disclosures. This ASU provides guidance to an organization's           
management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce         
diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly            
provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes.           
The amendments are effective for annual periods ending after December 15,
2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15,
2016. Early application is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods    
for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. The         
Company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard.         

Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its        
Emerging Issues Task Force) and the United States Securities and Exchange       
Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material         
impact on the Company's present or future financial statements.                 

NOTE 4     ACCRUED LIABILITIES                                                  

As of December 31, 2016, the Company had accrued professional fees              
of $750.                                                                        

NOTE 5   STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT                                                  

On April 4, 2016, the Company issued 20,000,000 founders common stock           
to two directors and officers pro rata as founder shares for services           
rendered to the Company, valued at $0.0001 par value per share, for a           
total of $2,000.  The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000                
shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock.                
As of December 31, 2016, 20,000,000 shares of common stock and no               
preferred stock were issued and outstanding.                                    

NOTE 6  SUBSEQUENT EVENT                                                        

Management has evaluated subsequent events through April 9, 2017,               
the date which the financial statements were available to be issued.            
All subsequent events requiring recognition as of December 31, 2016 have        
been incorporated into these financial statements and there are no              
subsequent events that require disclosure in accordance with FASB               
ASC Topic 855, "Subsequent Events."
