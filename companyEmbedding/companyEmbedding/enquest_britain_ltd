  29 June 2017

EnQuest PLC announces that Dr Philip Nolan will be stepping down as a Director of the Company with effect from 4 July, when he assumes new responsibilities as Non-Executive Chairman of Associated British Ports Holdings Limited, the direct holding company of Associated British Ports.






  26 June 2017
  

  Kraken First Oil
  
EnQuest confirms that first oil from the Kraken development was delivered on 23 June 2017. During the initial ramp-up period, the 13 wells that have been drilled and completed to date, comprising 7 producers and 6 injectors, are being brought online in a phased manner, to maximise long term productivity and value. 






  25 May 2017
  

  Operational Update
  
Kraken on track and 2017 production guidance confirmed.






  21 March 2017
  

  2016 FULL YEAR RESULTS ANNOUNCEMENT
  
ENQUEST PLC, 21 March 2017.  Results for the year ended 31 December 2016*. 






  17 February 2017
  

  KRAKEN FPSO IN THE FIELD AND HOOKED UP
  
The Kraken Floating Production Storage and Offloading (‘FPSO’) vessel arrived at the field on Monday 13 February, anticipating good weather conditions. The hook up of the Submerged Turret Production (‘STP’) buoy mooring system, to the FPSO was completed on 15th February and a full rotation test performed so that the vessel is now on station and securely moored.  Commissioning work will continue on the topsides. Reconstruction of the turret area pipework and connection of the risers and umbilicals to the swivel stack is being undertaken followed by commissioning of the subsea infrastructure. Delivery of first oil in Q2 2017 is on track.






  24 January 2017
  

  Trading and Operations Update
  
Key 2016 highlights

Production averaged 39,751 Boepd in 2016, up 8.7% on 2015, with production in the UK North Sea up 11.3%
		This was EnQuest’s highest annual production since the company started in 2010. Final production was adversely affected by the shutdown period at the end of the year, where the maintenance shutdown of the Brent Pipeline System took over a week longer than was anticipated, with winter weather also hampering the work necessary to bring production fully back onstream.

Final reported 2016 unit opex is expected to be around the lower end of latest full year guidance range of $25/bbl to $27/bbl.
Reported 2016 cash capex is also expected to be around the lower end of the range, of $620 million to $670 million.
Net debt as at 31 December 2016 expected to be approximately $1.8 billion







  24 January 2017
  

  ACQUISITION OF 25% OF MAGNUS OIL FIELD ENQUEST TO TAKE OVER OPERATORSHIP OF MAGNUS, SULLOM VOE TERMINAL AND ASSOCIATED INFRASTRUCTURE WITH NO CASH OUTLAY
  
EnQuest PLC (together with its subsidiaries, "EnQuest"), is pleased to announce an agreement to acquire from BP an initial 25% interest in the Magnus oil field ("Magnus") representing c.15.9 MMboe of additional net 2P reserves (gross reserves of 63.4 MMboe) with net production of 4.2 Mboe/d in 2016 (gross production 16.6 Mboe/d) as well as a 3.0% interest in the Sullom Voe oil terminal and supply facility ("SVT"), 9.0% of Northern Leg Gas Pipeline ("NLGP"), and 3.8% of Ninian Pipeline System ("NPS") (collectively the "Transaction Assets").

Welcome to EnQuest


EnQuest is an oil and gas development and production company focused on turning opportunities into value by targeting maturing assets and undeveloped oil fields.

EnQuest is one of the largest UK independent oil producers in the UK North Sea and has a presence in Malaysia. EnQuest’s assets include producing oil fields, new developments and a portfolio of discoveries.


            Vision and Strategy
            






                  EnQuest’s 2016 Full Year Results 
                
EnQuest’ CEO Amjad Bseisu said:
“EnQuest further streamlined its operations in 2016 and delivered cash capital expenditure at $609 million and unit opex at $24.6/bbl, both well down on the previous year. Operationally EnQuest worked at high levels of production efficiency and safely delivered production averaging 39,751 Boepd, our highest annual production figure, supporting our financial objectives.

2016 saw the successful restructuring of our balance sheet, designed to strengthen EnQuest’s liquidity position, to reduce the level of its cash debt service obligations and to enable it to bring the Kraken development onstream.

In early 2017, EnQuest securely moored the Kraken FPSO on station in the North Sea, where commissioning work continues on the vessel and the subsea infrastructure; preparations for the handover to operations are ongoing. The project remains below budget and on track to deliver first oil in Q2 2017.

In early 2017, EnQuest and BP announced EnQuest’s proposed acquisition of interests in the Magnus oil field and the Sullom Voe oil terminal. The innovative structure of the acquisition recognises EnQuest’s differential strength in managing maturing assets and infrastructure, whilst generating significant potential for future growth.

EnQuest’s combination of integrated technical capabilities and high levels of production efficiency and cost control ideally positions us to create value from assets such as Magnus and from the substantial potential in our existing asset portfolio, with 215 MMboe of net 2P reserves at the end of 2016. Our journey to optimise and increase production and reduce costs continues, with average 2017 production anticipated to be between 45,000 Boepd and 51,000 Boepd. Following delivery of Kraken, EnQuest will begin moving from a period of heavy capital investment into one focused on cash generation and deleveraging the balance sheet.”
As at 21 March 2017
