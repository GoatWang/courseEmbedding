Geoffrey Davis is commonly known as the Frisco Mortgage Guy because he is an integral member of the Frisco community where he lived since 2002. As a father of four, Geoffrey understands that for most people, their homes are not only their biggest financial investment but also the most important place to shelter and nurture their families.
Geoffrey’s clients trust him to find the mortgage products that are right for them, always keeping their best interest as the top priority. Geoffrey consistently encourages his clients to set realistic goals around purchase amounts to help them avoid the “house rich/cash poor” trap that homebuyers can fall into when they overreach their budgets. He has always discouraged clients from pursuing risky loan products which may be one reason why many of his clients were less impacted by the recent mortgage crisis than some others in the area.
 “Keeping it real” is Geoffrey’s philosophy. His focus is on ensuring that his clients understand the real costs of homeownership, and that they are ready for these costs. If a client is currently carrying a heavy debt load, he will encourage them to reduce the debt before pursuing a home loan. He takes the time to educate clients about home expenses – both expected and unexpected – that can become unbearable when laboring under the burden of debt. Geoffrey also explains how the best rates are available to those with higher credit scores, and how debt can reduce those scores, leading to a loan that is both more expensive and less beneficial to the client.
The bottom line for Geoffrey is making sure that his clients get the right loan product that works best for them. Taking the time to get to know each client, educating them, and providing honest, realistic information and guidance is simply the way he does business. A home is a long term investment, and Geoffrey views his relationships with his clients the same way.

About
The Company was founded in 1963, by Geoff Davies who bought his first tipper wagon, delivering mainly sand and gravel. After trying many types of tipper work Geoff decided to purchase a lime spreader which saw him diversify into agricultural contracting, providing a service of sowing, lime spreading  and hedge cutting etc.
During the early 70’s Geoff with the support of his wife Sheila branched out into bulk blowing animal feed deliveries, which led to a very successful growth within the company until the mid 1990’s when the agricultural industry began to decline. Geoff and the family made the decision to move the business into other areas. They decided to build a Warehouse providing Chilled and Ambient Storage.
This has now grown to include Storage, Cheese Reclamation, Packing & Labelling. In September 2010, Geoff and Sheila decided to step back from the running of the business. The Company is now run by their son Adrian and his wife Polly.

Geoffrey F. Davies













                    
                    Dr. Geoffrey F. (Geoff) Davies is a scientist, author and commentator.The Seventh Generation series:1. Economia (ABC Books, 2004)2. The Nature of the Beast (unpublished, 2012)3. Sack the Economists (BWM Books, 2013)4. The Rise and Failure of the Radical Right (BetterNature, May 2017)5. Desperately Seeking the Fair Go (BetterNature, July 2017).(The Grand Council of the Six Nations of the Iroquois is reputed to have included one member whose role was to speak for the seventh generation unborn.)The Scientist:Geoff is a retired Senior Fellow (now a Visiting Fellow) in geophysics at the Australian National University.  He has authored over one hundred scientific papers and two scientific books and has a Hirsch index of 40 (40 papers each with at least 40 citations, indicating significant international standing and influence).In 2005 he was awarded the inaugural Augustus Love medal for geodynamics by the European Geosciences Union.  He was selected in 1992 as a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union, an honour reserved for 0.1% of membership per year.  His most recent scientific book, Mantle Convection for Geologists, won the 2011 Mary B. Ansari Best Reference Work Award of the GeoScience Information Society.On economics:Geoff has been delving into the strange world of economics for nearly twenty years, bringing his four-decade experience as a practising scientist to bear on a discipline that, in the mainstream, has never understood how proper science works. It is pseudo-scientific, and pre-scientific.The Commentator:Geoff has contributed opinion pieces over many years to newspapers, magazines and online.  Since 2009 he has preserved many on the blog http://betternature.wordpress.com .  He has long experience, in science and elsewhere, in assessing fractious debates on difficult topics.  He has lectured on New Science and Old Wisdom and Playing With Superfire (the misapplication of technology to biological systems).Personal:Born to a farming family and growing up in Australia, Geoff's life has taken him to the USA and back and through several important stages - student, scientist, commentator, learning to be a real person (i.e. growing up some more), father, grandfather and Author Outside His Designated Field.  These days he is less concerned with exploring the universe and more concerned with helping humanity to live sensibly with each other on the only planet we have.
