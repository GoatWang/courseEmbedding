Univar Seeks Acquisitions
Jun 6 17
Univar Inc. (NYSE:UNVR) can achieve double-digit profit growth organically through shifting its mix to sell more specialties. Plus, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) can accelerate that growth, according to Stephen Newlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "We had to hit the pause button earlier as we wanted to first better understand markets and see where the attractive opportunities were - where we can get scalable acquisitions we can leverage. Previously the company was acquiring whatever was available. Now it needs to make strategic sense," said Stephen Newlin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

Where do you find the products we sell?
Hidden in our branded goods


Univar supplies a luminescent pigment called Lumilux used in brand protection. If you shine a UV light at the top of a branded spirit bottle or on designer wear, the name should appear. The same technique is used on passports.






				   What our suppliers say
				


It is great for us to work with a company like Univar, which knows the European API market so well. Their expertise has been invaluable in helping us meet regulatory requirements and their comprehensive pan-European distribution network is very attractive for us.

Why Univar


                                                        Univar = Chemistry Delivered
                                                    

What we do


                                                        Global chemistry distribution and innovative services
                                                    

What we believe


                                                        Safety, health and the environment come first
                                                    














                                                Grapefruit juice: a makeover story.
                                            

A beverage manufacturer asked Univar for help with a grapefruit juice that they
wanted to fortify with calcium and fiber. Univar’s food specialists were able
to recommend and source products that wouldn’t impact the juice’s flavor,
clarity or mouthfeel, and the final product was exactly what the manufacturer and
its customers were looking for — a fresh-from-the-tree taste with the added
benefit of calcium and fiber.


Calcium and fiber weren’t the only things the Univar food team had to offer,
though.

                                                New shine for a hair care line.
                                            

A firm was still marketing a hair care line that they'd developed years ago. The ten-year-old shampoo and conditioner were out of touch with the effects that today's consumers expect, and the ingredients required to achieve them — the products used last century's technology to achieve last century's results.


Our personal care team saw an opportunity to help.

                                                A sustainable solution for safer roadways.


                                        Univar employs a team responsible for marketing the products that make driving on
                                        winter roads safer. Traditionally, the team has promoted a menu of conventional
                                        deicers, like rock salt and calcium chloride. But a global focus on renewable resources
                                        and sustainability presented an opportunity to reassess our product line —
                                        the right green product from the right source could complement Univar's deicing
                                        portfolio rather than compete with it.

                                                Navigating the maze of global pharmaceutical regulations.
                                            

                                        In pharmaceutical applications, a small change can result in big ramifications.
                                        Because of the stringent regulations surrounding pharmaceutical products, a formulation
                                        change, even if it's just a change in colorant, can create a deluge of notification,
                                        documentation and testing requirements for a manufacturer.

                                        Univar's expertise in the regulatory process and our value-added administrative
                                        services to the pharmaceutical industry made us the natural choice when a manufacturer
                                        wanted to change a white tablet to a soft orange.

Univar has over 85 years of experience in sourcing, managing, and distributing chemicals. Our long-standing relationships with premier chemical suppliers ensure that we can connect you with the products you need, when and where you need them. At Univar, we expect the unexpected. Our network of strategically-placed locations offers back-up inventories should supply chain disruptions occur.
We offer flexible packaging options to fit your needs, including barge, railcar, truck, mini-bulk, tote, and drum. We strictly adhere to FDA standards when packaging and storing regulated products and perform stability testing on Univar-packaged USP containers, providing the quality assurance you need.

Chemistry plays a vital role in preventing the spread of diseases. Chlorine helps keep our kids healthy by killing germs found in swimming pools. Univar provides chlorine, bleach, and many other products to city municipalities around the world for pools, drinking water, and wastewater treatment, helping make people's lives safer and healthier.
