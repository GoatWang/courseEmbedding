                                    Claimant's opinion:





                                    David Hyman and entered an contractual agreement for photography services concerning a 8 x 10 portrait/CD for all paying guests within a week of the event July 14, 2012.  Additionally, he was to provide me with a framed family portrait and family album.  After contacting him several times to complete our business, he only delivered 20 CDs, 5 weeks after the event and nothing else.  This response was only after I threatened legal action.  He then wrote an e-mail demanding that I not recommend him to anyone else or anyone in my party along with not ever doing business with me again.  Finally, he indicated on 8/19/12 that he would pay my $420 back and send the photos.  To date that has not happened.

                            PeopleClaim is a new way to resolve disputes online without lawyers or mediators.
                            By inviting suggestions from the public, disputing parties get ideas that can lead
                            to settlement – and the person(s) who contributed them can win a reward.

                            Here's what to do: Read the case (left side of page). Then go to the bottom of the
                            page and enter your suggestion in the space provided. Click the Solution button.

                            Your suggestion will be sent to both parties and will post on the claim. If the
                            two sides agree to settle based on your suggestion, you're eligible to win. Note:
                            Cash rewards may be split among more than one person if settlement depends on ideas
                            from more than one contributor. If you have a claim of your own to resolve, click here.
