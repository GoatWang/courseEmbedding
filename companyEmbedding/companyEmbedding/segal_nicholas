Member, Board of Directors

                    2012 - ?                  


TherapeuticsMD, Inc.

                    TherapeuticsMD is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on creating safe and effective branded prescription, generic prescription, and over-the-counter (non-prescription) products targeted exclusively for women. We are driven to pursue the development and commercialization of three advanced hormone replacement products designed to alleviate the symptoms of and reduce the health risks resulting from menopause-related hormone deficiencies, including hot flashes, osteoporosis, and vaginal dryness. These proposed hormone replacement products, which contain estrogen and progestin alone or in combination, are being tested to provide equivalent efficacy at lower doses, enabling an enhanced side effect profile compared with competing products. These proposed hormone replacement therapy products have received Investigational New Drug acceptance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

We plan to begin phase 3 clinical trials of all three developmental candidates in 2013. We intend to leverage and grow our current marketing and sales organization to commercialize these products in the United States assuming the successful completion of the FDA regulatory process. We are also evaluating various other indications for our hormone technology, including oral contraception, preterm birth, vulvovaginal atrophy, and premature ovarian failure. The oral progestin market was approximately $400 million in 2011 U.S. sales; the estrogen market was approximately $800 million; and the combination Progestin/Estrogen market was $600 million.

As we expand the clinical development of our proposed hormone replacement products, we continue to market and grow our branded prescription and over-the-counter product lines consisting of prenatal vitamins, vegan DHA, iron supplements, Vitamin D supplements, natural menopause relief products, and scar tissue and stretch mark creams under our vitaMedMD brand and our generic prescription prenatal vitamins under our BocaGreenMD Prena1 name.

Our sales model focuses on the "4Ps": patient, provider, pharmacist, and payor. We market and sell our current products through a national sales force of full-time professionals that call on healthcare providers in the OB/GYN market space, as well as through our website directly to consumers. We strive to demonstrate to physicians that prescribing or recommending our products enables them to realize office efficiencies and patient and payor cost savings over competitive products, strategies, and distribution models. In addition, our products offer health care providers an alternative to patients to meet their individual nutritional and financial requirements related to co-pay and cost of care considerations. We also believe that our combination of brand, generic, and over-the-counter lines allows physicians, women, and payors cost-effective alternatives for top quality care.

Our fully staffed customer care center uses current customer relationship management technologies to respond to health care providers, pharmacies, and consumers via incoming and outgoing telephone calls, e-mails, and live-chat. We also facilitate repeat customer orders through our auto-ship feature
