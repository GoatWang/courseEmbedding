How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.              
              
            

12:40 p.m. July 28, 2017






What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?              
              
            

5:47 p.m. July 27, 2017

Beyond Tesla: 7 stocks driving the autonomous car revolution
              
              Look at these component manufacturers rather than the car companies, says Jeff Reeves.

These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform
              
              It wasn’t Trump’s “movement” that lifted stocks late last year, says Jeff Reeves. It was the promise of lower corporate tax rates.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.

Fund Overview



















The Fund seeks to provide long-term capital appreciation and income to investors by employing investment strategies
and asset allocation policies followed by traditional endowment funds. The Fund is designed to provide a âturn-keyâ
endowment strategy in a single offering. To best facilitate the implementation of the endowment strategy, a closed-end
interval structure is used which provides the adviser the flexibility to include diverse investments and asset classes while
also providing investors with daily share purchases and quarterly share repurchases.

                Comprehensive portfolio diversifier for investors
                

 
                Total return approach with an income component
                

 
                Investment manager focuses on seeking long-term capital appreciation
                






Fund Features:




 
                Complete, turn-key endowment strategy allocation
                

 
                Broadly diversified investment portfolio
                

 
                Quarterly redemption offer

Investment Strategy





















The endowment investment strategy has been embraced by many colleges, universities and other institutions across the globe as the best approach for managing their financial assets.


The endowment investment strategy seeks to increase total portfolio return while maintaining an acceptable level of risk through diversifying into performance-oriented assets other than U.S. stocks and bonds. Additional asset classes targeted include global equities, real estate, private equity, natural resources, absolute return investments (hedge funds and managed futures), and additional asset classes. Endowments have a long term investment time horizon with low liquidity needs that can take advantage of all of these different asset classes. Investors should consider how closely their investment goals and needs match those of endowments.          
          






Endowment Strategy Portfolios Key Similarities


 


BROAD DIVERSIFICATION
					
						Investments are made in numerous investment categories ranging from traditional equities and bonds to alternative investments such as real estate and private equity.
					
				

REDUCED CORRELATION
					
          Limited or low correlation between investments is targeted to reduce overall portfolio volatility.
          
				

ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS
					A large percentage of the portfolio is devoted to holdings other than U.S. stocks and bonds.
				
 


ILLIQUID INVESTMENTS
					Investments that cannot be quickly sold are targeted because they can offer performance premiums to compensate for their lack of liquidity.
				

REAL ASSETS
					Investments in real or hard assets such as real estate are sought because they can offer inflation protection and income as well as capital appreciation potential.
				

VARIOUS INVESTMENT STRUCTURES
					Different structures and investment vehicles are used to gain access to more unique opportunities and performance characteristics.
				
 
 










A "Typical" Allocation1
Endowments normally invest significant percentages of their funds into different sectors and limit their exposure to fixed income. The  potential allocation shown at right highlights a possible endowment model portfolio.
									The allocation shown at right also highlights a potential allocation that the Wildermuth Endowment Strategy Fund may employ.1

(1) Portfolio holdings and allocations subject to change without notice and may not represent current or future portfolio composition or allocations.

Important Risk Disclosures























WILDERMUTH ADVISORY, LLC IS AN SEC-REGISTERED INVESTMENT ADVISER THAT ADVISES THE FUND. Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund. This and other important information is contained within the Fund’s Prospectus, which can be obtained by calling (888) 889-8981. The Fund’s Prospectus should be read carefully before investing. Investing in the Fund involves risk, including  those summarized below.
An investment in the Fund is generally subject to market risk, including the loss of the entire principal amount invested. An investment in the Fund represents an indirect investment in the securities owned by the Fund.


           Endowments have a long term investment time horizon with low liquidity needs. Investors should consider how closely their investment goals and needs match those of endowments

           Like all financial instruments, the value of these securities may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. The value of your investment in the Fund at any point in time may be worth less than the value of your original investment, even after taking into account any reinvestment of dividends and distributions.

           When the Fund invests in equity securities, the Fund’s investments in those securities are subject to price fluctuations based on a number of reasons of issuer-specific and broader economic or international considerations. They may also decline due to factors which affect a particular industry or industries. In addition, equity securities prices may be particularly sensitive to rising interest rates, as the cost of capital rises and borrowing costs increase.

           The Fund may invest in publicly-traded and non-traded REITs or privately offered pooled investment vehicles that hold real estate as well as invest in real estate directly through entities owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the Fund. As a result, the Fund’s portfolio may be significantly impacted by the performance of the real estate market and may experience more volatility and be exposed to greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.

           REIT share prices may decline because of adverse developments affecting the real estate industry and real property values. In general, real estate values can be affected by a variety of factors, including supply and demand for properties, the economic health of the country or of different regions, and the strength of specific industries that rent properties.

           Exposure to the commodities markets may subject the Fund to greater volatility than investments in more traditional securities. The value of commodity-linked investments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as weather, and international economic, political and regulatory developments.

           The Fund may invest in medium- and small-capitalization companies, which may be newly formed or have limited product lines, distribution channels and financial or managerial resources. The risks associated with these investments are generally greater than those associated with investments in the securities of larger, more-established companies. This may cause the Fund’s net asset value to be more volatile when compared to investment companies that focus only on large-capitalization companies.

           The Fund is classified as a non-diversified management investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. This means that the Fund may invest a greater portion of its assets in a limited number of issuers than would be the case if the Fund were classified as a diversified management investment company. Accordingly, the Fund may be more sensitive to any single economic, business, political or regulatory occurrence than the value of shares of a diversified investment company.

           The shares have no history of public trading, nor is it intended that the shares will be listed on a public exchange at this time.

           We do not expect a secondary market in the shares to develop. Even if any such market were to develop, closed-end fund shares trade frequently at a discount from net asset value, which creates a risk of loss for investors purchasing shares in the initial public offering.

           You should consider the shares to be an illiquid investment. Even though the Fund will make periodic repurchase offers to repurchase a portion of the shares to provide some liquidity to shareholders, only a limited number of shares will be eligible for repurchase by us. Once each quarter, the Fund will offer to repurchase at net asset value (NAV) per share no less than 5% of the outstanding shares of the Fund, unless such offer is suspended or postponed in accordance with regulatory requirements. The Fund may increase the size of these offerings up to a maximum of 25% of the Fund’s outstanding shares, in the sole discretion of the Board, but it is not expected that the Board will do so.

           You should consider that you may not have immediate access to the money you invest for an indefinite period of time. An investment in our shares is not suitable for you if you need immediate access to the money you invest.

1 Record Date: Date of distribution amount declared.
2 Ex Date/Payable Date: Date of distribution paid to investors.
The Fund may make distribution that are treated as return of capital. A return of capital may occur for example, when some or all money that you invested in a Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect a Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with "yield", "income", or "profit". You should not draw any conclusions about a Fund's investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund's distribution policy.
Distributions are not guaranteed.

Information is updated every day at approximately 6P CST. The Last Price, Change, and Change Percent is listed at the top, with other quote data listed in the quoteboard below.  Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity. YTD High, Low, Change, %Change: The high and low price year-to-date, with the change and percent change year-to-date.

Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy.
