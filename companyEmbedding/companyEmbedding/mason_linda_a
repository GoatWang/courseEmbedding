The Real Housewives of New York City

Posted on June 5, 2017 by Linda 

Portraits as opposed to photos are timeless. I love doing them be they mixed media like this one of Carole Radziwill http://lindamasongallery.com/current-exhibition/   or a more classical portrait such as the acrylic on canvas I do of both children and adults   . http://lindamasongallery.com/portfolio/classic-childrens-portraits/   Portraits add Mystery and warmth to a home. If they are of the Host or Hostess, a good one will let you discover a different side to  them. If they are of people that you don’t know, you can use your own imagination to create a whole story around them. Great artists such as Mark Kostabi  capture a depth of human  nature without any facial features I capture that in the facial features, each artist is different. Many Americans are afraid to have paintings of people on a wall preferring more impersonal Art such as Abstract or scenery. Are we afraid of  Intimacy  ? A person is a “paysage” equally as deep and as interesting as The Grand Canyon. Watch out on Bravo June 7th at 9pm. The Real Housewives of New York City episode 10, part of this episode was filmed at my Solo show at the Gallery Vendome here in Soho, New York in December of 2016. To get a sneak peak and see how much fun the filming of the show was  check out my new Facebook page Linda Mason Art. To discuss comissioning portrait  call the number on the website:- www.lindamasongallery.com

Kim Kardashian makeup

Posted on September 17, 2016 by Linda 


I took some photos of  the actress Sarah  Reinsch with a classic smokey eye, a la Kim Kardashian, while filming her this week. Check out my blog, the one before last where I had her looking more natural and you will see how versatile she is.
To recreate this makeup , the products are all at www.lindamason.com:-
Snow White cream base. Transluscent light powder. Bare blush. Contouring powder, Driftwood and highlighter pearl. Eyeshadows:- Solo Opal in the inner corner next to the eye. In the outer corner Cocoa and Pitch black softened with a layer of Brown earth. These were also applied delicately under the eye. Black pencil inside the lower rim of  the eyes…and lots and lots of black lashes. I oulined the lips with the pencil Sandstone and used a nude gloss.

Interns

Posted on September 14, 2016 by Linda 

 At the Art of Beauty by Linda Mason  I had Interns and assistants from all walks of life and have stayed friends and in contact with most of them. They each brought inspiration to me in different ways . It is so good to keep in touch and see their progression. The top photos are recent ones I have just taken of Sarah Reinsch  who interned and worked for me 6 years ago. The smaller ones  I took 6 years ago. Sarah is both a gymnast and a dancer and now an actress so very much an inspiration as I love movement. On my Instagram lindamasonnyc I have posted a rough clip from one of my new films where I have painted her again.

Location for Photoshoot

Posted on August 29, 2016 by Linda 

We were very fortunate to have the use of the BBFL http://www.jplusbdesign.com/store/c43/BBFL.html space in Parkslope Brooklyn for the last makeup class session in July. It was also good for the photo shoot as we had a variety of different daylight situations to work in. Here is Sage from Major Models in one of the many settings in a dress from www.janewilsonmarquis.com hair by Almog and styling by Sylvie Holden and Gaby Garcia.

Makeup Class Photoshoot 8

Posted on August 27, 2016 by Linda 

 Congratulations to Nene Yamamoto for keeping the delicate freshness of Tatum from www.majormodel.com who was the baby of our models on this shoot. Nene did this both with the natural makeup and the stronger one by using soft pinks and iridescent silver and glitter. Almog did the hair and the styling was by Gabriela Garcia and Sylvia Holden with a www.minimal Hustle.com Tshirt and a www.janewilsonmarquis.com dress.

Makeup Class Photoshoot 7

Posted on August 26, 2016 by Linda 

Sage http://www.majormodel.com has one of those ivory skins that just captures the light and great bone structure perfect for natural beauty. Stronger makeup definitely changes her.  I especialy loved her look  as she ressembled Thalita who I was lucky to have assist me  from the ages of 14 till 21, when I closed the Art of Beauty in 2013 she left for New Orleans and  I miss her dearly. Kyoko Kosaki, Sage’s talented makeup artist, applied a little too much  for the natural makeup and I had to have her remove most  of it, she did an amazing job after that false start. When I say natural, I mean natural! Fresh bare skin minimal, if any, eye makeup and concealer, clean brows and gloss. For her natural look Sylvia dressed Sage in a Minimal Hustle T shirt and for the stronger makeup a dress by Jane Wilson Marquis. Hair by Almog .

Makeup class Photoshoot 6

Posted on August 25, 2016 by Linda 

The makeup of the model Kendall from Click http://clickmodel.com was done by Sayaka Sato. A fabulous fresh natural look (right) then an elegant classic with a cool twist acheived through applying a corn colored blush to the cheeks and green shadow to the brows. Hair by Almog and styling by Sylvia Holden and Gabriela Garcia.

Makeup Class Photoshoot 5

Posted on August 23, 2016 by Linda 

When the artist Kimi Goto did the makeup on Rose from the agency Click www.clickmodelnyc.com , I was pretty amazed. Kimi had never done makeup on a darker skinned model before. She did a fabulous natural makeup ,which you can see  in the blog “Photoshoot Styling” but I just had to do  her “Freestyle” makeup alone, it was so creative.  At first taken aback by the strength of it, when I looked through the camera I realized how well it worked on Rose. The colors were custom blended Kryolan aquacolor colors. Hair by Almog Burbea and styling by Sylvia Holden.

 MAKEUP FOR AGELESS BEAUTY
        published by Random House
        May 2011
©2011 Linda Mason
Price $19.99
 Linda shares her tricks of the trade that she's cultivated in her more
than three decades as a makeup artist and reveals how to create the most
attractive version of ourselves.  The pages are packed with gorgeous
photographs featuring beautiful women from all walks of life, including
such supermodels and celebrities as Brooke Shields, Carol Alt, Joan Jett,
Kim Alexis, Paulina Porizkova, and Veronica Webb, all of whom have
benefited from Linda's masterful eye and creative use of color.
"My biggest  dilemma in doing this book was how to categorize the makeup to make it simple  for you the reader to follow. I tried several things, including splitting them  up by age, but that didn’t work because many of these makeup looks can work  well on women of all ages, and I don’t want readers to feel limited by the age  ranges. Every age has its challenges, but challenges with the right attitude  are that much more fun! I finally settled on overall makeup themes for the  makeup applications themselves, starting with Subtle Color, for everyday wear;  Glamorous Color, for more dramatic effect; and Creative Color, for those times  when you’re feeling adventurous and open to experimenting! Each of these women  has a journey and a story to tell about how makeup works for her and expresses  who she is. I hope you will be inspired not just by their looks but by their  creative, even adventurous spirits." -Linda Mason

 SUN-SIGN MAKEOVERS 
        Publisher: Farrar, Straus, Giroux
©1986Linda Mason
Price $10

  


This book, published in              1986,contains lots of handy techniques and interesting pieces of information              that are very useful for makeup today. Linda explains how the differnt zodiac              signs are attracted to certain things and how that all interacts with beauty              and fashion. Each chapter begins with a basic description of the physical              characteristics that Linda has found to be common with each zodiac sign and              which can be enhanced with makeup; she uses celebrities to exemplify her              points. Then there's a series of three "Before and Afters" of regular women              in that zodiac sign and Linda adds detailed how-to's for each of those three              looks. It's easy to try the looks at home because Linda draws out each step              for you. It's also fun to read about your sign and see what celebrities and              models you are entwined with. The comments about some of the models and              celebrities Mason has worked with make for an interesting and entertaining              read. She explains not only how to match up your makeup with your horoscope              sign and harmonize your outer and inner beauty, but gives splendid remarks on              how this knowledge has helped her with her craft. Her voice is wise and              encouraging, it really makes you want to go out and try all her suggestions              for your sign.

			What is it: Two eyeliner gels and an eyeliner brush from celebrity makeup artist Linda Mason.Who is it for: Women who love the strength of black liner but not the harshness, as well as women who would like to try some color in a subtle, easy-to-wear way.Why is it different: Moire has beautiful red reflections that add dimension and accentuate the color of the eyes. It works on blue eyes as well as on hazel, green, and brown.Kingfisher, a beautiful deep turquoise, is a color that will flatter any eye color and can update any look.The brush holds the liner and allows you to manipulate the color more easily and cleanly.How do I use it: Dot the Moire liner between the lashes with the point of the brush to accentuate the lash line and give the appearance of thicker lashes. Use Moire to create a strong, dramatic look by lining the upper lid at the base of the lashes and extending the line upward in the outer corner. When applying both liners together, first apply Moire to the outer corner, drawing inward to the center of the eye. Wipe the brush, then apply Kingfisher from the inner corner to join with the Moire.Give a lifted look to the eyes with either of the shadows by applying the color in the outer half of the eye only.Create a smudged effect by applying the liner, then blend the edges of the line outward with your fingertip or brush. Apply Kingfisher alone, at the base of the upper lashes, or over your more neutral makeup to update it.To have a third color, mix the two liners together to create a deep green.From Linda Mason.Includes:
	    
  0.13-oz eyeliner gel in Moire, a black shade with silky red reflections0.13-oz eyeliner gel in Kingfisher, a deep turquoise shadeEyeliner bushMade in USA

 IMPRESSED
 I`ve been using this for 2 weeks now and I really like it, first off the colors are very pretty, the texture is a little thin so I have to go over the same line twice which means I use more product, and thirdly the brush helps quite a lot. I`m a eyeliner junkie so I`ve tried billions of them and I would rate this 1 out of 10...an 9, so this product is really good. It`s also easy to use so it cuts the time in my morning routine ;-) and its a good deal for 2 eyeliners plus a brush!

 STAYS ON
 I needed an eyeliner that would stay on in high humidity weather and this product worked well.
 09-12-12
 excellent, water proof, easy to use eyeliner!!
 I have had this for a while... it is really very, very good and will stay on through just about anything. The colors are very, very nice with the blue being especially lovely. The black has a tinge of red tone so it is not harsh and looks good with just about anything. I wonder why QVC does not have more of Linda Mason's products? They are nicely priced and the quality is extremely good...
I know there are quite a few other colors by Linda Mason... would be nice to see her other products...
Oh and these are nice little tubs and color is very concentrated/intense and will take years to use up... to protect them I keep them in a little plastic bag as I figure I will have them for years!!
 09-12-12
 Too expensive
 I thought this product was just average, way too expensive for such a small amount. It went on easy enough, but for me had no staying power. Having said that, I have a hard time keeping gel liners on. I do much better with a liquid. The product did not smudge or run, it just didn't stay on. Bobi Brown's works better, for me.
 09-03-12
 Black should mean black...
 The video said this was a black eyeliner with enhanced color mixed in. One would assume this meant black with a hit of red, etc.. The eyeliner is mauve/plum...not black.Does not look black in the container nor does it look this way on. And that is fine for those who liked it, but I was looking for a black with a twist, not plum. So it is a bit of misrepresention, and I have to send it back. As far as gel goes, it had staying power. But I had no real use for the turquoise, so this was just a "fail" for me. VERY happy for those who liked it, but I like the drama of black. It works on my brown eyes...reddish plummy black does not.

 VA VA VOOM
 I read the negative reviews, and puzzled. Perhaps these ladies didn't start with
clean eyelids? My results were amazing. I can now forget about smudgy eyes.
I have deep-set, oily eyelids that are not getting any younger. I've tried just about
everything presented. This is the best! It goes on smoothly, dries quickly, and stays all
day. The brush is fabulous too, and takes up very little room in my travel kit. I love both
the "kingfisher", and the "moire".

 Best Liner EVER!
 I am 55, and very active. I have tried every eyeliner made, and because of my age, when my eyes are fully open the skin under my brow sags to where it touches my eyeliner area. For this reason, all liners have smeared, and been imprinted on top right below my brow. UNTIL NOW! I hesitated to spend this much, but the reviews made me try it ... it went on SO easy, and was dry almost immediately. NO smudging, NO smearing, and I literally fell asleep with it on ... woke up to beautifully lined eyes! My husband even asked me what I did to my eyes, because they were beautiful!!!! I truly LOVE this product! Would love a few more colors, too!!! And, ways to purchase another brush so I could have one for each color! Feel like a movie star when wearing it! My eyes look so much younger!!!
 07-26-12
 Ten Stars!!!!
 This is the bomb of gel liners...........I have never noticed this on air before....It is the Best combo ever!!!! I am ordering a second set tohave on hand!!!!!!! This needs more air time on the makeup shows!!!!!!! I only just ordered and love the Tarte deep black inside the eye line...adding this outer area........... now I have perfect combo!!!!!!
GET this liner...you will be hooked...!!!!! DoesLinda Mason have more products on the Q...??? Hope to see more of this line!!!

 My Bad
 For thinking if I paid $50.00 I'd get an eyeliner that would work for my old droopy eyelids. NOT. I am returning
 07-23-12
 Wonderful
 Love it! Stays put and the brush is amazing. Please more colors.
 07-18-12
 LOVE, LOVE, LOVE
 I am in my 50's with very oily eyelids and FINALLY I found an eyeliner that stays put! Super product - highly recommend.
 07-06-12
 BEST EVER
 Okay, I also have tired many different types of eyeliners, but, this is far the best eyeliner I have ever used. My eyelids do have some droopiness to them that causes eyeliner to wear off very quickly. I find with this eyeliner if you have the same issue that I have, just apply the eyeliner then I take a blow dryer or just blow on my upper eye lid it drys quickly and stays put. I can wear this all day long with no smearing, IT STAYS PUT. I never in a million years thought I would spend this kind of money on eyeliner, but, it is worth every penny. Please bring more colors or better yet, offer this in individual colors without the brush (fyi: the brush is great).

Creating products inspired by my love of color and desire to help women enjoy and have the ability to play with color on herself as I did on the models I worked with.
