Previewing second-quarter restaurant results, Bernstein said broader industry comps improved in the second quarter, as the gap between the food at home, or FAH, and Food Away from Home, or FAFH,  inflation  narrowed notably. The firm also noted that macro data relevant for the restaurant industry, namely job growth and consumer confidence, improved.
Citing the Black Box Index, the firm said second-quarter comps fell 1 percent, a more modest decline than the 1.6-percent drop in the first quarter. Additionally, traffic shrank 3 percent versus a 3.6-percent contraction in the first quarter, while same-store sales did not vary substantially month to month, the firm said.
Among the categories of restaurants, analyst Sara Senatore said only fine dining and upscale casual reported positive same-store sales growth. The analyst termed fast casual and bar & grill as the weakest performers.

The analyst noted that consensus expectations have increased for  McDonald's Corporation  (NYSE: MCD) and  Yum! Brands, Inc.  (NYSE: YUM)'s KFC but have moved lower for the rest of the companies in her coverage. The weakest among them being  Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.  (NYSE: CMG),  Starbucks Corporation  (NASDAQ: SBUX) and  Brinker International, Inc.  (NYSE: EAT), the analyst said.

Sell-Side Comp Expectations


		Chipotle: +9.5 percent.

Domino's Pizza, Inc.  (NYSE: DPZ): +8.7 percent.

		Yum's Pizza Hut U.S. business: (-5 percent).

		Brinker: (-1.8 percent).

		Yum's KFC: +4 percent.


Buy-Side Comp Expectations


McDonald's: +3-3.5 percent Vs consensus of 3.1 percent, helped by strength in value and Signature line.

		Domino's: 7–8 percent versus consensus of 8.7 percent.

Wendys Co  (NASDAQ: WEN): 3 percent versus 3.2 percent consensus estimate.

Bernstein indicated that buy-side estimate was generally ahead of sell-side estimate for Yum's KFC. The firm also said buy side expects a miss on Taco Bell, but Taco Bell's comp is still very healthy and aggregate comps of Yum would likely beat estimates.

Bears Target Chipotle, Starbucks And Brinker
While noting that the credit card breach  Chipotle  disclosed in April is dragging comps, Bernstein sees comps currently running at 7–9 percent range compared to the 9.5-percent consensus estimate. The firm indicated that momentum at Starbucks waned over the quarter, with some bearish expectations pitching comps at 3 percent versus the consensus estimate of 5.3 percent.
TD Ameritrade Director Of International Trading Victor Jones added that the stock is extremely succeptable to headline risk at the moment.
"Right now the market is just very aware of everything that goes on with the company. It's sort of like, you fool the consumer once, they were willing to forgive them. You do something twice and it becomes very difficult for the consumer to forgive," he said. "Whether or not two strikes within a year and a half is enough to do a lot of damage to the consumer, time will tell, but they've got a lot of PR and customer trust issues."
Bernstein also noted that investors are now increasingly comfortable with a negative comp for Brinker.
"As commodity inflation reemerges and labor pressures persist, earnings will be primarily a function of top line growth — though some margin improvement opportunities exist for individual concepts," Bernstein said.
"On balance we believe modest inflation is a net benefit to restaurants as it should support improving industry demand trends as the FAH-FAFH gap narrows."
The firm expects modest inflation for diners, quick service restaurants and fast casuals. Additionally, the firm sees modest inflation in poultry, a significantly less deflationary environment for beef and a mixed environment for produce.
On valuation, Bernstein noted that relative valuations are generally below 5-year historical averages, except for quick service restaurants such as Yum Brands, McDonald's and Domino's. Starbucks and Brinker are trading at trough valuation and Chipotle and Wendy's are at less than a standard deviation below average.
"We think companies that can meet or beat top-line expectations will be rewarded," the firm concluded.

Earnings Schedule


		Domino's: July 25, before the market open.

		McDonald's: July 25, before the market open.

		Chipotle: July 25, after the market close.

		Starbucks: July 25, after the market close.

		Yum Brands: August 2, before the market open.

		Wendy's: August 9, before the market open.

		Brinker: August 10, before the market open.

Chipotle - A Risk/Reward Discussion Based On Relative Valuation - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Chipotle - A Risk/Reward Discussion Based On Relative ValuationJul.20.17 | About: Chipotle Mexican (CMG) Kenra Investors Value, long-term horizon, research analyst, contrarianMarketplaceConsumer AlphaSummaryShares of Chipotle Mexican Grill have fallen around 25% in the last two months.I try to assess the potential downside and upside based on conservative assumptions, using relative valuation.Unless a catalyst triggers a very negative scenario, risk/reward seems skewed in a favorable way.

Image Source: Yahoo A Conservative Scenario And The Implied Downside Risk Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) have performed very badly recently, losing around 25% just in the last two months. Despite the sharp decline, it seems that investors and analysts are not so sure this is a compelling entry point. Several investment banks continued to share skepticism about the prospects of an investment in CMG at these levels. Oppenheimer, for example, has recently written in a report: Risk/reward remains unfavorable, in our view, as Street estimates appear unachievable. Stock trades at 38x our ’18E EPS (and 30x '19E), an unsustainable valuation as comps slow from 1Q's peak, in our view. We need strong visibility for earnings upside or conviction in sustainability of above-mid-single-digit comps to justify the current stock price—neither of which appears likely to us. Oppenheimer’s doubts, shared by other analysts, revolves around the expectations of a decline in comps growth that makes the current valuation multiples look excessive. Oppenheimer expects comps of +9.5% in Q2 but forecasts a normalization to a low-to-mid single digit growth by 4Q 2017. Based on this expected performance, analysts argue that the current P/E multiples make the stock look expensive, although in Oppenheimer's case, their estimates are well below the street average. If we look at Wall Street estimates (per FactSet), CMG is currently trading at 31x 2018E EPS of $12.1 and at 24.5x 2019E EPS of $15.3. Considering that these multiples are not excessive for a company CMG’s growth potential, the bear case clearly assumes that analyst estimates are too optimistic.
 Oppenheimer’s statement that the stock looks expensive at the current forward multiples (despite their lower EPS forecast) implies there is some downside from the current levels, which I have tried to quantify through the stock’s relative valuation compared to its peers. Oppenheimer expects the company’s growth rate to decline, with comps growth expected to fall to low-mid single digits by 2H 2017. These expectations are not worse than the expectations for other restaurant stocks such as Starbucks (SBUX), McDonald’s (MCD) and Yum! Brands (YUM). Actually, CMG is showing better comps thanks to its recovery after recent issues, and even mid-single digit comps growth would be better than the average restaurant comps growth. McDonald’s is delivering low single digit comps growth, Starbucks has recently shown comps growth at a 3% rate, and Yum! Brands delivered a 2% comps growth last quarter. These numbers are all definitely lower than CMG’s recent comps, and also lower than the company’s expectations of high single digits growth for the full year (consistent with Oppenheimer’s forecast of a 9.5% growth). Even when we factor in a significant deceleration in comps growth, given that the current growth rate is an anomaly, it’s difficult to expect CMG’s comps to fall below the peers' levels, considering that there is still some “lost business” to recover. Moreover, there is the question of margins to consider. Chipotle hasn’t recovered yet from the headwinds that affected its business a couple of years ago after the E. coli crisis. This is has led to low margins compared to the company’s own history and compared to other restaurant chains. CMG’s TTM operating margin is just 3.7%, against 17% in 2015. With the company still in the middle of a process of recovery, it’s not credible to forecast comps and margins to grow at a slower rate compared to CMG’s peers. This has an important implication. The potential downside based on the different P/E multiple can only be unlocked if the company delivers very negative results, well below analyst estimates and even below conservative estimates from analysts at Oppenheimer.
 In the table below, you can see the forward P/E multiples for CMG (based on Oppenheimer’s estimates) and its peers (based on analyst estimates, per Factset). 

 Source: Author's elaboration, Oppenheimer estimates, Factset estimates The potential downside based on relative valuation is 25%-33%, which would be unlocked only if there is were strong reason to believe the company’s trend of recovery will stop, leaving the current margin gap still open. With comparable restaurant sales growing 17% and expected to grow high single digits, and margins recovering fast, there should be some negative catalyst to reverse the positive trend in order to make the downside scenario plausible, or to make the stock fall even below that levels. Considering the recent performance and the expectations of a further recovery, the 25%-33% downside I calculated based on conservative assumptions looks difficult to unlock. Potential Upside The success of an investment in CMG depends on whether (and how quickly) the company is able to recover the lost marginality. By comparing CMG’s valuation multiples to those of its peers, we can get an idea of the downside risk in the event that the company doesn’t manage to recover the lost marginality. But we can also get an idea of the potential upside if the company manages to fix its current issues. In order to do that, I will focus on a different category of valuation multiples – EV/evenue in particular. We want to calculate the upside potential in the positive scenario where the company recovers the lost marginality, so we have to look at valuation multiples that factor in the different marginality. EV/revenue is my favorite metric for this purpose. 

CMG EV to Revenues (NYSE:TTM) data by YCharts
 By comparing CMG to the same peers we used for the downside scenario, we can see the huge valuation gap in the current prices. If CMG continues to manage its recovery process successfully, this gap is destined to close, implying roughly 127% upside, based on the peers’ average EV/revenue multiple of 5.57. Conclusion Considering the good performance in the last few quarters, I think the company is on the right track to slowly close the margin gap. The downside risk doesn’t look very high, because a scenario where the company doesn’t manage to grow margins and comps faster than peers is not credible, considering the huge room for recovery and the recent positive results. On the other side, the current valuation gap based on EV/revenue shows significant potential upside, if the company continues to improve margins, with a 127% potential upside in the event that CMG reaches its peers’ margins. I am considering buying CMG with a 2-3 year investment horizon, but I want to get more clarity on the recent food-safety fears following the temporary closure of a restaurant in Virginia due to the suspects of a norovirus contagion. As some food-safety experts explained, many restaurants can encounter this kind of food-safety problems, and sometimes as a result of a transmission from customers, rather than as a consequence of problems in the food or because of sanitary violations. Nonetheless, the focus on Chipotle has been much higher since the E. coli scandal, so we may expect every issue of this kind to be amplified by media. This can lead to lower sales and jeopardize the bullish case. I am going to wait for a few days to understand whether the recent concerns are a flash in the pan or if they constitute a longer-term issue. Thanks for taking the time to read the article.

Pizza Hut to hire 3,000 new delivery drivers every month for the rest of the year


 Pizza Hut said Tuesday that it will hire around 14,000 delivery drivers by the end of 2017. The company is adding a new technology system to improve the reliability and accuracy of its deliveries. The hiring spree comes just a few months after Yum announced plans to invest $130 million in the struggling pizza chain to upgrade equipment, improve restaurant technology and boost advertising spending through 2018.

Pizza Hut is bolstering its fleet.
The Yum Brands chain announced Tuesday that it will hire around 14,000 delivery drivers by the end of 2017, or about 3,000 a month.
In addition, the company is adding a new technology system to improve the reliability and accuracy of its deliveries. The company said the Delivery Network Algorithm will better predict how long a delivery will take based on the weather, local construction and traffic jams, among other things.

Pizza Hut hopes that the additional labor and the new technology will better serve its customers and lead to more orders. Ramping up its digital presence could also help Pizza Hut better compete with rival Domino's, which is a leader in the pizza space.
The hiring spree comes just a few months after Yum announced plans to invest $130 million in the struggling pizza chain to upgrade equipment, improve restaurant technology and boost advertising spending through 2018.
"We are serious about this, and this focus and commitment to the best experience will hopefully help some customers re-assess the brand if they haven't tried us in a while or haven't had us deliver a pizza before," Nicolas Burquier, chief operating officer at Pizza Hut, said in a statement. "This is about accuracy and consistency, giving our customers a trusted experience."
In May, CEO Greg Creed equated the Pizza Hut investment to the $180 million that Yum put into KFC in 2015. The chicken chain has since seen 11 quarters of same-store sales growth, he said.
Last quarter, Pizza Hut saw global same-store sales fall 3 percent, while its partner brands Taco Bell and KFC saw stronger growth. Taco Bell's same-store sales were up 8 percent, and KFC's rose 2 percent.
In the U.S. alone, Pizza Hut same-store sales were down 7 percent. In previous quarters, the chain has lagged behind as well. Analysts have blamed menu fatigue in the past for these soft sales.
Of course, the pizza chain isn't the only restaurant seeking drivers.
Delivery has become a major priority for restaurants in the last year. If chains aren't using third-party services like Uber, DoorDash or Postmates, among others, they are beginning to create their own fleet of drivers.
Panera Bread said in April that it would hire 10,000 new employees by the end of the year to assist with its in-house delivery initiative. The company said that 75 percent of the new hires would be delivery drivers, while the remaining 25 percent would be in-cafe jobs.
While McDonald's is skipping the need to recruit drivers by partnering with Uber, delivery still requires more people to make the food and monitor the orders. The company is expected to hire 250,000 employees this summer, although it is unclear how many of those hires will be involved with delivery initiatives. 
"Our drivers are vitally important to our business, and we want to be the employer of choice for anyone looking to drive," Artie Starrs, president of Pizza Hut, U.S., said in a statement. "Our plan is to keep drivers busy, efficient, and on the road in an effort to best serve our customers. We are only scratching the surface in the territory of services and flexibility that we can offer to those looking to drive."

How Taco Bell Has Succeeded In The 'Dying' Fast Food Industry - Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»How Taco Bell Has Succeeded In The 'Dying' Fast Food IndustryJul.19.17 | About: Yum! Brands, (YUM) Michael Giolli Growth, long/short equity, tech, banksSummaryAbandoned unprofitable Baby Boomer Demographic.Embraced image as low-cost fast food with head-scratching culinary innovations.Started serving breakfast to cater to second half of millennial population.Yum! Brand (YUM) subsidiary Taco Bell has been enjoying some healthy gains so far in 2017 – pushing the brand’s stock price near record highs even while sub brands such as Pizza Hut continue to struggle. Taco Bell’s Q1 earnings were nearly 8 percent higher than Q1 in 2016 – a full five percentage points greater than analyst estimates. After the release of the Q1 earnings, shares rose over 2% to sit near a (then) yearly high of $67.91. As of today, shares are sitting 8% higher than after the Q1 earnings call at $73.86. What’s causing this spike in sales and investor confidence? What is causing Taco Bell to drive Yum! Brand’s growth despite other franchises struggling? The answer lies in Taco Bell’s two-pronged approach to lure millennial diners – an approach that other brands would be wise to mimic. An analysis of YUM! Brands’ 2016 income statement shows an increase in gross profit from 2015 of about $10 million. The firm’s net income is up as well by about $40 million. This increase in profit is, no doubt, due to the success of Taco Bell’s engagement with millennial consumers. While stores such as Pizza Hut have struggled mightily, causing the firm’s long-term-debt to triple as investments in Pizza Hut overseas have been failing (2% decline in year-over-year sales) – Taco Bell is continuing to pick up the slack for the firm as a whole. The balance sheet tells a similar story as the income statement. The balance sheet shows a significant increase in the firm’s year-over-year liquid cash, nearly doubling from 2015 to 2016. This is perhaps in response to a significant increase in its long term debt, which tripled from about 3 billion to 9 billion. The increased cash on hand is due to a desire for liquidity should it be needed to satisfy its debt obligations. Looking at the 2016 return on tangible common equity and return to stockholders is disappointing, however – as both of those numbers indicated significantly negative returns. What does this mean for YUM! Brand as a whole?
 While the stock price continues to go up due to investor confidence in sub-brands such as Taco Bell – the firm’s overall financials show a decreasing about of assets and an increasing amount of debt – showing a time of transition for the company as it evaluates its unsuccessful strategies at franchise like Pizza Hut. Looking at quarterly statements on the balance sheet shows an average of 10% decline in assets over the last 4 quarters with a nearly proportional increase in debt. Because of this time of transition for YUM, it is hard to recommend a long-term purchase. However, the stock is up nearly 8% in the past 3 months – reflecting the possibility for a short-term gain. Yum Brands needs to have other subsidiaries such as Pizza Hut take a lesson from Taco Bell in order to increase its assets and decrease its debts – in order to make itself a long-term growth option. How can Pizza Hut emulate Taco Bell? While Taco Bell is known as a fast-food innovator - Pizza Hut has attempted, unsuccessfully, to copy their innovative model. By adding things such as hotdog and bacon-stuffed crusts, Pizza Hut has tried to lure in young consumers with new and interesting flavor profiles. This effort has fallen flat. Pizza Hut has failed to realize that millennials have different demands for pizza than they do for traditional fast food. They want something simple, consistent, and easy to consume in groups. Pizza Hut’s new menu has thousands of different flavor combinations that create confusion for customers – and these different flavor combinations make it difficult for millennials to come to a consensus on what to order. Pizza, as opposed to tacos, is usually eaten in groups. Their online ordering process and menu is clunky and counter-intuitive, a deal breaker for technology minded millennials that want a fast and simple ordering process. This confusion, amongst millennials and baby boomers alike, has caused Pizza hut to lose market share in the pizza industry from 25% in 1995 to 14.3% in 2016. Brands like Papa Johns (PZZA) have begun to offer a simpler menu, cheaper prices, and discounts that tie-in with sports team scores in order to attract millennials. Promotions that engage social trends and attract price-conscious consumers are what is drawing millennials in to a fast-food industry that is slowly dying, according to analysts.
 Industry analysts have been lamenting that fact that millennials are “killing” fast food restaurants. They claim that instead of fast food, millennials want healthier options that they can get quickly and conveniently. Panera Bread (PNRA) and Chipotle (CMG) are great examples of brands that have capitalized on these changing tastes and preferences – enjoying great success. Baby Boomers and Gen X’ers, on the other hand, have often been criticized for liking food that is quick, convenient, and “familiar”. These customers are why places such as McDonalds (MCD), Burger King (BKW), and Wendy’s (WEN) have thrived. With the millennials’ shift towards fast-casual restaurants that provide clean, heathy food at a reasonable pace – why is Taco Bell still succeeding while brands like Pizza Hut are struggling? Surely Taco Bell and Pizza Hut represent everything millennials hate. Cheap food, mass-produced, “gross” presentation, and ground beef that is jokingly referred to as “mystery meat” . Taco Bell’s success lies in its innovations. Taco Bell is the company that introduced the Doritos Locos taco – a taco with a shell made from Dorito-crusted chips. They introduced the quesarito (A combined quesadilla and burrito). Why is a company that advertises a 1,000+ calorie 5-layer steak burrito experiencing nearly double-digit sale increases? The answer, as is the case with most brands, lies in the marketing. Taco Bell unapologetically advertises itself as unhealthy late-night drunk food. Its commercials exclusively feature millennials. They do not place Baby Boomer or child actors into their commercials in an effort to lure in those demographics. They know their target market, and they go after them. Taco Bell’s target market is 18-25 year old males with a technology bend who want quick and cheap meals that often times feature culinary innovations.  This target market assumption is solidified by the constant sweepstakes giveaways: not of things like vacations and cash, but of technology items like game consoles. Taco Bell doesn’t pretend to be a 5-star dining establishment, and you won’t see claims about their ground beef being from “grass-fed” or “organic” farms. Taco Bell knows what it is, and it embraces it. It’s a cheap alternative after a night of drinking, or it’s a quick stop for a flavor combination you’re not able to get anywhere else on the planet. Pizza Hut still includes adults in their advertisements, advertising their food as a family-friendly option. With flavor combinations such as buffalo chicken with a pretzel stuffed crust – these options are not meant for families – and parents are repulsed by this high-calorie menu option.
 Taco Bell, on the other hand focuses on its target market that they know is interested in their unique combinations. They are on the cutting edge of food technology, constantly introducing new innovations that pique the minds of millennials looking to stay “fashionable” in the food industry – as well as indulge in an affordable late-night treat. This primary strategy is why Taco Bell is able to carve a niche for itself amongst millennials and insulate itself from the carnage that is happening to other dining chains across the country.  Conclusion Taco Bell has not forgotten that millennials are a varied generation these days made up of professionals and young kids. It has suitably spread the breadth of its offerings to cater to this entire age range – from gross food combinations only enjoyed by the young to surprisingly palatable breakfast items available quickly and cheaply to working professionals. Combine this targeted focus with a willful decision to abandon product lines that cater to an unprofitable Baby Boomer market and Taco Bell may continue carrying the weight of Yum! Brand’s $1.42 billion empire until its sibling Pizza Hut can get in line. Until Pizza Hut is able to shift its focus and account for more than 20% of Yum! Brand’s overall profits - the income statement and balance sheet will continue to indicate that the stock is not poised for a healthy long-run opportunity. Do not be fooled by the rising stock price that is being fueled purely by the perception of the successful Taco Bell. Higher liabilities and debt combined with decreasing assets is a worrisome sign. Increased cash liquidity could also be indicating a fear of future ability to meet debt obligations. Because of this, Yum! is a quick buy and sell at most.

		Pizza Hut Hiring 14,000 Drivers by Year’s End	

Jul 18, 2017, 12:50 pm EDT  |  By Karl Utermohlen, InvestorPlace Writer



 
 

Pizza Hut (NYSE:YUM) announced Tuesday that it will be adding 14,000 drivers by the end of the year.
Yum! Brands announced back in May that it would seek to revitalize the pizza chain by injecting $130 million into the brand following a year-over-year quarterly earnings decline (compared to surges in this category for Taco Bell and KFC, also owned by Yum!).
One way in which the company is ensuring that Pizza Hut gets back on top is with speedier service as there have been complaints of customers’ pizza arriving cold or taking too long. Adding 14,000 drivers to its fold will help relieve some of these concerns.
The jobs will vary from being part time to full time, but they will all be permanent positions. Pizza Hut will make about 3,000 additions to its workforce every month through the rest of the year.
“As on-demand delivery continues to be a priority for our customers, we are more committed than ever to providing the best pizza delivery experience possible,” spokesman Doug Terfehr said.
Yum! Brands said back in January that it would be adding 11,000 cooks.
The company also said on Tuesday that it would be implementing a more precise algorithm to predict how much time it will take your food to go from being prepared to arriving in your doorstep.
YUM stock was trading flat Tuesday.

            COMMENTEMAILMORESpecial delivery: Pizza Hut says it will add about 14,000 new drivers by the end of 2017 in an effort to speed deliveries to customers.The hiring, combined with a new delivery system and enhanced online mapping, will enable Pizza Hut to "meet the needs of today's connected environment," the Plano, Texas-based company said Tuesday."This focus and commitment to the best experience will hopefully help some customers re-assess the brand if they haven't tried us in a while or haven't had us deliver a pizza before," Nicolas Burquier, Pizza Hut's chief operating officer said in a statement issued with the announcement. "We think these changes enable our team members even more to deliver a hot, delicious Pizza Hut pizza when the customer expects it."The changes come as Pizza Hut vies with rival Domino's Pizza (DPZ) for hot-and-cheesy supremacy. Pizza Hut operates more than 16,400 restaurants in more than 100 countries. Domino's has more than 14,000 locations in over 85 markets.Pizza Hut made shoes that will order pizzaHowever, Pizza Hut will lose market share to competitors and by 2018 the company will lose its dominant position to Domino's, Mark Kalinowski, a restaurant analyst for Nomura, predicted in a research note that was reported by CNBC and other media outlets in May.Taco Bell's Naked Chicken Chalupa boosts Yum Brands profitFacing increased competition, Yum Brands (YUM), Pizza Hut's corporate parent, announced in May it would invest approximately $130 million between 2017 and 2018 to quicken upgrades of restaurant technology, improve digital and e-commerce capability and boost advertising.Pizza Hut's U.S. franchisees agreed with the plan, said Yum Brands President and Chief Financial Officer David Gibbs told Wall Street analysts.The hiring effort will add an estimated 3,000 new Pizza Hut drivers per month through the end of the year. Pizza Hut said the hiring represents twice the number of drivers the company normally would add monthly.Coming amid a Trump administration push for new U.S. jobs, Pizza Hut's hiring is expected to increase its driver headcount to more than 50,000 by the end of the year, up from roughly 35,000 or so from now, the company said."We want to be the employer of choice for anyone looking to drive," said Artie Starrs, Pizza Hut's president for the U.S.The company's plans also feature a new "Delivery Network Algorithm," described as a technology system capable of predicting how long a delivery would take and factor in weather, construction, traffic and other variables to ensure safe and accurate deliveries.The system will be available in all 6,300 Pizza Hut U.S. locations immediately, the company said. Pizza Hut also said it has improved its online mapping and location services to improve accuracy in locating customers and identify the most convenient restaurant locations for faster delivery and carry-out options.Follow USA TODAY reporter Kevin McCoy on Twitter: @kmccoynyc

Pizza Hut Will Hire 14,000 Drivers to Prove It Can Deliver Pizza

                Company taking action to refresh its image with customers
            



                Chain has lost ground to Domino’s in delivery technology
            



Pizza Hut will hire 14,000 drivers this year as the restaurant chain plays catch-up with rivals in delivery, an area that’s fueled much of the industry’s growth in recent years.The company will add about 3,000 drivers a month through the end of this year, Pizza Hut said in a statement Tuesday. The pizza chain also is using a new algorithm to better predict delivery times, as well as relying on Google Maps to improve its accuracy.Pizza Hut, a Yum! Brands Inc.-owned chain that built its reputation on sit-down pizza service, is adapting to an industry where delivery rules. Domino’s Pizza Inc. and Papa John’s International Inc. have spent years making it easier to order -- via mobile apps and loyalty programs -- and have the food dispatched quickly to customers’ front doors.








The push to add drivers is part of a broader campaign to remind customers that they can get a Pizza Hut pie delivered.“This focus and commitment to the best delivery experience will hopefully help some customers reassess the brand if they haven’t tried us in a while or haven’t had us deliver a pizza before,” said Chief Operating Officer Nicolas Burquier. “This is about accuracy and consistency.”Pizza Hut struggled to compete with other major U.S., chains, including Domino’s, whose technology and mobile app have helped lock in customers. In the most recently reported quarter, Pizza Hut posted a 3 percent same-store sales decline. Domino’s, meanwhile, reported a 10 percent domestic gain.The new hiring push includes both full and part-time positions, Pizza Hut said. The company described the move as one of its largest efforts ever to attract delivery employees.

After Big Gains, Is This Chinese Fast-Food Company a Buy?
KFC and Pizza Hut, China's largest food chains, could have more room to run.











                Nicholas Rossolillo
            

                (nrossolillo)



            
            Jul 13, 2017 at 8:05PM
            
            





Since getting spun off from Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) in late 2016, Yum China (NYSE:YUMC) stock has returned over 30%. Though it is already China's biggest restaurant group, the company looks like it has more room to run.
The Yum China advantage
After years of struggling to grow its Chinese business, Yum! Brands decided to spin it off into a separate entity. Yum China, which owns sole rights to KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell in the world's most populous country, has been doing much better all on its own thus far.

Data by YCharts.
The argument for the spinoff was that allowing the business the freedom to operate all on its own would unlock value for shareholders. Management now has the latitude to make decisions tailored specifically to the Chinese market -- things like customizing the menu to local tastes, better marketing to Chinese consumers, and flexible decision-making without the extra oversight from Yum! Brands' sprawling global enterprise.
So far, so good. In the first two quarters of 2017, Yum China's operating profit has increased 34% through tighter control over costs, and comparable-restaurant sales were up 3% during the last quarter.
The decision to separate Yum China hasn't gone unnoticed by competitors. While not a full spinoff like Yum! Brands, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) sold 80% of its Chinese business to franchisees in a similar bid to promote growth and improve decision-making in the big Chinese market.
Going where the people are
China's middle class is quickly approaching 50% of the population, and the race to capture that market share is heating up. KFC and Pizza Hut are the current leaders, with over 7,600 locations (compared to McDonald's 2,600-plus). The burger chain plans on building another 1,000 to play catch-up. How does such a big enterprise like Yum China grow and stave off the competition?

Image source: Yum China.

Expanding delivery services has been identified by management as the key. While the Chinese consumer's insatiable appetite for fast food parallels the American consumer's, the way that food is consumed is a little different. Over half of China's population lives in densely populated cities and more are moving in by the millions every year. Because of tight living quarters, not everyone has their own car. So while the average American might grab a quick meal at the drive-thru, getting food delivered is far more important in China.
In response, Yum China announced back in May the purchase of a controlling interest in Daojia, a leader in online delivery of high-end food orders. As of the last quarter, 13% of sales were delivery and 4,900 locations offered delivery services. Management sees both numbers increasing in the years to come.





To buy or not to buy
Though second-quarter results were in line with expectations, Wall Street was apparently hoping for more, and the stock dropped over 10%. However, for the balance of 2017, management sees operating profits continuing to rise by double digits and total new restaurants totaling as many as 600.
With even more of China's population moving to the city and the middle class getting its hands on more discretionary money, fast food has more runway ahead of it. Yum China has lots of future potential and management's outlook remains positive. Investors who believe the Chinese consumer will eat more fast food in the years ahead should consider Yum China.

Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel  , on 7/12/17, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (Symbol: CBRL), Foot Locker, Inc. (Symbol: FL), and Yum! Brands Inc (Symbol: YUM) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. will pay its quarterly dividend of $1.20 on 8/4/17, Foot Locker, Inc. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.31 on 7/28/17, and Yum! Brands Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.30 on 8/4/17. As a percentage of CBRL's recent stock price of $165.48, this dividend works out to approximately 0.73%, so look for shares of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. to trade 0.73% lower - all else being equal - when CBRL shares open for trading on 7/12/17. Similarly, investors should look for FL to open 0.63% lower in price and for YUM to open 0.41% lower, all else being equal.    Below are dividend history charts for CBRL, FL, and YUM, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared.   Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (Symbol: CBRL)  :       Foot Locker, Inc. (Symbol: FL)  :         Yum! Brands Inc (Symbol: YUM)  :          In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 2.90% for Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc., 2.51% for Foot Locker, Inc., and 1.63% for Yum! Brands Inc.    In Monday trading, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. shares are currently up about 0.1%, Foot Locker, Inc. shares are off about 1.3%, and Yum! Brands Inc shares are down about 0.1% on the day.

A Fortune 500 corporation, Yum! operates the brands Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut, and WingStreet worldwide, except in China, where the brands are operated by a separate company, Yum China. Prior to 2011, Yum! owned Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants.
Based in Louisville, Kentucky, it is one of the world's largest fast food restaurant companies in terms of system units—with 43,617 restaurants (including 2,859 that are company-owned and 40,758 that are franchised) around the world in over 135 countries and territories.[3]

History[edit]
Tricon Global Restaurants[edit]
Yum! was created on May 30, 1997, as Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc. from PepsiCo's fast food division as the parent corporation of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurant companies.[4][5] Tricon Global was spun out in late 1997. Tricon selected Louisville as its headquarters moving near the KFC Restaurant Support Center from the Pepsi HQ in Purchase, New York, by early 1998.[5]
In 2000, Tricon Global agreed to test multi-branded locations with Yorkshire Global Restaurants. By March 2002, the Tricon-Yorkshire multibranding test consisted of 83 KFC/A&Ws, six KFC/Long John Silver's and three Taco Bell/Long John Silver's and was considered successful by the companies.[6]
In 2001, KFC started test restaurants in Austin, Texas, called "Wing Works", which is a chicken wing line sold with one of a few flavored sauces. Also, KFC hired a consultant to develop a breakfast menu.[7]
Yum! Brands[edit]
In March 2002, Tricon announced the acquisition of Lexington, Kentucky-based Yorkshire Global Restaurants, owner of the Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants[8] chains and its intention to change the company's name to Yum! Brands, Inc. On May 16, 2002, the name change became effective after a vote during the company's annual shareholders meeting, and on June 17, 2002, Yum! executed a two-for-one stock split. Shortly afterwards, due to Yum!'s lifetime contract with Pepsi, Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants (both of which previously served Coca-Cola products) began gradually switching to Pepsi products, with A&W Restaurants retaining A&W Root Beer from a separate deal with Dr Pepper/Seven Up (now Dr Pepper Snapple Group).
In 2002, Yum! began testing co-branding locations pairing Pizza Hut with Pasta Bravo, Back Yard Burgers and A&W.[9] The Pasta Bravo concept was acquired in 2003 from Pasta Bravo, Inc. of Aliso Viejo, California for $5 million to pair with Pizza Hut.[10]
In 2003, Yum! launched WingStreet as a hybrid combo unit with an existing Pizza Hut franchise.[11] In 2007 and 2008, a thousand WingStreet stores a year were opened. On October 19, 2009, Company president Scott Bergren publicize WingStreet's national launch.[11]
An East Dawning test cafeteria-style restaurant was opened in Shanghai in 2004. After initially failing, Yum! Brands chose the KFC business model (KFC is the most successful Western chain in China) and found greater success.[12] As of September 30, 2007, eight East Dawning restaurants were in operation.[13]
International focus[edit]




A single Yum! restaurant facility co-branded as Taco Bell and KFC in San Francisco, California






Another cobranded KFC and Taco Bell in Oscoda, Michigan


In January 2011, Yum! announced its intentions to divest itself of its Long John Silver's and A&W brands to focus on its core brands of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. For the decade leading up to the company's announcement, major growth had relied on international expansion. With little presence outside North America, the two chains no longer fit in the company's long-term growth plans.[14] The foreign expansion—particularly that of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut—was cited in the firm's January 18, 2011, announcement of its intention to sell the A&W and Long John Silver's chains. Both of those chains also suffered from poor sales, and had fewer locations compared to the other chains in the Yum! Brands portfolio. In September 2011, Yum! announced they had found buyers for the A&W and LJS chains. A Great American Brand will buy A&W, and LJS will be acquired by LJS Partners LLC.[8]
In May 2011, Yum! agreed to purchase Chinese hot pot chain Little Sheep for HK$4.56 billion.[15] The deal spent more than 4 months in anti-trust review by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, to determine whether or not the transaction would result in a monopolistic positioning of Yum! in the country's restaurant industry. The Ministry approved the deal in November 2011, according to Little Sheep representatives.[16]
In 2012, a KFC opened in Ramallah and became the first American fast food restaurant to operate in the West Bank; a Pizza Hut is also planned.[17]
In 2013, a few KFC locations in China supplied chicken found to contain "excess levels of chemical residue". Yum! has lost 6% of sales from publicity in China as of January 25.[18]
The company opened its first restaurant in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, in May 2013. For Mongolia, KFC is the first western fast food to open its doors in the country. The company is planning to open 15 more restaurants in Ulaanbaatar in the next 5 years, including the country's first drive-thru service.[19] Yum! Brands has also opened Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurants in newer Target stores.
Yum! Brands opened its 40,000th store in Calangute, Goa, India in October 2013.[20]
In 2013, its KFC subsidiary opened a fast casual version, KFC eleven, test location in Louisville on Bardstown Road.[21] In the third quarter of 2013, Yum! Brands had to book an impairment of the goodwill resulting from the takeover of Little Sheep in 2011 in the amount of $222 million, which reduced profits for 2013.[22]
In 2014, Yum! launched a number of additional restaurant test concepts, Super Chix, U.S. Taco Co. and Banh Shop.[23] Yum! opened Super Chix in Central Arlington, Texas that is similar in format to Chick-fil-A on April 9, 2014.[24] In the summer of 2014, Yum!'s Taco Bell subsidiary launched its U.S. Taco Co and Urban Tap Room fast-casual taco concept restaurant in Huntington Beach, California, to take on fast casual restaurants like Chipotle and Panera.[25]
In the first quarter of 2015, Third Point Management and Corvex Management separately acquired an unspecified stake in the company.[26] The sole KFC Eleven was closed in April 2015.[21] A second Chix unit opened in May 2015 with additional menu items. Super Chix was sold to founder Nick Ouimet and an investment group in August 2015.[23]
In 2017, Yum! announced plans to open 10 Pizza Hut restaurants in Ethiopia, after signing a franchise with the country's Belayab Foods and Franchise PLC.[27]

History[edit]
Tricon Global Restaurants[edit]
Yum! was created on May 30, 1997, as Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc. from PepsiCo's fast food division as the parent corporation of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurant companies.[4][5] Tricon Global was spun out in late 1997. Tricon selected Louisville as its headquarters moving near the KFC Restaurant Support Center from the Pepsi HQ in Purchase, New York, by early 1998.[5]
In 2000, Tricon Global agreed to test multi-branded locations with Yorkshire Global Restaurants. By March 2002, the Tricon-Yorkshire multibranding test consisted of 83 KFC/A&Ws, six KFC/Long John Silver's and three Taco Bell/Long John Silver's and was considered successful by the companies.[6]
In 2001, KFC started test restaurants in Austin, Texas, called "Wing Works", which is a chicken wing line sold with one of a few flavored sauces. Also, KFC hired a consultant to develop a breakfast menu.[7]
Yum! Brands[edit]
In March 2002, Tricon announced the acquisition of Lexington, Kentucky-based Yorkshire Global Restaurants, owner of the Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants[8] chains and its intention to change the company's name to Yum! Brands, Inc. On May 16, 2002, the name change became effective after a vote during the company's annual shareholders meeting, and on June 17, 2002, Yum! executed a two-for-one stock split. Shortly afterwards, due to Yum!'s lifetime contract with Pepsi, Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants (both of which previously served Coca-Cola products) began gradually switching to Pepsi products, with A&W Restaurants retaining A&W Root Beer from a separate deal with Dr Pepper/Seven Up (now Dr Pepper Snapple Group).
In 2002, Yum! began testing co-branding locations pairing Pizza Hut with Pasta Bravo, Back Yard Burgers and A&W.[9] The Pasta Bravo concept was acquired in 2003 from Pasta Bravo, Inc. of Aliso Viejo, California for $5 million to pair with Pizza Hut.[10]
In 2003, Yum! launched WingStreet as a hybrid combo unit with an existing Pizza Hut franchise.[11] In 2007 and 2008, a thousand WingStreet stores a year were opened. On October 19, 2009, Company president Scott Bergren publicize WingStreet's national launch.[11]
An East Dawning test cafeteria-style restaurant was opened in Shanghai in 2004. After initially failing, Yum! Brands chose the KFC business model (KFC is the most successful Western chain in China) and found greater success.[12] As of September 30, 2007, eight East Dawning restaurants were in operation.[13]
International focus[edit]




A single Yum! restaurant facility co-branded as Taco Bell and KFC in San Francisco, California






Another cobranded KFC and Taco Bell in Oscoda, Michigan


In January 2011, Yum! announced its intentions to divest itself of its Long John Silver's and A&W brands to focus on its core brands of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. For the decade leading up to the company's announcement, major growth had relied on international expansion. With little presence outside North America, the two chains no longer fit in the company's long-term growth plans.[14] The foreign expansion—particularly that of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut—was cited in the firm's January 18, 2011, announcement of its intention to sell the A&W and Long John Silver's chains. Both of those chains also suffered from poor sales, and had fewer locations compared to the other chains in the Yum! Brands portfolio. In September 2011, Yum! announced they had found buyers for the A&W and LJS chains. A Great American Brand will buy A&W, and LJS will be acquired by LJS Partners LLC.[8]
In May 2011, Yum! agreed to purchase Chinese hot pot chain Little Sheep for HK$4.56 billion.[15] The deal spent more than 4 months in anti-trust review by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, to determine whether or not the transaction would result in a monopolistic positioning of Yum! in the country's restaurant industry. The Ministry approved the deal in November 2011, according to Little Sheep representatives.[16]
In 2012, a KFC opened in Ramallah and became the first American fast food restaurant to operate in the West Bank; a Pizza Hut is also planned.[17]
In 2013, a few KFC locations in China supplied chicken found to contain "excess levels of chemical residue". Yum! has lost 6% of sales from publicity in China as of January 25.[18]
The company opened its first restaurant in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, in May 2013. For Mongolia, KFC is the first western fast food to open its doors in the country. The company is planning to open 15 more restaurants in Ulaanbaatar in the next 5 years, including the country's first drive-thru service.[19] Yum! Brands has also opened Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurants in newer Target stores.
Yum! Brands opened its 40,000th store in Calangute, Goa, India in October 2013.[20]
In 2013, its KFC subsidiary opened a fast casual version, KFC eleven, test location in Louisville on Bardstown Road.[21] In the third quarter of 2013, Yum! Brands had to book an impairment of the goodwill resulting from the takeover of Little Sheep in 2011 in the amount of $222 million, which reduced profits for 2013.[22]
In 2014, Yum! launched a number of additional restaurant test concepts, Super Chix, U.S. Taco Co. and Banh Shop.[23] Yum! opened Super Chix in Central Arlington, Texas that is similar in format to Chick-fil-A on April 9, 2014.[24] In the summer of 2014, Yum!'s Taco Bell subsidiary launched its U.S. Taco Co and Urban Tap Room fast-casual taco concept restaurant in Huntington Beach, California, to take on fast casual restaurants like Chipotle and Panera.[25]
In the first quarter of 2015, Third Point Management and Corvex Management separately acquired an unspecified stake in the company.[26] The sole KFC Eleven was closed in April 2015.[21] A second Chix unit opened in May 2015 with additional menu items. Super Chix was sold to founder Nick Ouimet and an investment group in August 2015.[23]
In 2017, Yum! announced plans to open 10 Pizza Hut restaurants in Ethiopia, after signing a franchise with the country's Belayab Foods and Franchise PLC.[27]
Corporate[edit]




The KFC Yum! Center, Louisville's largest arena


The current executive chairman of Yum! Brands is Greg Creed. The previous CEO was David C. Novak.[28] Novak became CEO of predecessor firm Tricon Global on January 1, 2000, and chairman of the board on January 1, 2001.[29] Greg Creed replaced Novak in his role as CEO on January 1, 2015.[30] At the AGM in May 2016, Robert D. Walter became non-executive chairman.
On October 20, 2015, Yum! Brands, Inc., announced that it intended to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies.[31] Yum China was spun off on November 1, 2016.[32]
Since 2006, Yum! Brands has served as the corporate sponsor of the Kentucky Derby.[33]

History[edit]
Tricon Global Restaurants[edit]
Yum! was created on May 30, 1997, as Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc. from PepsiCo's fast food division as the parent corporation of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurant companies.[4][5] Tricon Global was spun out in late 1997. Tricon selected Louisville as its headquarters moving near the KFC Restaurant Support Center from the Pepsi HQ in Purchase, New York, by early 1998.[5]
In 2000, Tricon Global agreed to test multi-branded locations with Yorkshire Global Restaurants. By March 2002, the Tricon-Yorkshire multibranding test consisted of 83 KFC/A&Ws, six KFC/Long John Silver's and three Taco Bell/Long John Silver's and was considered successful by the companies.[6]
In 2001, KFC started test restaurants in Austin, Texas, called "Wing Works", which is a chicken wing line sold with one of a few flavored sauces. Also, KFC hired a consultant to develop a breakfast menu.[7]
Yum! Brands[edit]
In March 2002, Tricon announced the acquisition of Lexington, Kentucky-based Yorkshire Global Restaurants, owner of the Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants[8] chains and its intention to change the company's name to Yum! Brands, Inc. On May 16, 2002, the name change became effective after a vote during the company's annual shareholders meeting, and on June 17, 2002, Yum! executed a two-for-one stock split. Shortly afterwards, due to Yum!'s lifetime contract with Pepsi, Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants (both of which previously served Coca-Cola products) began gradually switching to Pepsi products, with A&W Restaurants retaining A&W Root Beer from a separate deal with Dr Pepper/Seven Up (now Dr Pepper Snapple Group).
In 2002, Yum! began testing co-branding locations pairing Pizza Hut with Pasta Bravo, Back Yard Burgers and A&W.[9] The Pasta Bravo concept was acquired in 2003 from Pasta Bravo, Inc. of Aliso Viejo, California for $5 million to pair with Pizza Hut.[10]
In 2003, Yum! launched WingStreet as a hybrid combo unit with an existing Pizza Hut franchise.[11] In 2007 and 2008, a thousand WingStreet stores a year were opened. On October 19, 2009, Company president Scott Bergren publicize WingStreet's national launch.[11]
An East Dawning test cafeteria-style restaurant was opened in Shanghai in 2004. After initially failing, Yum! Brands chose the KFC business model (KFC is the most successful Western chain in China) and found greater success.[12] As of September 30, 2007, eight East Dawning restaurants were in operation.[13]
International focus[edit]

Another cobranded KFC and Taco Bell in Oscoda, Michigan


In January 2011, Yum! announced its intentions to divest itself of its Long John Silver's and A&W brands to focus on its core brands of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. For the decade leading up to the company's announcement, major growth had relied on international expansion. With little presence outside North America, the two chains no longer fit in the company's long-term growth plans.[14] The foreign expansion—particularly that of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut—was cited in the firm's January 18, 2011, announcement of its intention to sell the A&W and Long John Silver's chains. Both of those chains also suffered from poor sales, and had fewer locations compared to the other chains in the Yum! Brands portfolio. In September 2011, Yum! announced they had found buyers for the A&W and LJS chains. A Great American Brand will buy A&W, and LJS will be acquired by LJS Partners LLC.[8]
In May 2011, Yum! agreed to purchase Chinese hot pot chain Little Sheep for HK$4.56 billion.[15] The deal spent more than 4 months in anti-trust review by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, to determine whether or not the transaction would result in a monopolistic positioning of Yum! in the country's restaurant industry. The Ministry approved the deal in November 2011, according to Little Sheep representatives.[16]
In 2012, a KFC opened in Ramallah and became the first American fast food restaurant to operate in the West Bank; a Pizza Hut is also planned.[17]
In 2013, a few KFC locations in China supplied chicken found to contain "excess levels of chemical residue". Yum! has lost 6% of sales from publicity in China as of January 25.[18]
The company opened its first restaurant in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, in May 2013. For Mongolia, KFC is the first western fast food to open its doors in the country. The company is planning to open 15 more restaurants in Ulaanbaatar in the next 5 years, including the country's first drive-thru service.[19] Yum! Brands has also opened Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurants in newer Target stores.
Yum! Brands opened its 40,000th store in Calangute, Goa, India in October 2013.[20]
In 2013, its KFC subsidiary opened a fast casual version, KFC eleven, test location in Louisville on Bardstown Road.[21] In the third quarter of 2013, Yum! Brands had to book an impairment of the goodwill resulting from the takeover of Little Sheep in 2011 in the amount of $222 million, which reduced profits for 2013.[22]
In 2014, Yum! launched a number of additional restaurant test concepts, Super Chix, U.S. Taco Co. and Banh Shop.[23] Yum! opened Super Chix in Central Arlington, Texas that is similar in format to Chick-fil-A on April 9, 2014.[24] In the summer of 2014, Yum!'s Taco Bell subsidiary launched its U.S. Taco Co and Urban Tap Room fast-casual taco concept restaurant in Huntington Beach, California, to take on fast casual restaurants like Chipotle and Panera.[25]
In the first quarter of 2015, Third Point Management and Corvex Management separately acquired an unspecified stake in the company.[26] The sole KFC Eleven was closed in April 2015.[21] A second Chix unit opened in May 2015 with additional menu items. Super Chix was sold to founder Nick Ouimet and an investment group in August 2015.[23]
In 2017, Yum! announced plans to open 10 Pizza Hut restaurants in Ethiopia, after signing a franchise with the country's Belayab Foods and Franchise PLC.[27]
Corporate[edit]




The KFC Yum! Center, Louisville's largest arena


The current executive chairman of Yum! Brands is Greg Creed. The previous CEO was David C. Novak.[28] Novak became CEO of predecessor firm Tricon Global on January 1, 2000, and chairman of the board on January 1, 2001.[29] Greg Creed replaced Novak in his role as CEO on January 1, 2015.[30] At the AGM in May 2016, Robert D. Walter became non-executive chairman.
On October 20, 2015, Yum! Brands, Inc., announced that it intended to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies.[31] Yum China was spun off on November 1, 2016.[32]
Since 2006, Yum! Brands has served as the corporate sponsor of the Kentucky Derby.[33]

History[edit]
Tricon Global Restaurants[edit]
Yum! was created on May 30, 1997, as Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc. from PepsiCo's fast food division as the parent corporation of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurant companies.[4][5] Tricon Global was spun out in late 1997. Tricon selected Louisville as its headquarters moving near the KFC Restaurant Support Center from the Pepsi HQ in Purchase, New York, by early 1998.[5]
In 2000, Tricon Global agreed to test multi-branded locations with Yorkshire Global Restaurants. By March 2002, the Tricon-Yorkshire multibranding test consisted of 83 KFC/A&Ws, six KFC/Long John Silver's and three Taco Bell/Long John Silver's and was considered successful by the companies.[6]
In 2001, KFC started test restaurants in Austin, Texas, called "Wing Works", which is a chicken wing line sold with one of a few flavored sauces. Also, KFC hired a consultant to develop a breakfast menu.[7]
Yum! Brands[edit]
In March 2002, Tricon announced the acquisition of Lexington, Kentucky-based Yorkshire Global Restaurants, owner of the Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants[8] chains and its intention to change the company's name to Yum! Brands, Inc. On May 16, 2002, the name change became effective after a vote during the company's annual shareholders meeting, and on June 17, 2002, Yum! executed a two-for-one stock split. Shortly afterwards, due to Yum!'s lifetime contract with Pepsi, Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants (both of which previously served Coca-Cola products) began gradually switching to Pepsi products, with A&W Restaurants retaining A&W Root Beer from a separate deal with Dr Pepper/Seven Up (now Dr Pepper Snapple Group).
In 2002, Yum! began testing co-branding locations pairing Pizza Hut with Pasta Bravo, Back Yard Burgers and A&W.[9] The Pasta Bravo concept was acquired in 2003 from Pasta Bravo, Inc. of Aliso Viejo, California for $5 million to pair with Pizza Hut.[10]
In 2003, Yum! launched WingStreet as a hybrid combo unit with an existing Pizza Hut franchise.[11] In 2007 and 2008, a thousand WingStreet stores a year were opened. On October 19, 2009, Company president Scott Bergren publicize WingStreet's national launch.[11]
An East Dawning test cafeteria-style restaurant was opened in Shanghai in 2004. After initially failing, Yum! Brands chose the KFC business model (KFC is the most successful Western chain in China) and found greater success.[12] As of September 30, 2007, eight East Dawning restaurants were in operation.[13]
International focus[edit]




A single Yum! restaurant facility co-branded as Taco Bell and KFC in San Francisco, California






Another cobranded KFC and Taco Bell in Oscoda, Michigan


In January 2011, Yum! announced its intentions to divest itself of its Long John Silver's and A&W brands to focus on its core brands of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. For the decade leading up to the company's announcement, major growth had relied on international expansion. With little presence outside North America, the two chains no longer fit in the company's long-term growth plans.[14] The foreign expansion—particularly that of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut—was cited in the firm's January 18, 2011, announcement of its intention to sell the A&W and Long John Silver's chains. Both of those chains also suffered from poor sales, and had fewer locations compared to the other chains in the Yum! Brands portfolio. In September 2011, Yum! announced they had found buyers for the A&W and LJS chains. A Great American Brand will buy A&W, and LJS will be acquired by LJS Partners LLC.[8]
In May 2011, Yum! agreed to purchase Chinese hot pot chain Little Sheep for HK$4.56 billion.[15] The deal spent more than 4 months in anti-trust review by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, to determine whether or not the transaction would result in a monopolistic positioning of Yum! in the country's restaurant industry. The Ministry approved the deal in November 2011, according to Little Sheep representatives.[16]
In 2012, a KFC opened in Ramallah and became the first American fast food restaurant to operate in the West Bank; a Pizza Hut is also planned.[17]
In 2013, a few KFC locations in China supplied chicken found to contain "excess levels of chemical residue". Yum! has lost 6% of sales from publicity in China as of January 25.[18]
The company opened its first restaurant in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, in May 2013. For Mongolia, KFC is the first western fast food to open its doors in the country. The company is planning to open 15 more restaurants in Ulaanbaatar in the next 5 years, including the country's first drive-thru service.[19] Yum! Brands has also opened Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurants in newer Target stores.
Yum! Brands opened its 40,000th store in Calangute, Goa, India in October 2013.[20]
In 2013, its KFC subsidiary opened a fast casual version, KFC eleven, test location in Louisville on Bardstown Road.[21] In the third quarter of 2013, Yum! Brands had to book an impairment of the goodwill resulting from the takeover of Little Sheep in 2011 in the amount of $222 million, which reduced profits for 2013.[22]
In 2014, Yum! launched a number of additional restaurant test concepts, Super Chix, U.S. Taco Co. and Banh Shop.[23] Yum! opened Super Chix in Central Arlington, Texas that is similar in format to Chick-fil-A on April 9, 2014.[24] In the summer of 2014, Yum!'s Taco Bell subsidiary launched its U.S. Taco Co and Urban Tap Room fast-casual taco concept restaurant in Huntington Beach, California, to take on fast casual restaurants like Chipotle and Panera.[25]
In the first quarter of 2015, Third Point Management and Corvex Management separately acquired an unspecified stake in the company.[26] The sole KFC Eleven was closed in April 2015.[21] A second Chix unit opened in May 2015 with additional menu items. Super Chix was sold to founder Nick Ouimet and an investment group in August 2015.[23]
In 2017, Yum! announced plans to open 10 Pizza Hut restaurants in Ethiopia, after signing a franchise with the country's Belayab Foods and Franchise PLC.[27]
Corporate[edit]




The KFC Yum! Center, Louisville's largest arena


The current executive chairman of Yum! Brands is Greg Creed. The previous CEO was David C. Novak.[28] Novak became CEO of predecessor firm Tricon Global on January 1, 2000, and chairman of the board on January 1, 2001.[29] Greg Creed replaced Novak in his role as CEO on January 1, 2015.[30] At the AGM in May 2016, Robert D. Walter became non-executive chairman.
On October 20, 2015, Yum! Brands, Inc., announced that it intended to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies.[31] Yum China was spun off on November 1, 2016.[32]
Since 2006, Yum! Brands has served as the corporate sponsor of the Kentucky Derby.[33]

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM)  19.43 (07/24/17)      EPS (TTM)  $3.85      Market Cap $26.03 B     Shares Outstanding 348.23 M     Public Float 346.88 M     Yield 1.60% (07/24/17)      Latest Dividend $0.30 (08/04/17)      Ex-Dividend Date 07/12/17       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.37      Net Money Flow ($)  1.94 M    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock. A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Yum! Brands (YUM) Poised for Growth on Strategic Initiatives


May 24, 2017, 08:10:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com









































Shutterstock photo


 On May 23, we issued an updated research report on the world's largest restaurant company in terms of system units, Yum! Brands, Inc. YUM  .    Currently, Yum! Brands owns, operates and franchises over 43,500 restaurants in more than 135 countries and territories. In fact, its brands -- KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell -- are regarded as the global leaders of the chicken, pizza and Mexican-style food categories.   Impact of the China Business Separation    On Nov 1, 2016, Yum! Brands announced that it has spun off its all-important China division into an independent, publicly traded company Yum China Holdings, Inc. YUMC  . Post separation, shares of Yum! Brands have slightly underperformed the Zacks categorized Retail-Restaurants  industry. While the industry gained 19.4%, the company has witnessed a rise of 16.9%.       Nonetheless, the company is leaving no stone unturned to subsidize the effects of the spin-off as well as to bring its growth story back on the track. Notably, Yum! Brands three-year strategic transformation plan is expected to bring much growth, moving ahead.   Efforts Undertaken    Yum! Brands' transformation and growth strategy entails greater focus on the development of its three iconic global brands, increasing its franchise ownership, and creating a leaner and more efficient cost structure. It is also focusing on bold restaurant development as well as unrivaled culture and talent to drive continued growth for the company.    While the Pizza Hut brand's international division has been largely doing well, Yum! Brands is working on a number of areas to take its fair share of growth in the U.S. market and mark a turnaround. Evidently, the company entered into an agreement with the Pizza Hut U.S. franchisees.    Per the agreement, Yum! Brands will invest roughly $130 million to improve brand marketing alignment as well as accelerate enhancements to operations and technology The deal also includes a permanent commitment to incremental advertising and aggressive investment in a digital delivery-centric strategy. This is expected to increase convenience for customers and the company expects to see the results pay off in 2018 and beyond.    At KFC, management is focused on convenience and expects to further increase brand engagement and boost sales through a big push on the digital front in 2017. Meanwhile, at KFC International Yum! Brands is aggressively pursuing its global delivery initiative as delivery is considered to be the fastest growing channel in the business.    Meanwhile, management seeks to continue developing the Taco Bell brand through continued focus on innovation and value, expanding its delivery program, inventive marketing strategies and extended line of breakfast offerings. On international front too, Taco Bell continues to build momentum with new restaurant openings in various markets, given the growing enthusiasm for the brand and its improving economics.    It should be noted that the China division's spin-off has largely made Yum! Brands a more asset-light company, as many company-owned restaurants have been in the Chinese market. Moreover, Yum! Brands is committed toward becoming at least 98% franchised by the end of 2018. Thus, it expects to become a "pure play" franchisor with more stable earnings, higher profit margins, lower capital requirements and stronger cash flow conversion,    Additionally, Yum! Brands aims to revamp its financial profile and thereby improve the efficiency of its organization and cost structure globally. It believes that a "slimmer Yum Brands" would lead to efficiency gains.   Concerns    Yum! Brands is highly exposed to various emerging nations in Latin America. In fact, these nations have been exhibiting decelerating growth for some time due to various macro headwinds, which might dent sales in the near term.    Foreign exchange translation is also a concern for the company, given its significant international presence.    Meanwhile, the first quarter of 2017 marked the fifth consecutive quarter of negative comp sales for the U.S. restaurant industry as a whole, thereby continuing the somber mood. Thus, a choppy sales environment in the domestic space is likely to keep the top line under pressure.   Bottom Line    We are positive on Yum! Brands manifold efforts to drive growth at its three iconic brands and thereby improve the key drivers of its business, comps and net new units.    In fact, the company's efforts have started bearing fruits as reflected by positive estimate revisions. Earnings estimates for full-year 2017 and 2018 have moved up 1.5% and 0.6%, respectively, over the 30 days.    However, the China business accounted for more than half of the company's total revenue and had played a pivotal role in its solid performance in the last few years. Thus, the slight uncertainty surrounding the company's business post the China unit spin-off could continue to weigh on its performance, in the near term.   Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider    Yum! Brands has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in this sector include Del Taco Restaurants, Inc. TACO  and Darden Restaurants, Inc. DRI  holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here   .    The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Del Taco's 2017 earnings climbed 1.9%, over the past 60 days. The company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 5.69%.    Darden's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters with an average beat of 3.35%. In fiscal 2017, EPS (earnings per share) is expected to grow 12.9%.

History[edit]
Tricon Global Restaurants[edit]
Yum! was created on May 30, 1997, as Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc. from PepsiCo's fast food division as the parent corporation of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurant companies.[4][5] Tricon Global was spun out in late 1997. Tricon selected Louisville as its headquarters moving near the KFC Restaurant Support Center from the Pepsi HQ in Purchase, New York, by early 1998.[5]
In 2000, Tricon Global agreed to test multi-branded locations with Yorkshire Global Restaurants. By March 2002, the Tricon-Yorkshire multibranding test consisted of 83 KFC/A&Ws, six KFC/Long John Silver's and three Taco Bell/Long John Silver's and was considered successful by the companies.[6]
In 2001, KFC started test restaurants in Austin, Texas, called "Wing Works", which is a chicken wing line sold with one of a few flavored sauces. Also, KFC hired a consultant to develop a breakfast menu.[7]
Yum! Brands[edit]
In March 2002, Tricon announced the acquisition of Lexington, Kentucky-based Yorkshire Global Restaurants, owner of the Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants[8] chains and its intention to change the company's name to Yum! Brands, Inc. On May 16, 2002, the name change became effective after a vote during the company's annual shareholders meeting, and on June 17, 2002, Yum! executed a two-for-one stock split. Shortly afterwards, due to Yum!'s lifetime contract with Pepsi, Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants (both of which previously served Coca-Cola products) began gradually switching to Pepsi products, with A&W Restaurants retaining A&W Root Beer from a separate deal with Dr Pepper/Seven Up (now Dr Pepper Snapple Group).
In 2002, Yum! began testing co-branding locations pairing Pizza Hut with Pasta Bravo, Back Yard Burgers and A&W.[9] The Pasta Bravo concept was acquired in 2003 from Pasta Bravo, Inc. of Aliso Viejo, California for $5 million to pair with Pizza Hut.[10]
In 2003, Yum! launched WingStreet as a hybrid combo unit with an existing Pizza Hut franchise.[11] In 2007 and 2008, a thousand WingStreet stores a year were opened. On October 19, 2009, Company president Scott Bergren publicize WingStreet's national launch.[11]
An East Dawning test cafeteria-style restaurant was opened in Shanghai in 2004. After initially failing, Yum! Brands chose the KFC business model (KFC is the most successful Western chain in China) and found greater success.[12] As of September 30, 2007, eight East Dawning restaurants were in operation.[13]
International focus[edit]

Another cobranded KFC and Taco Bell in Oscoda, Michigan


In January 2011, Yum! announced its intentions to divest itself of its Long John Silver's and A&W brands to focus on its core brands of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. For the decade leading up to the company's announcement, major growth had relied on international expansion. With little presence outside North America, the two chains no longer fit in the company's long-term growth plans.[14] The foreign expansion—particularly that of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut—was cited in the firm's January 18, 2011, announcement of its intention to sell the A&W and Long John Silver's chains. Both of those chains also suffered from poor sales, and had fewer locations compared to the other chains in the Yum! Brands portfolio. In September 2011, Yum! announced they had found buyers for the A&W and LJS chains. A Great American Brand will buy A&W, and LJS will be acquired by LJS Partners LLC.[8]
In May 2011, Yum! agreed to purchase Chinese hot pot chain Little Sheep for HK$4.56 billion.[15] The deal spent more than 4 months in anti-trust review by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, to determine whether or not the transaction would result in a monopolistic positioning of Yum! in the country's restaurant industry. The Ministry approved the deal in November 2011, according to Little Sheep representatives.[16]
In 2012, a KFC opened in Ramallah and became the first American fast food restaurant to operate in the West Bank; a Pizza Hut is also planned.[17]
In 2013, a few KFC locations in China supplied chicken found to contain "excess levels of chemical residue". Yum! has lost 6% of sales from publicity in China as of January 25.[18]
The company opened its first restaurant in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, in May 2013. For Mongolia, KFC is the first western fast food to open its doors in the country. The company is planning to open 15 more restaurants in Ulaanbaatar in the next 5 years, including the country's first drive-thru service.[19] Yum! Brands has also opened Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurants in newer Target stores.
Yum! Brands opened its 40,000th store in Calangute, Goa, India in October 2013.[20]
In 2013, its KFC subsidiary opened a fast casual version, KFC eleven, test location in Louisville on Bardstown Road.[21] In the third quarter of 2013, Yum! Brands had to book an impairment of the goodwill resulting from the takeover of Little Sheep in 2011 in the amount of $222 million, which reduced profits for 2013.[22]
In 2014, Yum! launched a number of additional restaurant test concepts, Super Chix, U.S. Taco Co. and Banh Shop.[23] Yum! opened Super Chix in Central Arlington, Texas that is similar in format to Chick-fil-A on April 9, 2014.[24] In the summer of 2014, Yum!'s Taco Bell subsidiary launched its U.S. Taco Co and Urban Tap Room fast-casual taco concept restaurant in Huntington Beach, California, to take on fast casual restaurants like Chipotle and Panera.[25]
In the first quarter of 2015, Third Point Management and Corvex Management separately acquired an unspecified stake in the company.[26] The sole KFC Eleven was closed in April 2015.[21] A second Chix unit opened in May 2015 with additional menu items. Super Chix was sold to founder Nick Ouimet and an investment group in August 2015.[23]
In 2017, Yum! announced plans to open 10 Pizza Hut restaurants in Ethiopia, after signing a franchise with the country's Belayab Foods and Franchise PLC.[27]
Corporate[edit]




The KFC Yum! Center, Louisville's largest arena


The current executive chairman of Yum! Brands is Greg Creed. The previous CEO was David C. Novak.[28] Novak became CEO of predecessor firm Tricon Global on January 1, 2000, and chairman of the board on January 1, 2001.[29] Greg Creed replaced Novak in his role as CEO on January 1, 2015.[30] At the AGM in May 2016, Robert D. Walter became non-executive chairman.
On October 20, 2015, Yum! Brands, Inc., announced that it intended to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies.[31] Yum China was spun off on November 1, 2016.[32]
Since 2006, Yum! Brands has served as the corporate sponsor of the Kentucky Derby.[33]

History[edit]
Tricon Global Restaurants[edit]
Yum! was created on May 30, 1997, as Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc. from PepsiCo's fast food division as the parent corporation of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurant companies.[4][5] Tricon Global was spun out in late 1997. Tricon selected Louisville as its headquarters moving near the KFC Restaurant Support Center from the Pepsi HQ in Purchase, New York, by early 1998.[5]
In 2000, Tricon Global agreed to test multi-branded locations with Yorkshire Global Restaurants. By March 2002, the Tricon-Yorkshire multibranding test consisted of 83 KFC/A&Ws, six KFC/Long John Silver's and three Taco Bell/Long John Silver's and was considered successful by the companies.[6]
In 2001, KFC started test restaurants in Austin, Texas, called "Wing Works", which is a chicken wing line sold with one of a few flavored sauces. Also, KFC hired a consultant to develop a breakfast menu.[7]
Yum! Brands[edit]
In March 2002, Tricon announced the acquisition of Lexington, Kentucky-based Yorkshire Global Restaurants, owner of the Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants[8] chains and its intention to change the company's name to Yum! Brands, Inc. On May 16, 2002, the name change became effective after a vote during the company's annual shareholders meeting, and on June 17, 2002, Yum! executed a two-for-one stock split. Shortly afterwards, due to Yum!'s lifetime contract with Pepsi, Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants (both of which previously served Coca-Cola products) began gradually switching to Pepsi products, with A&W Restaurants retaining A&W Root Beer from a separate deal with Dr Pepper/Seven Up (now Dr Pepper Snapple Group).
In 2002, Yum! began testing co-branding locations pairing Pizza Hut with Pasta Bravo, Back Yard Burgers and A&W.[9] The Pasta Bravo concept was acquired in 2003 from Pasta Bravo, Inc. of Aliso Viejo, California for $5 million to pair with Pizza Hut.[10]
In 2003, Yum! launched WingStreet as a hybrid combo unit with an existing Pizza Hut franchise.[11] In 2007 and 2008, a thousand WingStreet stores a year were opened. On October 19, 2009, Company president Scott Bergren publicize WingStreet's national launch.[11]
An East Dawning test cafeteria-style restaurant was opened in Shanghai in 2004. After initially failing, Yum! Brands chose the KFC business model (KFC is the most successful Western chain in China) and found greater success.[12] As of September 30, 2007, eight East Dawning restaurants were in operation.[13]
International focus[edit]




A single Yum! restaurant facility co-branded as Taco Bell and KFC in San Francisco, California






Another cobranded KFC and Taco Bell in Oscoda, Michigan


In January 2011, Yum! announced its intentions to divest itself of its Long John Silver's and A&W brands to focus on its core brands of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. For the decade leading up to the company's announcement, major growth had relied on international expansion. With little presence outside North America, the two chains no longer fit in the company's long-term growth plans.[14] The foreign expansion—particularly that of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut—was cited in the firm's January 18, 2011, announcement of its intention to sell the A&W and Long John Silver's chains. Both of those chains also suffered from poor sales, and had fewer locations compared to the other chains in the Yum! Brands portfolio. In September 2011, Yum! announced they had found buyers for the A&W and LJS chains. A Great American Brand will buy A&W, and LJS will be acquired by LJS Partners LLC.[8]
In May 2011, Yum! agreed to purchase Chinese hot pot chain Little Sheep for HK$4.56 billion.[15] The deal spent more than 4 months in anti-trust review by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, to determine whether or not the transaction would result in a monopolistic positioning of Yum! in the country's restaurant industry. The Ministry approved the deal in November 2011, according to Little Sheep representatives.[16]
In 2012, a KFC opened in Ramallah and became the first American fast food restaurant to operate in the West Bank; a Pizza Hut is also planned.[17]
In 2013, a few KFC locations in China supplied chicken found to contain "excess levels of chemical residue". Yum! has lost 6% of sales from publicity in China as of January 25.[18]
The company opened its first restaurant in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, in May 2013. For Mongolia, KFC is the first western fast food to open its doors in the country. The company is planning to open 15 more restaurants in Ulaanbaatar in the next 5 years, including the country's first drive-thru service.[19] Yum! Brands has also opened Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurants in newer Target stores.
Yum! Brands opened its 40,000th store in Calangute, Goa, India in October 2013.[20]
In 2013, its KFC subsidiary opened a fast casual version, KFC eleven, test location in Louisville on Bardstown Road.[21] In the third quarter of 2013, Yum! Brands had to book an impairment of the goodwill resulting from the takeover of Little Sheep in 2011 in the amount of $222 million, which reduced profits for 2013.[22]
In 2014, Yum! launched a number of additional restaurant test concepts, Super Chix, U.S. Taco Co. and Banh Shop.[23] Yum! opened Super Chix in Central Arlington, Texas that is similar in format to Chick-fil-A on April 9, 2014.[24] In the summer of 2014, Yum!'s Taco Bell subsidiary launched its U.S. Taco Co and Urban Tap Room fast-casual taco concept restaurant in Huntington Beach, California, to take on fast casual restaurants like Chipotle and Panera.[25]
In the first quarter of 2015, Third Point Management and Corvex Management separately acquired an unspecified stake in the company.[26] The sole KFC Eleven was closed in April 2015.[21] A second Chix unit opened in May 2015 with additional menu items. Super Chix was sold to founder Nick Ouimet and an investment group in August 2015.[23]
In 2017, Yum! announced plans to open 10 Pizza Hut restaurants in Ethiopia, after signing a franchise with the country's Belayab Foods and Franchise PLC.[27]
Corporate[edit]




The KFC Yum! Center, Louisville's largest arena


The current executive chairman of Yum! Brands is Greg Creed. The previous CEO was David C. Novak.[28] Novak became CEO of predecessor firm Tricon Global on January 1, 2000, and chairman of the board on January 1, 2001.[29] Greg Creed replaced Novak in his role as CEO on January 1, 2015.[30] At the AGM in May 2016, Robert D. Walter became non-executive chairman.
On October 20, 2015, Yum! Brands, Inc., announced that it intended to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies.[31] Yum China was spun off on November 1, 2016.[32]
Since 2006, Yum! Brands has served as the corporate sponsor of the Kentucky Derby.[33]

History[edit]
Tricon Global Restaurants[edit]
Yum! was created on May 30, 1997, as Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc. from PepsiCo's fast food division as the parent corporation of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurant companies.[4][5] Tricon Global was spun out in late 1997. Tricon selected Louisville as its headquarters moving near the KFC Restaurant Support Center from the Pepsi HQ in Purchase, New York, by early 1998.[5]
In 2000, Tricon Global agreed to test multi-branded locations with Yorkshire Global Restaurants. By March 2002, the Tricon-Yorkshire multibranding test consisted of 83 KFC/A&Ws, six KFC/Long John Silver's and three Taco Bell/Long John Silver's and was considered successful by the companies.[6]
In 2001, KFC started test restaurants in Austin, Texas, called "Wing Works", which is a chicken wing line sold with one of a few flavored sauces. Also, KFC hired a consultant to develop a breakfast menu.[7]
Yum! Brands[edit]
In March 2002, Tricon announced the acquisition of Lexington, Kentucky-based Yorkshire Global Restaurants, owner of the Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants[8] chains and its intention to change the company's name to Yum! Brands, Inc. On May 16, 2002, the name change became effective after a vote during the company's annual shareholders meeting, and on June 17, 2002, Yum! executed a two-for-one stock split. Shortly afterwards, due to Yum!'s lifetime contract with Pepsi, Long John Silver's and A&W Restaurants (both of which previously served Coca-Cola products) began gradually switching to Pepsi products, with A&W Restaurants retaining A&W Root Beer from a separate deal with Dr Pepper/Seven Up (now Dr Pepper Snapple Group).
In 2002, Yum! began testing co-branding locations pairing Pizza Hut with Pasta Bravo, Back Yard Burgers and A&W.[9] The Pasta Bravo concept was acquired in 2003 from Pasta Bravo, Inc. of Aliso Viejo, California for $5 million to pair with Pizza Hut.[10]
In 2003, Yum! launched WingStreet as a hybrid combo unit with an existing Pizza Hut franchise.[11] In 2007 and 2008, a thousand WingStreet stores a year were opened. On October 19, 2009, Company president Scott Bergren publicize WingStreet's national launch.[11]
An East Dawning test cafeteria-style restaurant was opened in Shanghai in 2004. After initially failing, Yum! Brands chose the KFC business model (KFC is the most successful Western chain in China) and found greater success.[12] As of September 30, 2007, eight East Dawning restaurants were in operation.[13]
International focus[edit]




A single Yum! restaurant facility co-branded as Taco Bell and KFC in San Francisco, California






Another cobranded KFC and Taco Bell in Oscoda, Michigan


In January 2011, Yum! announced its intentions to divest itself of its Long John Silver's and A&W brands to focus on its core brands of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. For the decade leading up to the company's announcement, major growth had relied on international expansion. With little presence outside North America, the two chains no longer fit in the company's long-term growth plans.[14] The foreign expansion—particularly that of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut—was cited in the firm's January 18, 2011, announcement of its intention to sell the A&W and Long John Silver's chains. Both of those chains also suffered from poor sales, and had fewer locations compared to the other chains in the Yum! Brands portfolio. In September 2011, Yum! announced they had found buyers for the A&W and LJS chains. A Great American Brand will buy A&W, and LJS will be acquired by LJS Partners LLC.[8]
In May 2011, Yum! agreed to purchase Chinese hot pot chain Little Sheep for HK$4.56 billion.[15] The deal spent more than 4 months in anti-trust review by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, to determine whether or not the transaction would result in a monopolistic positioning of Yum! in the country's restaurant industry. The Ministry approved the deal in November 2011, according to Little Sheep representatives.[16]
In 2012, a KFC opened in Ramallah and became the first American fast food restaurant to operate in the West Bank; a Pizza Hut is also planned.[17]
In 2013, a few KFC locations in China supplied chicken found to contain "excess levels of chemical residue". Yum! has lost 6% of sales from publicity in China as of January 25.[18]
The company opened its first restaurant in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, in May 2013. For Mongolia, KFC is the first western fast food to open its doors in the country. The company is planning to open 15 more restaurants in Ulaanbaatar in the next 5 years, including the country's first drive-thru service.[19] Yum! Brands has also opened Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurants in newer Target stores.
Yum! Brands opened its 40,000th store in Calangute, Goa, India in October 2013.[20]
In 2013, its KFC subsidiary opened a fast casual version, KFC eleven, test location in Louisville on Bardstown Road.[21] In the third quarter of 2013, Yum! Brands had to book an impairment of the goodwill resulting from the takeover of Little Sheep in 2011 in the amount of $222 million, which reduced profits for 2013.[22]
In 2014, Yum! launched a number of additional restaurant test concepts, Super Chix, U.S. Taco Co. and Banh Shop.[23] Yum! opened Super Chix in Central Arlington, Texas that is similar in format to Chick-fil-A on April 9, 2014.[24] In the summer of 2014, Yum!'s Taco Bell subsidiary launched its U.S. Taco Co and Urban Tap Room fast-casual taco concept restaurant in Huntington Beach, California, to take on fast casual restaurants like Chipotle and Panera.[25]
In the first quarter of 2015, Third Point Management and Corvex Management separately acquired an unspecified stake in the company.[26] The sole KFC Eleven was closed in April 2015.[21] A second Chix unit opened in May 2015 with additional menu items. Super Chix was sold to founder Nick Ouimet and an investment group in August 2015.[23]
In 2017, Yum! announced plans to open 10 Pizza Hut restaurants in Ethiopia, after signing a franchise with the country's Belayab Foods and Franchise PLC.[27]
Corporate[edit]




The KFC Yum! Center, Louisville's largest arena


The current executive chairman of Yum! Brands is Greg Creed. The previous CEO was David C. Novak.[28] Novak became CEO of predecessor firm Tricon Global on January 1, 2000, and chairman of the board on January 1, 2001.[29] Greg Creed replaced Novak in his role as CEO on January 1, 2015.[30] At the AGM in May 2016, Robert D. Walter became non-executive chairman.
On October 20, 2015, Yum! Brands, Inc., announced that it intended to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies.[31] Yum China was spun off on November 1, 2016.[32]
Since 2006, Yum! Brands has served as the corporate sponsor of the Kentucky Derby.[33]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
