Ultragenyx Provides Regulatory Update on Burosumab
Jun 23 17
Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. announced that it has reached agreement with the FDA at a Pre-Biologics License Application (pre-BLA) meeting on the clinical package to support the burosumab (KRN23) BLA filing for X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH). At the meeting, the FDA agreed that the BLA can be submitted based on available clinical data and confirmed that both pediatric and adult indications would be included in the review. Based on the agreement, the submission of the burosumab BLA is planned for the second half of 2017. Specifically for the pediatric XLH population, the FDA agreed that the 64 week data from Study CL201 in 5-12 year olds and 24 week data from Study CL205 in 1-4 year olds would be sufficient for review. The FDA confirmed that data from the pediatric Phase 3 study (CL301) would not be required for the BLA filing. To support the adult XLH indication, the FDA agreed that the review would be based on the totality of the data from the adult Phase 3 study CL303 including fracture healing data. FDA would also accept some bone biopsy data from the 48 week open label bone quality Phase 3 study in adults if available during the review as supportive evidence.

Emil D. Kakkis, M.D., Ph.D.
Chief Executive Officer and President




	Dr. Kakkis is currently Ultragenyx’s President and Chief Executive Officer. He is also President of the non-profit EveryLife Foundation for Rare Diseases, an organization he founded in 2009 to work on regulatory policy issues.  Over the last 22 years Dr. Kakkis is best known for his work developing novel treatments for rare disorders. He began his work developing an enzyme replacement therapy (Aldurazyme®) for the rare disorder MPS I, with minimal funding and support. The struggle to get the therapy translated from a successful canine model to patients succeeded due to the critical financial support of the Ryan Foundation, a patient organization formed by Mark and Jeanne Dant for their son Ryan. Aldurazyme development was later supported by BioMarin and Genzyme leading to FDA approval in 2003. After joining BioMarin in 1998, Dr. Kakkis guided the development and approval of two more treatments for rare disorders, MPS VI and PKU, and has contributed to the initiation of 7 other treatment programs for rare disorders, three of which are now in clinical development or approved.

	After 11 years at BioMarin, Dr. Kakkis funded and launched the EveryLife Foundation for Rare Diseases, a non-profit foundation dedicated to the acceleration of biotech innovation for rare diseases through practical and scientifically sound improvements to development strategies, regulatory policy and law. The Foundation successfully advocated for improvements to the accelerated approval pathway for rare disease treatments that was passed by Congress in FDASIA in 2012.

	Dr. Kakkis went on to found Ultragenyx in 2010 to focus on developing as many rare and ultra-rare disease therapeutics as possible. Since its founding, Ultragenyx has grown to more than 100 employees developing treatments for five rare and ultra-rare diseases in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical development.   The company went public in January 2014 (RARE  NASDAQ).

	Dr. Kakkis is board certified in both Pediatrics and Medical Genetics. He graduated from Pomona College, magna cum laude and received the Vaile prize for his research.  He received combined M.D. and Ph.D. degrees from the UCLA Medical Scientist Program and received the Bogen prize for his research. He completed a Pediatrics residency and Medical Genetics Training Fellowship at Harbor- UCLA Medical Center from 1989-1993 and from 1993 to 1998, was an assistant professor of Pediatrics at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center where he initiated the enzyme therapy program for MPS I.

Ultragenyx’s strategy is predicated upon time and cost-efficient drug development, with the goal of delivering safe and effective therapies to patients with the utmost urgency.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Ultragenyx Reports Second Quarter 2017 Financial Results and Corporate Update






 
NOVATO, Calif., July  27, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:RARE), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel products for rare and ultra-rare diseases, today reported its financial results and corporate update for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.
“We look forward to submitting our biologics license application (BLA) for burosumab and working with the FDA to bring this potential treatment to adult and pediatric patients,” said Emil D. Kakkis, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and President of Ultragenyx. “We believe the first bone biopsy data from our ongoing Phase 3 bone quality study underscore burosumab’s impact on the underlying bone disease in adults with XLH.”  Second Quarter 2017 Financial Results For the second quarter of 2017, Ultragenyx reported a net loss of $72.9 million, or $1.72 per share, basic and diluted, compared with a net loss of $56.9 million, or $1.46 per share, basic and diluted in the second quarter of 2016. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, net loss was $141.2 million, or $3.35 per share, basic and diluted, compared with a net loss for the same period in 2016 of $109.7 million, or $2.81 per share, basic and diluted. This reflected cash used in operations of $110.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $84.6 million for the same period in 2016. Total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2017 were $78.4 million compared with $58.1 million for the same period in 2016, including non-cash stock-based compensation of $16.8 million and $10.9 million for the second quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Total operating expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2017 were $148.4 million compared with $111.7 million for the same period in 2016, including non-cash stock-based compensation of $31.3 million and $21.1 million in the first six months of 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in total operating expenses is due to the increase in development, commercial, and general and administrative costs as the company grows and advances its pipeline. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments were $457.5 million as of June 30, 2017. Recent Highlights  Burosumab (KRN23) anti-FGF23 Monoclonal Antibody in X-Linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH)  

Submission of a US BLA for burosumab for the treatment of pediatric and adult XLH patients planned in August 2017. In June 2017, we announced that we had reached agreement with the FDA at a pre-Biologics License Application (pre-BLA) meeting on the clinical package to support the burosumab BLA filing for XLH. At the meeting, the FDA agreed that the BLA could be submitted based on available clinical data and confirmed that both pediatric and adult indications would be included in the review. Specifically for pediatric patients, the filing will include the 64-week data from our Phase 2 study in 5-12 year olds and 24-week data from the Phase 2 study in 1-4 year olds. The FDA confirmed that data from the ongoing pediatric Phase 3 study would not be required for the BLA filing. To support the adult indication, the submission will include the 24-week placebo-controlled data from the adult Phase 3 study. Additionally, FDA agreed to accept any available bone biopsy data from the 48-week open label bone quality study in adults as supportive evidence.

Two new pieces of data on adult patients to be included in the burosumab BLA. Bone biopsy results from the first two adults in the bone quality study will be included in the burosumab BLA. In this study, baseline biopsies obtained from 11 patients confirmed that a majority of the patients had severe osteomalacia with a mean osteoid volume/bone volume of 26% vs. normal range of 0.3%-3.1%. These data verify that adult XLH patients have severe underlying bone disease even many years past puberty. Follow-up biopsies after 48 weeks of burosumab treatment are available from the first two patients. For these two patients, osteoid volume/bone volume was decreased from 24% and 29% to 9% and 7%, respectively. Osteomalacia was characterized by the pathologist as improving from severe to mild disease. Additionally, a post-hoc statistical analysis of bone fracture healing in the recently announced adult Phase 3 placebo-controlled study showed an odds ratio of 7.76 for complete healing of fractures and pseudofractures in the burosumab group compared to the placebo group (p=0.0004) at 24 weeks.

Burosumab designated a drug for a “rare pediatric disease”. The FDA’s Office of Orphan Drug Development (OOPD) has recently designated burosumab for the treatment of XLH as a drug for a “rare pediatric disease”. Under FDA's Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program, companies who receive approval for a new drug application or BLA for a rare pediatric disease may be eligible to receive a voucher for a Priority Review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. The Priority Review Voucher may be used by the company or sold to a third party.

European Conditional Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to be focused on pediatric indication. To ensure the expeditious availability of burosumab for pediatric XLH patients in Europe and to avoid any potential delays in the review procedure due to the large amount of recent data from the adult XLH Phase 3 study to be filed, our partners Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. (Kyowa Hakko Kirin) and Kyowa Kirin International PLC have decided to separate the adult and pediatric indications. A filing for the adult indication is planned after a decision is first reached on the pediatric indication.

Turkey agreement with Kyowa Kirin. In May 2017, Ultragenyx signed an agreement with a wholly owned subsidiary of Kyowa Kirin, pursuant to which Ultragenyx was granted the right to commercialize burosumab in Turkey. This subsidiary will have the option to take over commercialization efforts after a certain minimum period.
 Vestronidase alpha or rhGUS in Mucopolysaccharidosis 7 (MPS 7) 
BLA and MAA filings accepted for review. The FDA has granted vestronidase alpha Priority Review Status, and the BLA has a PDUFA goal date for a decision of November 16, 2017. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) opinion is expected in the first half of 2018. Upcoming Key Milestones  Burosumab in XLH 

Ultragenyx plans to submit a BLA for both adult and pediatric patients to the U.S. FDA for burosumab in August 2017.   Based on follow-up discussions with the FDA on the content and structure of the filing, the BLA filing is in final assembly and will be submitted in August. Given that the product is designated as a breakthrough therapy, it is expected that burosumab would obtain priority review after the filing which would indicate an 8-month review period.

Opinion from CHMP on the burosumab Conditional MAA for pediatric XLH expected around the end of 2017. The MAA was submitted and accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in December 2016.
 Vestronidase alpha in MPS 7 
PDUFA goal date and CHMP opinion. The PDUFA goal date for a decision is November 16, 2017 and no advisory committee meeting is expected in the US at this time. The CHMP opinion is expected in the first half of 2018. Aceneuramic Acid Extended Release (Ace-ER) in GNE Myopathy 
Data from the pivotal Phase 3 study in GNE myopathy expected in the second half of 2017. The fully enrolled randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled international study in 89 patients is evaluating the efficacy and safety of Ace-ER compared with placebo over 48 weeks. We plan to submit an NDA and MAA based on the Phase 3 data, if positive.  UX007 in Long-Chain Fatty Acid Oxidation Disorders (LC-FAOD) and Glut1 Deficiency Syndrome (Glut1 DS) 

Phase 3 study in FAOD patients. We continue to plan for discussions with regulators regarding the Phase 3 study in FAOD patients. 

Phase 3 movement disorder study in Glut1 DS patients ongoing. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study is enrolling approximately 40 patients. The primary endpoint compares the frequency of disabling paroxysmal movement disorder events with UX007 to placebo, as recorded by a daily electronic diary.
