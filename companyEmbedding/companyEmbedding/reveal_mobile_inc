  Advertising Competition with Facebook Heats Up






If you’ve spent any time in local, regional, or national sales in the last few years, there’s a great chance you’ve lost business to Facebook. Sure, you’ve always had competition, but the playing field is no longer level. It’s tilted mightily towards social media. They’ve got the biggest scale and easiest targeting tools available.
To bring this point home, PR Daily published research on January 11th, 2017 showing how pervasive advertising on Facebook has become.
Our report found that 93 percent of marketers use Facebook for business and 91 percent have invested in Facebook Ads. Despite the drop in its organic reach, 72 percent of respondents said their use of Facebook has held steady or increased in the past 12 months.
And spend is increasing…
This calendar year, 42 percent of respondents have spent more than in 2015, with only 7 percent of companies decreasing their social media marketing budgets. About half (51 percent) saw their annual budgets stay the same.
Making that point with more numbers is this data from PWC and IAB.

The takeaway: the competition is heating up as more businesses view social media marketing as a crucial element of their advertising strategy.
The teaser: we’ll soon announce a new product that lets our customers turn their location based mobile audiences into social media audiences. Not only will they be able to target their app users across Facebook, but they’ll also have access to Reveal Mobile’s entire network of 60M+ devices to create location targeted campaigns.
For the first time, we’ll empower sales teams to build a bridge for their advertisers between media companies and social media targeting. Easily package up visitors to an advertiser’s locations and/or competitive locations, and build them a campaign reaching this audience across the major social media channels. As ad spend continues to migrate to Facebook for the foreseeable future, Reveal Mobile will let media companies continue to have a voice, and valuable audience targeting, in the discussion.
Stay tuned.

  Documentation









Reveal Mobile provides a native mobile audience SDK that allows developers to provide targeted audiences to their ad network based on a user’s location, beacon interactions and installed applications.
Reveal Mobile requires an account with the Reveal system and a valid API key. Click here to sign up for an API key, and use sdk.revealmobile.com.





Reveal Mobile iOS SDK
(Version 1.3.27 published 07/14/17)
 
Reveal Mobile is a native mobile SDK that allows developers to provide tailored personas to their ad network based on a user’s location, beacon interactions and installed applications.
Swift NOTE: The prebuilt framework version does not support Swift due to legacy compatibility constraints. The easiest way to use the framework in Swift is to install from Cocoapods. We can provide pre-built framework versions supporting iOS 8+ only if Cocoapod installation is not suitable for your implementation.
A NOTE about our use of Background Modes: In order to detect iBeacons, we follow Apple’s documentation for UIBackgroundModes. In order to detect Eddystone beacons, which can’t use the iBeacon methods, we follow Apple’s documentation for using Bluetooth-central. Our customers use both iBeacon and Eddystone formats, so we must use both approaches. In order to save battery life, all Bluetooth related scanning is only turned on after all startup tasks are finished and then only in short intervals. We only use Bluetooth-central for beacon detection to tailor location-based content and advertising, and do not use it to connect to other Bluetooth devices.
Usage
Simple Setup
Objective-C
#import <Reveal/Reveal.h>
// Setup the Reveal Mobile SDK pointed at production with no debug features
Reveal *theSDK = [[Reveal sharedInstance] setupWithAPIKey:<YOUR API KEY>];

// Allow the SDK to request location permission for you on start, otherwise it defaults to waiting for you to request permission in your app
[theSDK setCanRequestLocationPermission: YES];
[theSDK start];

Swift
import Reveal
// Setup the SDK with your API key
Reveal.sharedInstance().setup( withAPIKey: "<YOUR API KEY>", andServiceType: .production )
// Allow the SDK to request location permission for you on start, otherwise it defaults to waiting for you to request permission in your app
Reveal.sharedInstance().canRequestLocationPermission = true
// Setup the Reveal Mobile SDK pointed at production with no debug features
Reveal.sharedInstance().start()

Testing Setup
Objective-C
Reveal *theSDK = [[Reveal sharedInstance] setupWithAPIKey:<YOUR API KEY>];
// Turn on optional debug logging
theSDK.debug = YES;
// Setup a list of beacon UUID's for testing. This list will override the list from the server if set.
theSDK.debugUUIDs = @[ @"<YOUR BEACON UUID>"];

// Allow the SDK to request location permission for you on start, otherwise it defaults to waiting for you to request permission in your app
[theSDK setCanRequestLocationPermission: YES];

// Start the SDK. The SDK will contact the server for further config info
// and start monitoring for beacons.
[theSDK start];


Swift
import Reveal
// Turn on optional debug logging
Reveal.sharedInstance().debug = true
// Setup the SDK with your API key
Reveal.sharedInstance().setup( withAPIKey: "<YOUR API KEY>", andServiceType: .production )
// Allow the SDK to request location permission for you on start, otherwise it defaults to waiting for you to request permission in your app
Reveal.sharedInstance().canRequestLocationPermission = true
// Setup the Reveal Mobile SDK pointed at production with no debug features
Reveal.sharedInstance().start()


Background transmission of beacons
To sending beacon bumps while the app is in background, enable the background fetch capability and add the following to your App delegate file:
Objective-C
- (void) application:(UIApplication *)application performFetchWithCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UIBackgroundFetchResult))completionHandler {
[[Reveal sharedInstance] backgroundFetchWithCompletionHandler: completionHandler];
}

Swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, performFetchWithCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (UIBackgroundFetchResult) -> Void)
{
Reveal.sharedInstance().backgroundFetchWithCompletionHandler( completionHandler );
}

Accessing the Personas
Objective-C
// Get personas to send to ad network. Personas array is an array of NSString* objects.
NSArray* personas = [Reveal sharedInstance].personas

Swift
// Get personas to send to ad network. Personas array is an array of NSString* objects.
var result = Reveal.sharedInstance().personas

Accessing the personas is a lightweight call to the SDK that does not involve a network request. You should call for personas everytime you build an ad view in order to get the most current available list of personas.
DFP Integration
If using DoubleClick (DFP), ensure these personas pass to the “reveal” custom targeting key in DFP as a custom parameter. Reveal Mobile will work with your ad trafficking team to create the custom targeting key in DFP. Below is sample code you can insert into your ad call to DFP. Please, make sure you revise this code sample to fit your existing ad call! For additional reference beyond the sample code, refer to Google’s documentation on custom targeting.
GADAdSize adsize = GADAdSizeFromCGSize(CGSizeMake(300, 250));
DFPBannerView* ad = [[DFPBannerView alloc] initWithAdSize:adsize];
GADRequest* request = [GADRequest request];
// get Reveal personas and add to AdNetworkExtras
GADExtras *extras = [[[GADExtras alloc] init] autorelease];
NSMutableDictionary *additionalParameters = [[[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init] autorelease];
NSArray* personas = [Reveal sharedInstance].personas;
NSString *persona_list = [personas componentsJoinedByString:@","];
[additionalParameters setObject:persona_list forKey:@"reveal"];
extras.additionalParameters = additionalParameters;
[request registerAdNetworkExtras:extras];
// get Location and add to request
CGFloat lat;
CGFloat lon;
CGFloat accuracy;
// populate these variables with the location information from CoreLocation, 
// then call setLocationWithLatitude:longitude:accuracy:
[request setLocationWithLatitude:lat longitude:lon accuracy:accuracy];
// make the request
[ad loadRequest:request];

 
Project setup
Since Reveal Mobile monitors your users’ locations, it is important to communicate clearly to the end user why your application asks for their location. We suggest setting the following values in your Info.plist file. You are free to change the wording, ours is only a suggestion. The first key is for iOS 8.0 support and the latter is for legacy systems.



Key
Value




NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription
We use your device’s location to tailor content and advertising within the app.


Privacy – Location Usage Description
We use your device’s location to tailor content and advertising within the app.



You will also need to add Apple’s Core location and Core Bluetooth frameworks to your project and select the “Uses Bluetooth LE accessories” option under the background modes capability.
To support background notification of beacons, you will also need to enable the “Background fetch” fetch capability.
Requirements
Reveal Mobile requires at least iOS 7.0 to run. Beacon scanning requires a Bluetooth LE capable device to operate.
For beacon scanning to function correctly in iOS, Apple requires the “Always” location permission. Apple built beacon scanning directly into the operating system, which allows beacon detection to occur while the app is in the background and not currently open. Using the “While Using the App” setting for location permission isn’t sufficient for beacon detection. You must add the “Always” permission, and we recommend this be the default location permission requested.
For reference, here is Apple’s documentation on beacon scanning. Here’s where Apple discusses using Location Services in the background, with the relevant text copied below.
Using Location Services in the Background:

Most location services are meant to be used while your app is in the foreground but some can also run in the background. In some cases, location events can even cause your app to be relaunched to process an event. To run most location services in the background, you need to enable the location updates background mode in the Capabilities tab of your Xcode project. For services that launch your app, you need to request (and be granted) “Always” authorization from the user.
Reveal Mobile requires an account with our system and a valid API key. You may request a production key from the Reveal Mobile team at support@revealmobile.com.
Installation
Simple Integration
Reveal Mobile is available through CocoaPods. To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:
pod "Reveal"


Manual Integration
Reveal Mobile can be added as a framework. First, download the iOS Framework here. After adding Reveal.framework to your project, you need to link your project against the following system frameworks (CoreLocation, CoreBluetooth, AdSupport).

Reveal Mobile Android SDK
(Version 1.4.2 published 07/14/17)
Reveal Mobile is a native mobile SDK that allows developers to provide tailored personas to their ad network based on a user’s location, beacon interactions and device details.
Usage
The Reveal Mobile setup should happen only once when the application launches. You need to subclass android.app.Application (adding the appropriate AndroidManifest.xml information to use your subclass) and adding your code in the onCreate() method.
Simple Setup
public class BaseApplication extends Application {
...
@Override
public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();

    // Setup the Reveal Mobile SDK pointed at production with no debug features
    Reveal reveal = Reveal.getInstance();
    reveal.setAPIKey("<YOUR API KEY>");

    //Start Reveal Mobile service. This will start start discovering beacons.  The Reveal Mobile SDK requires you to pass in the Application variable to receive boot loading broadcasts
    reveal.start(this);
    ...
}

Accessing the Personas
In order for your app to deliver ads using Reveal Mobile audience data, you must pass the personas to your ad server.
// Get personas to send to ad network.  Personas array is an array of String objects.
List<String> personas = Reveal.getInstance().getPersonas();

Accessing the personas is a lightweight call to the SDK that does not involve a network request. You should call it to get the most current available list of personas every time you build an ad view.
DFP Integration
If using DoubleClick (DFP), ensure the personas pass to the “reveal” custom targeting key in DFP as a custom parameter. Reveal Mobile will work with your ad trafficking team to create the custom targeting key in DFP. Below is sample code you can insert into your ad call to DFP. Please, make sure you revise this code sample to fit your existing ad call! Here’s Google’s documentation to help out.
import com.google.android.gms.ads.mediation.admob.AdMobExtras;

AdView adview = new AdView(activity);
adview.setAdSize(size);
adview.setAdUnitId(unit);

adview.setLayoutParams(new FrameLayout.LayoutParams(LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT, size.getHeightInPixels(activity)));

AdRequest.Builder ab = new AdRequest.Builder();

// add reveal
String revealApiKey = activity.getString(R.string.revealApiKey);
if (revealApiKey != null && revealApiKey.length() > 0) {
    List<String> personas = Reveal.getInstance().getPersonas();

    Bundle b = new Bundle();
    b.putString ("reveal", StringUtils.join(personas, ","));

    ab.addNetworkExtras(new AdMobExtras(b));
}

// add location
double lat;
double lon;
float accuracy;

// populate lat, lon, accuracy with location information from the system

Location loc = new Location ("");
loc.setLatitude(lat);
loc.setLongitude(lon);
loc.setAccuracy(accuracy);

ab.setLocation (loc);

AdRequest adrequest = ab.build();
adview.loadAd(adrequest);


Independent Beacon Scanning
Should your usage of the SDK require disabling of beacon detection, the appropriate flag to set to false is:
setIsBeaconScanningEnabled

If your usage of the SDK requires the ability to disable beacon detection while the app is in the background, the appropriate flag to set to false is:
setIsBackgroundScanningEnabled

Project setup/Installation
Reveal Mobile can be setup automatically using our Maven dependency or manually using our downloadable dependency.  The following sections will go through these methods.
Setup via Maven/Gradle
Add the following dependencies to your application module’s gradle file (if not already present):
dependencies {   
compile 'com.stepleaderdigital.reveal:reveal:+@aar'  
compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:+'   
compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:+'   
}
Manual Setup
Reveal Mobile is available as an Android .jar file. Place this .jar file in your libs directory and then follow the instructions below. If you are using the manual integration, then you will need to add these entries to your application module’s Manifest for beacon scanning to occur.
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /> 
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" /> 
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" /> 
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED" /> 
<uses-permission-sdk-23 android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />

<!-- Android suggests putting this in the manifest even though false is the default value -->

<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.bluetooth_le" android:required="false"/>
<application>
        <receiver android:name="com.stepleaderdigital.reveal.StartupBroadcastReceiver">
   <intent-filter>
       <action android:name="android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED"/>
       <action android:name="android.intent.action.ACTION_POWER_CONNECTED"/>
       <action android:name="android.intent.action.ACTION_POWER_DISCONNECTED"/>
   </intent-filter>
</receiver>

<service android:enabled="true"
   android:exported="false"
   android:isolatedProcess="false"
   android:label="beacon"
   android:name="com.stepleaderdigital.reveal.BeaconService"
   />

<service android:name="com.stepleaderdigital.reveal.BeaconIntentProcessor"
   android:enabled="true"
   android:exported="false"
   />
    </application>
Location Permission Requests (Targeting SDK > 23 only)
In apps targeting Android SDK level 23 and above (6.0+), developers must explicitly request permissions from the user that Android deems “dangerous”, such as location. Since the Reveal SDK requires the “ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION” permission, implementers targeting SDK level 23+ must request this permission from the end users before the Reveal SDK can properly function. We suggest following Android’s guide to request permissions and handle the results here: http://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting.html. The Reveal SDK will function if location access is denied, but it will not be able to determine the information needed to make a profile of the user for ad targeting.
Requirements
Reveal Mobile requires at least Android 4.3 to run. Beacon scanning requires a Bluetooth LE capable device to operate.
