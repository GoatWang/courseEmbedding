CRITIC REVIEWS:�Charles Dalmor�s made his operatic d�but at the Th��tre des Arts in Rouen on 6 October, 1899, in the Wagnerian r�le of Siegfried.  Following this, he spent six seasons with the Th��tre de la Monnaie in Brussels and sang with success at London's Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in 1904-1905 and 1909-1911.His American d�but took place in Gounod's FAUST, in which he appeared with New York's Manhattan Opera Company on 7 December, 1906.  He spent four years with the company, specializing in French r�les.  For American audiences, he created the r�les of Julien in Charpentier's LOUISE and Jean Gaussin in Massenet's SAPHO.  Another famous part that he sang was Pell�as in Debussy's PELL�AS ET M�LISANDE.  He also appeared in numerous productions with the Philadelphia Opera Company between 1908-1910.In 1910 Dalmor�s was engaged by the Chicago Grand Opera Company with whom he performed until 1914.  The company was highly active in Philadelphia as well as Chicago and often performed under the title of the Philadelphia-Chicago Grand Opera Comoany while in that city.  With that company he notably performed the r�le of Vinicius in the United States premi�re of Jean Nougu�s's QUO VADIS.  In 1917 Dalmor�s joined the Chicago Opera Association.  There he sang for the first time the title r�les in Wagner's PARSIFAL and TRISTAN UND ISOLDE.  He also visited Germany and Austria on different occasions prior to the outbreak of World War I, performing Wagner in the original language in Berlin and other cities.  In 1908-1909, he appeared at the Vienna Court Opera and undertook the r�le of Lohengrin, in Wagner's eponymous opera, at the 1908 Bayreuth Festival.Tall for a tenor, he was praised by contemporary critics not only for his strong, steady, well-modulated voice but also for his impressive stage presence and acting.  Fortunately, he made a number of gramophone records for Victor which have been reissued on CD.  Produced between 1907 and 1912, they confirm the excellence of his musicianship and the imposing power of his declamatory singing, although the top of his range sounds a bit constricted on these 100-year-old discs.  One of his most celebrated records is a 1907 rendition of Manrico's aria �Ah! si, ben mio�, from Verdi's IL TROVATORE, in which he displays an admirably smooth legato line, elegant phrasing and a splendid trill.  He also recorded a few French songs as well as arias and duets from various operas, including LOHENGRIN, Meyerbeer's LE PROPH�TE, Saint-Sa�ns' SAMSON ET DALILA, Offenbach's LES CONTES D'HOFFMANN, Bizet's CARMEN, Massenet's GRISELIDIS, and Gounod's ROM�O ET JULIETTE and FAUST.Dalmor�s returned to France in 1918 but subsequently went back to the United States to live.  He taught singing and died in Hollywood, California at the age of 68.  In the pantheon of great French dramatic/lyric-dramatic tenors, his place is secure.  He proved to be a worthy successor to Jean de Reszke, L�on Escalais and Albert Alvarez, each of whom enjoyed international careers during the 1890s and early 1900s.  Of those French-speaking tenors who took up his mantle, the most esteemed were Paul Franz and Fernand Ansseau, followed in turn by Rene Maison, Georges Thill and, finally, Jose Luccioni, who was the last representative of this distinguished lineage.  Luccioni retired in 1962.  There are no big-voiced French tenors of comparable stature singing today.�- Ned Ludd�[Maison�s] efforts are to be applauded, as they are most fulfilling in every musical and artistic aspect imaginable, and underline the fact that he was one of the most histrionically and vocally talented tenors of his generation�.Ren� Maison�s voice has a timbre that�can perhaps be compared to a slightly dry, yet rich and full-bodied red wine.  He was a big man physically, and his repertoire and the tone emitted on his recordings do indicate size, weight and a delivery that (according to critical reviews) must have demonstrated excellent projection.�- Alan Bilgora, THE RECORD COLLECTOR, 2011

MORE INFO:  Moscow Festival Ballet


Created in 1967 by Cuban choreographer Alberto Alonso, with music written by Russian composer Rodion Shchedrin, this one-act ballet set in Spain is based on Bizet’s opera Carmen. Also to be performed, Romeo and Juliet, based on Shakespeare’s timeless tragedy, with music by Tchaikowsky.



Background



Artistic Director: Sergei Radchenko
The Moscow Festival Ballet was founded in 1989 when legendary principal dancer of the Bolshoi Ballet Sergei Radchenko sought to realize his vision of a company which would bring together the highest classical elements of the great Bolshoi and Kirov Ballet companies in an independent new company within the framework of Russian classic ballet.
Leading dancers from across the Russia have forged under Radchenko’s direction an exciting new company staging new productions of timeless classics such as Giselle, Don Quixote, Paquita and Carmen.
Since its inception, the Moscow Festival Ballet has completed two tours of Europe, with extraordinary receptions in Italy, France, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands. Two tours of the United Kingdom, including capacity audiences at London's famed Coliseum, have resulted in re- engagements during the 1995-96, 1996-97, 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000 seasons.
The company has also performed with great success in Turkey at the Istanbul Festival and in Greece at the Athens Festival, and recently completed a two-month tour of Japan, Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong. Under the direction of Sergei Radchenko, the Moscow Festival Ballet continues to expand its repertoire.  In addition to commissioning new works from within Russia and abroad, the company specializes in Twentieth Century full-length ballets such as Cinderella, Romeo and Juliet, Legend of Love, Stone Flower and The Golden Age. Mr. Radchenko has researched the original choreography and stage productions of several of Marius Petipa's classic ballets, including new productions in the year 2000 of Don Quixote and Paquita, and a recreation of Jules Perrot's and Jean Coralli's Giselle.
The Moscow Festival Ballet has toured extensively throughout the United States, beginning with a Coast-to-Coast tour in the Winter/Spring of 1997 and returning in 2001, 2004, 2007, 2010, and 2014, and returns to the United States and Canada in the Winter/Spring of 2016.

Professional Wine Reviews for Benjamin Romeo Carmen Rioja Gran Reserva Tempranillo 2008

      Rated 95 by Robert Parker
      

        The 2008 Carmen Gran Reserva has a classic nose with notes of American oak, some herbaceous character (I mean it in a positive, fresh way) in the shape of some spearmint. It displays an array of notes of tobacco, cured meats, leather, balsamic herbs and a hint of chalk. The medium-bodied palate reveals a powerful Gran Reserva, with intense flavors, great acidity and length. This wine is very different in style to the rest of Benjamin's wines, following the patterns of the classical Riojas of yesteryear. Bravo! Drink 2014-2020.

Additional Information on Benjamin Romeo Carmen Rioja Gran Reserva Tempranillo 2008



        
        Winery

        Benjamin Romeo





Vintage: 2008
2008 saw very high yields across wineries in much of the southern hemisphere, as a result of highly favorable climatic conditions. Although in many areas, these high yields brought with them something of a drop in overall quality, this could not be said for South Australia's wines, which were reportedly excellent. Indeed, the 2008 Shiraz harvest in South Australia is said to be one of the most successful in recent decades, and western Australia's Chardonnays are set to be ones to watch out for. New Zealand's Pinot Noir harvest was also very good, with wineries in Martinborough reportedly very excited about this particular grape and the characteristics it revealed this year.

Pinot Noir also grew very well in the United States, and was probably the most successful grape varietal to come out of California in 2008, with Sonoma Coast and Anderson Valley delivering fantastic results from this grape. Elsewhere in United States, Washington State and Oregon had highly successful harvests in 2008 despite some early worries about frost.

However, it was France who had the best of the weather and growing conditions in 2008, and this year was one of the great vintages for Champagne, the MÃ©doc in Bordeaux, Languedoc-Roussillon and Provence, with Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay grapes leading the way. Italy, too, shared many of these ideal conditions, with the wineries in Tuscany claiming that their Chianti Classicos of 2008 will be ones to collect, and Piedmont's Barberesco and Barolo wines will be recognized as amongst the finest of the past decade.







Varietal: Tempranillo
The wines made from the Tempranillo grape varietal have gone down in history as being some of the finest in the world, with the Spanish region of Riot being one of the most famed and respected examples of a quality red wine made with this grape. Elsewhere in the world, the Tempranillo grape has had plenty of success, and grows best in regions with a mixture of hot sunshine and cooling breezes. These grapes hold plenty of intense and interesting flavors, and are often said to hold many of the most sought after flavors to be found in a red wine. Leather, tobacco, plums and herbs are often noted in wines made with Tempranillo grapes, and the blended wines made with this varietal are often seen at the top of world rankings.







Region: La Rioja
La Rioja is by far the most famous wine region of Spain, and remains one of the world's great wine producing regions, consistently offering deep, complex red wines of character and distinction, partly due to the fact that La Rioja benefits from excellent soils, rich in minerals and nutrients, and plenty of sunshine. The climatic conditions allow the fine grape varietals to reach full ripeness and express plenty of the best features of their terroir, making La Rioja wines some of the most interesting to have ever come out of Europe. The Cantabrian mountains to the north provide the perfect shelter from the colder, wetter influences of the Atlantic oceans, and in the beloved vineyards of La Rioja, wineries have been cultivating exceedingly flavorful Tempranillo grapes for generations for the inclusion in their fine single variety and blended wines.







Country: Spain
For over two thousand years, Spain has been responsible for much of Europe's wine production, making the very best of native grape varietals, and more recently experimenting with and perfecting wines made from imported grapes. Of course, the region of La Rioja is renowned world-wide for the quality and characteristics of its wines, which benefit greatly from the warm, dry continental climate of the area, and the fertile soils of the Ebro river basin. However, there is far more to Spanish produce than the complex, aromatic and earthy red wine of this region, as a result of the vast range of wine making traditions and practices, and terrains and climatic conditions found across the country. The region Castilla y Leon produces some of Europe's finest white wines, and the sparkling wines of Cava and the sherries of Jerez are firm favorites for wine lovers around the world.

AboutArgentina
Get the Full Story






Until the early 1990s, Argentina's wine industry was focused inward, as the local market's thirst was sufficient to absorb the huge quantities of everyday drinking wine produced there. But with per-capita consumption in the domestic market in sharp decline since the mid-1970s, Argentina's wine producers realized that they had to look to export markets to remain in business, and winemaking in Argentina began its transformation.
In just a few short years, Argentina has shifted its emphasis to the production of quality wine and turned its attention to export markets. Vine yields have been reduced dramatically. Large old wood casks have been widely replaced by oak barriques. And a major wave of new planting has taken place in mostly cooler, high-altitude sites that are better suited to producing serious wines, such as the Uco Valley, in the foothills of the Andes, about 80 miles south of the city of Mendoza. Despite the widespread reduction of vine yields, Argentina remains a huge wine producer, ranking number five in the world. Red Argentine wines, especially those from Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, and blends incorporating these two varieties, represent the lion's share of the best bottles.
Many of today's finest Argentine wines have barely five years of history. Consulting winemakers from California and Europe have brought their technical expertise to Argentina, as well as their knowledge of what is necessary to compete in the world wine market. At the same time, there has been an explosion of foreign investment by wealthy wine producers, luxury corporations and individual investors attracted by inexpensive vineyard land and by Argentina's warm, dry climate. Since the Argentine peso was sharply devalued in late 2001, land prices have been even more attractive to outside investors.
