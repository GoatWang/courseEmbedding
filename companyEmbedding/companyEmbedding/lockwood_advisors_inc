Investment InsightsRead Commentary








Investment Approach
Philosophy Lockwood’s investment decisions are based on objective research in an effort to eliminate bias toward particular investments or money managers. With access to resources and insights of BNY Mellon, one of the world’s largest investment organizations, Lockwood seeks to deliver superior long-term investment outcomes for clients by emphasizing risk management in our management of portfolios and thorough investment manager selection.
Key philosophy differentiators:

Emphasizing a long-term investment horizon—an approach that seeks to counteract emotional behaviors that can lead to poor investment outcomes
Focus on downside risk management—our experience shows us that steady, long-term wealth accumulation is best achieved by focusing on loss avoidance instead of upside return chasing
A relationship with BNY Mellon—accessing capital market, asset allocation and manager research from one of the world’s largest financial institutions provides our clients with access to best-practice insights similar to those delivered to the largest institutional investors

Portfolio Construction From analyzing asset classes to choosing managers, we believe that our advantage in portfolio construction lies in understanding manager due diligence, research and their connection to the capital markets. Lockwood’s Investment Committee considers in-depth analysis of these factors when making asset allocation and investment research decisions.
Due Diligence by the BNY Mellon Manager Research Group Lockwood works with the BNY Mellon Manager Research Group to conduct initial due diligence and ongoing monitoring of investment managers and vehicles, including:

Qualitative and quantitative investment manager screening and selection
Investment manager monitoring and oversight
Performance analysis and attribution



What We Offer
In today’s world of heightened regulatory scrutiny in the industry and more complex investment strategies, advisors often outsource portfolio management responsibilities or components of the portfolio construction process. Lockwood’s broad range of solutions enables advisors to outsource parts of the investment process, resulting in more time to spend with clients and prospects.
Solutions from BNY Mellon's Lockwood range from separately managed accounts, fixed and flexible mutual fund/ETF wrap offerings and our unified managed account offering where client assets are managed by Lockwood on a fully discretionary basis.
Lockwood’s products and services include:

 Investment management, research and overlay services, giving you access to discretionary services including separately managed accounts, flexible/fixed mutual fund/exchange-traded fund wrap accounts, fixed/flexible unified managed accounts
Investment manager monitoring and oversight
 Business development/field support
 Advisory consulting services

Lockwood’s discretionary investment advisory solutions include:


The Lockwood/American Funds Core Portfolios  The Lockwood/American Funds Core Portfolios combine actively managed American Funds and select, passively managed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to create an active/passive hybrid portfolio that seeks to provide an efficient and effective investment solution for investors. With a minimum investment of $10,000, these portfolios are attentive to fees, with the goal of enabling investors to meet their long-term investment needs.
Built on the tenets of objectives-based investing, the three unique, diversified portfolios align with key stages of the investor lifecycle:

An appreciation model for the accumulation stage
A balanced model for the transition stage
A conservative growth model for the retirement stage

Lockwood is solely responsible for the fund selection and construction of the portfolios and neither American Funds Distributors, Inc. nor its affiliates are involved in such activities.
