    Executive Speaker Series







On November 14th, Frank Cohen (center), Senior Managing Director of Blackstone’s Real Estate Group, joined a group of Kellogg students for lunch and discussed Blackstone’s strategy, his career, the state of the real estate markets, and provided career and investing advice. Also pictured at the head table are Sean O’Grady, President, Kellogg Real Estate Club (left), Craig Furfine, Clinical Professor of Finance (right) and students of the Kellogg Real Estate Club.

Our executive speaker series was launched in May of 2004. Our inaugural speaker was Sam Zell. His presentation was attended by 25 students from the Kellogg Real Estate Club and several real estate faculty members as well as Dean Jacobs. The format then is much like today: Over lunch at the Allen Center, the executive provides an informal overview of his/her views on the commercial real estate market, which is followed by a question-and-answer period with the students and faculty. The series is a joint effort between the Kellogg Real Estate Program, Kellogg Real Estate Club and the Guthrie Center for Real Estate Research, but was initiated by the Zell Center for Risk Research. 

The Kellogg Real Estate Executive Speaker Series provides our students an informal forum to exchange ideas with and ask questions of leading real estate executives. This interaction with key members of the real estate industry provides the students with varied and insightful perspectives on leadership, investment management, competition, personal development and other significant issues. The program also fosters positive relationships between key industry practitioners (and their company(ies)) and the Kellogg Real Estate Program.

Stephen Quazzo Named Chairman of the ULI Foundation

Posted on June 30, 2016  by  Melanie Starkey 





 




Urban Land Institute leader Stephen R. Quazzo, chief executive officer of Pearlmark Real Estate in Chicago, has been named chairman of the ULI Foundation. A member of the Foundation’s board of directors, Quazzo began his two-year chairmanship term July 1, 2016.
The mission of the ULI Foundation is to serve as the philanthropic source for ULI, a multi-disciplinary research and education institute with more than 38,000 members dedicated to responsible land use and building thriving, sustainable communities worldwide. The Foundation, with net assets of more than $48 million, secures endowment funds, major gifts and annual fund contributions from ULI members as well as funding from other philanthropic organizations to support the Institute’s key programs, activities and services.
As chairman, Quazzo continues the Foundation’s efforts to strengthen the connection between donor giving and ULI’s impact. “Cities around the world are grappling with many forces of change, including demographics, population shifts, economic drivers, the environment and technology. As a result, ULI’s work in community building has never been more necessary or relevant,” Quazzo said. “The Foundation’s support is integral to expanding ULI’s reach and influence. There is a direct correlation between gifts to the Institute and results achieved. I look forward to keeping the momentum going for the Foundation and for ULI.”
Quazzo, a ULI global board member, global trustee, and ULI Foundation governor, has a strong history of volunteerism with the Institute. He has served as a Trustee from 2003 to 2012 and as a former Executive Committee member from 2005 to 2009. He is currently on the ULI Foundation Board of Directors, and previously served as a member of the ULI Governance and Nominating Committee. Quazzo was active on Chicago local arrangements committees and serves on the ULI Chicago governance committee. In addition, he has been a ULI council member for over 20 years, having served on both the Industrial and Office Park Development Council and the Commercial Retail Development Council.
