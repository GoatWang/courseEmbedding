Discover How to Buy a Business with Little to None of Your Own Money! 


Learn how you can get 100% funding to buy a business. Not like real estate investing or stock trading, but the business of your dreams — like a coffee shop, hair salon, spa,  retail store, auto shop, liquor store, restaurant, sports bar, etc.






 



93% of small business funding is rejected by banks. Banks overwhelmingly say “No” to small business loan requests. However, just because a bank won’t fund a deal doesn’t mean there is no startup business funding or business credit available for that deal. Since 2003, Ed Keels and his staff at Beyond Breakeven, Inc. (BBI) have been helping people with deal structures that provide business funding and business credit when banks won’t. In fact, BBI has developed more than 100 ways to fund a business acquisition or startup and do so with little to none of the buyer’s own money.

 Asset Protection Planning: The Basics To Get You Started | How To Protect Your Assets            How To Protect Your Assets Menu       Asset Protection Planning: The Basics To Get You Started Asset protection planning is the most important part of managing your business, and you need to be sure that you have something that will help you keep more money in your pocket. Your business has a lot of assets that need to be protected, and you need to start working with a planner who will help you manage all those things without a problem. The best part of this is that a planner can show you how to handle the process, and then you can purchase protection that works for you.   Choose An AgentThe agent you work with is the first person you need to talk to when it is time for this work to be done. You know that you need to have someone on your side who will help you find the best protection possible, and you need to keep adjusting your protection until you are happy with it. Then you can buy the protection, and it can be changed any time you add or subtract assets from your business. Purchase Enough Protection For Everything You need to make sure that you have enough protection for everything your business owns. Even the tiniest thing your business owns is important, and you need to have protection that covers every single one of these things. Ask your agent to look over the assets of your company, and then the company will instantly have all the information that is needed to draw up your policy.   Protecting Against LawsuitsThis protection also needs to make sure that you have a way of handling any kind of lawsuit. You have assets that people can attack, or you might have to fight for your assets in court. The best way to handle this situation is to have some kind of coverage that works on all levels. Your agent will let you know what you can purchase to protect your business, and then you will instantly learn how easy it is to use. The protection not only provides basic insurance, but it also helps you when you are stuck in some kind of legal battle. The best part of asset protection is that you can protect your business from attacks no matter how bad they are. You do not have to wait for something bad to happen to you. You can lean on your protection, and you can use that policy to make real changes to the way that you manage your business. You do not have to sit back while people attack you, and you do not have to accept losses that happen. You will be able to get help from an agent who will protect you, and the agent will help you file a claim when needed.
