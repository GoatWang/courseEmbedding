PROFILE SUMMARY








Alejandro Riquezes
Member since
                            January 23rd, 2012
                        
Boca Raton , USA
Co-Founder - CEO at wind2share



Co-Founder of wind2share.    

I am part of a group of great individuals building wind2share, 

I am building my own network in wind2share, in order to share knowledge and expertise with other members and world-renowned institutions, turning them into countless business opportunities. 

I am more than willing to refer potential clients to different companies and institutions that are looking for opportunities in several sectors.

As a Co-Founder & CEO of wind2share, a social referral network, I help managers, entrepreneurs, for-profit and not-for-profit institutions get their messages out to connect, broadly and engage so they can effectively reach new clients in different markets. 

The wind2share business model is about helping people and companies connect, with the long-term purpose of supporting each other and if business opportunities are successful, then sharing the benefits.

Whether it’s via a tweet, an email, face to face (still my favorite), direct message, social media platforms like Facebook, Linkedin, or Tencent (China), using your WhatsApp or BB, Ebay or our own beloved wind2share, when we connect with someone that has the expertise, we should look to partner to create business opportunities. I believe that most people should take advantage and monetize their professional connections. That’s why most people go to work 8 to 9 hours a day (I go 12 or more...) – to make money.

My background in Investments / Finance, as a financial adviser with focuses on University Endowments and Pension Funds; I have been Portfolio Manager in a very small emerging market equity privately owned Fund and Co-Founded a family and friends Hedge Fund (now closed)…. My philosophy is to plan for long-term view but with day-to-day actions…. I love marketing; I had experience in sales and marketing in a well-known consumer product company.

I'm a golf veteran (40 years playing and still maintaining a 15 handicap….not good), I enjoy meeting new companies, organizations and people around the world and talking about the power of social media and the new economy (The democratization of business). I am one of wind2share’s greatest advocates— always trying to spread the word one tweet or blurb at a time….

What I like to preach:

  “Monetization of contacts today… thanks to social media” equals wind2share

“I am a partner (also ambassador) of great companies “as a user/member of wind2share…. And of course anyone can be one too….. If you have the right attitude!!

My great partners (the wind2share team) and I are helping develop the tools for the democratization of business opportunities … wind2share
