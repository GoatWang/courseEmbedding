Sterling Consolidated Corporation, Inc.
					The multi-billion dollar market for hydraulic and pneumatic seals is highly-fragmented and ripe for consolidation. Our acquisition strategy is opportunistic and is focused on companies with generational changes of ownership, where we can provide investment capital for growth or leverage our operation capabilities to drive value for all stakeholders. Our deep bench of talent, core knowledge and industry-leading expertise makes Sterling an excellent partner for aging or opportunistic business owners that are seeking an exit strategy or a business combination that can enhance their return, accelerate future growth or drive greater profitability. 
				



Sterling Seal is a distributor of O-rings. O-rings are one of the simplest, yet most engineered, precise, and useful seal designs. They are one of the most common and important elements of hydraulic and pneumatic machines. O-rings and the other products that Sterling Seal sells are used in a wide variety of industries, including automotive, pump, transmissions, oil and energy, machinery, and packaging. These products are utilized primarily as seals to prevent leakage of liquids or a gas. Sterling offers a catalogue of standard sizes, and will take orders for special sizes not available in the standard catalogue. In order to satisfy the needs of our customers and stay competitive, Sterling Seal always maintains a wide variety of products in substantial quantities at its main warehouse in Neptune, New Jersey, as well as at its other facilities in Florida and Massachusetts.




In 2008 the SCC aggressively invested in the freight forwarding business with the startup of the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Integrity Cargo, LLC. This relationship allows us to control costs, reduce handling and provide faster deliveries from non-domestic vendors. Integrity Cargo also handles inbound customer direct factory shipments. Entering the freight forwarding market has provided the Company with a competitive advantage as compared with other importing distributors of rubber O-Rings.  By having the ability to utilize our own freight company, we are able to consolidate shipments from various sources and ship as frequently as needed which has resulted in improved efficiencies and delivery times.





ADDR Properties, LLC is a real estate holding company.  The LLC owns two properties.  The first is a 28,000 square foot warehouse facility in Neptune, NJ and is occupied by Sterling Seal to conduct its operations, as well as by other tenants. The second property is an investment property in Cliffwood Beach, NJ. The Company's operations outgrew the facility and four tenants currently occupy 65% of the location.

This Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (this "Code") applies to the officers, controllers and in-house counsel of the companies listed above, who are referred to in this Policy for convenience collectively as "Officers."
The companies listed above are referred to in this Code for ease of reference collectively as well as singly as the "Company." However, references to "Sterling" are to the publicly-traded parent company, Sterling Consolidated Corporation.
Introduction
This Code is subject to all applicable law. Nothing in this Code is intended to require any action contrary to law. In the event that this Code conflicts with any law or code of professional responsibility or conduct, Officers must comply with the law and such code. Nothing in this Code is intended to be or will be construed (a) to amend the charter or bylaws of the Company; (b) to change the legal duties imposed upon Officers under state, federal and other applicable laws, rules and regulations; (c) to expand the liabilities of Officers beyond applicable law; or (d) to affect any rights available to Officers under state and other applicable law or the Company's charter or bylaws. Officers shall be entitled to the benefits of indemnification to the fullest extent permitted by law and the Company's charter and bylaws, and shall be entitled to exculpation to the extent provided by state law and the Company's charter. This Code may be amended, modified or waived from time to time.
This Code may be amended, modified or waived by Sterling's Board of Directors. Any amendments, modifications or waivers of this Code will be promptly disclosed in accordance with applicable securities laws and the applicable rules of any national securities exchange and national securities association on which the securities of Sterling may be listed from time to time. This disclosure requirement also applies to any de facto waiver where an Officer violates this Code, but is not subjected to any internal sanctions.
This Code provides general guidelines only. It is intended to supplement, but not to replace the policies and procedures of the Company. In the event that any policy or procedure of the Company conflicts with this Code, Officers must comply with this Code.
Officers should consult Sterling's Board of Directors if they have any questions about this Code. Code of Business Conduct & Ethics Revised March 12, 2010.
1Honest and Ethical Conduct. Each Officer must demonstrate honest and ethical conduct in fulfilling his or her duties, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships in accordance with Company policies.

Each Officer must also comply with the Company's reporting policies, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controls as well as any other policies that the Company adopts from time to time on specific laws, rules and regulations.

5Reporting of Illegal or Unethical Behavior.

If these concerns require confidentiality, such as providing anonymity for the source of the information, the Officer must make every effort to maintain such confidentiality, subject to applicable laws, rules, regulations and legal proceedings. Sterling's Audit Committee has established procedures for Company employees to report on a confidential and anonymous basis any complaint about fraud, accounting irregularities, internal controls, audit matters, waste of resources, potentially illegal activities, inappropriate drug use, sexual harassment or similar issues.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements  The information contained in Item 2 contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and  This filing contains a number of forward-looking statements which reflect management's current views and expectations with respect to our business, strategies, products, future results and events, and financial performance. All statements made in this filing other than statements of historical fact, including statements addressing operating performance, events, or developments which management expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future, including statements related to distributor channels, volume growth, revenues, profitability, new products, adequacy of funds from operations, statements expressing general optimism about future operating results, and non-historical information, are forward looking statements. In particular, the words "believe," "expect," "intend," "anticipate," "estimate," "may," variations of such words, and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements, and their absence does not mean that the statement is not forward-looking. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from historical results as well as those expressed in, anticipated, or implied by these forward-looking statements. We do not undertake any obligation to revise these forward-looking statements to reflect any future events or circumstances.  Readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and projections about future events, are not guarantees of future performance, are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions (including those described below), and apply only as of the date of this filing. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.  Overview  We were incorporated in the State of Nevada as Oceanview Acquisition Corp. on January 31, 2011. On May 18, 2012, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to Sterling Consolidated Corp.  Our largest subsidiary is Sterling Seal& Supply, Inc. ("Sterling Seal"), a New Jersey corporation which was incorporated in 1997. Its predecessor was Sterling Plastic & Rubber Products, Inc., incorporated in New Jersey and was founded in 1970. Sterling Seal engages primarily in the distribution and sale of O-rings, rubber seals, oil seals, custom molded rubber parts, custom Teflon parts, Teflon rods, O-ring cord, bonded seals, O-ring kits, and stuffing box sealant.  We also own real property through our subsidiaries ADDR Properties, LLC ("ADDR") and Q5 Ventures, LLC ("Q5"). ADDR owns a 28,000 square foot facility in Neptune, New Jersey, that is primarily used by Sterling Seal for its operations. ADDR also owns another property in Cliffwood Beach, New Jersey, that was previously occupied by Sterling Seal and is now rented out to tenants. Q5 owns a 5,000 square foot facility that is used by Sterling Seal in Florida.  In addition, our subsidiary Integrity Cargo Freight Corporation ("Integrity") is a freight forwarding business. Integrity shares a facility with Sterling Seal and manages the importation of Sterling Seal's products and exports products on behalf of Sterling Seal to various countries.  Since going public on February 7, 2013, the Company has acquired Superior Sales Inc., a North Carolina o-ring custom manufacturer and distributor as well as RG Sales Inc., a Pennsylvania distributor of o-rings and rubber products. The Company continues to review acquisition targets as its primary means of expansion.  Recent Financings  Private Placements  In January of 2012, Sterling Seal and Supply, Inc. conducted a private placement under Rule 506 of Regulation D. In the offering, Sterling Seal and Supply, Inc. sold a total of 697,040 shares of common stock at $0.30 per share to 36 investors prior to the June 8, 2012 share exchange agreement for total proceeds of $209,112.  In June 2012, Sterling Consolidated Corp. conducted a private placement selling an additional 100,333 shares to 2 investors for a total investment of $30,100.  In December of 2012, Sterling Consolidated Corp. obtained an equity investment of $35,000 in exchange for 116,667 shares from one investor.  Commencement of Trading  On April 30, 2013, the Company's common stock began trading over-the-counter on the OTC QB exchange.  SurePoint Investment Agreement and Registration Statement on Form S-1  On May 28, 2013, we entered into an investment agreement, (the "SurePoint Investment Agreement") with SurePoint Capital, a Delaware limited liability company ("SurePoint"). Pursuant to the terms of the SurePoint Investment Agreement, SurePoint committed to purchase up to $1,000,000 of our common stock over a period of up to twenty-four (24) months. From time to time during the twenty-four (24) month period commencing from the effectiveness of the registration statement, the Company may deliver a put notice to SurePoint which states the dollar amount that we intend to sell to SurePoint on a date specified in the put notice. The maximum investment amount per notice shall be no more than $50,000 worth of common stock so long s such amount does not exceed 4.99% of the outstanding shares of the Company. The purchase price per share to be paid by SurePoint shall be calculated at a ten (10%) discount to the average of the three lowest closing bids during the five (5) consecutive trading days immediately prior to the receipt by SurePoint of the put notice. The Company has reserved 4,273,504shares of our common stock for issuance under the SurePoint Investment Agreement. Additionally, the Company agreed to issue SurePoint 125,000 shares of our common stock.  In connection with the SurePoint Investment Agreement, the Company also entered into a registration rights agreement with SurePoint, pursuant to which the Company is obligated to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") covering 4,398,504 shares of our common stock underlying the SurePoint Investment Agreement within 21 days after the closing of the transaction.  On June 21, 2013, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Under the registration statement, SurePoint may sell up to 4,398,504 shares of the Company's common stock based upon the Company delivering put notices.  On July 24, 2013, pursuant to SEC comments, the Company filed a request to withdraw the registration statement on Form S-1. Following the withdrawal, the Company re-negotiated the SurePoint Investment Agreement and re-filed a new registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC on July 30, 2013 for 4,398,504 shares of common stock. The registration statement was declared effective on August 27, 2013.  This registration statement gives the Company the opportunity to deliver put notices to SurePoint in exchange for cash. The Company intends to use the proceeds to take advantage of acquisition opportunities that may arise in the future, however the Company cannot make any assurances that these opportunities will arise.  In October and November of 2013, the Company issued 275,000 shares at a weighted average price of $0.16/share under the SurePoint Investment Agreement.  Results of Operations  Comparison for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013  Net Revenue  Net revenue increased by approximately $89,049 or approximately 5.4%, from $1,650,100 for the three months ended March 31, 2013 to $1,739,149 for the three months ended March 31, 2014. This increase is due primarily to incremental sales from the Company's September 2013 acquisition of North Carolina-based Superior Seals Inc.  Total Cost of Sales  Cost of sales increased by $67,574 or approximately 6.3%, from $1,066,732 for the three months ended March 31, 2014 to $1,134,306 for the three months ended March 31, 2013. The increase is commensurate to the increase in sales.  Gross profit  Gross profit increased approximately $21,475, or approximately 3.7%, from $583,368 for the three months ended March 31, 2013 to $604,843 for the three months ended March 31, 2014. This increase can be attributed to the above described increase in sales.  Net Income  As a result of the above factors, net income was $85,862 for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to net income of $110,922 for the three months ended March 31, 2013. This decrease of $25,060 or approximately 22.6% is attributed to the above described increase in gross profit mitigated by a slightly higher General and Administrative expenses due to increased headcount and a higher tax provision.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash requirements for, but not limited to, working capital, capital expenditures, and debt repayments have been funded from cash balances on hand, revolver borrowings, loans from officers, notes payable and cash generated from operations.  At March 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $317,450 as compared to approximately $543,945 as of December 31, 2013, representing a decrease of $226,495. This decrease can be explained by net cash used in operating activities of $154,032 primarily attributed to paydown of accounts payable,; net cash used in investing activities of $83,440 due to investment in a leasehold improvement; and net cash provided from financing activities of $10,977, primarily attributed to drawdown on the line of credit of $33,167. At March 31, 2014, our working capital was approximately $1,445,575.  The cash flow from operating activities decreased from net cash used of $8,273 for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 to 154,032 for the quarter ended March 31, 2014. This decrease of $145,759 is primarily attributed to a significant paydown of accounts payable of $366,852 offset by an increase of accounts receivable of $366,852.  The cash flow from financing activities increased from net cash used of $32,675 for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 to net cash provided of $10,977 for the quarter ended March 31, 2014. This increase is primarily attributed to the drawdown on a line of credit in the amount of $33,167.  Bank Loans  The Company refinanced its debt in 2013 with a New York commercial bank and there are currently a $1.25 million line of credit and a $1,200,000 mortgage outstanding. The line of credit calls for a variable interest rate of the Wall St. Journal published prime rate plus 1% and requires an annual review. The mortgage has a variable rate of LIBOR plus 4.25% and is for a 5 year term expiring in October of 2018. As of May 20, 2014, the Company is in technical violation of one of its bank covenants due to a reported 2013 fiscal loss. The Company is currently reviewing ways to remedy the broken covenant.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures pertaining to contingent assets and liabilities. Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies," to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to bad debts, inventories, income taxes, and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates.  We believe the following accounting policies and estimates are the most critical. Some of them involve significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions.  Revenue recognition  The Company recognizes revenue based on Account Standards Codification ("ASC")  Revenue is recognized at the date of service rendered to customers when a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the services rendered, no other significant obligations of the Company exist and collectability is reasonably assured. Payments received before satisfaction of all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as unearned revenue.  Income taxes  Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.  The Company applied the provisions of ASC 740-10-50, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes", which provides clarification related to the process associated with accounting for uncertain tax positions recognized in our financial statements. Audit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed. The completion of review or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the Company's liability for income taxes. Any such adjustment could be material to the Company's results of operations for any given quarterly or annual period based, in part, upon the results of operations for the given period. At December 31, 2013, management considered that the Company had no uncertain tax positions, and will continue to evaluate for uncertain positions in the future.  Fair values of financial instruments  The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for current assets and currently liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments. The carrying amount of long-term loans approximates fair value since the interest rate associated with the debt approximates the current market interest rate.  The Company adopted ASC 820-10, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures", which establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value and a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements for both financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities. This standard defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. This standard does not require any new fair value measurements, but discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flows) and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). For purposes of ASC 820-10-15, nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities would include all assets and liabilities other than those meeting the definition of a financial asset or financial liability as defined in ASC-820-10-15-15-1A.  Stock-based compensation  The Company records stock-based compensation at fair value of the stock provided for services. The Company currently does not have any issued and outstanding stock options or other derivatives.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-02, "Receivables (Topic 310) A Creditor's Determination of Whether a Restructuring Is a Troubled Debt Restructuring". The update clarifies the guidance on a creditor's evaluation of whether it has granted a concession as well as clarifying the guidance when a creditor's evaluation of whether a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties. The guidance clarifies when a Company should record impairment due to concessions or the financial difficulties of the debtor. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods ending after June 15, 2011. The guidance should be applied retrospectively to restructurings occurring on or after the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The adoption did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.  In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-03, "Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860) Reconsideration of Effective Control for Repurchase Agreements". ASU 2011-03 applies to transactions where the seller transfers financial assets that both entitle and obligate the transferor to repurchase or redeem the financial assets before their maturity. The amendments in this guidance remove from the assessment of effective control the criteria requiring the transferor to have the ability to repurchase or redeem the financial assets on substantially the agreed terms even in the event of default by the transferee and the collateral maintenance guidance related to that criterion. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods ending after December 15, 2011 and should be applied on a prospective basis. The adoption does not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.  In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, "Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS". The amendment results in a consistent definition of fair value and ensures the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS"). This amendment changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for Level 3 fair value measurements. This amendment will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2012. Based on current operations, the adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.  In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2011-05, "Comprehensive Income (Topic 220), and Presentation of Comprehensive Income". ASU 2011-05 amends the presentation of other comprehensive income and the Statement of Consolidated Operations. Under this amendment, entities will be required to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. Regardless of which reporting option is selected, the Company is required to present on the face of the financial statements, reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statements where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented. The current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity has been eliminated. This amendment will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2012 and full retrospective application is required. The Company does not anticipate that this amendment will have a material impact on its financial statements.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Sterling Consolidated Corp Announces Initial Orders for Its Latest Product
 


















Neptune, NJ -- (ReleaseWire) -- 10/25/2016 --Sterling Consolidated Corp (OTCPK:STCC), the parent company of Sterling Seal & Supply Inc., a distributor of custom molded rubber components, o-rings, gaskets, and seals, is pleased to announce today the company has filled its first two orders for "Bungs", a new product for the beer and wine barrel manufacturing industry.

Bungs are made of FDA and medical grade certified synthetic silicone that can seal wine and beer barrels more efficiently. More wine and beer barrel manufacturing companies are turning to alternative stoppers to provide more efficient sealing for their products.

"The market opportunity for this product is unbelievable," said Chairman Angelo DeRosa. "We've basically been cold calling wine barrel manufacturers, but now we're going to make brochures and generate a strategic marketing plan to really move the product."

The two orders of bungs equate to 1050 pieces or 525 barrels. The company does have a third order pending and upon finalization of that order, bungs will be in 540 barrels, bringing in $3500 in sales for the company thus far.

"Our goal for next year is to generate $800,000 to $1,000,000 in sales," said Chairman Angelo DeRosa. "We would rather ten accounts with less numbers than one account with a huge number."

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling
security holders. All of the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock will
go to the selling security holders. We have agreed to bear the expenses 
relating to the registration of the common stock for the selling security 
holders.


Rubber is the raw material that we are dependent on in our business. In order to
compete in the US, a supplier must import from China. This is due to the fact
that manufacturing rubber is a labor intensive project and labor costs are
significantly cheaper in China than they are in the United States.

There is a lot of competition in the US for seals and products that we
distribute. In order to establish competitive prices, we purchase large
quantities of product at a time. It would be too costly for smaller companies or
our customers to circumvent us by buying directly from the supplier because the
prices are much higher for smaller orders. Importation costs are also high and
add to the overall cost of the product.

This is a competitive advantage for us because we are a larger company that has
the cash and other resources that enables us to hold inventory at our warehouse.
This helps us maintain a competitive advantage because not only do we have the
ability of reducing our costs, we can also decrease the amount of time it takes
to deliver orders to our customers, provided that we have the product in our
warehouse. Stockpiling an inventory also requires capital. Currently, we have
over two million dollars in inventory to service our current customers’ demands.

For some of our customers, there is a cost incurred as a result of switching
from Sterling Seal as a supplier. Because Sterling Seal is an approved supplier
for many of our industrial and commercial customers, while other suppliers may
not be approved, our customers could face increased costs as a result of
switching to another supplier's product. For certain customers, in order to
switch from an approved supplier, the product must be tested and approved. In
the automotive industry the factories have to be audited and approved in
addition to the distributor and their products. Because of the potential for
increasing costs, our current customers are unlikely to abandon us.

In addition, many of our customers place small orders throughout the year. It
takes a long time to build the business to cover overhead costs. For this
reason, it is difficult for a supplier to enter into our industry. Most of
Sterling Seal’s accounts are repeat customers with consistent demands for
O-rings and custom-molded rubber.

Once we have the product in our warehouse, either if it is already in inventory
or if we just received the shipment of the product from China, the Company is
able to cost-effectively distribute products to local markets across the United
States within two (2) business days because we have established multiple
distribution factories over the course of our years of operating. This helps to
expedite deliveries and reduce costs. This also gives us an advantage over our
competitors. In addition, the vertical integration of our freight forwarding
business, Integrity, with our primary operations through Sterling Seal helps us
deliver products more cost-effectively.

We currently have relationships with domestic and international distributors.
The Company intends to increase sales through acquisitions and investing in
complementary corporations.


Company Description
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada as Oceanview Acquisition Corp on
January 31, 2011. On May 18, 2012, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to
change our name to Sterling Consolidated Corp. We are a holding company, and all
of our operations are conducted through our four subsidiaries:


 Sterling Seal &
Supply, Inc. (“Sterling Seal”), ADDR Properties, LLC (“ADDR”), Q5 Ventures, LLC
(“Q5”), and Integrity Cargo Freight Corporation (“Integrity”). In June 2012,
these four entities became subsidiaries of the Company through an Equity
Exchange Agreement by which the shareholders of Sterling Seal, ADDR, Q5, and
Integrity became shareholders of the Company and in exchange the Company
received all of the authorized and outstanding shares of Sterling Seal, ADDR,
Q5, and Integrity.

Sterling Consolidated Corp. conducts its entire business through its four
subsidiaries. Each subsidiary is responsible for a specific business function of
the Company. 

----

Our largest subsidiary is Sterling Seal & Supply, Inc. (“Sterling Seal”), a New
Jersey corporation which was incorporated in 1997. Its predecessor was Sterling
Plastic & Rubber Products, Inc., incorporated in New Jersey founded in 1970.
Sterling Seal engages primarily in the distribution and sale of O-rings, rubber
seals, oil seals, custom molded rubber parts, custom Teflon parts, Teflon rods,
O-ring cord, bonded seals, O-ring kits, and stuffing box sealant.

Sterling Seal is a distributor of O-rings. O-rings are one of the simplest, yet
most engineered, precise, and useful seal designs. They are one of the most
common and important elements of machine design. O-rings and the other products
that Sterling Seal sells are used in a wide variety of industries, including
automotive, pump, transmissions, oil and energy, machinery, and packaging. These
products are utilized primarily as seals to prevent leakage of liquids or air.
Most of the products carried by Sterling Seal are made of rubber, but some are
coated and the rubber compound can change upon customer request.

Sterling Seal sells directly to smaller distributors and original equipment
manufacturers in need of seals. It offers a catalogue of standard sizes, and
will take orders for special sizes not available in the standard catalogue. In
order to satisfy the needs of our customers and stay competitive, Sterling Seal
always maintains a wide variety of products in substantial quantities at its
main warehouse in Neptune, New Jersey, as well as its other facilities in the
United States. The products that we hold in inventory at our warehouse are
standard products that are most often ordered. If a customer orders a product
that is not in our inventory, we will have to order the product from one of our
suppliers in China.

We have approximately 3,300 customers that place orders with us for the delivery
of o-ring or similar products. Our largest customer is Freudenberg who sells
replacements kits to John Deer and Harley Davidson, among many other companies.
Other automotive customers are Precision International and Sonnax
Transmissions.  We stock a variety of rubber seals to service pool filter and
pump manufacturers.  We also distribute our products to many resellers of
replacement parts and pool stores.  Bay State Pool and Horizon Pool and Spa are
two of our larger accounts in the pool industry.

A large portion of our customer base services the plumbing and industrial
industries.  These accounts include, Fastenal, Kaman Industrial and Eastern
Industrial.  They are localized to service a wide range of products, but they
purchase O-Rings and rubber seals from Sterling.

Sterling Seal receives Requests for Quotations electronically and by fax daily
from its various customers. The sales force then reviews each request, and
responds with a “quoted” price for delivery and price. If such a quote is
accepted, the customer responds with a Purchase Order for a specific price and
delivery.

After a Purchase Order is accepted and we do not have the ordered product in our
inventory, we then contact one of our fifteen different suppliers. All of our
suppliers are located in China. In determining which suppliers to use, we look
for suppliers that deliver quality products in a timely manner. We do not have
any long term contracts with any of our suppliers. The following is the list of
our 10 largest principal suppliers:

 - Progum Elastomer Technology Co., Ltd.

 - Ivy Seals Group Corp.

 - Ge Mao Rubber Ind. Co.

 - Escort Seals

 - Rubber Best Industry Corp.

 - Wyatt Seal, Inc.

 - Best Ring Industrial

 - Supaseal Ltd.

 - Goodway Rubber Ind Co Ltd

 - AnySeals, Inc.

O-ring and rubber seals are generally considered commodities, meaning that such
goods are fungible and there is little if any distinction between the various
producers and suppliers of the products. None of the products sold by Sterling
Seal are under patent and there are no intellectual property or licensing
issues. Sterling Seal sets itself apart from other similarly situated companies
though the variety and quality of its inventory, the price point at which it
sells its various products, and its ability to deliver products to customers on
time. The time it takes us to deliver the ordered product to a customer will
mainly depend on whether we have it in inventory or need to order it from a
supplier in China. If we have it in inventory, we can package, ship and
distribute the product within two (2) business days.

When orders arrive at Sterling Seal, we ship the products to our customer and
invoice on a 45-day basis.

Integrity Cargo Freight Corporation

Our subsidiary, Integrity Cargo Freight Corporation (“Integrity”) is a freight
forwarding business. They are primarily responsible for transporting products we
order from our suppliers back to our warehouse in Neptune, NJ. After Sterling
Seal confirms from its supplier that a product is ready to be picked up,
Integrity Cargo is responsible for picking up the products and getting them to
the dock and delivered to the Sterling Seal warehouse.

Integrity shares a facility with Sterling Seal and manages the importation of
Sterling Seal’s products and its exports to various countries. Currently eighty
percent (80%) of Sterling Seal’s imports come from Asia, and ten percent (10%)
of the Company’s sales are exported to various countries. However, all payables
are billed and collected in USD, so Sterling does not bear any foreign exchange
risk on open payables.

We incorporated Integrity in order to vertically integrate our operations and
not have to rely on third parties to deliver our products from the supplier.
This has resulted in quicker delivery and more predictable delivery times.

This provides the Company with a competitive advantage over other importers of
O-rings and seals as we can utilize our own freight company and consolidate our
operations. As a result, the Company is able to provide lower prices to its
customers. This also provides us with a much greater level of control over our
shipping, which expedites lead times and deliveries to our customers.

Entering the freight forwarding market has provided the Company with a
competitive advantage as compared with other importing distributors of rubber
O-Rings. By having the ability to utilize our own freight company, we are able
to consolidate shipments from various sources and ship as frequently as needed,
which has resulted in improved efficiencies and delivery times.

Integrity also performs freight forwarding services for third party customers.
Integrity currently has about twenty (20) customers that it performs freight
forwarding services for. However, roughly fifty percent (50%) of its revenues
derive from freight forwarding for Sterling Seal.

Integrity shares a facility and certain overhead costs such as information
technology with Sterling Seal, so both entities have lower operational costs due
to economies of scale.

ADDR Properties, LLC.

ADDR Properties, LLC (“ADDR”) is one of our two subsidiaries that owns real
property. ADDR owns a 28,000 square foot facility in Neptune, NJ. Roughly ninety
percent (90%) of this property is used by Sterling Seal as its principal
executive office and primary warehouse. The remaining 3,000 square feet of this
facility is rented out to the Children’s Center of Monmouth. The current lease
agreement with the Children’s Center of Monmouth is for three (3) years at
$2,000 per month and expires in August 2014.

ADDR also owns another property in Cliffwood Beach, NJ (the “ADDR Property”),
which was Sterling Seal’s former principal office. It is currently being rented
out to four different tenants, who occupy about sixty-five percent (65%) of the
property. The remaining thirty-five percent (35%) of the property is currently
vacant, and ADDR is actively seeking out suitable tenants. Two of the four
tenants have oral contracts with ADDR and rent the property on a month to month
basis. Total rent received from the ADDR Property is $3,550 per month.

Q5 Ventures, LLC

Q5 Ventures, LLC owns a 5,000 square foot facility in Apopka, Florida, which is
used by Sterling Seal for its Florida operations. This facility was specifically
built for Sterling Seal’s operations. The lease is effective through January 1,
2013 and Sterling Seal pays Q5 rent in the amount of $5,000 per month.

----

Our principal executive office is located at 1105 Green Grove Road, Neptune, New
Jersey 07753, and our telephone number is (732) 918-8004. This facility is owned
by our subsidiary, ADDR, and also serves as the principal executive office for
each of our other subsidiaries.
