Quick Reference Guide


Liability

Negligence

Damages

Limitations




What is Liability?
Liability is when someone is legally responsible to another person because of his or her actions or failure to act. In a personal injury case there may be several parties who have a certain degree of liability or responsibility for the auto accident.


What is Negligence?
Negligence is when one party is careless in its duty to someone. For example, if a landlord doesn't repair a broken step and someone slips and falls, then the landlord was negligent. He had a duty to fix the step; he didn't fix it; someone fell and suffered damages because he didn't fix it. Negligence is often part of personal injury cases.


What are Considered Damages?
Damages is the legal word for the money an injured party has lost due to an injury. Those damages could be medical bills, prescriptions, time off from work, lengthy recovery time, and also pain and suffering. Most insurance policies only cover certain parts of the cost involved in common injuries like car accidents, slip and falls or workplace illnesses.


What is a Statute of Limitations?
The law limits the amount of time you can file a claim and collect damages for your auto accident. That law is called the Statute of Limitations. No matter how great your loss, you will not be able to collect if you miss this deadline. Your lawyer will know all the deadlines for your state. Putting a claim together can take time, so it's important to consult with a lawyer near you as soon as possible.

The Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) (Māori: Te Kaporeihana Āwhina Hunga Whara) is a New Zealand Crown entity responsible for administering the country's universal no-fault accidental injury scheme. The scheme provides financial compensation and support to citizens, residents, and temporary visitors who have suffered personal injuries.
The corporation was founded as the Accident Compensation Commission on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Accident Compensation Act 1972. Its principal governing act today is the Accident Compensation Act 2001.[1] As a Crown entity, ACC is responsible to a Cabinet Minister via its Board of Directors. Unlike most other Crown entities, it has its own dedicated ministerial portfolio, which since December 2016 has been held by Michael Woodhouse.

Features[edit]
ACC is the sole and compulsory provider of accident insurance in New Zealand for all work and non-work injuries. The corporation administers the ACC Scheme on a no-fault basis, so that anyone – regardless of the way in which they incurred an injury – has coverage under the Scheme. Due to the scheme's no-fault basis, people who have suffered personal injury do not have the right to sue an at-fault party, except for exemplary damages.[2]
The ACC scheme provides a range of entitlements to injured people; however 93.5 percent of new claims in 2011–12 were for treatment costs only. Other entitlements include weekly compensation for lost earnings (paid at a rate of 80% of a person's pre-injury earnings) and the cost of home or vehicle modifications for the seriously injured. The scheme offers entitlements subject to various eligibility criteria.
ACC works with trusted partners and communities to prevent injuries. These initiatives include, but are not limited to, RugbySmart with New Zealand Rugby[3], Ride Forever[4], Mates and Dates[5], and ‘Make Your Home a Safety Zone’ with Safekids[6].
History[edit]
ACC has its origins in the 1900 "Workers' Compensation Act" (Workers' Compensation for Accidents Act (1900)), which established a limited compensation scheme for workers who had suffered injuries where there was no directly responsible party. In 1967 a New Zealand Royal Commission, chaired by High Court judge Owen Woodhouse, recommended extending this compensation to cover all injuries on a no-fault basis. Following this report, on 1 April 1974 the New Zealand Government established the Accident Compensation Commission to implement the requirements of the 1972 Accident Compensation Act and the 1973 Amendments. The Act was later replaced by the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2001, which was renamed the "Accident Compensation Act 2001" in 2010. The Annual Report (1989/90) of the Accident Compensation Commission[7] proposed that the distinction between "accidents" (which are covered)[8] and "illness" (which is not) should be dropped. But this proposal was not taken up by the government. In 1992, the government renamed the Accident Compensation Commission as the "Accident Compensation Corporation".
From 1 July 1999, the Fourth National Government allowed private insurance operators to provide work-related accident insurance, and ACC was briefly exposed to competition. The Fifth Labour Government (elected in November 1999) repealed this change, and as of 1 July 2000 re-instated the ACC as the sole provider of accident insurance coverage.
Administration of levies[edit]
ACC is primarily funded through a combination of levies and government contributions. Income collected from each source goes into predetermined account based on the source. Costs relating to an injury are paid from one of these accounts based on the type and cause of the injury.
The four main accounts are: Work, Earners, Non-Earners, and Motor Vehicle. There is also a fifth account, Treatment Injury (formerly Medical Misadventure) that draws on both the Earners and Non-Earners account.[9][10]


Account
Covers
Income sources


Work
Work-related injuries
Levies collected from employers and self-employed people. The amount payable averages 0.72% of an employer's payroll or income earned (as of 1 April 2017); rates vary depending on the employer's industry and risks associated with it.


Earners
Non-work injuries by income earners
Levies collected in conjunction with tax deductions on income. Paid by employees through PAYE or by self-employed people directly. The amount payable is 1.21% of income earned (as of 1 April 2017).


Non-earners
Non-work injuries by non-income earners
(e.g. children, elderly, unemployed, visitors)
Government contribution from the general taxation pool.


Motor Vehicle
Injuries relating to motor vehicles on public roads
Levies included in the price of petrol (not diesel or LPG), and through motor vehicle license fees. Levies average $113.94 (GST exclusive) per vehicle per year (as of July 2017), with motorcycles and heavy vehicles paying more than average due to the increased likelihood of injury associated with these modes of transport; the petrol levy set at 6c per litre (GST exclusive).


Treatment Injury
Injuries as a result of medical treatment
Funded from the Earners and Non-Earners accounts, depending on the clients' employment status.


ACC for the self-employed – ACC Coverplus Extra[edit]
ACC Coverplus Extra was introduced by ACC to provide cover for self-employed workers and business owners that would fail to otherwise be covered adequately by the standard ACC Cover Plus policy. It works by paying an agreed level of compensation, in the event of an injury resulting in time off from work.[11]
With this cover already agreed upon any business would not have to prove loss of income and has certainty on their amount of cover in the event of an accident injury. ACC Cover Plus policy was designed to cover employees and would only pay 80% of the net taxable income. With ACC Cover Plus Extra a self-employed contractor would get 100% of the pre-agreed compensation cover until one was fit for full-time work. A business owner would be able to get compensation under ACC Cover Plus Extra even if the business continued to earn income whilst the business owner was off work injured. This would not be possible with the standard policy.[11]
Funding[edit]




ACC offices in Palmerston North


ACC initially had a "pay-as-you-go" funding model which collected "only enough levies during the year to cover the cost of claims for that particular year". In 1999 a "fully funded" model was adopted whereby sufficient levies were collected to cover the lifetime cost of each injury – which might require compensation over a period of 30 years or more.[9] However, getting ACC onto a strong financial footing was not easy and in 2009, ACC posted a $4.8 billion loss – described as the biggest corporate loss in New Zealand's history. This cost escalation is thought to have been due to an increase in the number of claims, a widening of entitlements and increased costs of meeting the claims.[12] Another factor was physiotherapy services being made free at the point of delivery leading to over-servicing of clients.[13] Between 2000 and 2008 this appears to have contributed to an increase in physiotherapy costs of 214%.[14]
The 100% reimbursement scheme for physiotherapist services was ended and ACC levies on wages and motorists were increased.[15] ACC chairman John Judge told the Sunday Star-Times that it was going to take a "hard-nosed" approach to get ACC into a sustainable position. This would require "substantial" levy increases and "legislative change to get people off the scheme and back to work quicker".[12] By 2012, ACC had made good progress towards its 2019-goal (of being fully funded), and was $4.5 billion short of matching liabilities ($28.5b) with its assets ($24b).[16]
Towards the end of 2012, ACC Minister Judith Collins announced that Government would not cut ACC levies for the 2013–14 year. While the ACC Board and Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment had recommended reducing the levies by between 12 and 17 per cent, Collins stated that the government's decision was motivated by the uncertain economic conditions and a desire to ensure that reductions to the levy were sustainable. Andrew Little, the Labour Party's ACC spokesman, criticised this decision, claiming that it was driven by the government's attempt to bring the budget into surplus and reducing the levy would provide a boost to the economy.[17] In the 2013 budget, Collins announced a $1.3 billion cut in ACC levies over the next two years. Collins said the Earners and Workers accounts were now fully funded after the Corporation reduced the number of long term ACC claimants from 14,000 to less than 11,000.[18]
In 2015/16, ACC’s outstanding claims liability (OCL) increased by $6.4 billion, which lead to a net deficit of $3.4 billion. The OCL measures the future cost of all existing ACC claims. That year also saw 1.93 million claims accepted; a 5.2% increase from the previous year. $3.5 billion was paid out to all new and existing claims.[19]
There has been some conjecture over whether or not ACC staff were paid incentives to remove long term clients off weekly compensation. This was refuted by Ex-CEO Ralph Stewart in 2012. That year there were 10,400 long-term claimants registered with ACC – down by over 1,000.[20]
Notable events[edit]
Violence against staff[edit]
In some cases ACC clients have threatened or attempted to harm ACC staff members. In 1999, a staff member was fatally stabbed by a claimant at an ACC office in Henderson.[21] In 2010 ACC logos were removed from company vehicles after several staff were "rammed or driven off the road by other drivers". The following year a threat against former chief executive Ralph Stewart led to a decision for security staff to be posted outside his home. There have been at least two threats to blow up a car bomb outside ACC offices and police have had to be called on several other occasions. In 2012, there were a total of 134 recorded threats made against staff - the majority against case managers "making difficult decisions" on clients' cases.[22]
Client fraud[edit]
In 2013, it was reported that 64 people have been convicted of defrauding ACC of a total of more than $10 million over the past four years. This includes clients claiming they were "injured" but who kept working while receiving ACC benefits and medical practitioners who billed ACC for more treatment than they actually provided. Another category of ACC fraudster includes widows who continued claiming payments after their (injured) partners have subsequently died. Sometimes these payments went on for nearly 30 years before the fraud came to light – with one woman receiving nearly $150,000 after her husband had died.[23]
Staff fraud[edit]
There have been a number of cases where ACC staff have defrauded the corporation. Jeffrey Chapman, former ACC chief executive from 1985 to 1992, was imprisoned for defrauding ACC and other government agencies; Gavin Robbins, his successor from 1993 to 1997, was also charged with fraud but was acquitted.[24] In 2011, a senior manager was convicted of dishonesty offences involving property leased to ACC by private business interests.[25] In late 2012, Jonathan Wright, an ACC-contracted medical assessor, was convicted of dishonestly obtaining over $18,000 in falsified travel expenses from ACC.[26]
Treatment Injury claims[edit]
Medical misadventure claims were re-labelled as Treatment Injury claims (TI) in 2005. A treatment injury is when an injury is caused by treatment provided by a registered health professional. These injuries are not a necessary part or ordinary consequence of the treatment.[27]
Bronwyn Pullar privacy breach[edit]
ACC has had a number of breaches of privacy relating to claimants. The most significant occurred in 2011 after the release of details of 6700 claimants to an ACC claimant, Bronwyn Pullar. Pullar had been battling ACC since suffering a head injury in 2002—and had 45 separate complaints against the agency—only one of which was about the privacy breaches.[28] In 2011 she and former National Party president Michelle Boag, had a meeting with two senior ACC managers to discuss her concerns. ACC referred the matter to the police claiming Pullar had threatened to go to the media about the privacy breaches if she didn't get what she wanted. The police listened to a tape recording of the meeting and decided there was no case to answer.[29][30]
In March 2012, ACC Minister Nick Smith resigned from Cabinet after it was revealed that he had written letters on behalf of Pullar, who was a personal friend of his, while he was ACC Minister.[31]
ACC chairman John Judge continued to insist his version of events was correct and as a result ACC Minister Judith Collins did not renew his tenure on the ACC Board. The chief executive of ACC, Ralph Stewart, also resigned the next day.[32] Three other Board members – Murray Hilder, Rob Campbell and John McCliskie – also resigned.[33]
The fallout from the affair continued in May 2012, when Collins sued Labour MPs Trevor Mallard and Andrew Little for defamation over comments they made on Radio New Zealand broadcasts linking her to the leak of an email from Michelle Boag following the release of the files.[34] The case was settled after a High Court hearing in November 2012.[35]
An independent review of ACC was conducted towards the end of 2012 and found the organisation "lacked a comprehensive strategy for protecting and managing claimants' information" and said ACC had an "almost cavalier" attitude toward its clients. The review showed that the culture within ACC enabled its staff to target clients involved in privacy breaches and complaints rather than demonstrating respect for claimants. In 2013, a training Academy for staff was mooted with an "emphasis on a client-centred approach".[36]

Other entitlements include weekly compensation for lost earnings (paid at a rate of 80% of a person's pre-injury earnings) and the cost of home or vehicle modifications for the seriously injured. The scheme offers entitlements subject to various eligibility criteria.
ACC works with trusted partners and communities to prevent injuries. These initiatives include, but are not limited to, RugbySmart with New Zealand Rugby[3], Ride Forever[4], Mates and Dates[5], and ‘Make Your Home a Safety Zone’ with Safekids[6].
History[edit]
ACC has its origins in the 1900 "Workers' Compensation Act" (Workers' Compensation for Accidents Act (1900)), which established a limited compensation scheme for workers who had suffered injuries where there was no directly responsible party. In 1967 a New Zealand Royal Commission, chaired by High Court judge Owen Woodhouse, recommended extending this compensation to cover all injuries on a no-fault basis. Following this report, on 1 April 1974 the New Zealand Government established the Accident Compensation Commission to implement the requirements of the 1972 Accident Compensation Act and the 1973 Amendments. The Act was later replaced by the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2001, which was renamed the "Accident Compensation Act 2001" in 2010. The Annual Report (1989/90) of the Accident Compensation Commission[7] proposed that the distinction between "accidents" (which are covered)[8] and "illness" (which is not) should be dropped. But this proposal was not taken up by the government. In 1992, the government renamed the Accident Compensation Commission as the "Accident Compensation Corporation".
From 1 July 1999, the Fourth National Government allowed private insurance operators to provide work-related accident insurance, and ACC was briefly exposed to competition. The Fifth Labour Government (elected in November 1999) repealed this change, and as of 1 July 2000 re-instated the ACC as the sole provider of accident insurance coverage.
Administration of levies[edit]
ACC is primarily funded through a combination of levies and government contributions. Income collected from each source goes into predetermined account based on the source. Costs relating to an injury are paid from one of these accounts based on the type and cause of the injury.
The four main accounts are: Work, Earners, Non-Earners, and Motor Vehicle. There is also a fifth account, Treatment Injury (formerly Medical Misadventure) that draws on both the Earners and Non-Earners account.[9][10]

Covers
Income sources


Work
Work-related injuries
Levies collected from employers and self-employed people. The amount payable averages 0.72% of an employer's payroll or income earned (as of 1 April 2017); rates vary depending on the employer's industry and risks associated with it.


Earners
Non-work injuries by income earners
Levies collected in conjunction with tax deductions on income. Paid by employees through PAYE or by self-employed people directly. The amount payable is 1.21% of income earned (as of 1 April 2017).


Non-earners
Non-work injuries by non-income earners
(e.g. children, elderly, unemployed, visitors)
Government contribution from the general taxation pool.


Motor Vehicle
Injuries relating to motor vehicles on public roads
Levies included in the price of petrol (not diesel or LPG), and through motor vehicle license fees. Levies average $113.94 (GST exclusive) per vehicle per year (as of July 2017), with motorcycles and heavy vehicles paying more than average due to the increased likelihood of injury associated with these modes of transport; the petrol levy set at 6c per litre (GST exclusive).


Treatment Injury
Injuries as a result of medical treatment
Funded from the Earners and Non-Earners accounts, depending on the clients' employment status.


ACC for the self-employed – ACC Coverplus Extra[edit]
ACC Coverplus Extra was introduced by ACC to provide cover for self-employed workers and business owners that would fail to otherwise be covered adequately by the standard ACC Cover Plus policy. It works by paying an agreed level of compensation, in the event of an injury resulting in time off from work.[11]
With this cover already agreed upon any business would not have to prove loss of income and has certainty on their amount of cover in the event of an accident injury. ACC Cover Plus policy was designed to cover employees and would only pay 80% of the net taxable income. With ACC Cover Plus Extra a self-employed contractor would get 100% of the pre-agreed compensation cover until one was fit for full-time work. A business owner would be able to get compensation under ACC Cover Plus Extra even if the business continued to earn income whilst the business owner was off work injured. This would not be possible with the standard policy.[11]
Funding[edit]




ACC offices in Palmerston North


ACC initially had a "pay-as-you-go" funding model which collected "only enough levies during the year to cover the cost of claims for that particular year". In 1999 a "fully funded" model was adopted whereby sufficient levies were collected to cover the lifetime cost of each injury – which might require compensation over a period of 30 years or more.[9] However, getting ACC onto a strong financial footing was not easy and in 2009, ACC posted a $4.8 billion loss – described as the biggest corporate loss in New Zealand's history. This cost escalation is thought to have been due to an increase in the number of claims, a widening of entitlements and increased costs of meeting the claims.[12] Another factor was physiotherapy services being made free at the point of delivery leading to over-servicing of clients.[13] Between 2000 and 2008 this appears to have contributed to an increase in physiotherapy costs of 214%.[14]
The 100% reimbursement scheme for physiotherapist services was ended and ACC levies on wages and motorists were increased.[15] ACC chairman John Judge told the Sunday Star-Times that it was going to take a "hard-nosed" approach to get ACC into a sustainable position. This would require "substantial" levy increases and "legislative change to get people off the scheme and back to work quicker".[12] By 2012, ACC had made good progress towards its 2019-goal (of being fully funded), and was $4.5 billion short of matching liabilities ($28.5b) with its assets ($24b).[16]
Towards the end of 2012, ACC Minister Judith Collins announced that Government would not cut ACC levies for the 2013–14 year. While the ACC Board and Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment had recommended reducing the levies by between 12 and 17 per cent, Collins stated that the government's decision was motivated by the uncertain economic conditions and a desire to ensure that reductions to the levy were sustainable. Andrew Little, the Labour Party's ACC spokesman, criticised this decision, claiming that it was driven by the government's attempt to bring the budget into surplus and reducing the levy would provide a boost to the economy.[17] In the 2013 budget, Collins announced a $1.3 billion cut in ACC levies over the next two years. Collins said the Earners and Workers accounts were now fully funded after the Corporation reduced the number of long term ACC claimants from 14,000 to less than 11,000.[18]
In 2015/16, ACC’s outstanding claims liability (OCL) increased by $6.4 billion, which lead to a net deficit of $3.4 billion. The OCL measures the future cost of all existing ACC claims. That year also saw 1.93 million claims accepted; a 5.2% increase from the previous year. $3.5 billion was paid out to all new and existing claims.[19]
There has been some conjecture over whether or not ACC staff were paid incentives to remove long term clients off weekly compensation. This was refuted by Ex-CEO Ralph Stewart in 2012. That year there were 10,400 long-term claimants registered with ACC – down by over 1,000.[20]
Notable events[edit]
Violence against staff[edit]
In some cases ACC clients have threatened or attempted to harm ACC staff members. In 1999, a staff member was fatally stabbed by a claimant at an ACC office in Henderson.[21] In 2010 ACC logos were removed from company vehicles after several staff were "rammed or driven off the road by other drivers". The following year a threat against former chief executive Ralph Stewart led to a decision for security staff to be posted outside his home. There have been at least two threats to blow up a car bomb outside ACC offices and police have had to be called on several other occasions. In 2012, there were a total of 134 recorded threats made against staff - the majority against case managers "making difficult decisions" on clients' cases.[22]
Client fraud[edit]
In 2013, it was reported that 64 people have been convicted of defrauding ACC of a total of more than $10 million over the past four years. This includes clients claiming they were "injured" but who kept working while receiving ACC benefits and medical practitioners who billed ACC for more treatment than they actually provided. Another category of ACC fraudster includes widows who continued claiming payments after their (injured) partners have subsequently died. Sometimes these payments went on for nearly 30 years before the fraud came to light – with one woman receiving nearly $150,000 after her husband had died.[23]
Staff fraud[edit]
There have been a number of cases where ACC staff have defrauded the corporation. Jeffrey Chapman, former ACC chief executive from 1985 to 1992, was imprisoned for defrauding ACC and other government agencies; Gavin Robbins, his successor from 1993 to 1997, was also charged with fraud but was acquitted.[24] In 2011, a senior manager was convicted of dishonesty offences involving property leased to ACC by private business interests.[25] In late 2012, Jonathan Wright, an ACC-contracted medical assessor, was convicted of dishonestly obtaining over $18,000 in falsified travel expenses from ACC.[26]
Treatment Injury claims[edit]
Medical misadventure claims were re-labelled as Treatment Injury claims (TI) in 2005. A treatment injury is when an injury is caused by treatment provided by a registered health professional. These injuries are not a necessary part or ordinary consequence of the treatment.[27]
Bronwyn Pullar privacy breach[edit]
ACC has had a number of breaches of privacy relating to claimants. The most significant occurred in 2011 after the release of details of 6700 claimants to an ACC claimant, Bronwyn Pullar. Pullar had been battling ACC since suffering a head injury in 2002—and had 45 separate complaints against the agency—only one of which was about the privacy breaches.[28] In 2011 she and former National Party president Michelle Boag, had a meeting with two senior ACC managers to discuss her concerns. ACC referred the matter to the police claiming Pullar had threatened to go to the media about the privacy breaches if she didn't get what she wanted. The police listened to a tape recording of the meeting and decided there was no case to answer.[29][30]
In March 2012, ACC Minister Nick Smith resigned from Cabinet after it was revealed that he had written letters on behalf of Pullar, who was a personal friend of his, while he was ACC Minister.[31]
ACC chairman John Judge continued to insist his version of events was correct and as a result ACC Minister Judith Collins did not renew his tenure on the ACC Board. The chief executive of ACC, Ralph Stewart, also resigned the next day.[32] Three other Board members – Murray Hilder, Rob Campbell and John McCliskie – also resigned.[33]
The fallout from the affair continued in May 2012, when Collins sued Labour MPs Trevor Mallard and Andrew Little for defamation over comments they made on Radio New Zealand broadcasts linking her to the leak of an email from Michelle Boag following the release of the files.[34] The case was settled after a High Court hearing in November 2012.[35]
An independent review of ACC was conducted towards the end of 2012 and found the organisation "lacked a comprehensive strategy for protecting and managing claimants' information" and said ACC had an "almost cavalier" attitude toward its clients. The review showed that the culture within ACC enabled its staff to target clients involved in privacy breaches and complaints rather than demonstrating respect for claimants. In 2013, a training Academy for staff was mooted with an "emphasis on a client-centred approach".[36]

The Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) (Māori: Te Kaporeihana Āwhina Hunga Whara) is a New Zealand Crown entity responsible for administering the country's universal no-fault accidental injury scheme. The scheme provides financial compensation and support to citizens, residents, and temporary visitors who have suffered personal injuries.
The corporation was founded as the Accident Compensation Commission on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Accident Compensation Act 1972. Its principal governing act today is the Accident Compensation Act 2001.[1] As a Crown entity, ACC is responsible to a Cabinet Minister via its Board of Directors. Unlike most other Crown entities, it has its own dedicated ministerial portfolio, which since December 2016 has been held by Michael Woodhouse.

Features[edit]
ACC is the sole and compulsory provider of accident insurance in New Zealand for all work and non-work injuries. The corporation administers the ACC Scheme on a no-fault basis, so that anyone – regardless of the way in which they incurred an injury – has coverage under the Scheme. Due to the scheme's no-fault basis, people who have suffered personal injury do not have the right to sue an at-fault party, except for exemplary damages.[2]
The ACC scheme provides a range of entitlements to injured people; however 93.5 percent of new claims in 2011–12 were for treatment costs only. Other entitlements include weekly compensation for lost earnings (paid at a rate of 80% of a person's pre-injury earnings) and the cost of home or vehicle modifications for the seriously injured. The scheme offers entitlements subject to various eligibility criteria.
ACC works with trusted partners and communities to prevent injuries. These initiatives include, but are not limited to, RugbySmart with New Zealand Rugby[3], Ride Forever[4], Mates and Dates[5], and ‘Make Your Home a Safety Zone’ with Safekids[6].
History[edit]
ACC has its origins in the 1900 "Workers' Compensation Act" (Workers' Compensation for Accidents Act (1900)), which established a limited compensation scheme for workers who had suffered injuries where there was no directly responsible party. In 1967 a New Zealand Royal Commission, chaired by High Court judge Owen Woodhouse, recommended extending this compensation to cover all injuries on a no-fault basis. Following this report, on 1 April 1974 the New Zealand Government established the Accident Compensation Commission to implement the requirements of the 1972 Accident Compensation Act and the 1973 Amendments. The Act was later replaced by the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2001, which was renamed the "Accident Compensation Act 2001" in 2010. The Annual Report (1989/90) of the Accident Compensation Commission[7] proposed that the distinction between "accidents" (which are covered)[8] and "illness" (which is not) should be dropped. But this proposal was not taken up by the government. In 1992, the government renamed the Accident Compensation Commission as the "Accident Compensation Corporation".
From 1 July 1999, the Fourth National Government allowed private insurance operators to provide work-related accident insurance, and ACC was briefly exposed to competition. The Fifth Labour Government (elected in November 1999) repealed this change, and as of 1 July 2000 re-instated the ACC as the sole provider of accident insurance coverage.
Administration of levies[edit]
ACC is primarily funded through a combination of levies and government contributions. Income collected from each source goes into predetermined account based on the source. Costs relating to an injury are paid from one of these accounts based on the type and cause of the injury.
The four main accounts are: Work, Earners, Non-Earners, and Motor Vehicle. There is also a fifth account, Treatment Injury (formerly Medical Misadventure) that draws on both the Earners and Non-Earners account.[9][10]

ACC for the self-employed – ACC Coverplus Extra[edit]
ACC Coverplus Extra was introduced by ACC to provide cover for self-employed workers and business owners that would fail to otherwise be covered adequately by the standard ACC Cover Plus policy. It works by paying an agreed level of compensation, in the event of an injury resulting in time off from work.[11]
With this cover already agreed upon any business would not have to prove loss of income and has certainty on their amount of cover in the event of an accident injury. ACC Cover Plus policy was designed to cover employees and would only pay 80% of the net taxable income. With ACC Cover Plus Extra a self-employed contractor would get 100% of the pre-agreed compensation cover until one was fit for full-time work. A business owner would be able to get compensation under ACC Cover Plus Extra even if the business continued to earn income whilst the business owner was off work injured. This would not be possible with the standard policy.[11]
Funding[edit]




ACC offices in Palmerston North


ACC initially had a "pay-as-you-go" funding model which collected "only enough levies during the year to cover the cost of claims for that particular year". In 1999 a "fully funded" model was adopted whereby sufficient levies were collected to cover the lifetime cost of each injury – which might require compensation over a period of 30 years or more.[9] However, getting ACC onto a strong financial footing was not easy and in 2009, ACC posted a $4.8 billion loss – described as the biggest corporate loss in New Zealand's history. This cost escalation is thought to have been due to an increase in the number of claims, a widening of entitlements and increased costs of meeting the claims.[12] Another factor was physiotherapy services being made free at the point of delivery leading to over-servicing of clients.[13] Between 2000 and 2008 this appears to have contributed to an increase in physiotherapy costs of 214%.[14]
The 100% reimbursement scheme for physiotherapist services was ended and ACC levies on wages and motorists were increased.[15] ACC chairman John Judge told the Sunday Star-Times that it was going to take a "hard-nosed" approach to get ACC into a sustainable position. This would require "substantial" levy increases and "legislative change to get people off the scheme and back to work quicker".[12] By 2012, ACC had made good progress towards its 2019-goal (of being fully funded), and was $4.5 billion short of matching liabilities ($28.5b) with its assets ($24b).[16]
Towards the end of 2012, ACC Minister Judith Collins announced that Government would not cut ACC levies for the 2013–14 year. While the ACC Board and Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment had recommended reducing the levies by between 12 and 17 per cent, Collins stated that the government's decision was motivated by the uncertain economic conditions and a desire to ensure that reductions to the levy were sustainable. Andrew Little, the Labour Party's ACC spokesman, criticised this decision, claiming that it was driven by the government's attempt to bring the budget into surplus and reducing the levy would provide a boost to the economy.[17] In the 2013 budget, Collins announced a $1.3 billion cut in ACC levies over the next two years. Collins said the Earners and Workers accounts were now fully funded after the Corporation reduced the number of long term ACC claimants from 14,000 to less than 11,000.[18]
In 2015/16, ACC’s outstanding claims liability (OCL) increased by $6.4 billion, which lead to a net deficit of $3.4 billion. The OCL measures the future cost of all existing ACC claims. That year also saw 1.93 million claims accepted; a 5.2% increase from the previous year. $3.5 billion was paid out to all new and existing claims.[19]
There has been some conjecture over whether or not ACC staff were paid incentives to remove long term clients off weekly compensation. This was refuted by Ex-CEO Ralph Stewart in 2012. That year there were 10,400 long-term claimants registered with ACC – down by over 1,000.[20]
Notable events[edit]
Violence against staff[edit]
In some cases ACC clients have threatened or attempted to harm ACC staff members. In 1999, a staff member was fatally stabbed by a claimant at an ACC office in Henderson.[21] In 2010 ACC logos were removed from company vehicles after several staff were "rammed or driven off the road by other drivers". The following year a threat against former chief executive Ralph Stewart led to a decision for security staff to be posted outside his home. There have been at least two threats to blow up a car bomb outside ACC offices and police have had to be called on several other occasions. In 2012, there were a total of 134 recorded threats made against staff - the majority against case managers "making difficult decisions" on clients' cases.[22]
Client fraud[edit]
In 2013, it was reported that 64 people have been convicted of defrauding ACC of a total of more than $10 million over the past four years. This includes clients claiming they were "injured" but who kept working while receiving ACC benefits and medical practitioners who billed ACC for more treatment than they actually provided. Another category of ACC fraudster includes widows who continued claiming payments after their (injured) partners have subsequently died. Sometimes these payments went on for nearly 30 years before the fraud came to light – with one woman receiving nearly $150,000 after her husband had died.[23]
Staff fraud[edit]
There have been a number of cases where ACC staff have defrauded the corporation. Jeffrey Chapman, former ACC chief executive from 1985 to 1992, was imprisoned for defrauding ACC and other government agencies; Gavin Robbins, his successor from 1993 to 1997, was also charged with fraud but was acquitted.[24] In 2011, a senior manager was convicted of dishonesty offences involving property leased to ACC by private business interests.[25] In late 2012, Jonathan Wright, an ACC-contracted medical assessor, was convicted of dishonestly obtaining over $18,000 in falsified travel expenses from ACC.[26]
Treatment Injury claims[edit]
Medical misadventure claims were re-labelled as Treatment Injury claims (TI) in 2005. A treatment injury is when an injury is caused by treatment provided by a registered health professional. These injuries are not a necessary part or ordinary consequence of the treatment.[27]
Bronwyn Pullar privacy breach[edit]
ACC has had a number of breaches of privacy relating to claimants. The most significant occurred in 2011 after the release of details of 6700 claimants to an ACC claimant, Bronwyn Pullar. Pullar had been battling ACC since suffering a head injury in 2002—and had 45 separate complaints against the agency—only one of which was about the privacy breaches.[28] In 2011 she and former National Party president Michelle Boag, had a meeting with two senior ACC managers to discuss her concerns. ACC referred the matter to the police claiming Pullar had threatened to go to the media about the privacy breaches if she didn't get what she wanted. The police listened to a tape recording of the meeting and decided there was no case to answer.[29][30]
In March 2012, ACC Minister Nick Smith resigned from Cabinet after it was revealed that he had written letters on behalf of Pullar, who was a personal friend of his, while he was ACC Minister.[31]
ACC chairman John Judge continued to insist his version of events was correct and as a result ACC Minister Judith Collins did not renew his tenure on the ACC Board. The chief executive of ACC, Ralph Stewart, also resigned the next day.[32] Three other Board members – Murray Hilder, Rob Campbell and John McCliskie – also resigned.[33]
The fallout from the affair continued in May 2012, when Collins sued Labour MPs Trevor Mallard and Andrew Little for defamation over comments they made on Radio New Zealand broadcasts linking her to the leak of an email from Michelle Boag following the release of the files.[34] The case was settled after a High Court hearing in November 2012.[35]
An independent review of ACC was conducted towards the end of 2012 and found the organisation "lacked a comprehensive strategy for protecting and managing claimants' information" and said ACC had an "almost cavalier" attitude toward its clients. The review showed that the culture within ACC enabled its staff to target clients involved in privacy breaches and complaints rather than demonstrating respect for claimants. In 2013, a training Academy for staff was mooted with an "emphasis on a client-centred approach".[36]

The Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) (Māori: Te Kaporeihana Āwhina Hunga Whara) is a New Zealand Crown entity responsible for administering the country's universal no-fault accidental injury scheme. The scheme provides financial compensation and support to citizens, residents, and temporary visitors who have suffered personal injuries.
The corporation was founded as the Accident Compensation Commission on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Accident Compensation Act 1972. Its principal governing act today is the Accident Compensation Act 2001.[1] As a Crown entity, ACC is responsible to a Cabinet Minister via its Board of Directors. Unlike most other Crown entities, it has its own dedicated ministerial portfolio, which since December 2016 has been held by Michael Woodhouse.

Features[edit]
ACC is the sole and compulsory provider of accident insurance in New Zealand for all work and non-work injuries. The corporation administers the ACC Scheme on a no-fault basis, so that anyone – regardless of the way in which they incurred an injury – has coverage under the Scheme. Due to the scheme's no-fault basis, people who have suffered personal injury do not have the right to sue an at-fault party, except for exemplary damages.[2]
The ACC scheme provides a range of entitlements to injured people; however 93.5 percent of new claims in 2011–12 were for treatment costs only. Other entitlements include weekly compensation for lost earnings (paid at a rate of 80% of a person's pre-injury earnings) and the cost of home or vehicle modifications for the seriously injured. The scheme offers entitlements subject to various eligibility criteria.
ACC works with trusted partners and communities to prevent injuries. These initiatives include, but are not limited to, RugbySmart with New Zealand Rugby[3], Ride Forever[4], Mates and Dates[5], and ‘Make Your Home a Safety Zone’ with Safekids[6].
History[edit]
ACC has its origins in the 1900 "Workers' Compensation Act" (Workers' Compensation for Accidents Act (1900)), which established a limited compensation scheme for workers who had suffered injuries where there was no directly responsible party. In 1967 a New Zealand Royal Commission, chaired by High Court judge Owen Woodhouse, recommended extending this compensation to cover all injuries on a no-fault basis. Following this report, on 1 April 1974 the New Zealand Government established the Accident Compensation Commission to implement the requirements of the 1972 Accident Compensation Act and the 1973 Amendments. The Act was later replaced by the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2001, which was renamed the "Accident Compensation Act 2001" in 2010. The Annual Report (1989/90) of the Accident Compensation Commission[7] proposed that the distinction between "accidents" (which are covered)[8] and "illness" (which is not) should be dropped. But this proposal was not taken up by the government. In 1992, the government renamed the Accident Compensation Commission as the "Accident Compensation Corporation".
From 1 July 1999, the Fourth National Government allowed private insurance operators to provide work-related accident insurance, and ACC was briefly exposed to competition. The Fifth Labour Government (elected in November 1999) repealed this change, and as of 1 July 2000 re-instated the ACC as the sole provider of accident insurance coverage.
Administration of levies[edit]
ACC is primarily funded through a combination of levies and government contributions. Income collected from each source goes into predetermined account based on the source. Costs relating to an injury are paid from one of these accounts based on the type and cause of the injury.
The four main accounts are: Work, Earners, Non-Earners, and Motor Vehicle. There is also a fifth account, Treatment Injury (formerly Medical Misadventure) that draws on both the Earners and Non-Earners account.[9][10]


Account
Covers
Income sources


Work
Work-related injuries
Levies collected from employers and self-employed people. The amount payable averages 0.72% of an employer's payroll or income earned (as of 1 April 2017); rates vary depending on the employer's industry and risks associated with it.


Earners
Non-work injuries by income earners
Levies collected in conjunction with tax deductions on income. Paid by employees through PAYE or by self-employed people directly. The amount payable is 1.21% of income earned (as of 1 April 2017).


Non-earners
Non-work injuries by non-income earners
(e.g. children, elderly, unemployed, visitors)
Government contribution from the general taxation pool.


Motor Vehicle
Injuries relating to motor vehicles on public roads
Levies included in the price of petrol (not diesel or LPG), and through motor vehicle license fees. Levies average $113.94 (GST exclusive) per vehicle per year (as of July 2017), with motorcycles and heavy vehicles paying more than average due to the increased likelihood of injury associated with these modes of transport; the petrol levy set at 6c per litre (GST exclusive).


Treatment Injury
Injuries as a result of medical treatment
Funded from the Earners and Non-Earners accounts, depending on the clients' employment status.


ACC for the self-employed – ACC Coverplus Extra[edit]
ACC Coverplus Extra was introduced by ACC to provide cover for self-employed workers and business owners that would fail to otherwise be covered adequately by the standard ACC Cover Plus policy. It works by paying an agreed level of compensation, in the event of an injury resulting in time off from work.[11]
With this cover already agreed upon any business would not have to prove loss of income and has certainty on their amount of cover in the event of an accident injury. ACC Cover Plus policy was designed to cover employees and would only pay 80% of the net taxable income. With ACC Cover Plus Extra a self-employed contractor would get 100% of the pre-agreed compensation cover until one was fit for full-time work. A business owner would be able to get compensation under ACC Cover Plus Extra even if the business continued to earn income whilst the business owner was off work injured. This would not be possible with the standard policy.[11]
Funding[edit]




ACC offices in Palmerston North


ACC initially had a "pay-as-you-go" funding model which collected "only enough levies during the year to cover the cost of claims for that particular year". In 1999 a "fully funded" model was adopted whereby sufficient levies were collected to cover the lifetime cost of each injury – which might require compensation over a period of 30 years or more.[9] However, getting ACC onto a strong financial footing was not easy and in 2009, ACC posted a $4.8 billion loss – described as the biggest corporate loss in New Zealand's history. This cost escalation is thought to have been due to an increase in the number of claims, a widening of entitlements and increased costs of meeting the claims.[12] Another factor was physiotherapy services being made free at the point of delivery leading to over-servicing of clients.[13] Between 2000 and 2008 this appears to have contributed to an increase in physiotherapy costs of 214%.[14]
The 100% reimbursement scheme for physiotherapist services was ended and ACC levies on wages and motorists were increased.[15] ACC chairman John Judge told the Sunday Star-Times that it was going to take a "hard-nosed" approach to get ACC into a sustainable position. This would require "substantial" levy increases and "legislative change to get people off the scheme and back to work quicker".[12] By 2012, ACC had made good progress towards its 2019-goal (of being fully funded), and was $4.5 billion short of matching liabilities ($28.5b) with its assets ($24b).[16]
Towards the end of 2012, ACC Minister Judith Collins announced that Government would not cut ACC levies for the 2013–14 year. While the ACC Board and Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment had recommended reducing the levies by between 12 and 17 per cent, Collins stated that the government's decision was motivated by the uncertain economic conditions and a desire to ensure that reductions to the levy were sustainable. Andrew Little, the Labour Party's ACC spokesman, criticised this decision, claiming that it was driven by the government's attempt to bring the budget into surplus and reducing the levy would provide a boost to the economy.[17] In the 2013 budget, Collins announced a $1.3 billion cut in ACC levies over the next two years. Collins said the Earners and Workers accounts were now fully funded after the Corporation reduced the number of long term ACC claimants from 14,000 to less than 11,000.[18]
In 2015/16, ACC’s outstanding claims liability (OCL) increased by $6.4 billion, which lead to a net deficit of $3.4 billion. The OCL measures the future cost of all existing ACC claims. That year also saw 1.93 million claims accepted; a 5.2% increase from the previous year. $3.5 billion was paid out to all new and existing claims.[19]
There has been some conjecture over whether or not ACC staff were paid incentives to remove long term clients off weekly compensation. This was refuted by Ex-CEO Ralph Stewart in 2012. That year there were 10,400 long-term claimants registered with ACC – down by over 1,000.[20]
Notable events[edit]
Violence against staff[edit]
In some cases ACC clients have threatened or attempted to harm ACC staff members. In 1999, a staff member was fatally stabbed by a claimant at an ACC office in Henderson.[21] In 2010 ACC logos were removed from company vehicles after several staff were "rammed or driven off the road by other drivers". The following year a threat against former chief executive Ralph Stewart led to a decision for security staff to be posted outside his home. There have been at least two threats to blow up a car bomb outside ACC offices and police have had to be called on several other occasions. In 2012, there were a total of 134 recorded threats made against staff - the majority against case managers "making difficult decisions" on clients' cases.[22]
Client fraud[edit]
In 2013, it was reported that 64 people have been convicted of defrauding ACC of a total of more than $10 million over the past four years. This includes clients claiming they were "injured" but who kept working while receiving ACC benefits and medical practitioners who billed ACC for more treatment than they actually provided. Another category of ACC fraudster includes widows who continued claiming payments after their (injured) partners have subsequently died. Sometimes these payments went on for nearly 30 years before the fraud came to light – with one woman receiving nearly $150,000 after her husband had died.[23]
Staff fraud[edit]
There have been a number of cases where ACC staff have defrauded the corporation. Jeffrey Chapman, former ACC chief executive from 1985 to 1992, was imprisoned for defrauding ACC and other government agencies; Gavin Robbins, his successor from 1993 to 1997, was also charged with fraud but was acquitted.[24] In 2011, a senior manager was convicted of dishonesty offences involving property leased to ACC by private business interests.[25] In late 2012, Jonathan Wright, an ACC-contracted medical assessor, was convicted of dishonestly obtaining over $18,000 in falsified travel expenses from ACC.[26]
Treatment Injury claims[edit]
Medical misadventure claims were re-labelled as Treatment Injury claims (TI) in 2005. A treatment injury is when an injury is caused by treatment provided by a registered health professional. These injuries are not a necessary part or ordinary consequence of the treatment.[27]
Bronwyn Pullar privacy breach[edit]
ACC has had a number of breaches of privacy relating to claimants. The most significant occurred in 2011 after the release of details of 6700 claimants to an ACC claimant, Bronwyn Pullar. Pullar had been battling ACC since suffering a head injury in 2002—and had 45 separate complaints against the agency—only one of which was about the privacy breaches.[28] In 2011 she and former National Party president Michelle Boag, had a meeting with two senior ACC managers to discuss her concerns. ACC referred the matter to the police claiming Pullar had threatened to go to the media about the privacy breaches if she didn't get what she wanted. The police listened to a tape recording of the meeting and decided there was no case to answer.[29][30]
In March 2012, ACC Minister Nick Smith resigned from Cabinet after it was revealed that he had written letters on behalf of Pullar, who was a personal friend of his, while he was ACC Minister.[31]
ACC chairman John Judge continued to insist his version of events was correct and as a result ACC Minister Judith Collins did not renew his tenure on the ACC Board. The chief executive of ACC, Ralph Stewart, also resigned the next day.[32] Three other Board members – Murray Hilder, Rob Campbell and John McCliskie – also resigned.[33]
The fallout from the affair continued in May 2012, when Collins sued Labour MPs Trevor Mallard and Andrew Little for defamation over comments they made on Radio New Zealand broadcasts linking her to the leak of an email from Michelle Boag following the release of the files.[34] The case was settled after a High Court hearing in November 2012.[35]
An independent review of ACC was conducted towards the end of 2012 and found the organisation "lacked a comprehensive strategy for protecting and managing claimants' information" and said ACC had an "almost cavalier" attitude toward its clients. The review showed that the culture within ACC enabled its staff to target clients involved in privacy breaches and complaints rather than demonstrating respect for claimants. In 2013, a training Academy for staff was mooted with an "emphasis on a client-centred approach".[36]

Features[edit]
ACC is the sole and compulsory provider of accident insurance in New Zealand for all work and non-work injuries. The corporation administers the ACC Scheme on a no-fault basis, so that anyone – regardless of the way in which they incurred an injury – has coverage under the Scheme. Due to the scheme's no-fault basis, people who have suffered personal injury do not have the right to sue an at-fault party, except for exemplary damages.[2]
The ACC scheme provides a range of entitlements to injured people; however 93.5 percent of new claims in 2011–12 were for treatment costs only. Other entitlements include weekly compensation for lost earnings (paid at a rate of 80% of a person's pre-injury earnings) and the cost of home or vehicle modifications for the seriously injured. The scheme offers entitlements subject to various eligibility criteria.
ACC works with trusted partners and communities to prevent injuries. These initiatives include, but are not limited to, RugbySmart with New Zealand Rugby[3], Ride Forever[4], Mates and Dates[5], and ‘Make Your Home a Safety Zone’ with Safekids[6].
History[edit]
ACC has its origins in the 1900 "Workers' Compensation Act" (Workers' Compensation for Accidents Act (1900)), which established a limited compensation scheme for workers who had suffered injuries where there was no directly responsible party. In 1967 a New Zealand Royal Commission, chaired by High Court judge Owen Woodhouse, recommended extending this compensation to cover all injuries on a no-fault basis. Following this report, on 1 April 1974 the New Zealand Government established the Accident Compensation Commission to implement the requirements of the 1972 Accident Compensation Act and the 1973 Amendments. The Act was later replaced by the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2001, which was renamed the "Accident Compensation Act 2001" in 2010. The Annual Report (1989/90) of the Accident Compensation Commission[7] proposed that the distinction between "accidents" (which are covered)[8] and "illness" (which is not) should be dropped. But this proposal was not taken up by the government. In 1992, the government renamed the Accident Compensation Commission as the "Accident Compensation Corporation".
From 1 July 1999, the Fourth National Government allowed private insurance operators to provide work-related accident insurance, and ACC was briefly exposed to competition. The Fifth Labour Government (elected in November 1999) repealed this change, and as of 1 July 2000 re-instated the ACC as the sole provider of accident insurance coverage.
Administration of levies[edit]
ACC is primarily funded through a combination of levies and government contributions. Income collected from each source goes into predetermined account based on the source. Costs relating to an injury are paid from one of these accounts based on the type and cause of the injury.
The four main accounts are: Work, Earners, Non-Earners, and Motor Vehicle. There is also a fifth account, Treatment Injury (formerly Medical Misadventure) that draws on both the Earners and Non-Earners account.[9][10]

Funded from the Earners and Non-Earners accounts, depending on the clients' employment status.


ACC for the self-employed – ACC Coverplus Extra[edit]
ACC Coverplus Extra was introduced by ACC to provide cover for self-employed workers and business owners that would fail to otherwise be covered adequately by the standard ACC Cover Plus policy. It works by paying an agreed level of compensation, in the event of an injury resulting in time off from work.[11]
With this cover already agreed upon any business would not have to prove loss of income and has certainty on their amount of cover in the event of an accident injury. ACC Cover Plus policy was designed to cover employees and would only pay 80% of the net taxable income. With ACC Cover Plus Extra a self-employed contractor would get 100% of the pre-agreed compensation cover until one was fit for full-time work. A business owner would be able to get compensation under ACC Cover Plus Extra even if the business continued to earn income whilst the business owner was off work injured. This would not be possible with the standard policy.[11]

ACC initially had a "pay-as-you-go" funding model which collected "only enough levies during the year to cover the cost of claims for that particular year". In 1999 a "fully funded" model was adopted whereby sufficient levies were collected to cover the lifetime cost of each injury – which might require compensation over a period of 30 years or more.[9] However, getting ACC onto a strong financial footing was not easy and in 2009, ACC posted a $4.8 billion loss – described as the biggest corporate loss in New Zealand's history. This cost escalation is thought to have been due to an increase in the number of claims, a widening of entitlements and increased costs of meeting the claims.[12] Another factor was physiotherapy services being made free at the point of delivery leading to over-servicing of clients.[13] Between 2000 and 2008 this appears to have contributed to an increase in physiotherapy costs of 214%.[14]
The 100% reimbursement scheme for physiotherapist services was ended and ACC levies on wages and motorists were increased.[15] ACC chairman John Judge told the Sunday Star-Times that it was going to take a "hard-nosed" approach to get ACC into a sustainable position. This would require "substantial" levy increases and "legislative change to get people off the scheme and back to work quicker".[12] By 2012, ACC had made good progress towards its 2019-goal (of being fully funded), and was $4.5 billion short of matching liabilities ($28.5b) with its assets ($24b).[16]
Towards the end of 2012, ACC Minister Judith Collins announced that Government would not cut ACC levies for the 2013–14 year. While the ACC Board and Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment had recommended reducing the levies by between 12 and 17 per cent, Collins stated that the government's decision was motivated by the uncertain economic conditions and a desire to ensure that reductions to the levy were sustainable. Andrew Little, the Labour Party's ACC spokesman, criticised this decision, claiming that it was driven by the government's attempt to bring the budget into surplus and reducing the levy would provide a boost to the economy.[17] In the 2013 budget, Collins announced a $1.3 billion cut in ACC levies over the next two years. Collins said the Earners and Workers accounts were now fully funded after the Corporation reduced the number of long term ACC claimants from 14,000 to less than 11,000.[18]
In 2015/16, ACC’s outstanding claims liability (OCL) increased by $6.4 billion, which lead to a net deficit of $3.4 billion. The OCL measures the future cost of all existing ACC claims. That year also saw 1.93 million claims accepted; a 5.2% increase from the previous year. $3.5 billion was paid out to all new and existing claims.[19]
There has been some conjecture over whether or not ACC staff were paid incentives to remove long term clients off weekly compensation. This was refuted by Ex-CEO Ralph Stewart in 2012. That year there were 10,400 long-term claimants registered with ACC – down by over 1,000.[20]
Notable events[edit]
Violence against staff[edit]
In some cases ACC clients have threatened or attempted to harm ACC staff members. In 1999, a staff member was fatally stabbed by a claimant at an ACC office in Henderson.[21] In 2010 ACC logos were removed from company vehicles after several staff were "rammed or driven off the road by other drivers". The following year a threat against former chief executive Ralph Stewart led to a decision for security staff to be posted outside his home. There have been at least two threats to blow up a car bomb outside ACC offices and police have had to be called on several other occasions. In 2012, there were a total of 134 recorded threats made against staff - the majority against case managers "making difficult decisions" on clients' cases.[22]
Client fraud[edit]
In 2013, it was reported that 64 people have been convicted of defrauding ACC of a total of more than $10 million over the past four years. This includes clients claiming they were "injured" but who kept working while receiving ACC benefits and medical practitioners who billed ACC for more treatment than they actually provided. Another category of ACC fraudster includes widows who continued claiming payments after their (injured) partners have subsequently died. Sometimes these payments went on for nearly 30 years before the fraud came to light – with one woman receiving nearly $150,000 after her husband had died.[23]
Staff fraud[edit]
There have been a number of cases where ACC staff have defrauded the corporation. Jeffrey Chapman, former ACC chief executive from 1985 to 1992, was imprisoned for defrauding ACC and other government agencies; Gavin Robbins, his successor from 1993 to 1997, was also charged with fraud but was acquitted.[24] In 2011, a senior manager was convicted of dishonesty offences involving property leased to ACC by private business interests.[25] In late 2012, Jonathan Wright, an ACC-contracted medical assessor, was convicted of dishonestly obtaining over $18,000 in falsified travel expenses from ACC.[26]
Treatment Injury claims[edit]
Medical misadventure claims were re-labelled as Treatment Injury claims (TI) in 2005. A treatment injury is when an injury is caused by treatment provided by a registered health professional. These injuries are not a necessary part or ordinary consequence of the treatment.[27]
Bronwyn Pullar privacy breach[edit]
ACC has had a number of breaches of privacy relating to claimants. The most significant occurred in 2011 after the release of details of 6700 claimants to an ACC claimant, Bronwyn Pullar. Pullar had been battling ACC since suffering a head injury in 2002—and had 45 separate complaints against the agency—only one of which was about the privacy breaches.[28] In 2011 she and former National Party president Michelle Boag, had a meeting with two senior ACC managers to discuss her concerns. ACC referred the matter to the police claiming Pullar had threatened to go to the media about the privacy breaches if she didn't get what she wanted. The police listened to a tape recording of the meeting and decided there was no case to answer.[29][30]
In March 2012, ACC Minister Nick Smith resigned from Cabinet after it was revealed that he had written letters on behalf of Pullar, who was a personal friend of his, while he was ACC Minister.[31]
ACC chairman John Judge continued to insist his version of events was correct and as a result ACC Minister Judith Collins did not renew his tenure on the ACC Board. The chief executive of ACC, Ralph Stewart, also resigned the next day.[32] Three other Board members – Murray Hilder, Rob Campbell and John McCliskie – also resigned.[33]
The fallout from the affair continued in May 2012, when Collins sued Labour MPs Trevor Mallard and Andrew Little for defamation over comments they made on Radio New Zealand broadcasts linking her to the leak of an email from Michelle Boag following the release of the files.[34] The case was settled after a High Court hearing in November 2012.[35]
An independent review of ACC was conducted towards the end of 2012 and found the organisation "lacked a comprehensive strategy for protecting and managing claimants' information" and said ACC had an "almost cavalier" attitude toward its clients. The review showed that the culture within ACC enabled its staff to target clients involved in privacy breaches and complaints rather than demonstrating respect for claimants. In 2013, a training Academy for staff was mooted with an "emphasis on a client-centred approach".[36]

The Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) (Māori: Te Kaporeihana Āwhina Hunga Whara) is a New Zealand Crown entity responsible for administering the country's universal no-fault accidental injury scheme. The scheme provides financial compensation and support to citizens, residents, and temporary visitors who have suffered personal injuries.
The corporation was founded as the Accident Compensation Commission on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Accident Compensation Act 1972. Its principal governing act today is the Accident Compensation Act 2001.[1] As a Crown entity, ACC is responsible to a Cabinet Minister via its Board of Directors. Unlike most other Crown entities, it has its own dedicated ministerial portfolio, which since December 2016 has been held by Michael Woodhouse.

Features[edit]
ACC is the sole and compulsory provider of accident insurance in New Zealand for all work and non-work injuries. The corporation administers the ACC Scheme on a no-fault basis, so that anyone – regardless of the way in which they incurred an injury – has coverage under the Scheme. Due to the scheme's no-fault basis, people who have suffered personal injury do not have the right to sue an at-fault party, except for exemplary damages.[2]
The ACC scheme provides a range of entitlements to injured people; however 93.5 percent of new claims in 2011–12 were for treatment costs only. Other entitlements include weekly compensation for lost earnings (paid at a rate of 80% of a person's pre-injury earnings) and the cost of home or vehicle modifications for the seriously injured. The scheme offers entitlements subject to various eligibility criteria.
ACC works with trusted partners and communities to prevent injuries. These initiatives include, but are not limited to, RugbySmart with New Zealand Rugby[3], Ride Forever[4], Mates and Dates[5], and ‘Make Your Home a Safety Zone’ with Safekids[6].
History[edit]
ACC has its origins in the 1900 "Workers' Compensation Act" (Workers' Compensation for Accidents Act (1900)), which established a limited compensation scheme for workers who had suffered injuries where there was no directly responsible party. In 1967 a New Zealand Royal Commission, chaired by High Court judge Owen Woodhouse, recommended extending this compensation to cover all injuries on a no-fault basis. Following this report, on 1 April 1974 the New Zealand Government established the Accident Compensation Commission to implement the requirements of the 1972 Accident Compensation Act and the 1973 Amendments. The Act was later replaced by the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2001, which was renamed the "Accident Compensation Act 2001" in 2010. The Annual Report (1989/90) of the Accident Compensation Commission[7] proposed that the distinction between "accidents" (which are covered)[8] and "illness" (which is not) should be dropped. But this proposal was not taken up by the government. In 1992, the government renamed the Accident Compensation Commission as the "Accident Compensation Corporation".
From 1 July 1999, the Fourth National Government allowed private insurance operators to provide work-related accident insurance, and ACC was briefly exposed to competition. The Fifth Labour Government (elected in November 1999) repealed this change, and as of 1 July 2000 re-instated the ACC as the sole provider of accident insurance coverage.
Administration of levies[edit]
ACC is primarily funded through a combination of levies and government contributions. Income collected from each source goes into predetermined account based on the source. Costs relating to an injury are paid from one of these accounts based on the type and cause of the injury.
The four main accounts are: Work, Earners, Non-Earners, and Motor Vehicle. There is also a fifth account, Treatment Injury (formerly Medical Misadventure) that draws on both the Earners and Non-Earners account.[9][10]


Account
Covers
Income sources


Work
Work-related injuries
Levies collected from employers and self-employed people. The amount payable averages 0.72% of an employer's payroll or income earned (as of 1 April 2017); rates vary depending on the employer's industry and risks associated with it.


Earners
Non-work injuries by income earners
Levies collected in conjunction with tax deductions on income. Paid by employees through PAYE or by self-employed people directly. The amount payable is 1.21% of income earned (as of 1 April 2017).


Non-earners
Non-work injuries by non-income earners
(e.g. children, elderly, unemployed, visitors)
Government contribution from the general taxation pool.


Motor Vehicle
Injuries relating to motor vehicles on public roads
Levies included in the price of petrol (not diesel or LPG), and through motor vehicle license fees. Levies average $113.94 (GST exclusive) per vehicle per year (as of July 2017), with motorcycles and heavy vehicles paying more than average due to the increased likelihood of injury associated with these modes of transport; the petrol levy set at 6c per litre (GST exclusive).


Treatment Injury
Injuries as a result of medical treatment
Funded from the Earners and Non-Earners accounts, depending on the clients' employment status.


ACC for the self-employed – ACC Coverplus Extra[edit]
ACC Coverplus Extra was introduced by ACC to provide cover for self-employed workers and business owners that would fail to otherwise be covered adequately by the standard ACC Cover Plus policy. It works by paying an agreed level of compensation, in the event of an injury resulting in time off from work.[11]
With this cover already agreed upon any business would not have to prove loss of income and has certainty on their amount of cover in the event of an accident injury. ACC Cover Plus policy was designed to cover employees and would only pay 80% of the net taxable income. With ACC Cover Plus Extra a self-employed contractor would get 100% of the pre-agreed compensation cover until one was fit for full-time work. A business owner would be able to get compensation under ACC Cover Plus Extra even if the business continued to earn income whilst the business owner was off work injured. This would not be possible with the standard policy.[11]
Funding[edit]




ACC offices in Palmerston North


ACC initially had a "pay-as-you-go" funding model which collected "only enough levies during the year to cover the cost of claims for that particular year". In 1999 a "fully funded" model was adopted whereby sufficient levies were collected to cover the lifetime cost of each injury – which might require compensation over a period of 30 years or more.[9] However, getting ACC onto a strong financial footing was not easy and in 2009, ACC posted a $4.8 billion loss – described as the biggest corporate loss in New Zealand's history. This cost escalation is thought to have been due to an increase in the number of claims, a widening of entitlements and increased costs of meeting the claims.[12] Another factor was physiotherapy services being made free at the point of delivery leading to over-servicing of clients.[13] Between 2000 and 2008 this appears to have contributed to an increase in physiotherapy costs of 214%.[14]
The 100% reimbursement scheme for physiotherapist services was ended and ACC levies on wages and motorists were increased.[15] ACC chairman John Judge told the Sunday Star-Times that it was going to take a "hard-nosed" approach to get ACC into a sustainable position. This would require "substantial" levy increases and "legislative change to get people off the scheme and back to work quicker".[12] By 2012, ACC had made good progress towards its 2019-goal (of being fully funded), and was $4.5 billion short of matching liabilities ($28.5b) with its assets ($24b).[16]
Towards the end of 2012, ACC Minister Judith Collins announced that Government would not cut ACC levies for the 2013–14 year. While the ACC Board and Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment had recommended reducing the levies by between 12 and 17 per cent, Collins stated that the government's decision was motivated by the uncertain economic conditions and a desire to ensure that reductions to the levy were sustainable. Andrew Little, the Labour Party's ACC spokesman, criticised this decision, claiming that it was driven by the government's attempt to bring the budget into surplus and reducing the levy would provide a boost to the economy.[17] In the 2013 budget, Collins announced a $1.3 billion cut in ACC levies over the next two years. Collins said the Earners and Workers accounts were now fully funded after the Corporation reduced the number of long term ACC claimants from 14,000 to less than 11,000.[18]
In 2015/16, ACC’s outstanding claims liability (OCL) increased by $6.4 billion, which lead to a net deficit of $3.4 billion. The OCL measures the future cost of all existing ACC claims. That year also saw 1.93 million claims accepted; a 5.2% increase from the previous year. $3.5 billion was paid out to all new and existing claims.[19]
There has been some conjecture over whether or not ACC staff were paid incentives to remove long term clients off weekly compensation. This was refuted by Ex-CEO Ralph Stewart in 2012. That year there were 10,400 long-term claimants registered with ACC – down by over 1,000.[20]
Notable events[edit]
Violence against staff[edit]
In some cases ACC clients have threatened or attempted to harm ACC staff members. In 1999, a staff member was fatally stabbed by a claimant at an ACC office in Henderson.[21] In 2010 ACC logos were removed from company vehicles after several staff were "rammed or driven off the road by other drivers". The following year a threat against former chief executive Ralph Stewart led to a decision for security staff to be posted outside his home. There have been at least two threats to blow up a car bomb outside ACC offices and police have had to be called on several other occasions. In 2012, there were a total of 134 recorded threats made against staff - the majority against case managers "making difficult decisions" on clients' cases.[22]
Client fraud[edit]
In 2013, it was reported that 64 people have been convicted of defrauding ACC of a total of more than $10 million over the past four years. This includes clients claiming they were "injured" but who kept working while receiving ACC benefits and medical practitioners who billed ACC for more treatment than they actually provided. Another category of ACC fraudster includes widows who continued claiming payments after their (injured) partners have subsequently died. Sometimes these payments went on for nearly 30 years before the fraud came to light – with one woman receiving nearly $150,000 after her husband had died.[23]
Staff fraud[edit]
There have been a number of cases where ACC staff have defrauded the corporation. Jeffrey Chapman, former ACC chief executive from 1985 to 1992, was imprisoned for defrauding ACC and other government agencies; Gavin Robbins, his successor from 1993 to 1997, was also charged with fraud but was acquitted.[24] In 2011, a senior manager was convicted of dishonesty offences involving property leased to ACC by private business interests.[25] In late 2012, Jonathan Wright, an ACC-contracted medical assessor, was convicted of dishonestly obtaining over $18,000 in falsified travel expenses from ACC.[26]
Treatment Injury claims[edit]
Medical misadventure claims were re-labelled as Treatment Injury claims (TI) in 2005. A treatment injury is when an injury is caused by treatment provided by a registered health professional. These injuries are not a necessary part or ordinary consequence of the treatment.[27]
Bronwyn Pullar privacy breach[edit]
ACC has had a number of breaches of privacy relating to claimants. The most significant occurred in 2011 after the release of details of 6700 claimants to an ACC claimant, Bronwyn Pullar. Pullar had been battling ACC since suffering a head injury in 2002—and had 45 separate complaints against the agency—only one of which was about the privacy breaches.[28] In 2011 she and former National Party president Michelle Boag, had a meeting with two senior ACC managers to discuss her concerns. ACC referred the matter to the police claiming Pullar had threatened to go to the media about the privacy breaches if she didn't get what she wanted. The police listened to a tape recording of the meeting and decided there was no case to answer.[29][30]
In March 2012, ACC Minister Nick Smith resigned from Cabinet after it was revealed that he had written letters on behalf of Pullar, who was a personal friend of his, while he was ACC Minister.[31]
ACC chairman John Judge continued to insist his version of events was correct and as a result ACC Minister Judith Collins did not renew his tenure on the ACC Board. The chief executive of ACC, Ralph Stewart, also resigned the next day.[32] Three other Board members – Murray Hilder, Rob Campbell and John McCliskie – also resigned.[33]
The fallout from the affair continued in May 2012, when Collins sued Labour MPs Trevor Mallard and Andrew Little for defamation over comments they made on Radio New Zealand broadcasts linking her to the leak of an email from Michelle Boag following the release of the files.[34] The case was settled after a High Court hearing in November 2012.[35]
An independent review of ACC was conducted towards the end of 2012 and found the organisation "lacked a comprehensive strategy for protecting and managing claimants' information" and said ACC had an "almost cavalier" attitude toward its clients. The review showed that the culture within ACC enabled its staff to target clients involved in privacy breaches and complaints rather than demonstrating respect for claimants. In 2013, a training Academy for staff was mooted with an "emphasis on a client-centred approach".[36]

The company offers a wide variety of job to 1700 people in Australia and gives work positions opportunity to the community. Then that will encourage the employees to work harder and harder to improve the quality of the product, and the company will develop quickly.

1.3
a) Explain how effective you feel Goldenstate Manufacturers is in meeting its purpose
Goldenstate Manufacturers is an influential textile-manufacturing-company in the business for over 30 years located in Australia. Also the company is the top five manufacturing organizations in the country. But Effective toward the Goldenstate operating manufacturing 'purpose is not to do with expectations. That the speed of production and dissemination showed their own weaknesses, coordinated traffic is limited, the lack of capacity of the team leaders and supervisors. The problems are that a considerable decrease of 20%, the growth of the company's manufacturing, customer dissatisfaction, reduced in quality products. In addition, the communication barriers between company managers and ways of thinking and management methods are different, for example, Adam, knitted manager and Ron, complete the manager, they all adhere to the concept of "my way or no way". Also James, printing and dyeing managers do not emphasize the tasks among staff, but only worry about their emotions affect productivity. Their aim is to provide high-quality products rather than using chaos sector relations and leadership to solve the problem.
b) List four main management skills or competencies needed for it to be competitive
c) Explain why you feel each of the four skills or competencies list in 1.3(b) are important

2.1
a) From any of the leadership theories you have studied on the course identify and briefly explain which theory Ron, the Finishing Manager most closely aligns with, giving evidence from the case study to support your comments
Ron, the Finishing Manager does not allow his staff the liberty to take any action or make any decisions without his acknowledgment. So that means the staffs should ask his opinion before make any decision. And he most closely aligns with transactional theory.
b) Identify and explain the Leadership styles of Adam, the Knitting Manager, and James, the Dyeing Manager giving evidence from the case study to support your comments
Adam, the knitting Manager believes in the philosophy of "My way or no way". She shows an example of an Autocratic Leadership Style. This type of leadership is said to be synonymous with dictatorship, where only one person presides with complete authority over the followers or workers. Their decision has to be taken as the golden rule and is never to be questioned or challenged. They plan out everything and order their subordinates to work according to their rules. For instance, if a company has an authoritarian leader as the managing director, the employees in the company would have to work as per the rules set by him. They would not be allowed to participate in any kind of decision-making process. This may hinder the growth of the company by enhancing the productivity. In short, the authoritative leader has full control on those around him and has complete authority to treat them as he wants.
James, the Dyeing Manager, does not take much notice if workers do not do their jobs, he likes to be liked by his staffs and refrains from taking any actions which might upset the team and turn them against him. His style and Adam’ style is the opposite. So he shows an example of a Laissez Faire leadership style. Laissez-faire leadership is not ideal in situations where group members lack the knowledge or experience they need to complete tasks and make decisions. Some people are not good at setting their own deadlines, managing their own projects and solving problems on their own. In such situations, projects can go off-track and deadlines can be missed when team members do not get enough guidance or feedback from leaders. Laissez-faire leadership can be effective in situations where group members are highly skilled, motivated and capable of working on their own. While the conventional term for this style is 'laissez-faire' and implies a completely hands-off approach, many leaders still remain open and available to group members for consultation and feedback.
c) Comment on how appropriate you feel each of these leadership styles are in the current situation- give two reasons for your answer to each style
Adam, the knitting Manager shows an example of an Autocratic Leadership Style. This style is not helpful to the current situation.
It is harmful to the communication between manager and staffs, also it will create a gap. And Adam should give the staffs that work for him a chance, and receive their suggestion instead of asking them to do work directly.
When the managers use this style, the staffs must be working with too much pressure, they will not be succeed.
James, the Dyeing Manager, shows an example of a Laissez Faire leadership style. This is not available for Goldenstate Manufacturers.
If employees work with too much freedom, they will become lazy, even they are working with good mood, the result with no quality.
Also it is difficult to make decision, because everyone has different opinion, the manager should listen to all the staffs, it is waste time and money.
2.2
a) Select one motivational theory
Herzberg’s two-factor theory: The Two Factor Theory has had a considerable amount of practical and as well as theoretical influences. In fact, from a practical perspective, the influence of Herzberg's motivation theory can be seen at every organizational level as well as within every department. From a theoretical perspective, Herzberg's motivation theory can be perceived as having similarities to Maslow's Theory of Need with the exception that for Herzberg's theory, the needs aren't placed in a progressive continuum, rather they are divided into two independent factors. In fact, Herzberg would argue that the opposite of satisfaction is not dissatisfaction since different stimuli are involved in generating each of those emotional states, reinforcing the fact that they are not on the same continuum. As a result, these states must be measured on different scales. The Two Factor Theory or Herzberg's Theory of Motivation is still to this day, holding to the test of time. However, through its existence there have been many critiques. In 1968, Herzberg indicated that there were 16 other studies from various parts of the world that use different population samples that are supportive of his original findings.
Among the criticism of the theory, the list below is representative of the most cited ones:
The Two Factor Theory assumes that happy employees produce more.
What motivates one individual might be a de-motivator for another individual.
Doesn't account for individual personality traits that could provide a different response to a motivator or hygiene factor.
Communication management departments as a new Goldenstate manufacturer (Pvt) Ltd. Chief Executive Officer, Mark Fraser incentive business, general manager Carl Herzberg's two-factor theory, let him open the other members of the excitation lead Carlcases. Technical management personnel hesitation in hiring new employees so that he could not do their jobs effectively. Using this theory of motivation, Mark should have a general manager with the regular meeting of the entire team. A monthly meeting to the part of the management and staff the opportunity to say their new ideas and share their ideas with, which will help improve the company's. Thus, Karl and his staff meet each other, but also the application of this technology. Other factors, health, Mark first supervise him how to deal with his subordinates and guide his policy management and management team to achieve the company's goals Carl. In this method, there will be a united group, to establish a relationship with their manager, as well as their colleagues.
b) Advise Adam, the Knitting Manager, of four ways he might motivate his staff so they will remain with the company
Adam needs to ensure that the physical needs of his staff, which means that he in order to ensure that the salaries and wages of all employees must be paid time without any delay. Money come from wages is an important part of the life of his staff, without it, they could not afford their basic needs in their daily lives, do not have the money, they will not be able to buy food. Another way to motivate his staff Adam respect of his subordinates in order to gain their respect and his team completed their purpose, way. Equally important is that he received from staff feedback and analysis of the strengths and weaknesses. As a result, Adam is able to monitor and evaluate progress, as well as how to deal with the problem, to solve these problems. Such as bulletin boards, e-mail, meetings, video conferencing and telephone with the team to have an open communication line monitoring progress. Finally, Adam can adjust his leadership style to be more open, more space and provde a better working environment to his employee's work performance, to meet the skills needs of the self-realization of his staff. He can motivate his employees in their work to become more creative, innovative applications properly, as long as the changes can help improve the quality of their work, and effectively to achieve their goals, Adam am pleased to open to accept changes.
2.3 Mark the CEO has hold Ron, the Finishing Manager that he should delegate more. You are a assigned to coach Ron though the steps he must take to delegate effectively.
a)Explain to Ron 3 benefits of delegation , using information from the case study to ill ustrate your comments.
The benefits of the delegation, Ron can be achieved:
• Accountability: some of the specific tasks assigned to his staff, Ron employees can do a better job, because they can feel that they have personal accountability results of the tasks they perform, despite the fact that the final decision and responsibility to remain in the decision delegation who hand. Worker / employee who is assigned the task will be the implementation of responsible for their work. In addition, Ron lost his staff to minimize the risk in the finishing department. Some accountability results are set out below:
1 performance will be improved
2 better employee participation and participation
3 increase employee commitment and ability to feel
4 allow for more innovation and creativity
5 better employees and their job satisfaction and morale
• opportunities for staff development: his staff assigned new tasks, so that they feel that they have more responsibility and his staff have the opportunity to be stretched and the challenges of the new position, because you want to open several employees every day work and do the same tasks day after day. Appoint Ron can give employees the opportunity to develop more professional skills and work experience. This experiential development of the best things most cost manager sometimes monitoring and presentation
• empowerment: Finish Manager can benefit from the delegation of the development department. Ron This will help to build and strengthen his personal capacity and his staff will be valued more respect for his staff and superiors. Delegation here, too, there are some more benefits. Streamline his workload, Ron can have more time to focus more on the essentials of management tasks. His staff will feel more motivated and self-confidence, because they already trust, as well as the stress level of the entire labor force also declined.
b) Explain to Ron 5 steps needed to be taken for effective delegation.
The need for effective delegation The first step is to select a team. This step includes the causes and attributes of the person / team appointed to know the goals and objectives of the program. Whether it is a delegate should be aware that the idea of a delegate. The second step is to assess their requirements and needs, their ability to do the task, and how they understand their duties and responsibilities. Explained, they are assigned capacities and specific job or task has been delegated. Training should be provided if it is considered necessary. The chosen people should be trusted and have the basic skills of a manager. The third step is the expected results, including the final product of a task and its corresponding result negotiations. The discussion a prerequisite to participate in other services required by the financial budget, functional equipment and production, such as the work done. The date stated deadline and reviews, while observing their reactions, give directions at the same time.

Damages: How Much is a Personal Injury Case Worth?




Evaluating your accident or injury case:  A look at the different types of compensation available in a personal injury lawsuit.


By David Goguen, J.D.

Share on Facebook












If you're considering filing a personal injury lawsuit over a car accident, slip and fall, or any other kind of injury, you may be wondering "What is my case really worth?" The answer comes down to "damages" -- figuring out what your injuries have cost you monetarily, physically, and mentally (and, in some cases, whether the defendant's conduct should be punished).
In a personal injury case, money damages are paid to an injured person (the plaintiff) by the person or company who is found to be legally responsible for the accident (the defendant or their insurer). A damage award can be agreed upon after a negotiated settlement -- among the parties, their insurance companies, and their attorneys, for example -- or may be ordered by a judge or jury following a court trial. (To learn more about how insurance companies value a claim after an accident, see Nolo's article How Do Insurers Value an Injury Claim?)
Below you'll find an explanation of the different kinds of damages that are common in many personal injury cases and how a personal injury damages award can be affected by the plaintiff's action (or inaction).
Compensatory Damages in Personal Injury Cases
Most personal injury damages are classified as "compensatory," meaning that they are intended to compensate the injured plaintiff for what was lost due to the accident or injury. A compensatory damages award is meant to make the injured plaintiff "whole" again from a monetary standpoint (to the extent that's possible). This means trying to put a dollar figure on all the consequences of an accident. Some compensatory damages are relatively easy to quantify -- like reimbursement for property damage and medical bills. But it's harder to place a monetary value on pain and suffering or the inability to enjoy hobbies because of physical limitations caused by lingering accident-related injuries.
Here's a rundown of the different types of compensatory damages that are common in many personal injury cases.
Medical treatment. A personal injury damages award almost always includes the cost of medical care associated with the accident -- reimbursement for treatment you've already received and compensation for the estimated cost of medical care you'll need in the future because of the accident.
Income. You may be entitled to compensation for the accident's impact on your salary and wages -- not just income you've already lost but also the money you would have been able to make in the future, were it not for the accident. In personal injury legalese, a damage award based on future income is characterized as compensation for an accident victim's "loss of earning capacity."
Property loss. If any vehicles, clothing, or other items were damaged as a result of the accident, you'll likely be entitled to reimbursement for repairs or compensation for the fair market value of the property that was lost.
Pain and suffering. You may be entitled to get compensation for pain and serious discomfort you suffered during the accident and in its immediate aftermath -- also for any ongoing pain that can be attributed to the accident. Learn more: What is Pain and Suffering?
Emotional distress. Usually linked to more serious accidents, emotional distress damages are meant to compensate a personal injury plaintiff for the psychological impact of an injury -- including fear, anxiety, and sleep loss. Some states consider emotional distress as part of any "pain and suffering" damage that is awarded to a personal injury plaintiff.
Loss of enjoyment. When injuries caused by an accident keep you from enjoying day-to-day pursuits like hobbies, exercise, and other recreational activities, you may be entitled to receive "loss of enjoyment" damages.
Loss of consortium. In personal injury cases, "loss of consortium" damages typically relate to the impact the injuries have on the plaintiff's relationship with their spouse -- the loss of companionship or the inability to maintain a sexual relationship, for example. Some states also consider the separate impact on the relationship between a parent and their child when one is injured. In some cases, loss of consortium damages are awarded directly to the affected family member rather than to the injured plaintiff.
Punitive Damages in Personal Injury Cases
In cases where the defendant's conduct is deemed particularly egregious or outrageously careless, a personal injury plaintiff may be awarded punitive damages on top of any compensatory damages award. Punitive damages stem from a rationale that is quite different from the justification tied to compensatory damages, which attempt to "make someone whole."
Punitive damages are awarded to the injured plaintiff, but the real goal of these kinds of damages is to punish the defendant for its conduct -- to "hit them in the pocketbook," so to speak -- and to act as a deterrent. Since it isn't unusual for punitive damage awards to top tens of millions of dollars, most states have set some type of cap on punitive damage awards in personal injury cases.
How Plaintiff's Actions (or Inaction) Can Affect a Damages Award
In some cases, an injured person's role in causing an accident -- or their inaction after being injured -- can diminish the amount of damages available in a personal injury case.
Comparative negligence. If you're at fault (even partially) for the accident that caused your injuries, chances are that any damage award will reflect that. That's because most states adhere to a "comparative negligence" standard that links damages to degree of fault in a personal injury case.
Contributory negligence. In the small handful of states that follow the concept of "contributory negligence" for personal injury lawsuits, you may not be able to recover any compensation at all if you're deemed partially to blame for the accident.
After the accident: failure to mitigate damages. The law in most states expects plaintiffs in personal injury cases to take reasonable steps to minimize or "mitigate" the financial impact of the harm caused by the accident. If an injured plaintiff just sits back and rests on their proverbial laurels when it isn't reasonable to do so (by failing to get necessary medical treatment after an accident, and making their injuries much worse, for example) a damages award might be significantly reduced. (For more information on defense strategies that can counter an injury claim, read Nolo's article Defenses in Personal Injury Cases.)

Personal Injury Claims









Should you file a personal injury lawsuit after an accident or injury, and what can you expect if you do? In this section, we offer tips on how fault is established in an injury case, figuring out how much your claim might be worth, and the best early steps you can take to help your case and protect your legal rights.








First Steps After an Accident or Injury





Take Notes After an Accident or Injury
Writing down the details after an accident is more accurate than relying on your memory.




Personal Injury Accidents: Preserve Evidence
The first few days immediately following an accident are often the most important for finding and preserving evidence of what happened -- and documenting your injuries.




Getting Your Medical Records: Information on Rights, Procedures, and Denials
You may need to get copies of your medical records for a number of reasons. If you're involved in a personal injury lawsuit, medical records may be a key element in the case.




Personal Injury Claims: Notifying Responsible Parties
If you've been injured in an accident, it's important to notify anyone who may be responsible for the accident.









Who Is at Fault?





Who's at Fault for an Accident FAQ
Injured in an accident? Proving who is responsible for an accident can be tough.




Proving Fault in Personal Injury Accidents: General Rules
How to decide who is legally at fault for an accident or personal injury.




Negligence, The 'Duty of Care,' and Fault for an Accident

Key Considerations in an Injury Claim





Damages: How Much is a Personal Injury Case Worth?
Evaluating your accident or injury case:  A look at the different types of compensation available in a personal injury lawsuit.




What is 'Pain and Suffering' in a Personal Injury Case?

Quick Reference Guide


Liability

Negligence

Damages

Limitations




What is Liability?
Liability is when someone is legally responsible to another person because of his or her actions or failure to act. In a personal injury case there may be several parties who have a certain degree of liability or responsibility for the auto accident.


What is Negligence?
Negligence is when one party is careless in its duty to someone. For example, if a landlord doesn't repair a broken step and someone slips and falls, then the landlord was negligent. He had a duty to fix the step; he didn't fix it; someone fell and suffered damages because he didn't fix it. Negligence is often part of personal injury cases.


What are Considered Damages?
Damages is the legal word for the money an injured party has lost due to an injury. Those damages could be medical bills, prescriptions, time off from work, lengthy recovery time, and also pain and suffering. Most insurance policies only cover certain parts of the cost involved in common injuries like car accidents, slip and falls or workplace illnesses.


What is a Statute of Limitations?
The law limits the amount of time you can file a claim and collect damages for your auto accident. That law is called the Statute of Limitations. No matter how great your loss, you will not be able to collect if you miss this deadline. Your lawyer will know all the deadlines for your state. Putting a claim together can take time, so it's important to consult with a lawyer near you as soon as possible.

Quick Reference Guide


Liability

Negligence

Damages

Limitations




What is Liability?
Liability is when someone is legally responsible to another person because of his or her actions or failure to act. In a personal injury case there may be several parties who have a certain degree of liability or responsibility for the auto accident.


What is Negligence?
Negligence is when one party is careless in its duty to someone. For example, if a landlord doesn't repair a broken step and someone slips and falls, then the landlord was negligent. He had a duty to fix the step; he didn't fix it; someone fell and suffered damages because he didn't fix it. Negligence is often part of personal injury cases.


What are Considered Damages?
Damages is the legal word for the money an injured party has lost due to an injury. Those damages could be medical bills, prescriptions, time off from work, lengthy recovery time, and also pain and suffering. Most insurance policies only cover certain parts of the cost involved in common injuries like car accidents, slip and falls or workplace illnesses.


What is a Statute of Limitations?
The law limits the amount of time you can file a claim and collect damages for your auto accident. That law is called the Statute of Limitations. No matter how great your loss, you will not be able to collect if you miss this deadline. Your lawyer will know all the deadlines for your state. Putting a claim together can take time, so it's important to consult with a lawyer near you as soon as possible.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
