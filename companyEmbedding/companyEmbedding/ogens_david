CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., July 11, 2013 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The University of Virginia Darden School of Business today announced the appointment of Locke Ogens as executive director of the Darden School Foundation and strategic relations. 
(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20100916/DC66431LOGO) 
Ogens will serve as the staff leader of the Darden School Foundation and will manage the Foundation's day-to-day operations. She will organize the engagement of the Foundation Board of Trustees, as well as the Corporate Advisory Board. She will also integrate the activities of Darden's other volunteer leadership boards and advisory groups, including the Darden School Alumni Board of Directors, the Dean's Diversity Advisory Council and the Global Advisory Council.
In addition, she will manage relationships with important, strategic stakeholders of Darden, including volunteer leaders, corporate leaders, government officials, University leaders and others. 
"We are confident that in Locke we have a visionary leader, who will work closely with Darden's senior leadership team and the Darden School Foundation Board of Trustees to drive the School's high-touch engagement with its valuable strategic partners and volunteer leadership boards, and to forge new relationships around the globe," said Darden Dean Bob Bruner. 
Phil Knisely, chair of the Darden School Foundation Board of Trustees, emphasized Ogens' experience as a nonprofit leader. "Locke has served on and led important nonprofit boards -- in the Boston area and here at the University of Virginia. Her administrative skills and ability to foster key relationships will be instrumental as the School and Foundation work in concert to advance the School's vision for world-class impact and stature."
An officer of the Darden School Foundation, Ogens will report to the dean of the Darden School and the chair of the Darden School Foundation Board of Trustees.
Ogens has served as Darden's executive director for strategic relations since February 2013. She joined Darden in May 2012 as interim chief of staff for external relations. Previously, she was a longtime investment management executive with firms including Morgan Stanley and Schroders. 
While based in Boston, she served as chair of the Greater Boston Salvation Army Advisory Board and as a member of the Salvation Army Massachusetts State Advisory Board. 
At the University of Virginia, she has served as a trustee of the U.Va. College Foundation Board for eight years, and she held the office of president from April 2010 to April 2012. She also served on the U.Va. Council of Foundations and is a member of the Raven Society. 
Ogens is a 1976 graduate of U.Va.'s College and Graduate School of Arts & Sciences.

Class of 2/27/13



In the next class we will go back and update our iGoogle home page. For those of you who don't know anything about iGoogle, I will also help you become familiar with iGoogle and how to set it up. Also be aware that iGoogle will not be available after November 1, 2013. I feel that iGoogle is so extremely valuable that we will next talk about other similar products. There are many and I picked three to tell you about and one that I choose to replace my iGoogle account. This one I will talk about in detail.UStart.org. Protopage, and Netvibes are the three with the later the one I have chosen.

Class of Feb. 20, 2013



This is the first class of the Spring 2013 semester. Like all my first classes, I will give you a overview of what you will learn in the class, what you need to do to keep up with the class, how I conduct the class and how you interact with me.



I guess to start out we need to know what is the Internet, its initial purpose, and how it evolved to what it is today and its future to expect in the future.



Technology is changing our lives everyday and the Internet is one of the advances that you should welcome and not fear it. It is not going away.



Remember there is no stupid question, only people who don't want to learn. Thus we will start each class with questions that puzzle you.



A weekly outline that is not written in stone.

1. Open discussion and technology
2. I google 
3. Facebook/email/social media 
4. Games/memory
5. Travel
6. Bargains: restuarants, coupons
7. Trends on the Internet 
8. Browser updating 
9. Museums, the arts, education 
10. Things to do in New Jersey; plays, music, library, community news
11.  Cloud
12. How to put your photos on the Internet and so much more.
13. How to put your music collection on the Internet and so much more.
