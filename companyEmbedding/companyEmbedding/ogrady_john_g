O'GRADY, JOHN G.





O'GRADY, JOHN G. (1829–1879). John G. O'Grady, pioneer innkeeper, was born in Westport, Ireland, in 1829. He immigrated to Boston in 1848. Although he had studied for the priesthood, he decided in Boston to pursue medicine instead. He eventually traveled west, and in the early 1850s he served in the United States Infantry at what later became Fort McKavett in Menard County. There he attained the rank of sergeant and later opened a mercantile business. In 1856, while at the fort, he married Katherine Cahill of Tipperary, Ireland; they had eight children. When the fort closed in March 1859, the couple moved to Boerne, a stage stop on the military road from San Antonio to Fort Concho and Ben Ficklin. O'Grady supplied feed to government teams hauling freight and opened an adobe inn that he called Kendall House in honor of Kendall County, which he had helped organize. The inn was on the south bank of Cibolo Creek and on the east side of the road as it entered Boerne from San Antonio. According to legend, Robert E. Lee stopped at the inn on his last tour of duty for the United States in early 1860. In 1963 the remaining portion of the inn, then known as the Stotts House, received a historical marker. O'Grady often took part in the pursuit of Indians who made raids on settlements in the Boerne area. During the Civil War he served as postmaster of Boerne. In January and February 1872 he contributed a meteorological register to the Smithsonian Institution. The legislature listed him as a commissioner in the act to incorporate the San Antonio and Fredericksburg Narrow Gauge Railway Company in March 1875. O'Grady died in 1879. Two of his children, Robert Emmit and Alice, continued the hospitality of Kendall House at the Argyle Hotel in San Antonio.

About John G. O'grady

                            Dr John (Jack) Lake is (despite being only 43 years of age!) one of the foremost hepatologists practising in the US at this time. He is Professor of Medicine and Surgery, Director of the Gastroenterology Division and Medical Director of the Liver Transplant Program at the University of Minneapolis. He has a prodigious publications record, and is adviser and reviewer for a large number of professional journals. He was invited to join the editorial team by DrO'Grady, who identified him as the kind of young, dynamic individual whose enthusiasm and international reknown will attract top-grade international contributors to the project.Dr John O'Grady can be seen as Dr Lake's equivalent in the UK. He has recently taken over as Director of one of the World's most prestigious centres for the study of liver diseases - the Institute of Liver Studies at King's College Hospital, London. Like Dr Lake, he has a prodigious record of publications, and contributes extensively to high level texts in hepatology (he is one of the only UK-based contributors to Schiff & Schiff!) and transplantation.Dr Peter Howdle is a Senior Lecturer in Medicine at the University of Leeds, and Consultant Gastroenterologist at St James's University Hospital in Leeds. He was responsible forsetting up the Liver Transplant unit at St James's in 1990, and worked very closely with Dr O'Grady when he headed the unit (1992 to 1996). The unit carries out over 80 transplants per year. Dr Howdle has been a Visiting Lecturer at Harvard University Medical School, and has recently been appointed Professor of Clinical Education for the University of Leeds. He has been an Editor for Bailliere's International Practice and Research series in Clinical Gastroenterology - and hence has numerous contacts and a great deal of invaluable educational and editorial experience.O'Grady, Lake and Howdle -Comprehensive Clinical Hepatology8 Hotsheetshow more

The result is a book that, despite its complexity, is easy to read and understand. The nice figures, tables and charts allow a quick and easy interpretation of the concepts it offers to readers. I especially appreciated how easy it was to find the different items of information I need in my everyday activity as a hepatologist. A large number of books are available in hepatology. This one is an easy-to-use, ready reference not only for hepatologists but also for gastroenterologists, internists and family physicians who see patients with hepatic complaints. G.
