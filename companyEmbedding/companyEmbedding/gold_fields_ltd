Why ClubCorp Holdings, CF Industries Holdings, and Gold Fields International Jumped Today
These stocks supported the market on a quiet day. Find out why.











                Dan Caplinger
            

                (TMFGalagan)



            
            Jul 10, 2017 at 4:31PM
            
            





The stock market was narrowly mixed on Monday, but it returned to a quieter level of activity after several turbulent trading sessions last week. The Dow and S&P 500 both finished very close to the unchanged level, though the Nasdaq Composite posted more substantial gains of almost half a percent. Without much news to drive the market, many investors focused on the retail sector, where a key marketing campaign from the leading online retailer to attract new members had negative impacts on brick-and-mortar stores. Company-specific news also helped send some stocks higher, and ClubCorp Holdings (NYSE:MYCC), CF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF), and Gold Fields International (NYSE:GFI) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.
ClubCorp hits a hole-in-one
Shares of ClubCorp Holdings soared 30% after Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) said that it would spend $1.1 billion to purchase the country club and golf course operator. Under the terms of the deal, Apollo agreed to pay a strangely precise amount of $17.12 per share in cash for ClubCorp, and shares traded nearly all the way up to that price today. ClubCorp board chair John Beckert noted that the transaction "represents the culmination of our review of strategic alternatives and achieves our goal of enhancing value for shareholders." The golf course operator also believes that Apollo's support will help give members even better experiences, even if ClubCorp's shareholders won't be the ones to benefit further from continued success.

CF climbs toward the sun
CF Industries Holdings picked up 7% on a good day for fertilizer stocks in general. Prices in the corn market climbed to their highest levels in more than a year, with commodities market participants fearing that a lack of rainfall and hot weather in key U.S. growing regions could lead to less supply. Analysts expect higher corn prices to lift the price of fertilizers as well, and shareholders are hopeful that better pricing could lift CF and its peers out of their recent slump. Investors will have to hope that expected production-capacity shutdowns still take effect in order to help support higher prices. Even with today's gains, CF shares trade at only half where they did a couple years ago, and it will take considerably more good news to restore hard-hit investors' confidence in the stock.





Gold Fields looks brighter
Finally, shares of Gold Fields International climbed 7%. The gold mining company got a lift from a pause in the recent downturn in the gold market. Even though bullion prices rose only $2 per ounce to $1,214 today, they bounced back from an early drop, and investors seemed pleased that at least for now, the yellow metal didn't breach the $1,200-per-ounce level. Falling metals prices have accompanied moves from the Federal Reserve to pull back from its financial crisis-era policies of bond purchases, and the recent push higher in bond yields reawakened fears from precious-metals investors about the possible impact of further economic strength on the gold market. Gold Fields is still in good position to handle gold prices at current levels, but it will have to keep working hard to minimize costs in order to get as much profit as possible from its operations.

How Has Miners’ Volatility Trended in July?

Miners gain strength
Mining stocks have bounced back from the choppy markets seen over the past week. On July 17, most mining stocks saw an upward movement. It’s important for investors to understand crucial parameters such as volatility and the relative strength index (or RSI) in order to make sound investment decisions.
In this part, we’ll look at some important technical indicators for Royal Gold (RGLD), Gold Fields (GFI), Agnico-Eagle (AEM), and Silver Wheaton (SLW).

Implied volatility
Call implied volatility measures the change in the price of an asset with respect to variations in the price of its call option. On July 17, 2017, Royal Gold, Gold Fields, Agnico Eagle, and Silver Wheaton had implied volatilities of 28.1%, 46.1%, 35%, and 30.8%, respectively. Volatility in mining stocks is generally greater than precious metals’ volatility.



RSI
The relative strength index is used for analyzing whether an asset is overbought or oversold. If an RSI level is above 70, the asset may see a decline in price because it’s overbought. If an RSI level is below 30, the asset may be oversold and chances are that the price could rise soon.
Lately, the RSI levels of these four miners have rebounded. Royal Gold, Gold Fields, Agnico Eagle, and Silver Wheaton have marginal RSI levels of 64.1, 59.1, 37, and 41.3, respectively.
Leveraged gold and silver funds like the Direxion Daily Gold Miners ETF (NUGT) and the ProShares Ultra Silver ETF (AGQ) are also influenced by fluctuations in precious metal prices. These two funds fell 6.5% and 5.6%, respectively, on a five-day trailing basis due to the ongoing rebound in miners.

Gold Fields Ghana (GFG) Limited'sTarkwa Mine recently trained about 31 young people in mining-related skills in the Tarkwa-Nsuaem Municipality of the Western Region at a cost of over GHS300,000.
The initiative was, among other things, designed to equip the youth with employable skills and was undertaken by the Training and Development Centre (TDC) for the mining and gas industry.
The 31 youth, who formed the first batch to go through the programme, included two females.
They were trained in mining equipment operations, general mining safety and equipment, including mining equipment operating safety.
At the graduation ceremony at Tarkwa, Robert Siaw, Sustainable Development Manager, GFG, Tarkwa Mine, indicated that another batch of 30 people was billed for training in operating two mining machines this year.
He pointed out that engagements had already started in the communities, and that applications were opened to interested young men and women to apply.
He encouraged more women to take advantage of the training to enable them to become employable and also enhance their economic empowerment.
'We know that women, who operate heavy machines, are most likely to be more careful and diligent,' Mr Siaw said.
He explained that the training was not a sequel to employment in Gold Fields, but would provide them with an opportunity to be eligible for employment whenever there are opportunities for such skill-set anywhere in the world.
Mr. Siaw mentioned that the company was also operating a scholarship scheme to support brilliant needy children in its host communities to pursue secondary and tertiary education.
'Already, Gold Fields has a four-year apprenticeship programme for the youth to acquire skills in welding and fabrication, dressmaking, auto electrical and hairdressing,' he disclosed.
Many of these young men and women, who enrolled for that programme, fell off along the way; for instance, this year, only seven out of the 15 apprentices who enrolled graduated.
The mining company used the occasion to present four Yamaha motorbikes - two each to the municipal directorate of education at Tarkwa and the district directorate of education at Bogoso in the Prestea/Huni-Valley District of the region.
The four motorbikes, which cost GHS30,000.00, was to assist the education directorate in the two districts to enhance supervision for teaching and learning.(c)  2017 Media Trust Limited Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

How Analysts See South African Mining after 2Q17

				Jul 19, 2017				2:15 pm EDT            










AngloGold Ashanti’s rating changes
CIBC (Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce) downgraded AngloGold Ashanti (AU) from a “sector outperform” rating to “sector perform” on May 15, 2017. This downgrade was mainly due to the company’s weaker-than-expected results.
RBC Capital Markets downgraded AU’s stock from “outperform” to “sector perform” on April 24, 2017. The firm maintained that this was mainly a valuation call.

Goldman Sachs (GS) downgraded AngloGold from to “buy” to “neutral” on April 25, 2017. GS’s analyst sees the gold price (GLD) risk as skewed toward the downside.



Rating changes for Sibanye
Sibanye Gold (SBGL) restarted operations at its Cooke mine on July 3, 2017, following an unprotected strike that started in the mine on June 6, 2017. Sibanye Gold has not seen any major rating changes in the last few months.
Harmony Gold and Gold Fields
Deutsche Bank (DB) lowered Harmony Gold’s (HMY) rating from “hold” to “sell” on March 17, 2017. DB analyst Patrick Mann believes that the gold and platinum sectors are both fully valued.
On February 3, 2017, HSBC raised Harmony Gold’s (HMY) target price from 34 South African rands to 35 rands.
HSBC downgraded Gold Fields (GFI) to a “sell” rating from “moderate sell” on April 27, 2017.
RBC Capital Markets downgraded GFI from “sector perform” to “underperform” on April 24, 2017. RBC believes that while GFI offers attractive medium-term growth, it needs to invest a majority of its near-term free cash flow into projects to achieve that. This leaves the company with little scope to deleverage its balance sheet.

Slightly Sweet charges home to win Winter StakesSuperRacingApprentice Brandon Stockdale burns arm, misses winning rides after trying to shake off flu at SandownMATT STEWART, Herald SunJuly 19, 2017 4:44pmBRANDON Stockdale did not feel the wrath of stewards at Sandown on Wednesday but Stockdale was still in “hot water”.And in hospital, undoubtedly cursing as two rides he was forced to forfeit scored under replacement riders. Stockdale was taken to Dandenong Hospital after badly scolding his forearm on a bucket of hot water.The leading apprentice had been suffering flu-like symptoms and was provided a bucket and a towel by medical staff after he dismounted from his ride in the first race.Stockdale placed the bucket in front of him and the towel over his head, an impromptu sauna, and burned his arm while cradling the bucket.Victorian Jockeys’ Association chief executive Matt Hyland said Stockdale “was in a world of pain”. “It’s quite a severe burn,’’ he said, adding he was unsure if Stockdale would be able to ride at Flemington on Saturday.media_cameraJockey Brandon Stockdale was taken to hospital after scolding his forearm at Sandown on Wednesday.Stockdale’s rides included Gold Fields, in race five, and Gun Chase in the sixth. Gold Fields won for Ben Allen and Gun Chase scored for Jordan Grob.Meanwhile, Craig Williams and Beau Mertens emerged from the Sandown meeting on 72 wins apiece with just three meetings to go to decide the city premiership.Mertens had a frustrating day of six placegetters — including five seconds — and Williams scored one winner, the debutante Brahmos, to draw level with Mertens.Mertens’ second placegetters were Taqdees (r1), Bowerman (r2), Charlie Garcon (r6), Cismontane (r7) and Four Sisters (r8).In a quirky twist, Four Sisters ran second to Tassie longshot Miss It And A Bit, who was ridden by Stephanie Thornton for her first city winner. She is an employee of Four Sisters’ trainer Mick Kent.media_cameraCraig Williams drew level with Beau Mertens in the jockeys’ premiership race after riding Brahmos to victory at Sandown on Wednesday.INSIDE RUNNINGMatt Stewart and Michael ManleyBetting coup as grey bolts inTHE $41 to $11 plunge on Fully Maxed looked like confetti at the 300m at Sandown on Wednesday. But once balanced the grey flew home over 1000m and flogged his rivals.Trainer Shane Nichols played a straight bat when asked about the origins of the betting coup but he was impressed with Fully Maxed. “He really motored home,’’ Nicholls said.Brahmos to Williams’ aidTRAINER John Sadler had Craig Williams’ premiership in mind when he suggested Williams pop into Caulfield and ride unraced Brahmos in a gallop.Sadler suggested, “I might be able to help you out’’ when he asked Williams a week or so ago how many winners in front of him Beau Mertens was.Williams was impressed with Brahmos’ “feel’’ that morning and the three-year-old raced up to it with a strong debut win at Sandown.Sadler described Brahmos as a late maturer, a “big, dumb kid’’.Return of a stayers’ favouriteA RACE that Subzero won in 1991 — the Byerley Handicap for two-year-olds — returns to the racing calendar for the first time in 25 years at Flemington on Saturday.When Subzero won the race it was 2000m but two years afterwards it was removed from the calendar. This time it returns as an 1800m race as part of the VRC and Racing Victoria’s initiative to encourage more stayers.The winner of Saturday’s race will gain an automatic start in the Victoria Derby and if it’s a filly in the VRC Oaks. Nine horses — all maidens — have accepted to start in the race on Saturday.Darren Weir’s two-year-old filly Anchor Bid, who finished second to Royal Symphony, is favourite at $1.50 with TABCommentsnav_small_downnav_small_upPost CommentHide Commentsnav_small_downnav_small_up

Jagadeeshwar takes initiative to find solution to the ‘health hazard’ The curve and dip on the landscape of Kolar Gold Fields owing to mounds, some more than 100 feet high, are all that’s left of the mining operations that were stopped in 2001. The promise of gold has since faded, but residents complain that dust from the huge dumps of waste soil left after extracting the precious metal is a health hazard. These ‘cyanide mounds’, as the locals call them, are a slow poison that is causing people to suffer from respiratory-related diseases, said activists; a claim that health officials said is exaggerated.With no resolution in sight, M. Jagadeeshwar, Third Additional District and Sessions judge at KGF, expressed interest in finding a solution. At a meeting convened in his chamber on Monday, he asked officials of various departments to coordinate and draw an action plan to find a permanent solution.According to residents and local activists, 32 million tonnes of waste has been produced over a century and dumped at 16 locations in KGF. “For people living nearby, the problem worsens during the monsoon, and on windy days as they are forced to inhale the dust,” said a resident, and added that the period from June to August is particularly bad, with a rise in cases of bronchial disorders and allergies. Ashok Kumar, a trader at M.G. Market in KGF, alleged that the milk produced by cattle grazing in the area is polluted. “Vegetables in the markets are covered with dust, which is a cause for concern among buyers,” he said. Madan, who lives in New Mill Block, alleged that the authorities and people’s representatives were insensitive to the problem because 70% of the residents were Dalits.Allegations denied However, these allegations have been dismissed by health officials. R. Nanmathi Selvan, Officer on Special Duty, Bharat Gold Mines Ltd., said that waste dumps used to be maintained properly during mining operations through biological fencing and other measures. To the criticism that arsenic content of the mines adversely affected vegetation, animals and human beings, he said, “The waste and any arsenic content must have settled and become hard over the last 17 years. And since high density rocks were crushed during mining, there is not much chance of dust being dispersed by the winds. Movement of people over the mounds causes the soil to loosen.”Planting saplingsEfforts to plant saplings over the mounds to prevent dust from spreading did not yield much success. “A serious and scientific way needs to be found to solve the issue permanently,” said M. Gule Gowda, a farmer and activist involved in the legal battle on the issue. Now, residents are hoping that the initiative taken by Mr. Jagadeeshwar will yield a lasting resolution.Post a Comment More In KarnatakaKarnataka Related Articles << Previous Story‘Complete Tunga lift irrigation project works at the earliest’ Next Story >>BJP leader commits suicide in Belagavi Please Wait while comments are loading...

Gold Fields Ltd. Is Underperforming Its Peers, But Times Are Changing - Gold Fields Limited (NYSE:GFI) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Gold Fields Ltd. Is Underperforming Its Peers, But Times Are ChangingDec.19.16 | About: Gold Fields (GFI) Mining Geologist Base metals, gold & precious metals, oil & gas, commoditiesLinkedIn PageSummaryGold Fields Ltd. stock is, at the time of writing, resting near its 52-week low; the stock has shed all of its 2016 gains.Comparison to the other gold majors shows that Gold Fields is underperforming the industry.Gold Fields has lower debt and a higher all in sustaining cost (AISC) than most gold mining majors.The South Deep mine and Gold Fields' project development pipeline provide plenty of excess reserves and resources for long-term production.Unlike many of the gold majors, Gold Fields still has substantial room to improve its operating performance, making the stock worth considering at current prices.

 Source: Company Presentation, Energy and Mines 2014 Introduction As an investor, I cannot help but lean towards a contrarian approach. Rather than being drawn to companies that have been outperforming their industry in recent months, I look for companies that have been underperforming their industry, especially in terms of share price. I tend to like these companies for an investment thesis if I can convince myself that A. the ways in which the company is underperforming can be improved upon with time (i.e. it is not a fixed cost structure limiting financial results, rather it might be weak operating performance) and B. the company's management does not appear to be totally incompetent. From this perspective, I analyze the gold mining majors as they continue to shed their 2016 gains to a decreasing gold price, and I analyze one of the worst performers of 2016 in detail: Gold Fields Ltd. (NYSE:GFI). Gold Market Outlook The gold mining industry, in general, has been on a sharp downward trend since the election of president Donald Trump in the United States. His election seemed to have bolstered economic confidence, particularly in the manufacturing and mining industries (industrial metals, not precious metals). Precious metals, often viewed as a safe haven investment, typically maintain a negative correlation to market confidence. The price of gold has fallen from its highs approaching $1400/troy ounce (ozt) in June/July to $1,134/ozt at the time of writing:
 

 (Source: Infomine) Another macroeconomic factor affecting the gold price is the recent decision by the US federal government to raise interest rates by 25 basis points. The US government aims to maintain this trend of interest rate hiking into the future. An environment of increasing interest rates is generally viewed as negative for the price of gold, because gold is a non-interest bearing asset; higher interest rates will thus increase the appeal of keeping savings in an interest-generating savings account rather than in gold. However, as the Investopedia explains nicely, this correlation historically does not exist. The interest rate gold correlation can also be viewed from this perspective: the US federal government raises interest rates to calm an over-heating economy, encouraging US citizens to consider saving their money rather than spending or investing it. Thus, interest rates tend to rise during times of rapid, unstable economic expansion, i.e. during economic conditions leading up to a market crash. From this perspective, the higher the interest rate becomes, the closer the US economy has come to an inevitable market downturn, which in turn benefits the gold price. Either way, I take interest rates into little consideration when evaluating the future gold price. Lastly, a positive gold price macro-economic factor that is underway is that the annual production of gold is expected to shrink over the coming years because of reduced capital spending over the extended downturn in gold prices since 2011. In terms of simple supply and demand economics, decreasing gold production on a yearly basis should serve to boost the price of gold. Supply and demand economics only apply loosely to gold; however, because the large majority of produced gold is not truly consumed, rather it remains in bullion form as an investment and can be re-introduced to the gold supply/demand equation whenever people storing gold decide to sell.
 It is impossible to predict the future of the price of gold, but given the above headwinds and tailwinds, I am confident enough to potentially increase my position in gold miners on the presumption that the downside related to a decreasing gold price is currently limited. Gold Mining Major's Performance in 2016 With this thesis, I begin my look at the gold mining major's performance over the last year: 

 (Source: Scottrade.com) With Gold Fields stock price in purple (see the purple star for current yearly return), this chart demonstrates that Gold Fields is the only one of these major gold miners whose stock price has increased roughly 0% over the past year. Gold Fields is dramatically underperforming its peers: Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE:ABX), Kinross Gold Corp. (NYSE:KGC), Newmont Mining Corp. (NYSE:NEM), Yamana Gold Inc. (NYSE:AUY), and AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (NYSE:AU). The only company on this chart with a similar performance to Gold Fields is Goldcorp Inc. (NYSE:GG). To understand why this underperformance is occurring, I will compare several important metrics between these companies. It is important to note that the metrics below far from fully explain the share price movements of each stock; all of the gold majors have been actively working to improve their performance throughout the year via a myriad of actions, too numerous to cover here. Debt Debt load is important to consider when evaluating the share price performance of these gold mining majors, particularly during the massive mid-year upswing in the gold price. Stocks with a greater debt load are at a higher risk of default when the gold prices are low, thus they will experience more dramatic swings in share price when the price of gold moves. As summarized nicely in this Market Realist article comparing Barrick, Newmont, Goldcorp, Yamana Gold and Kinross, Barrick and Kinross carry the highest debt/equity and debt/asset ratios among these majors:
 

 (Source: Market Realist) It is no coincidence that Barrick and Kinross stocks have outperformed most of the gold majors over the past year. A quick look at Gold Fields' recent financial statements reveals a debt/equity ratio of 0.38 (38%) and a debt/asset ratio of 0.19 (19%): 

 (Source: Company Presentation) Total assets, shareholders' equity and net debt were used in the above calculations. These ratios, particularly the low debt/asset ratio, place Gold Fields Ltd. right alongside the debt position of Goldcorp and Yamana Gold. It is no surprise to see that the Gold Fields Ltd. share price has underperformed most majors; the company has less upside in an increasing gold price market as a result of its relatively low debt position (note: this also means the company has less downside in a decreasing gold price environment). To suggest that Gold Fields should be trading in the same price range that it was a year ago is questionable, however, when companies such as Barrick are still trading at a 100% premium to their share price a year ago. All In Sustaining Costs All in sustaining cost (AISC) is a valuable metric when evaluating the ability of a gold miner to generate free cash flow. This metric attempts to factor in expenses from every aspect of running a gold mining company (even those not directly related to a single mine's operation) to determine the profit margin a company is making per each ounce of gold mined. The AISC of a company's operations can drastically affect the profitability of the company, particularly in a low gold price environment. Companies with lower AISC will be better suited to a low gold price, whereas conversely companies with a higher AISC will have a greater leverage to a higher gold price. At the end of 2015, the AISC of the major gold miners was as follows:
 

 (Source: Mining.com) Perhaps Gold Fields' greatest challenge lies here: Gold Fields has one of the highest AISC values in the industry. The company continued to reduce its AISC into 2016 (as did all of the majors), but it still is around $1000/oz: 

 (Source: Company Presentation) With one of the highest AISC values in the industry, Gold Fields will struggle to remain profitable in a gold price environment that many of the gold majors can thrive in; not a positive outlook for the company. In terms of share price movement, this higher AISC provides a greater leverage to the gold price, perhaps explaining the substantial upswing in the share price in July/August (correlating to a higher gold price during that time). Goldcorp, on the other hand, having both low debt and a notably lower AISC of below $900/oz, experienced less leverage in its share price to the mid-year gold price increase, but also less downside when the gold price began retreating in the Fall. Gold Fields, a company with relatively low debt and poor assets compared to its peers; not exactly a solid investment thesis. Looking more closely into Gold Fields' operations may provide a different outlook, however. Gold Fields' Mining Operations Gold Fields' current mining operations falls into four regions, with additional regions where they have ongoing mining projects: 


 (Source: Company Presentation) 

 (Source: Company Website) In 2015, the large majority of production came from their mining operations in Australia and Ghana, whereas the vast majority of their reserves and resources come from the South African region, all attributable to the South Deep Mine, Gold Field's only operation there: 

 (Source: Company Presentation) The company also has significant polymetallic mineral resources in three project areas: Chile, Philippines and Finland. Gold Fields' highest grade production regions are South Africa and Australia: 

 

 (Source: Company Presentation) The high grade and massive reserve/resource size of the South Deep mine are promising for the long-term potential of Gold Fields; as reserves and resources decline, South Deep is likely to account for an increasing portion of Gold Fields production profile.
 Next, analysis of Gold Field's AISC by region: 

 (Source: Company Presentation) The AISC values from Ghana, Peru, and Australia of $999/oz, $765/oz, and $991/oz, respectively, are all competitive compared to other major gold miners. The blaring weakness here is the production from South Deep, with an AISC of $1289/oz and an all in cost (AIC) of $1317/oz. South Deep, although a promising mine with high grade and massive reserves and resources, is currently in the process of achieving stable production. During this production ramp-up, South Deep has been a major sore thumb in the operational and financial results of Gold Fields Ltd., and is likely responsible for much of the underperformance of Gold Fields' share price. The South Deep Gold Mine: Gold Fields' Upside Potential Since acquiring it in 2006, the South Deep gold mine has been a flagship asset and major focus for Gold Fields Ltd. Gold Fields' strategy for the mine when it acquired it was a long-term overhaul of the existing mine plan, replacing higher cost, more dangerous labor intensive mining with mechanized mining techniques. The mechanized mine plan projected 770,000 oz/year production until 2057, with the full mine life with lower production stages extending until 2080. With a combined reserves and resource estimate of 105.7 million ounces of gold, South Deep is the second largest gold resource in the world, behind only Freeport-McMoran's (NYSE:FCX) Grasberg mine (which surprisingly is a primary copper mine; gold is recovered as a by-product). The initial mine plan also forecasted AISC as low as $900/oz, which would significantly improve Gold Fields' cash flow if realized. However, achieving this nameplate operational capacity has proven to be excessively difficult over the past years, with accidents, a complicated ore body, trouble finding skilled labor, etc. continuing to delay the ramp-up of the mine. Gold Fields had forecast production at 289,000 oz for the year, but continued operational trouble, including an employee death in September, may result in lower production. Also in September, CEO Nick Holland announced that the production at Gold Fields' South Deep mine will be smaller than initially planned for at least the next three years, with a focus on stable production and profitability instead of high volume. The company is thus now expecting to fall short of the initial mine plan for the foreseeable future; however, a focus on profitability suggests the financial burden of this operation will continue to shrink (and reverse to a profit) going forward. Gold Fields plans to provide an updated operational outlook in February of 2017 for the South Deep Mine.
 Gold Fields Near-Term Catalysts Focusing on other operations, there are several recent news articles relevant to the near-term performance of Gold Fields. First, the government of Ghana recently decided to reduce their corporate tax rate from 35% to 32.5% and to adjust the gold production royalty rate from a fixed 5% to a sliding scale royalty rate: 

 (Source: Seeking Alpha contributor Alberto Abaterusso) This update is very good news for Gold Fields going forward, and provides much needed relief to the operating margins of its assets in Ghana. In light of this, Gold Fields has recently announced in November a plan to invest $1.4 billion dollars to extend the life of its Damang mine in Ghana from 2017-2024. In ironically similar news (in terms of capital investment), Gold Fields and Silver Standard Resources (NASDAQ:SSRI) have withdrawn a $1.4-billion dollar offer to buy Kirkland Lake Gold Inc. (OTCPK:KGILF); it seems that Gold Fields has opted to reinvest in its own projects instead. I would have liked to see this bid go through as Kirkland Lake Gold offers attractively high grade assets in Canada; however, Gold Fields has plenty of its own brownfield and greenfield projects to develop, so I am not concerned about this rejection. On December 8, Gold Fields announced the acquisition of a 50% stake and a 1.5% net smelter return royalty for the Gruyere gold project in Australia from Gold Road Resources Ltd. (OTCPK:ELKMF) for A$350 million, potentially adding half of the 6.2 million contained ounces of gold grading 1.3 grams/tonne to its future production profile in Australia. This acquisition, in addition to Gold Fields current projects in Finland, the Philippines, and Chile, provides a considerable development pipeline for Gold Fields.
 Investment Thesis The continued negative operational performance at South Deep and the struggle of the GFI stock price relative to other gold majors sparks my interest in the company from a value/contrarian perspective. The continued operating and financial troubles holding down the stock price of Gold Fields relative to other gold majors leaves significant room for operating/financial performance and stock price improvement that Gold Fields' peers are beginning to lack. When this improvement is realized (i.e. when the South Deep mine starts to close in on its nameplate capacity and AISC), Gold Fields has the potential to rapidly close in on its competitors in terms of operating and financial metrics, at which point GFI stock can be expected to outperform its peers. While it may be years yet until South Deep reaches 700,000oz/year production, I expect the operating metrics to improve drastically next year at the mine, in which case Gold Field's position amongst the gold majors will be re-evaluated. With plenty of projects in the investment pipeline and a massive reserve/resource base at South Deep, there is little concern for asset depletion at the current rate of production for Gold Fields. Competing gold majors (such as Barrick Gold) have earned substantial stock price appreciation relative to Gold Fields due to achieving lower AISC for their operations, utilization of asset sales to reduce debt, and achieving wider operating margins within the recent gold price spike, all of which has increased the financial strength of these companies (see Resource Sector Digest: Hail Barrick Edition). Gold Fields, on the other hand, was in less of a position of financial risk at the beginning of the year and continues to suffer from underwhelming operating results, leaving little to inspire share price appreciation. Over the course of the next year or two, however, times are destined to change. Gold Fields' operational and financial performance are bound to stabilize as the remaining complications with South Deep are worked out. In the meantime, reduced taxation in Ghana combined with a promising pipeline of mining projects pave the way for a stronger Gold Fields Ltd. going forward.

                    Big Fees for Little Credit                
Some companies issue cards with the sole intent of collecting fees from gullible customers, not offering them credit; gold miners are digging deeper and more.











                    Doubts Cloud Takeover Talk for Gold Fields                
A report that said the South African mining company Gold Fields was the target of a buyout offer may have been a hoax.











                    South African Mining Company Buying a Major Gold Reserve                
Gold Fields said that it would acquire a 50 percent stake in the South Africa’s South Deep mine from Barrick Gold of Toronto in a deal worth more than $1.5 billion.











                    Gold Fields Shareholders Reject a Merger                
Shareholders of the South African mining company Gold Fields rejected a bid to merge with Iamgold of Toronto Tuesday, a development that shifted investors' focus back to Harmony Gold Mining's hostile bid for Gold Fields. With the $2.1 billion Iamgold deal out of the way, Harmony, a rival South African gold miner, made clear it would reinvigorate its plan to purchase Gold Fields in an all-stock transaction worth about $6.25 billion. It had earlier said it would abandon its pursuit of Gold Fields if the Iamgold deal prevailed.











                    World Business Briefing | Africa: South Africa: Mine Company Resists Merger Bid                
Gold Fields Ltd. urged shareholders to reject a takeover bid of 44.9 billion rand ($7.4 billion) from its rival South African gold producer, the Harmony Gold Mining Company, saying it was too low and a takeover would weaken the company. The bid ''destroys shareholder value,'' said Ian Cockerill, left, the chief executive of Gold Fields. Harmony, which has posted three consecutive quarterly losses, is ''financially stretched'' and lacks the experience to run the combined company, he said. A spokesman for Harmony defended the bid, saying a merged company would attract a broad range of investors.











                    World Business Briefing | Africa: South Africa: Gold Miner Posts  A Loss                
The Harmony Gold Mining Company, which has bid to take over Gold Fields to become the world's biggest gold producer, posted a loss of 340 million rand ($55 million) in its most recent quarter, its fifth consecutive quarterly loss. The loss in its first quarter, which ended Sept. 30, was smaller than the loss of 559 million rand in the fourth quarter as the company cut jobs and shut unprofitable mine shafts. The company lost 119 million rand in the year-earlier quarter. Separately, Gold Fields said it would respond to Harmony's $8 billion takeover bid on Nov. 3.











                    South African Miner in Hostile Bid for Gold Fields                
Harmony Gold Mining, the largest miner of South African gold, made a hostile bid yesterday to acquire Gold Fields Ltd., another South African miner, for 52.9 billion rand ($8.2 billion) in stock, igniting a bitter takeover battle to create the world's largest gold producer. Gold Fields, with extensive worldwide holdings, is twice the size of Harmony. The unsolicited offer could derail a $2.1 billion merger deal reached in the summer to combine Gold Fields and Iamgold of Canada.











                    Gold Fields to Buy Iamgold, Fending Off Bidder From U.S.                
Gold Fields, the large gold producer based in Johannesburg, agreed Wednesday to buy the Iamgold Corporation, based in Toronto, in a stock swap valued at about $2.1 billion, fending off a competing bid from Golden Star Resources. Iamgold will issue 351.7 million shares and become part of a new, publicly traded Gold Fields unit led by Gordon R. Parker, 68, the former chairman of the Newmont Mining Corporation.











                    Russians Buy Gold Fields Mining Stake                
Norilsk Nickel said on Monday that it had acquired 20 percent of Gold Fields, the South African mining corporation, from Anglo-American for $1.16 billion in cash. The move, which took the industry by surprise, propels Norilsk, a large Russian metals producer little known in the West, into the top ranks of gold producers. ''Norilsk Nickel believes the purchase of a 20 percent stake in Gold Fields, with its world-class gold mining assets, to be an excellent investment,'' Leonid Rozhetskin, vice chairman for the management board of Norilsk Nickel, said in a written statement. ''We think particularly highly of Gold Fields' management.''











                    Black Group in South Africa To Buy Stake in Gold Mines                
Gold Fields, one of the world's largest gold miners, said yesterday that it had agreed to sell a 15 percent stake in its South African operations to Mvelaphanda Resources for 4.1 billion rand ($516.4 million). The transaction is one of the biggest so far in South Africa's six-year effort to expand the role of blacks in owning and operating the country's gold industry. ''Through this deal we will speedily achieve our stated objectives of putting together a black economic transaction which will transform Gold Fields,'' Ian Cockerill, the chief executive of Gold Fields, said in a statement to the Securities Exchange News Service in Johannesburg, where the company is based.














COMPANY NEWS

                    ANGLO AMERICAN TO ACQUIRE STAKES IN 2 MINING RIVALS                
Anglo American, one of the world's largest mining companies, has agreed to trade $863 million in nonmining assets for minority stakes in two competitors. Anglo will turn over three-quarters of its 20 percent stake in FirstRand, a major South African financial services company, to Remgro, a holding company for mining, financial and industrial interests. In exchange, it will get 7.1 percent of Billiton and 11.3 percent of Gold Fields. Anglo has shed assets worth about $1.6 billion this year to concentrate on mining and processing ore.










WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: AFRICA

                    PROFIT GROWS AT GOLD FIELDS LTD.                
Helped by improved efficiency at its mines and a decline in the value of the South African rand, Gold Fields Ltd., the world's third-largest producer of gold, reported that quarterly profits more than tripled to 370 million rand, or $53 million. The performance was considered especially strong in light of the languishing price of gold. Gold Fields has agreed to merge with the Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation of Canada and move its primary stock listing from Johannesburg to Toronto, but the merger has yet to be approved by South Africa. Henri E. Cauvin










INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS

                    A South African-Canadian Merger in Gold                
Gold Fields Ltd. became the first South African gold producer to merge with a foreign counterpart today, a deal with the Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation of Canada, creating a mining giant with a combined market value of $3.4 billion. The transaction partly reflects the global pressure on gold producers to combine and keep costs low, best positioning themselves for the possibility that the prolonged slump in gold prices will end.










WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: AFRICA

                    MINE STRIKE THREATENED                
South Africa's gold industry, the world's biggest, faces a nationwide strike in as little as two weeks unless managers retract plans to dismiss workers, the country's biggest mining union said. The National Union of Mineworkers threatened to expand a seven-day strike by 4,100 miners to protest proposed job cuts at Gold Fields Ltd., the world's second-biggest gold company, to include as many as 200,000 workers nationwide. South African gold companies, which have the highest average production costs in the industry, need to cut more than 80,000 jobs to survive with prices at a 20-year low, the Chamber of Mines says.

                    Big Fees for Little Credit                
Some companies issue cards with the sole intent of collecting fees from gullible customers, not offering them credit; gold miners are digging deeper and more.











                    Doubts Cloud Takeover Talk for Gold Fields                
A report that said the South African mining company Gold Fields was the target of a buyout offer may have been a hoax.











                    South African Mining Company Buying a Major Gold Reserve                
Gold Fields said that it would acquire a 50 percent stake in the South Africa’s South Deep mine from Barrick Gold of Toronto in a deal worth more than $1.5 billion.











                    Gold Fields Shareholders Reject a Merger                
Shareholders of the South African mining company Gold Fields rejected a bid to merge with Iamgold of Toronto Tuesday, a development that shifted investors' focus back to Harmony Gold Mining's hostile bid for Gold Fields. With the $2.1 billion Iamgold deal out of the way, Harmony, a rival South African gold miner, made clear it would reinvigorate its plan to purchase Gold Fields in an all-stock transaction worth about $6.25 billion. It had earlier said it would abandon its pursuit of Gold Fields if the Iamgold deal prevailed.











                    World Business Briefing | Africa: South Africa: Mine Company Resists Merger Bid                
Gold Fields Ltd. urged shareholders to reject a takeover bid of 44.9 billion rand ($7.4 billion) from its rival South African gold producer, the Harmony Gold Mining Company, saying it was too low and a takeover would weaken the company. The bid ''destroys shareholder value,'' said Ian Cockerill, left, the chief executive of Gold Fields. Harmony, which has posted three consecutive quarterly losses, is ''financially stretched'' and lacks the experience to run the combined company, he said. A spokesman for Harmony defended the bid, saying a merged company would attract a broad range of investors.











                    World Business Briefing | Africa: South Africa: Gold Miner Posts  A Loss                
The Harmony Gold Mining Company, which has bid to take over Gold Fields to become the world's biggest gold producer, posted a loss of 340 million rand ($55 million) in its most recent quarter, its fifth consecutive quarterly loss. The loss in its first quarter, which ended Sept. 30, was smaller than the loss of 559 million rand in the fourth quarter as the company cut jobs and shut unprofitable mine shafts. The company lost 119 million rand in the year-earlier quarter. Separately, Gold Fields said it would respond to Harmony's $8 billion takeover bid on Nov. 3.











                    South African Miner in Hostile Bid for Gold Fields                
Harmony Gold Mining, the largest miner of South African gold, made a hostile bid yesterday to acquire Gold Fields Ltd., another South African miner, for 52.9 billion rand ($8.2 billion) in stock, igniting a bitter takeover battle to create the world's largest gold producer. Gold Fields, with extensive worldwide holdings, is twice the size of Harmony. The unsolicited offer could derail a $2.1 billion merger deal reached in the summer to combine Gold Fields and Iamgold of Canada.











                    Gold Fields to Buy Iamgold, Fending Off Bidder From U.S.                
Gold Fields, the large gold producer based in Johannesburg, agreed Wednesday to buy the Iamgold Corporation, based in Toronto, in a stock swap valued at about $2.1 billion, fending off a competing bid from Golden Star Resources. Iamgold will issue 351.7 million shares and become part of a new, publicly traded Gold Fields unit led by Gordon R. Parker, 68, the former chairman of the Newmont Mining Corporation.











                    Russians Buy Gold Fields Mining Stake                
Norilsk Nickel said on Monday that it had acquired 20 percent of Gold Fields, the South African mining corporation, from Anglo-American for $1.16 billion in cash. The move, which took the industry by surprise, propels Norilsk, a large Russian metals producer little known in the West, into the top ranks of gold producers. ''Norilsk Nickel believes the purchase of a 20 percent stake in Gold Fields, with its world-class gold mining assets, to be an excellent investment,'' Leonid Rozhetskin, vice chairman for the management board of Norilsk Nickel, said in a written statement. ''We think particularly highly of Gold Fields' management.''











                    Black Group in South Africa To Buy Stake in Gold Mines                
Gold Fields, one of the world's largest gold miners, said yesterday that it had agreed to sell a 15 percent stake in its South African operations to Mvelaphanda Resources for 4.1 billion rand ($516.4 million). The transaction is one of the biggest so far in South Africa's six-year effort to expand the role of blacks in owning and operating the country's gold industry. ''Through this deal we will speedily achieve our stated objectives of putting together a black economic transaction which will transform Gold Fields,'' Ian Cockerill, the chief executive of Gold Fields, said in a statement to the Securities Exchange News Service in Johannesburg, where the company is based.













COMPANY NEWS

                    ANGLO AMERICAN TO ACQUIRE STAKES IN 2 MINING RIVALS                
Anglo American, one of the world's largest mining companies, has agreed to trade $863 million in nonmining assets for minority stakes in two competitors. Anglo will turn over three-quarters of its 20 percent stake in FirstRand, a major South African financial services company, to Remgro, a holding company for mining, financial and industrial interests. In exchange, it will get 7.1 percent of Billiton and 11.3 percent of Gold Fields. Anglo has shed assets worth about $1.6 billion this year to concentrate on mining and processing ore.










WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: AFRICA

                    PROFIT GROWS AT GOLD FIELDS LTD.                
Helped by improved efficiency at its mines and a decline in the value of the South African rand, Gold Fields Ltd., the world's third-largest producer of gold, reported that quarterly profits more than tripled to 370 million rand, or $53 million. The performance was considered especially strong in light of the languishing price of gold. Gold Fields has agreed to merge with the Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation of Canada and move its primary stock listing from Johannesburg to Toronto, but the merger has yet to be approved by South Africa. Henri E. Cauvin










INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS

                    A South African-Canadian Merger in Gold                
Gold Fields Ltd. became the first South African gold producer to merge with a foreign counterpart today, a deal with the Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation of Canada, creating a mining giant with a combined market value of $3.4 billion. The transaction partly reflects the global pressure on gold producers to combine and keep costs low, best positioning themselves for the possibility that the prolonged slump in gold prices will end.










WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: AFRICA

                    MINE STRIKE THREATENED                
South Africa's gold industry, the world's biggest, faces a nationwide strike in as little as two weeks unless managers retract plans to dismiss workers, the country's biggest mining union said. The National Union of Mineworkers threatened to expand a seven-day strike by 4,100 miners to protest proposed job cuts at Gold Fields Ltd., the world's second-biggest gold company, to include as many as 200,000 workers nationwide. South African gold companies, which have the highest average production costs in the industry, need to cut more than 80,000 jobs to survive with prices at a 20-year low, the Chamber of Mines says.

Gold Fields Limited is a South African gold mining firm, one of the world’s largest, which is listed on both the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The firm was formed in 1998 with the amalgamation of the gold assets of Gold Fields of South Africa Limited and Glencor Limited. As of the third quarter of 2014, Gold Field was the world's seventh-largest producer of gold.[3]
The company is headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa. It owns and operates mines in South Africa, Ghana, Australia and Peru. Its growth efforts are focused mainly in the regions where it already has a footprint and are mainly driven through brown fields exploration on its existing land positions and through opportunistic M&A in the same regions. Its chairperson is Cheryl Carolus and the CEO is Nick Holland.
