FedEx
FedEx is proud to deliver the FedExCup competition to golf fans. Now in its 10th season, the FedExCup is an exciting season-long points competition that has set a new standard for excellence and ushered in a thrilling new era for professional golf. Over the span of 47 events, players vie to become the FedExCup Champion, which distinguishes one player who not only performs well during the PGA TOUR Season, but also excels through the pressure of the four-event FedExCup Playoffs. Tiger Woods won the inaugural FedExCup in 2007 and again in 2009. Vijay Singh won the title in 2008 and Jim Furyk rose to the top in 2010. Bill Haas secured the title of 2011 FedExCup Champion with a brilliant save out of a greenside water hazard on the second hole of a sudden death playoff. Brandt Snedeker claimed the FedExCup in 2012, and Henrik Stenson took it home in 2013. In 2014, Billy Horschel had a remarkable FedExCup Playoffs performance by winning the BMW Championship and TOUR Championship by Coca-Cola back to back, and securing his spot as FedExCup Champion.  In 2015, Jordan Spieth was able to maintain the momentum he seemed to possess all season long, and rose to victory in Atlanta. With the strength of his putter alone, Spieth had an incredible performance at the TOUR Championship by Coca-Cola, and capped off his historic PGA TOUR season by becoming the youngest to ever take home the FedExCup in 2015. Most recently, Rory McIlroy came from three shots back with three holes to play to join a three-way playoff. His comeback was fueled by a 137-yard eagle hole out on No. 16. McIlroy went on to drain a birdie putt on the fourth playoff hole to win the 2016 FedExCup.
FedEx provides customers and businesses worldwide with a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services.  With annual revenues of $48 billion, the company offers integrated business applications through operating companies competing collectively and managed collaboratively, under the respected FedEx brand. Consistently ranked among the world's most admired and trusted employers, FedEx inspires its more than 325,000 team members to remain "absolutely, positively" focused on safety, the highest ethical and professional standards and the needs of their customers and communities.
