Tim Wallace




Having realised at 18 that following his dream to be a guitarist in a rock band might be "a bit tricky", Tim Wallace chose instead to pursue a slightly steadier career in design. Following his education at Middlesex University and the Royal College of Art, he has built an international reputation as one of the leading designers of office and healthcare furniture.

After completing a Master’s Degree at the Royal College of Art, Wallace spent more than a decade gaining experience working with companies in the UK, Europe, China and the US. In 1996, Wallace established Tim Wallace Design, and since then he has developed a strong international client list and a range of products unprecedented in their success. His designs are produced throughout the world and include award winning products such as Abak Environments for Herman Miller.
Working with many different cultures has been the catalyst for Wallace's love of exploring, which has served him well as a designer. Wallace believes that "new solutions are rarely obvious, but if you have a good grasp of what's involved, you significantly increase your chances of solving the problem well. To do that you must look at the problem from perspectives other than your own.” He explains: "It's very easy to get seduced by some nice little sketch," he says "but the image of a product is often the final part of the process. If you start this too early, you might miss an opportunity to discover something new”.

 ÂŠ Tim Wallace Design 2013





Having realised at 18 that following his dream to be a guitarist in a rock band might be "a bit tricky", Tim Wallace chose instead to pursue a slightly steadier career in design. Following his education at Middlesex University and the Royal College of Art he has built an international reputation as one of the leading designers of office and health care furniture.
 
After completing a Masters Degree at the Royal College of Art, Wallace spent more than a decade gaining experience working with companies in the UK, Europe, China and the US. In 1996 Wallace established Tim Wallace Design and since then he has developed a strong international client list and a range of products unprecedented in their success. His designs are produced throughout the world and include Abak Environments for Herman Miller, Chameleon and Crossover for UK manufacturer Senator International as well as Startline for India-based Wipro.
 
Working with many different cultures has been the catalyst for Wallace's love of exploring, which has served him well as a designer. "I like to gather information and learn about the issues from as many sources as possible," he says. "I do a lot of research before I start to design and carry on exploring and testing as we progress." Wallace believes that "new solutions are rarely obvious, but if you have a good grasp of what's involved, you significantly increase your chances of solving the problem well. To do that you have to look at the problem from perspectives other than your own". He explains "It's very easy to get seduced by some nice little sketch," he says "but once you've got this image in mind, you might miss something important."
 
Design Education:
 
1980-83  Royal College of Art - School of Furniture Design
               Master of Design (MDes RCA)
 
1977-80  Middlesex University
               Department of Furniture Design
               BA Hons Three Dimensional Design
 
Awards:
 
Best of NeoCon Gold Award, 2004 for Abak Environments
Design Guild Mark 2008 for Abak Environments
Best of NeoCon Innovation Award 2012 for Salus
India Design Mark for Startline 2012
