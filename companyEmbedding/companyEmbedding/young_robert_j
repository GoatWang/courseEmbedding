Executive Spotlight: Robert J. Young | doTERRA Essential Oils






















































Executive Spotlight: Robert J. Young

Founding Executive Product Marketing and Branding Services











Rate
							/ Comment




























Rob’s doTERRA® story began with a simple invitation to help. He says, “Some of the founders of doTERRA that I had worked with in other companies contacted me and asked for some marketing help. I was happy to, so I started out as an uncompensated friendly consultant. I didn’t mind—in fact, I was excited when they told me a little about the project. During that process, they asked me if I would consider leaving my consulting business to work with them full time and help them really get going. I was persuaded that they were doing something great for the future, so I talked to my wife and kids and made sure they felt good about it. I’ve been full-time ever since.” What is your role in doTERRA? I’m over product development, marketing, and branding services for doTERRA. I’m also responsible for the Healing Hands foundation, though the whole group of executives passionately manage the foundation as a team. What do you consider your biggest professional obstacle? I’m a little bit OCD. I like to make things as perfect as they can be. Sometimes I know I need to be a little more patient to let things develop, but I haven’t let go of that. Where do you see doTERRA in the future? I think our mission is sound, our value structure is firm, and we really could continue on the same path. The mission of introducing the world to essential oils—that every family ought to have oils as that obvious first healthy solution—is still our path. We’re happy with what we’ve done so far, we just want to keep going. Things continue to go well; there are also huge opportunities internationally. I hope the future is that as we get bigger and bigger we’ll do even more good in the world with our Healing Hands foundation. What are your life goals? First and foremost I want to be a good husband, and second I want to be a good father. And after that, if I can serve other people and be known for kindness and integrity, that’s good enough for me. Could you tell us something that few people know about you? I haven’t always been bald—I fired my hair before it had the chance to quit. I used to be an active triathlete with my wife, and during that time I started shaving my head because I was working out three times a day and hair just became an annoyance. I’m probably genetically bald now, but I didn’t start out that way. It was completely voluntary.Do you have a favorite quote? Something my grandfather, who was a famous professional musician, had on his letterhead: “Wonderful how life touches life and how boundless influence is.” I have tried to track the quote down to its original author but it remains a mystery. Random Facts Rob’s favorite place to travel is Hawaii.He and his wife like all sorts of outdoor activities, including mountain biking, running, and camping.Rob and his wife have five kids.

History of RJ Young




 




RJ Young started more than 60 years ago and continues to strongly into the future.

 
RJ Young is now one of the largest independent office equipment dealers in the country, operating in seven states throughout the Southeast, servicing a total of 19 locations and employing more than 500 people. 
Small but strong beginning
In 1955, Robert J. Young, Sr. and only four employees opened the doors of his new Ditto duplicating dealership. Twelve successful years later, RJ Young became a premier photocopier dealer and in 1977, added Ricoh, Canon, HP, Muratec and Océ product lines to its fleet.
Robert J. Young Sr. retired in 1986 after selling controlling interest in the company to John T. Crunk, who had started with the company in 1958. In 1996, Mr. Crunk became Chairman of the Board and his son, John T. Crunk, Jr. became President and Chief Executive Officer, thus continuing the tradition of the company being a family owned and operated business.
Updated name and offerings for new millennium
In 1999, the Robert J. Young Company condensed their name to the RJ Young Company. In the new millennium, RJ Young has continued to grow by acquiring locations throughout the Southeast to include Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida.
RJ Young has also expanded our business lines, including an onsite copy center, an off-site copy center program. Plus, through the acquisition of Chattanooga, TN based Preferred Computers, a managed IT services provider, RJ Young expanded to offer Managed IT Services. The expansion fit into RJ Young’s core competencies and serves as a natural transition to a services-led organization.                                                         
In early 2013, RJ Young announced a partnership with Samsung Electronics America Inc. to serve as an authorized BTA dealer offering Samsung’s portfolio of printing and multifunction devices, including the A4 and A3 products along with solutions to address the needs of customers from small businesses to enterprises throughout the Southeast.
Today, RJ Young continues to provide the best products and services to our clients while keeping a close eye on new technologies.
