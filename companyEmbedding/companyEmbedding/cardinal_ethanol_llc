					Full Description



Cardinal Ethanol, LLC, incorporated on February 7, 2005, is a producer of fuel-grade ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil and carbon dioxide. As of September 30, 2016, the Company produced approximately 120 million gallons of ethanol.EthanolThe Company's primary product is ethanol. Ethanol is ethyl alcohol, a fuel component, which is made from corn and various grains. The ethanol the Company produces is manufactured from corn. Ethanol is used as an octane enhancer in fuels, an oxygenated fuel additive for the purpose of reducing ozone and carbon monoxide emissions, and a non-petroleum-based gasoline substitute. The principal markets for the Company's ethanol are petroleum terminals in the northeastern United States.Distillers GrainsThe principal co-product of the ethanol production process is distillers grains, a high protein animal feed supplement primarily marketed to the dairy, beef, poultry and swine industries. Dry mill ethanol processing creates three forms of distillers grains: Distillers Wet Grains with Solubles (DWS), Distillers Modified Wet Grains with Solubles (DMWS) and Distillers Dried Grains with Solubles (DDGS). DWS is processed corn mash. DWS has a shelf life of approximately three days and can be sold only to farms within the vicinity of an ethanol plant. DMWS is DWS, which has been dried to approximately 50% moisture. DMWS has a shelf life of approximately 10 days and are sold to nearby markets. DDGS is DWS, which has been dried between 10% and 12% moisture. DDGS has an almost indefinite shelf life, and may be sold and shipped to any market.Corn OilThe corn oil that the Company produces is not food grade corn oil and it cannot be used for human consumption. It can be used as the feedstock to produce biodiesel, as a feed ingredient and has other industrial uses. It distributes corn oil to end users and third party brokers in the domestic market.Carbon DioxideThe Company also sells carbon dioxide gas. The Company sells carbon dioxide to Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., which operates a carbon dioxide liquefaction plant on the Company's property.The Company competes with Archer Daniels Midland, Flint Hill Resources LP, Green Plains Renewable Energy, POET Biorefining and Valero Renewable Fuels.

Cardinal Ethanol, LLC Begins Production in Indiana
								
				Press Release -- Union City, IN – November 3, 2008 – Cardinal Ethanol, LLC today officially began production marking the 100 million gallon per year biorefinery as the 12th ethanol facility in production in Indiana. Indiana is the fifth largest producer of ethanol, and with the addition of Cardinal Ethanol, now produces more than 1.1 billion gallons of ethanol per year. This $150 million facility is the largest investment by a corporation in Randolph County, Indiana.
"It is with a tremendous source of pride that Cardinal Ethanol now occupies a critical role in our local community's economic revitalization and our country's drive for energy security," said Troy Prescott, president of Cardinal Ethanol, LLC. "The ethanol industry now provides more than half of our country's renewable energy, and we're proud to be a part of a team that is working toward the day that America will no longer have to rely on hostile countries for its energy needs."

Cardinal Ethanol, located in East Central Indiana, near Union City, will employ 48 full time employees. The plant will create demand for 36,000,000 bushels of corn each year, much of it from the local area. Approximately 340,000 tons of dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) will be produced annually, which will be marketed to livestock and poultry producers as a value-added nutritional supplement.

"Despite the recent drop in energy prices, it is more critical than ever for America to remain committed to the increase of sustainable fuels and forward in the creation of a balanced energy portfolio. Today, ethanol is the only significant available renewable fuel option for the fuel transportation market and will remain a critical element in our move to energy independence," said Toni Nuernberg, executive director of the Ethanol Promotion and Information Council (EPIC). "Cardinal Ethanol now joins the group of ethanol producers who are helping secure America’s economic and energy future."
