North Bay Resources Inc.

North Bay Resources Inc. (OTC: NBRI) is a fully-reporting natural resources exploration company 
with current 
projects in North America.


In British Columbia, the Company holds 100%-ownership of a multitude of significant mining 
properties. These include two 
gold-platinum placers, the Fraser River Project and the Monte Cristo, and lode projects such as the advanced-stage 
Mount Washington Project on Vancouver Island, the Coronation 
Gold project in the historic Slocan Mining district, and the Tulameen Platinum Project near Princeton, BC.  In addition to its 
many precious metal projects, the Company also owns additional prospective projects that host strategic mineral resources such 
as Vanadium, Crystalline Flake Graphite, and Rare Earth Elements (REE).

 The Company's mission is to build a portfolio of viable mining prospects throughout the world 
and   developing them through subsidiaries and JV partners to their full economic potential. Join us.  Our future is 
golden! 

















Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors -The United 
States 
Securities and Exchange Commission permits U.S. mining companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only those 
mineral deposits that a company can economically and legally extract or produce. We use certain terms on this website (or 
press releases), such as "measured," "indicated," and "inferred" "resources," which 
the SEC guidelines strictly prohibit U.S. registered companies from including in their filings with the SEC. U.S. Investors 
are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form S-1 and subsequent Form 10-K which may be secured from us, or from 
our website at http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml. This web site also contains information about adjacent properties on which we 
have no right to explore or mine. We advise U.S. investors that the SEC's mining guidelines strictly prohibit information of 
this type in documents filed with SEC. U.S. investors are cautioned that mineral deposits on adjacent properties are not 
indicative of mineral deposits on our properties.

Metals & Mining Company Research Reports


Mining companies, as a rule, carry out such activities as the discovery of reserves, their mining and processing.  Various geological materials are mined – be it coal, gold or silver ore, chromite, salt, and a far more. Some companies specialize on certain products (e.g. metals or minerals), but the industry behemoths offer goods belonging to different product categories.  
Companies active in the mining industry vary according to the size and types of their operations.  Nevertheless, the market is dominated by manufacturers receiving over USD 500 million in revenues annually. BHP Billiton, Vale, Rio Tinto, Shenhua and Suncor are amid companies determining the path of the industry. 
The Catalogue is full of innumerable research reports containing profiles of the major and minor companies involved in metals and mining industries. Besides containing all-inclusive profiles of metals and mineral companies, reports offer unique data on companies’ strengths and weaknesses, financial performance, recent developments and future prospects. Detailed discussions of legal and political framework, product offerings and key competitors are also available in the research studies.
