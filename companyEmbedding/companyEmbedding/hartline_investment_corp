      Our History    

Hartline Investment Corporation was founded in 1990 by William G. Hart, CFA, CIC. Bill was the former CEO of Continental Capital Management Corporation, in Chicago, Illinois. Hartline began its investment management business with 12 institutional clients and $70 million in assets under management. Since then, Hartline has added services for individuals and families and has grown rapidly, primarily by referral. In addition to the Chicago headquarters, Hartline has added a second office in Kenilworth, Illinois, and intends to soon open a third office in Munising, Michigan, a beautiful and friendly community in the Upper Peninsula where Bill visits throughout the year. Hartline brings its client-centered approach to clients anywhere in the United States. Currently, Hartline manages approximately $350 million in clients’ assets in Arizona, Kansas, Nebraska, Washington, Oregon, California, Texas, Colorado, Montana, Missouri, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, New York, West Virginia, and Florida.
The Hartline name is an extension of William Hart’s last name combined with line. The term hart dates back to an old English word used to denote a male deer, typically a mature red deer. The old English term is carried on today as an element of Hartline’s logo. The line portion of the title signifies a way of thinking, as in line of thought, and as an element of charting course and establishing direction. The line on the map that traces the journey, in this case of financial success, is different for everyone. The hart line is simply the personal line to each client’s objectives.
The Logo of two harts charging against one another expresses the dichotomies of investing, in contrast to the bull and the bear that describe markets in terms of direction. The harts depict conflicting alternatives that are not necessarily good or bad, but simply the opposite sides of an issue. It may be the established versus the innovative, or the risk versus the return. Many important investing decisions result from consideration of the conflicting choices. Resolving alternatives or combining opposing forces focuses attention on the critical issues in the purchase or sale decision.

      Our Practice    

Hartline uses a comparative process to determine the most attractive asset classes at particular points in time. By this, we mean that expected returns are measured for each asset class. Then, the returns are compared with historical data to determine the amount of expected return or risk assumed in the various asset classes. In this way, we can make allocations among asset classes, which maximize the potential return of the portfolio against the risk assumed within the ranges acceptable to each client. Available asset classes include:

Common Stocks
Stock Options
Preferred Stocks
Real Estate Investment Trusts
Corporate, Government, Municipal, Agency, and Collateralized Bonds
Insurance Alternatives
Money Market Securities
