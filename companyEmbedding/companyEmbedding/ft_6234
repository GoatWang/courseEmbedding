Business is Booming in Downtown Billings, MT

                    I recently listed a two-story downtown loft in the historic Oliver Building in Billings. We don't have a lot of properties like that in this small city, but that's a situation that looks likely to change. 

If you're at all au fait with real estate you will know that listing agents use a comparative market analysis (CMA) tool to determine the asking price of a properly. So when I came to list Unit 307 at 2702 Montana Ave, Billings, I really struggled to find comparable homes.

Well with determination, frustration and some divine inspiration I settled on an asking price of $289,000 for the 1,700 sq ft unit. So far we've attracted a good bit of interest. But more surprisingly we've seen similar homes his the market in recent weeks. Looking at those home in comparison to my listing, I'm happy to say my price per square foot is highly competitive and we should be getting an offer soon.

So to return to my original statement, it does look as if things are beginning to come alive in the downtown residential property market. It would be great to see the city come to life outside of business hours. I'm sure it will be a busy, vibrant place for people who don't want the ubiquitous suburban rancher. 

Please check out my listing and let me know if this kind of lifestyle would suit you. We will also be listing similar properties in the future, and if you're into something bigger, please let me know as we are also looking at selling former commercial sites for residential use.

                    My favorite places to take family and friends, and I encourage my clients also is to take in, the Alamo, walk around it, read about it, and then go across the street, down some steps to the San Antonio River.   I love this area, good food, good music, some pretty good jazz,  good shopping and lots of flavor of San Antonio.  If you want to take a day trip around the historical missions,  rent a bike and take a ride.   So much history of this area surrounds these missions and they are fun to visit and a great day trip on the bike, or an afternoon in a car. Of course the Majestic Theater and the new Tobin Center of Performing Arts should be at the top of your list to visit.

                    Buying the right home can be very challenging these days.  How's it working for you?  In my past experience, what I've found is that most agents just don't have a plan to help their buyers.  
My technique may be a little different, but my buyers ALWAYS find exactly what they've been dreaming about.  How?  I take the time and sit down with you and your family and really get to know you during a consultation.  I will only show you properties that matches what you want.  I will negotiate aggressively on your behalf.  I will help make the process as stress free as possible.  Hire me and you'll recognize that I do so much more than the average agent!

                    San Antonio is a great town with a diverse population. There is something here for everyone. If you are a foodie, you should check out the hot new restaurants in Southtown. Love craft beer and live music, check out the Alamo Beer Company. Love local fare, you have to head out to the Pearl Market at the Pearl Brewery. Want to immerse yourself in the culture, set your sights on Market Square. Lastly, San Antonio has the River Walk once described as the American Venice! On the River Walk one can take a river boat tour, grab a margarita at one of the many restaurants that line the river, ghost hunt at the historic Menger, visit the Alamo where Davy Crockett and the Texian Army took their last stand against Santa Anna and so much more. Once you get here you'll never want to leave, trust me, I'm a transplant!

SnapLock Gutter System®                                                                           Architects & Commercial                               Application          Current Maximum Load/ Weight                                 Capacity is as follows: 1-Gallon of Water Weighs 8.3 Ibs.  5" Gutters -                                 .6234 gal. per ft. = 5.21Ibs. per foot of gutter 6" Gutters -                                 .92 gal. per ft. = 7.6 lbs. per running ft. of                                 gutter.  Product Testing Inc. performed an independent                                 test of the SnapLock Gutter System® and found                                 that the load capacity when using the SnapLock                                 Gutter System® was 11.3 times or 1130% greater                                 than that of 5" gutters at full capacity                                 and 7.6 times or 760% greater than that of 6"                                 gutters at full capacity. These tests prove that                                 the SnapLock system will not only handle the                                 weight of a gutter full of water, but it can also                                 take on heavy gutter loads caused by ice and snow. Product Testing Inc. is certified with the Florida                                 State Board of Professional Engineers under Certificate                                 No. EB-0006775 and with the Building Code Compliance                                 Office, Miami-Dade County, Administrative Order                                 10-3 under Laboratory Certification No. 06-1121.06.
