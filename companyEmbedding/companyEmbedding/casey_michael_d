Ava's Tagless Horror With Carters: Letter From Carters CEO, Michael Casey

Ava's Tagless Horror With Carters


















Wednesday, October 22, 2008







Letter From Carters CEO, Michael Casey





Today a letter arrived at our home via Federal Express from Carters’ CEO, Michael Casey. It was handwritten and on the Carters’ CEO letterhead. Here is the content of the note:10-23-08 Dear Mr. (our last name), I received your email yesterday. I am very sorry to hear that your daughter developed a rash while wearing a Carter’s garment. As a father of six children, I care deeply about the safety & health of children. I want to assure you that we are thoroughly investing (sic) the cause of the rash. I am committed to regaining your trust in our products. I hope you’ll give us that opportunity. Sincerely, / s /Mike Casey This letter was sent via FedEx, and the footnote on the letterhead reads: Michael C. Casey Chief Executive Officer 1170 Peachtree Street, Suite 900, Atlanta,  Georgia 30309Telephone 404-745-2802 Fax 404-892-3079 Email mike.casey@carters.com NYSE Listed: CRI     Here is my response, sent via email tonight: Dear Mr. Casey, Thank you for your letter. First, our baby Ava did not develop a rash.  She was chemically burned by the Carters clothes she wore.  Our pediatrician confirmed she suffered a chemical burn and not a rash.  Secondly, a Carters tagless product recall and public disclosure is the only solution, which you failed to address in your letter. You are a father of six children, how many more families and babies are you willing to sacrifice? Lastly, you cannot regain our or the public’s trust in your Carters brand until you act appropriately.  We will not stop our relentless pursuit to publicize this issue until you and Carters take immediate and appropriate actions. Your products injured our baby and many others. The statistical rate of reported injuries should be an irrelevant factor in you and your company’s decision to disclose this hazard and recall your product. Do the right thing. Sincerely,/ s /

Excellent response to a utterly pointless, disingeous letter from the CEO. It's interesting how CEOs seem to think that personal attention--regardless of how fleeting and how insubstantial--from a CEO will make a consumer feel grateful. Your response was perfect.

I just want you to know, that my daughter didn't suffer from burns like yours did. HOWEVER, whem I first read about this issue I went through all her clothes & set aside all the "problem" ones, contacted carter's & was told they would send me an envelope to send the clothing to them to get a refund. That was 3 weeks ago. I ended up sewing medical tape over the items, b/c I dont want to deal with this company.I read the update (including yur letter) on ZRecs today, and wanted to let you know that even though my daughter didn't suffer, I will NEVER give any money to Carter's again. To say they handled this badly is puttting it mildly.I have also passed around the story to family & friends, and hopefully it will affect their choices in purchases in the future. If we won't protect our kids, who will?

I will add your blog to my own so other mommies and daddies are aware of the problem - your return response to that pointless dribble from the 'CHIEF' was well stated and timely.  Keep on 'em!

I appreciate all of your support.  Carters CEO, Michael Casey, can't win us over with a handwritten note.  He needs to issue a corporate mandate to recall these defective clothes!  The public advisory and statements have not even reach Carters' retail stores (just updated my blog with a victim's account).  It's truly shameful.  Thank you for helping to share this information!

My infant has also developed the born in the last 24 hours. EXACT location of the "tagless." I am waiting for morning to call Carters but have already sent an email to EVERYONE I know, commented to everyone on Facebook and have demanded and will continue to demand a RECALL!! Parents today use Born Free Plastic Bottles, PVC free plastics etc....why can't we demand that they make safer clothing for our babies!!! Carters is already saving millions having these clothes manufactured in China, are they really that cheap that they have to cut costs at the expense of infants.

Dear C ~ I echo your frustration and outrage about this hideous corporate practice.  It is truly amazing that this company is making money off of our babies' backs!  I am also sorry to hear that your child has been affected.  Please continue to spread the word any way you can.  I started this blog to share our own experience in hopes it would save other babies and their families from this terrible experience and injury. Good luck to you!

Did you contact the CPSC?  The Consumer Product Safety Commission is there to protect the public from products that are deemed 'unsafe'.  This certainly fits that catagory.  They will make sure that the product(s) in question will be removed from the market place.  I wish you and your baby well.

Dear Anonymous:  Yes, the CPSC is informed & came out with a statement in conjuction with Carters warning consumers that babies may be affected.  Unfortunately it came too late for daughter and many other families.

Why did I start this dia(blog)?

Since my daughter, Ava, was 6 weeks old, we started noticing redness on her back (around her neck and between her shoulders). Instead of enjoying these first couple months of our baby's arrival into our lives, we began a nightmare into what was causing this growing wound on her back. We spent many days and nights comforting her, going to the doctors' appointments, the emergency room, after-hours medical appointments, using many methods and medications to try and soothe her pain. At barely 3 months old, Ava's wound was the worse we'd ever seen it. She could not sleep on her back and was not yet rolling over. We had to hold her to give her the comfort of rest. At this pediatrician's appointment, they looked at her and said they'd never seen something so big! It was terrifying. The doctors told us to immediately go to the hospital, because the wound was so big it might be infected (we discovered through the cultures taken at the hospital that Ava caught a staph infection!) and our daughter might not be able to fight it on her own. We rushed to UCSF Children's Hospital where Ava was put in a sterile hospital room (anyone entering had to wear gloves, a mask & gown). She was given IV antibiotics and monitored. I spent the night with her, but didn't sleep at all. What parent could? I rattled my mind wondering what this was, how it happened and if my daughter would be okay. Even after she was released from the hospital, she still had this painful chronic back wound. We cut the area of her clothing that covered this pear-shape wound to apply the topical treatments and closely monitor her recovery. We continued to go to her Dr.'s appointments and they still could not figure out why she had this chronic back wound.Last month (September 2008), I was perusing through the Internet and discovered several blogs on babies being affected by Carters tagless clothing. This ah-ha! moment brought to light the months of unanswered questions to my daughter's wound -- it was the Carters tagless clothes she wore that caused it. We immediately removed all Carters clothes and switched to the old type of labeled baby clothes. Her back wound is healing. She is now almost 7 months old. We have spoken to Carters, the media, and to many parents whose babies have been affected. It is my hope and intention that this becomes a more public dialogue where Carters and any other baby manufacturer and/or distributor that becomes aware their products are causing injury or harm to babies/children and their families inform the public, and immediately recall and remove these products!
