	A-tisket, a-tasket, a happy yellow basket! A cheerful gift basket for birthdays or anytime you want to send sunshine, it nearly overflows with big lilies, gerberas and roses. A pretty butterfly floats over the basket, reminiscent of a summer picnic.

	A natural brown basket is packed with yellow lilies, gerberas, roses, button spray chrysanthemums, carnations and delicate green leaves. Approximately 12" W x 11" H

Substitution Policy

	Occasionally, substitutions of flowers and/or vase are necessary due to temporary, regional availability issues. If this is the case with the gift you've selected, our experienced florists will ensure that the style, theme and color scheme of your arrangement is preserved and will only substitute items of equal or greater value.

U.S. producer of Pur Java products is expanding its self-distribution territories in three states as it continues to accelerate the pace of growth in 2016.After several months of researching crowdfunding sites, we selected the Kickstarter community for our crowdfunding needs. We feel that the Kickstarter crowdfunding community platform aligns with our outreach strategy of building a better community infrastructure of products that are centered around people getting to know each other’s identities, desires and life experiences. The Kickstarter filtering process helps to ensure we have a high quality, successful campaign that will move our vision forward.   In September of 2015, we took our improved Pur Java concentrate and Joe Fizz Coffee Soda to Hy-Vee Inc. supermarket, Health Food Associates/Akins and Vitamin Cottage/Natural Grocers stores. After signing proper vendor agreement, we began to supply the chain stores with our products in the Midwest Area and we all celebrated our largest commercial deals. “Together with the crowdfunding community as our partners, we can change the landscape of the U.S. Beverage Industry,” said Primo Galicia, president and CEO, The Basket Is Full, Inc.“We are all excited to further advance our efforts to balance national scale and local capability, which will help us significantly increase our leadership and enhance our competitive advantage in the U.S. beverage industry.” Six month ago, Mark Metzger, Nancy and Primo Galicia were in Lincoln, Nebraska filing incorporation documents for The Basket Is Full, Inc.  We knew we had a great product and we just had to get it in front of as many customers as possible.”With an enduring commitment to building sustainable communities, our Company is focused on initiatives that reduce our environmental footprint, support active healthy living, create a safe and inclusive work environment for our associates to enhance the economic development of the communities where we operate.About The Basket Is Full, Inc.:The Basket Is Full, Inc. is a leading producer, self-distributor and marketer of Pur Java coffee beverage, tea and soda products in North America.
