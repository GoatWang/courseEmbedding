Usually can work with your department to schedule time off for vacations, events ahead of time. Facilities and break rooms always clean. I was able to read/study on down time, but that's different in other departments. They give away furniture every few months, a lot of it is in good condition or even new. Unless you are IT or on the production line it's M-F 8-5, which I loved. I'd recommend this to someone who is finishing school or looking for a more permanent position.ConsThe CEO micro-manages everyone. Down to the warehouse workers. The benefits package is garbage, no maternity leave, minuscule amount of PTO, pay is terrible. I only received a $.16 raise in my 3 years there despite getting a degree while there. Managers really dont have much power, so executives have to approve everything you do. There's no room for advancement.Advice to ManagementLower management, keep caring about your employees. It's very much appreciated and noticed!!! Upper management, get off your high horses. You're really not the most important beings in the world.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Nutraceutical Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Nutraceutical 2016-09-23 10:57 PDT Jun 1, 2016"Flexible, great for students and workforce"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Sales Associate in Columbus, GACurrent Employee - Sales Associate in Columbus, GARecommendsPositive OutlookI have been working at Nutraceutical part-time (More than 5 years)Prosvery flexible schedule, easy products to sell, willing to transfer, scholarships offered, benefits to full time workersConsnot a lot of traffic in the storesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Nutraceutical Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Nutraceutical 2016-06-01 10:52 PDT Join the Nutraceutical team See Our Latest Jobs May 19, 2016"Great Company"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Marketing Coordinator (Brand) in Salt Lake City, UTCurrent Employee - Marketing Coordinator (Brand) in Salt Lake City, UTRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOProsVery stable, great co-workers, opportunity for advancement if you take initiativeConsEmployees need to be held more accountableAdvice to ManagementWork on improved communication with the rank & fileShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Nutraceutical Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Nutraceutical 2016-05-19 13:28 PDT Apr 27, 2016"Operations Leader"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Ogden, UTCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Ogden, UTRecommendsPositive OutlookI have been working at Nutraceutical full-time (More than a year)ProsGreat place to work, fun and able to build lasting relationships with employees for there future.ConsN/A at this point.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Nutraceutical Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Nutraceutical 2016-04-27 09:40 PDT Mar 1, 2016"Great Products"StarStarStarStarStarCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Gresham, ORCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Gresham, ORI have been working at Nutraceutical (More than 3 years)ProsAwesome brands with a lot of varietyConsVery little direction or help when you need itAdvice to ManagementCommunication would be helpfulShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Nutraceutical Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Nutraceutical 2016-03-01 12:07 PST Mar 3, 2016 Helpful (4)"Stay Away"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Ogden, UTFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Ogden, UTDoesn't RecommendNeutral OutlookDisapproves of CEOProsI did not experienced any positive aspects of this company.ConsTerrible business ethics.

Occupation
Business Executive


Frank William "Bill" Gay (September 11, 1920 – May 21, 2007) was an American executive who oversaw several entities for Howard Hughes. He was chairman of the board of directors of the Hughes Air Corporation. He served as a senior vice president and member of the board of directors for the Hughes Tool Company. He was also president and chief executive officer of Summa Corporation.
Born in Salt Lake City, Utah, he was a student at University of California, Los Angeles when he was hired by Hughes. He was responsible for the creation of Hughes Dynamics, a short-lived computer services subsidiary of Hughes Tool in the early 1960s.[1][2] A member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Gay put together the so-called "Mormon Mafia" that comprised Hughes's inner circle in his later life. Appointed by the Delaware Court of Chancery, Gay served as trustee of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute from 1984 until his retirement in 2006. He had previously served on the Institute's executive committee from 1971-1984.[3]
He was an active supporter of the Boy Scouts of America.
His son is Robert C. Gay, a co-founder and CEO of Huntsman Gay Global Capital, and before that managing director of Bain Capital for sixteen years.
Gay died in Kingwood, Texas.[4]
