SJF Ventures has raised $125 million for its fourth oversubscribed fund. SJV Ventures IV LP will focus on economically and socially responsible companies. The fund’s limited partners include two dozen foundation endowments, family offices, funds-of-funds and pensions.
PRESS RELEASE
DURHAM, N.C., Dec. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — SJF Ventures has closed SJF Ventures IV, L.P., a $125 million fund investing in high-growth companies creating a healthier, smarter and cleaner future. The oversubscribed fund will build on proven impact investment strategies from three previous SJF funds that have delivered superior financial returns and driven sizable positive impacts in clean energy and climate change mitigation, asset recovery and recycling, sustainable food and agriculture, education, health and wellness, and quality job creation. SJF has offices in Durham, New York and San Francisco and invests throughout the U.S.
Limited partners subscribing to SJF Ventures IV include more than two dozen foundation endowments, along with leading family offices, funds of funds, pensions and individuals active in impact investing. “We are thrilled to bring together this assembly of impact investors to help us support highly successful businesses driving lasting, positive changes,” said Dave Kirkpatrick, SJF Ventures Managing Director. “Fundraising went quite quickly due to SJF’s track record but also to the work of many to educate mainstream investors on impact investing.” 





Founded in 1999, SJF Ventures has invested in 52 portfolio companies across three funds. Representative portfolio businesses include NEXTracker, which has delivered more than 4 gigawatts of solar tracking systems globally; intelligent infrastructure provider Novinium, which has rejuvenated over 150 million feet of underground power cable in situ; circular economy leader Optoro, whose reverse logistics platform has allowed retailers to save 60% of the waste and 31% of the carbon footprint of returned goods; sustainable food producer Vital Farms, which is the nation’s largest provider of pasture-raised eggs; preventative health leader Solera Health, which has created a marketplace that connects the 86 million U.S. adults at risk for type 2 diabetes with thousands of community and virtual wellness providers; education technology company Raise, where over 320,000 students – representing 1 out of 2 high schools in America – have signed up to earn ‘micro-scholarships’ from over 200 colleges; and marketing automation company LeadGenius, which serves over 200 companies and is intentional about hiring individuals from underemployed populations.
Total employment across the entire SJF portfolio is over 10,000 jobs, with 78% of those jobs created since the SJF financing round. SJF Ventures was recently named a Top 10 impact fund based on its Impact Business Model Rating by the Global Impact Investment Rating System (GIIRS) and a Finalist for the international 2017 Circular Economy Investor Award. 





SJF Ventures typically invests between $3 and $10 million. The fund focuses on expansion-stage companies and is deeply engaged at the board level to help drive business and impact results of portfolio companies. The SJF investment team is comprised of Alan Kelley, Arrun Kapoor, Christine Primmer, Cody Nystrom, Dan Geballe, Dave Kirkpatrick, David Griest, Rick Defieux and Stephanie Nieman. www.sjfventures.com.

Entrepreneur Testimonials




 




”  








“SJF has been a great partner and friend to the entrepreneurs at Optoro as we’ve grown from a small 25 person team to over 250 people providing solutions for some of the nation’s biggest retailers.  In the early days, they helped us figure out our business model, navigate the world of sustainable commerce, and land some of our first clients.  And when the times were bad during the rough spots, they loyally stood by our side and helped us push through to continue on our growth trajectory.  Today, as we’ve evolved into a strong player in our industry, they act as an advisor on strategy as we look to many larger opportunities in the future.  We couldn’t have asked for a better and more loyal investor than SJF.”
—Tobin Moore, CEO

“SJF Ventures led our Series B round, which catalyzed $25MM in growth capital financing at a critical time -- helping NEXTracker fulfill on rapidly increasing sales volumes.   As our company grew, SJF continued to help through deep engagement on the board all the way through to our successful transaction with Flex.    Any entrepreneur with a rapidly growing business would be hard pressed to find a more aligned and helpful investment partner than SJF.”
—Dan Shugar, CEO




 




”  








“SJF quickly understood why consumers love pasture-raised eggs and why the principles of conscious capitalism are core to what we do.  That helped us to select SJF as our first institutional investor.”
—Matt O'Hayer, CEO




 




”  








“SJF has been a tremendous asset to Rustic Crust. From the time of their initial investment to our most recent round of financing, SJF has proven to be a true partner.

With SJF Ventures, we were fortunate to find an investor aligned well with CEI on building a values-driven enterprise that rapidly scales solar power and renewable energy utilization.”
—Brent Alderfer, CEO

“We have been working well with SJF since September 2013.  We are fortunate to have many ready to invest in our growth, such as very large SV firms and even the venture capital/technology transfer arm of a top 5 technology university in the United States.  We chose SJF because of Arrun’s intelligence and energy, and because the firm shared our values.   SJF understands our values driven culture.  They get that our mission to help struggling students, often those from low income areas, is the most important goal to our team of teachers and technologists and that by educating kids carefully and effectively, we would also build a successful business. They vowed to support us in our educational mission and have even introduced us to potential customers within their network.   As a company with a values-driven culture, we made the right choice in choosing SJF.”
—Kevin McAliley, CEO
