of your businesss name. (A DBA is also called a Fictitious /Assumed Business Name or Trade Name.

Note: All businesses need a federal tax ID number except sole proprietors that are not employers and are not independent contractors.

IRS rule: The client must issue a 1099 form to the independent contractor and the independent contractor must have a federal tax ID.
  However, even sole owners may obtain a federal ID and use it as a business tax ID instead of using their own social security number as a
  business tax ID number.  State EIN ID However, all other licenses that apply to sole proprietors as discussed here are requited regardless of getting

LLC 



Instead of filing a fictitious business name DBA Filing (about $49 plus state and legal newspaper publication fees)  in

  Filing a DBA is not required if you will set up an LLC or form a Corporation.  

    If you will do business under your first and last legal name you will not need to get a fictitious business name.  
     Using any language that connotes additional owners in the name of the business makes filing a fictitious business name mandatory.   
Incorporation

✔ Incorporation

If you do form an Other  llc or incorporate  (about $49 plus state fees for most states)  your Other business instead of just filing a fictitious business name (dba), 
  that insurs that you don't have personal liability for debts and civile liabililty arising from your business dealings and you will not have to record the  Wayzata business name.
  In lieu of recording a Hennepin County    trade company name (our  filing service fee includes trade name registration and newspaper legal publication for 4 weeks) you can also form a corporation in  
 MN  or form an MN     LLC (starts @ $49 plus state fee for most states & includes bylaws for the corporation and Limited Liability operating agreement for the LLC that is required to open a business bank account).  . 

About Your Business Type
otherWhat Legal Registrations Do I Need To Start a Business?
                    If you are starting an enterprise having  499  employees or less, you will be a small business owner and in the company  29 million small businesses of which 19 million are self employed. If you are a home based business, you will be among the 52% of all small businesses. 


                   Yes, a whooping 52% start a home business so you have to consider more than planning ahead,  finding a location ( could be your home as a business location)  and getting the equipment and or inventory that you need to begin selling  your merchandise or services.  Starting a small employer or self employed business absolutely requires certain legal steps such as  selecting the business legal structure and the licenses and tax registrations peculiar to your type of business. 
                     Some registrations are standard ( i.e., uniform for all businesses including home, online or for street vendors)  such as a general business license that is required by all businesses in addition to other specific licenses and  tax registrations that your particular type of business needs.  If you are planning to start a business without employees, there are about 23 million such businesses in the U.S. and 81/%  of these non-employer report less than $50,000 thousand per year in gross receipts.  Here is a break down of what legal registrations you need: 
Legal Business Structure
                   A small business is a very important venture considering they create 64% of all new jobs and about 600,000  new such businesses start each month (or 2.2 million new start-ups per year) in the U.S. and more than 51% of all employees are small business employees. So you have  to make it a legal entity. The government wants you to select a legal structure so you can be taxed accordingly. 
                    For example, a sole proprietorship is taxed differently from a limited liability company. Thus, starting a business requires the selection of one of several structures but the most common are the following: 
                   1. Sole Proprietorship,
                   2. Limited Liability Company
                   3. Corporation ( C, S, or Nonprofit)
                   4. Partnership ( General and Limited)

                   If you are starting a self employed business as most business are starting from home and or onlinie, you might want to know that  19.3 million nonemployer businesses are sole proprietorships, 1.3 million are partnerships and 1.8 million are corporations or LLCs. If you have questions about what structure to select, you may want to educate yourself by reading this article about which one is the best for your situation.
EXAMPLE: 
                    Marie and Juana wanted to start a marijuana business because of the two names composing the marijuana name but  instead of being high decided to be law abiding and rolled the joint into a business online from home selling regular merchandise paraphernalia such as babies clothing and toys as well as seks ( x omitted for obvious reasons) toys from their website as well as on ebay and amazon, or etsy.  Marie and Juana will have to select a legal structure first because all other tax and licenses registrations will be filed under that structure.

                   Marie and Juana can start as a general partnership, a limited partnership, an LLC or a corporation.  The general partnership requires a business name registration ( AKA DBA Doing Business As filing).

                   So, general partnerships need at least a federal tax ID number, a business license, and an assumed business name registration also called a fictitious business name or DBA even if the business name is the personal name of one of the partners, such as "Jones, and Associates". The DBA filing is a certificate that must be recorded and the main information in it is the business name, the owners name, and their addresses. 
                     However, if the partnership files a limited liability company or incorporates, the name does not have to be registered. On the other hand, the small business is a sole proprietor, it does need to file a business name registration only if the business name is different from the full owner's legal name. 
                   For example, if the owner's legal name is "Juana J. Jones," and does business with that name without any other trade name, e.g., "Juana's, Boutique," she does not have to file a DBA but "Jane's Boutique," requires a DBA registration. Despite that, Juana could file an LLC or form a Corporation and she would not have to file a DBA.

Self employed small businesses have an average of $45,000 annual gross income and the fastest growing freelance businesses are home businesses, auto repair shops, beauty salons dry cleaners, and cleaning services but they are others including the latest e-cigarettes, e liquid or vape shops. 
                  After ten years, only about 25% of small businesses survive but be of good cheer because this sector gross revenues are almost $3 trillion dollars. An LLC or Corporation is a legal person. A natural person, like you and I, has a social security number and a birth certificate. A legal person is a person without a physical body but has a birth certificate that is created when the articles of organization for the LLC or the articles of incorporation for the corporation is executed and filed with the state government. 
                  The articles can be 1 or more pages but normally it is just one page with the name of the corporate entity, its officially declared business address and the registered agent's name and address. The register agent is a designated natural or legal person that receive the mail directed to the corporation or LLC. 
                  That person can be the shareholder of the corporation or the LLC member or manager or any other person that the shareholders or member designate. For example, you can designate your Aunt Maria or Jeff, your grandpa as the registered agent who will use their own address to receive corporate snail mail. Thus, you can select and register your legal structure with a DBA for sole proprietor and partnership and with a corporate certificate with a corporation or LLC. 
Licenses and Tax ID Registrations
                  Business License
                  All structure will need to obtain a business tax registration also called a business license or permit. This can be a certificate or just a receipt that you have paid the, usually, flat tax of $0 to $100 or more dollars annually so the government will permit you to do business at your location and selling the specific merchandise that you sell. 
Seller's Permit
                  If you sell merchandise, whether retail, wholesale or on a street corner from home etc., you will need to register for sales tax. This requires a filing of a seller's permit certificate. That certificate contains your business name and address as well a resale certificate number. That number is the one you use when you execute a resale certificate and send it to your wholesaler to buy wholesale merchandise. The resale certificate is not the seller's permit itself but a one page certificate that certifies that you have the seller's permit number. You supposed to sign the certificate and send it to the wholesaler. The wholesaler needs a seller's permit to buy himself wholesale but also to sell wholesale. 
Federal Tax ID Number

                  All businesses need a federal tax ID number except sole proprietors that may elect to use their social security number instead of the suggested federal tax ID number. The federal ID is a 9 digit number such as 123456789 and is issued by the federal government after filing the required form with all your business information, and your name and social security number. After you get that ID, you usually take it to the bank and open a business bank account because the banks require it before they open an account for you. You also need this number if you become an employer, i.e., hire employees. The federal government requires that you report employment and unemployment forms with it and pay the required taxes.
State Employer Tax ID Number
                  Actually, if you hire employees, you will also need a state employer tax ID number. The state government requires that you report employment and unemployment forms with it and pay the required taxes because you need to pay employment taxes to both the federal and state governments.
                  In conclusion, you will need to select the business structure, the licenses and tax IDs and you will be ready and legal to start selling your services or merchandise.

          LLC (Limited Liability Company) FAQs: 
Q:   Is setting up an LLC a better choice than filing a DBA?    
A:   If the business market projection is a target fot the company you should consider forming an LLC.  For example if  the assumed business name is .  
deas XYZtch Capital Insight PartnersCo.    
   this company name as well as any other business name must be filed with the clerk as a trade name registration and that requires a filing fee to be registered.  
   A trade registration is requred but if the owner wants to use the business name exclusively he or she cannot because anyone else can also file the same trade name.  Nor does the trade name registration protects the owner from personal legal or financial liability as forming a limited liability company (LLC) .   
   It is  perhaps a better choice to just incorporate for the same or a little higher fee because you will also have corporate protection for the business name and personal vs business liabilities.    
    E.g. if your business has debts the lender can sue you personally to obtain a judgment vs your personal assets as opposed in the case you were a corporation where the lender could only sue the corporation directly and if the limited liability company (LLC) had no assets the lender could get nothing.  
    Note that once you incorporate no one can register the limited liability company (LLC) name at the state level. 

Q:   What if I am a very small company?  Do I need a limited liability company (LLC)?
A:    You do not need an LLC.  However 
Q:    Does an LLC without employees need a tax ID number? 
A:   An LLC without employees may not need a tax ID number but an LLC with more than one owner does need one.  In addition if the LLC is engaged in selling taxable items such as clothing it will need a sales state tax ID number in addition to any other tax ID.
Q:    What if I an an out of state business?  Do I still need to register and obtain a limited liability company (LLC)? 
A:     Unless you have a location in the state you sell it is not required to form an LLC there. 
Q:    When do I have to change my limited liability company (LLC)?
A:    You may have to get a new tax ID number if your status as a business changes. For example if you change from sole owner to a partnership or from LLC to corporation as well as when you buy a new business you need to get a new tax ID under your business name or individual name.
Q: Do I need to obtain a federal  or state tax ID number before forming a limited liability company (LLC)  or getting other licenses?
A: 
Q:   What are the benefits of havin a DUNS number? 
A:   You can use it to your benefit by providing favorable business information to make it more likely to get a loan from a lender bank. 
Q:   Do I need to pay sales tax to the state as an LLC?
A:   Paying sales tax depends on your state. For example in Oregon you dont need to pay sales tax but you still need a resale certificate to buy from other states wholesale  products.
