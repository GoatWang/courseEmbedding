 Notes to
Condensed Financial Statements

For the
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015

(Unaudited)

 

Note 1
– General Organization and Business

 

Our
History and Background

 

We were
incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 8, 2007. Since
inception, we have been engaged in organizational efforts,
obtaining financing and establishing the groundwork both in China
and in the U.S. to organize training programs for Chinese students
and participants who wish to pursue higher levels of practical
education in the entertainment industry with leading U.S. film
schools and colleges. We also plan to acquire, invest and manage
certain compatible training and educational businesses located in
China.

 

We were
originally formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination
through the acquisition of, or merger with, an operating business
and/or entering into collaboration and joint venture agreements
with existing businesses compatible with our core business
objectives. Accordingly, we have focused our efforts on identifying
possible business combinations, acquisitions, and/or compatible
joint ventures and business opportunities and further developing
our core business related to the field of entertainment,
particularly with music, motion picture and TV production, and
animation, and in the field of education, vocational training and
business/financial services.

 

In the
second half of 2014 the Company entered into potential merger
discussions with China Tactician University Company Limited
(“Tactician Group”) which is a Hong Kong corporation
owning a variety of Chinese companies involved in a wide range of
education and training, including vocational training to middle
management as well as operating regional colleges. A due diligence
process has commenced whereby the Company will evaluate the audited
financial statements of the Tactician Group which, if and when
completed, may enable the Company to work towards a definitive
merger agreement. At the same time, the Company also entered into
similar potential merger discussions Gold Street Holding (China)
Co., Limited (“Gold Street Group”). Subject to the
satisfactory completion of due diligence process , the Company may
proceed with the acquisition of the Gold Street Group. There can be
no assurance , however, this either merger/acquisition will
actually be achieved.

 

On April
11,2016 the Company executed a Letter of Intent with Haerbin
International TV & Film Arts Academy (“HITFAA”)
which is located in the city of Haerbin, Heilongjiang province ( in
northeast China). Under this Letter of Intent, the parties agreed
to cooperate to create a resource to train students in the field of
film and TV production. On May 16, 2016, a Chinese joint venture
company was formed ( 51% owned by the Company and 49% owned by
local Chinese parties) called Haerbin Leading Film & TV
Entertainment Co., Ltd. with the objective of owning 100% of HITFAA
.Presently, no capitalization and no activity has occurred in
Haerbin Leading Film & TV Entertainment Co., Ltd. and there can
be no assurance that any capitalization or activity will actually
occur.

 

Basis of
Presentation of Unaudited Condensed

 

The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The condensed
financial statements of the Company as of and for three and six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited. In the opinion
of management, all adjustments (including normal recurring
adjustments) have been made that are necessary to present fairly
the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2016, the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.

Notes to
Financial Statements

For the
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015

(Unaudited)

 

Operating
results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for a full fiscal year.
The balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the
Company’s audited financial statements included in the Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

 

Going
Concern

 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared under the
assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern. Such
assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have incurred
recurring losses from operations, and utilized cash flow in
operating activities since inception, and we have no recurring
source of revenue. As of June 30, 2016, we have an accumulated
deficit of $104,992. These factors, among others, raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In
addition, the Company’s independent registered public
accounting firm, in its report on the Company’s December 31,
2015 financial statements, has raised substantial doubt about the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The
accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going
concern.

 

Management’s
plan to support the Company in operations and to maintain its
business strategy is to raise funds through public offerings and to
rely on officers and directors to perform essential functions with
minimal compensation. If we do not raise all of the money we need
from public offerings, we will have to find alternative sources,
such as a private placement of securities or loans or advances from
our officers, directors or others. Such additional financing may
not become available on acceptable terms and there can be no
assurance that any additional financing that the Company does
obtain will be sufficient to meet its needs in the long term. Even
if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may
contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt
financing; or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in
the case of equity financing.

 

Use of
Estimates

 

In
preparing financial statements, management makes estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities in the balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the
statement of operations. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

 

Basic and
Diluted Net Loss Per Share

 

Our
computation of earnings per share (“EPS”) includes
basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is measured as the income (loss)
available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average
common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted income (loss) per
share reflects the potential dilution, using the treasury stock
method, that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue
common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or
resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the
income (loss) of the Company as if they had been converted at the
beginning of the periods presented, or issuance date, if later. In
computing diluted income (loss) per share, the treasury stock
method assumes that outstanding options and warrants are exercised
and the proceeds are used to purchase common stock at the average
market price during the period.

 

Options
and warrants may have a dilutive effect under the treasury stock
method only when the average market price of the common stock
during the period exceeds the exercise price of the options and
warrants. Potential common shares that have an anti-dilutive effect
(i.e., those that increase income per share or decrease loss per
share) are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.

For the
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015

(Unaudited)

 

Income
(loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss)
by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the respective periods. Basic and diluted (loss)
per common share is the same for periods in which the Company
reported an operating loss because all warrants and stock options
outstanding are anti-dilutive. As of June 30, 2016 there were no
potential dilutive securities.

 

Fair Value
of Financial Instruments

 

The FASB
ASC 320-12-65 (“Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
Instruments”), requires the determination of fair value of
the Company’s financial assets and liabilities. The estimated
fair values of financial instruments were determined by management
using available market information and appropriate valuation
methodologies. The carrying amounts of financial instruments
including cash and advances from officer approximate their fair
value because of their short maturities.

 

Income
taxes

 

The
Company accounts for income taxes under an asset and liability
approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.
Accordingly, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected impact of differences between the
financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.
The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred
tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be
realized.

 

In the
event the Company was to determine that it would be able to realize
its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its recorded
amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be credited
to operations in the period such determination was made. Likewise,
should the Company determine that it would not be able to realize
all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment
to the deferred tax assets would be charged to operations in the
period such determination was made.

 

The
Company is subject to U.S. federal income taxes and income taxes of
various state tax jurisdictions. As the Company’s net
operating losses have yet to be utilized, all previous tax years
remain open to examination by Federal authorities and other
jurisdictions in which the Company currently operates or has
operated in the past. The Company had no unrecognized tax benefits
as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 and does not anticipate any material
amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12
months.

 

The
Company accounts for uncertainties in income tax law under a
comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition,
measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions
taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns as prescribed
by GAAP. The tax effects of a position are recognized only if it is
“more-likely-than-not” to be sustained by the taxing
authority as of the reporting date. If the tax position is not
considered “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained, then
no benefits of the position are recognized. As of June 30, 2016,
the Company had not recorded any liability for uncertain tax
positions. In subsequent periods, any interest and penalties
related to uncertain tax positions will be recognized as a
component of income tax expense.

 

No current
provision or benefit for federal income taxes has been recorded for
the three months ended June 30, 2016 or for any period from
inception through June 30, 2016 as the Company has no taxable
income.
