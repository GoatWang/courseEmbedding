Living in Belize

 


Belize is a kaleidoscope of lost ancient civilizations, lively cultures, untamed natural beauty, and exotic wildlife. In your quest to live in a tropical paradise, you will discover that Belize is the closest thing to “Eden” you will ever find. Please explore the wonders of Belize as you encounter the adventurous and relaxing lifestyle that echoes the tropical Caribbean. 

 








BELIZE LIFESTYLE

 


The Belizean way of life is a humble one; one of simplicity, adventure, and absolute relaxation. Belize is a friendly country of farmers, fishermen and nature lovers. Whether you choose to retire in Belize or simply escape to the natural beauty of this wonderland for a few months out of the year, life in Belize promises to be bliss.

 









RETIRING IN BELIZE

 


Over the past 7 years Belize has seen a major surge in couples looking to retire in this tropical paradise. Factors such as a change of pace to the urban hustle and bustle, a warm tropical climate, an easier way of life, the pristine natural beauty, and an array of outdoor activities, are driving the high demand for people wanting to retire in Belize.

 









BUYING PROPERTY

 


The influx of tourists traveling to Belize, and the rise in the number of Baby Boomers retiring in the country, have been catalysts behind real estate investment opportunities steadily increasing. Purchasing real estate is simple and property ownership rights for foreigners are recognized by fee-simple title.

 









 


BELIZE ATTRACTIONS

 









SCUBA DIVING

 


Home to the second largest coral reef in the world, and sprawling along 300km of pristine coastline, the majestic Belize Barrier Reef is a spectacle that attracts thousands of scuba divers every year to the country of Belize. The reef has a multitude of exquisite diving spots for both novices and the more experienced.

 









FISHING

 


Belize is home to some of the best fishing in the Caribbean offering anglers both fly fishing, river fishing and deep-sea fishing. The Belize Barrier Reef has miles of pristine coral flats and offers extraordinary fishing. From Mahi Mahi, Bone Fish, Tarpon, Tuna and Wahoo, you are sure to have a fresh catch for the week.

 









ISLAND HOPPING

 


The enchanting coastline of Belize and the hundreds of palm-strewn cayes scattered along the Belize Barrier Reef, are a dream come true for any avid ocean voyager. Explore the many beautiful coastal inlets, lagoons and rivers as you meander through unchartered waters. Or set sail for the majestic reef and drop anchor

 









MAYAN EXPLORATION

 


Belize was once the center of one of the greatest civilizations of antiquity and is considered to have been the heart of Maya civilization during the Classic period. Today, you can tour these mystical Maya ruins for yourself, or hire an experienced guide to educate you on these archeological phenomenons.

Dream Valley Resort



On-Grid At It’s Best Performance
 

















































 
A solution to produce some day-time energy by the sun was wanted for Dream Valley Resort. Many of their main power consumers are working during day time. While the grid is still the main power source for the resort, the on-grid solar system is taking over the day-time peaks for the AC-units, laundry and the electrical water heating amongst others.
Any kWh that is produced by this solar-system, is half the price than what the KWh costs coming from the grid!

WHAT IS EQUITY ESTATES?
2-minute video




Invest In Your Travel
















WHAT DO OUR INVESTORS HAVE TO SAY?












“Our family has enjoyed many treasured events with Equity Estates—an engagement, a honeymoon, anniversaries, birthdays and cherished memories with lifelong friends. Equity Estates residences have furnished snap shots of some of the most joyous times of our lives.”
THE LOCKETT FAMILY OF AUSTIN, TX
“Equity Estates makes so much sense. Not only do we get to enjoy the homes, but it’s also a great long-term investment opportunity.”
THE BRIDGES FAMILY OF BOSTON, MA
“I really can’t forget our first EE experience. My kids were young, and my wife and I were still cool. As I stare at the rotating photographs on my kitchen counter, as I often do, most of the pictures are from EE vacations…but the ones that most often bring a tear to my eye are the ones of my kids when they were still little. Regardless of the material splendor of all the wonderful destinations we are lucky enough to enjoy, I am sure it is that type of memory that all of us cherish the most.”
THE YOUNG FAMILY OF ATLANTA, GA

Your Future Home

					Although The Reserve owners may choose any builder for the construction of their homes, we encourage the use of our in-house residential builder, Sanctuary Design & Build, or one of our “preferred” custom homebuilders.

					SanctuaryDesign & Build				

As part of our full spectrum of home building and architectural services, we extend the expertise of Sanctuary Design and Build, a full-service residential construction company. Sanctuary Design and Build has partnered with world-renowned architect Stephen Green to design eco-friendly homes that take full advantage of the beautiful natural surroundings.






SANCTUARY DESIGN & BUILD



The home’s thoughtfully designed open floor plans, reminiscent of Balinese and Hawaiian designs, allow owners to fully experience the breezes, scenery and natural light of the tropical setting. In building the home, Sanctuary Design and Build employs mostly local materials to create a unique assortment of amenities, including outdoor terraces, shade structures and gardens that blend outdoor and indoor living while maintaining an authentic natural experience. At the heart of each home is a tropical garden that serves to connect all the detached structures visually and functionally.
Outdoor common areas and pools provide a central gathering space that unifies the home. Aesthetically designed to balance with nature, the homes are also well prepared for natural events.  All homes feature six-foot reinforced concrete walls (available in a choice of attractive exterior finishes), seamless low-profile metal roofs atop structurally engineered roof truss systems, creating visual appeal while providing maximum durability and safety. Large hurricane-proof sliding glass doors and windows let in ample natural light while offering expansive views of the tropical setting.

					PreferredBuilders				

Although The Reserve owners may choose any builder for the construction of their homes, we encourage the use of one of our “preferred” custom homebuilders. These “preferred” builders have undergone a thorough evaluation to ensure they support the eco-sensitive vision of The Reserve with the utmost integrity and proficiency. Choosing to work with a “preferred” custom homebuilder will further protect the return on your property investment.















					Bamboo Homes				

The Reserve is proud to present our full line of Bamboo Homes, which have quickly become a favorite of our residents.  Built almost entirely of natural bamboo, the Bamboo Homes are extremely eco-friendly, beautiful and incredibly strong.  They blend seamlessly into the natural landscape and invoke an immediate feeling of peacefulness when they are entered.

Living in Belize

 


Belize is a kaleidoscope of lost ancient civilizations, lively cultures, untamed natural beauty, and exotic wildlife. In your quest to live in a tropical paradise, you will discover that Belize is the closest thing to “Eden” you will ever find. Please explore the wonders of Belize as you encounter the adventurous and relaxing lifestyle that echoes the tropical Caribbean. 

 








BELIZE LIFESTYLE

 


The Belizean way of life is a humble one; one of simplicity, adventure, and absolute relaxation. Belize is a friendly country of farmers, fishermen and nature lovers. Whether you choose to retire in Belize or simply escape to the natural beauty of this wonderland for a few months out of the year, life in Belize promises to be bliss.

 









RETIRING IN BELIZE

 


Over the past 7 years Belize has seen a major surge in couples looking to retire in this tropical paradise. Factors such as a change of pace to the urban hustle and bustle, a warm tropical climate, an easier way of life, the pristine natural beauty, and an array of outdoor activities, are driving the high demand for people wanting to retire in Belize.

 









BUYING PROPERTY

 


The influx of tourists traveling to Belize, and the rise in the number of Baby Boomers retiring in the country, have been catalysts behind real estate investment opportunities steadily increasing. Purchasing real estate is simple and property ownership rights for foreigners are recognized by fee-simple title.

 









 


BELIZE ATTRACTIONS

 









SCUBA DIVING

 


Home to the second largest coral reef in the world, and sprawling along 300km of pristine coastline, the majestic Belize Barrier Reef is a spectacle that attracts thousands of scuba divers every year to the country of Belize. The reef has a multitude of exquisite diving spots for both novices and the more experienced.

 









FISHING

 


Belize is home to some of the best fishing in the Caribbean offering anglers both fly fishing, river fishing and deep-sea fishing. The Belize Barrier Reef has miles of pristine coral flats and offers extraordinary fishing. From Mahi Mahi, Bone Fish, Tarpon, Tuna and Wahoo, you are sure to have a fresh catch for the week.

 









ISLAND HOPPING

 


The enchanting coastline of Belize and the hundreds of palm-strewn cayes scattered along the Belize Barrier Reef, are a dream come true for any avid ocean voyager. Explore the many beautiful coastal inlets, lagoons and rivers as you meander through unchartered waters. Or set sail for the majestic reef and drop anchor

 









MAYAN EXPLORATION

 


Belize was once the center of one of the greatest civilizations of antiquity and is considered to have been the heart of Maya civilization during the Classic period. Today, you can tour these mystical Maya ruins for yourself, or hire an experienced guide to educate you on these archeological phenomenons.

OFFSHORE COMPANY FORMATION IN BELIZE












Belize is an ideal place for the formation of an offshore company. THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS COMPANIES (IBC) ACT, Chapter 270 of the Laws of Belize created a special category of companies known as an International Business Company. The law was enacted to permit tax minimization and asset protection at competitive rates.  An Offshore Company is defined as a company that pays no taxes, and is for the most part free of trade and other restrictions such as exchange control, trade licensing and public disclosure requirements in Belize. In all other respects an offshore company can perform practically any function an ordinary corporation can perform. Thus, the formation of an offshore company in Belize is an ideal tax planning vehicle which can be used for a wide range of commercial activities. 

Belize has become popular jurisdiction for offshore company formation due to its English-based legal system. The IBC legislation was based on the British Virgin Island model. In addition, full-ranged, high-tech and international offshore banking services empower Belize as an ideal jurisdiction for offshore business, so that Belize has been experiencing a fast growth in offshore company formation. Belize IBCs enjoy a flexible corporate structure making Belize a dynamic leader globally in offshore company formation. 

We also incorporate British Virgin Islands and Panamanian Companies at a competitive price!
