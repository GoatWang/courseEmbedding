    Actionable prices may only be obtained on a real-time, expressly agreed upon basis.
     Any indicative valuations or estimates in materials on the Site are provided for
      informational purposes only. Any information regarding any valuations with respect

    Hypothetical or Past Performance

   Hypothetical or simulated performance results have inherent limitations. Unlike an actual
    performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the
     trades have not actually been executed, the results may have under or over-compensated

     trading programs in general are designed with the benefit of hindsight. Past performance 
     is not in any way indicative of any future results and no representation is being made 
     with respect to past performances being in any way indicative of future performance.

CIBC purchased a majority stake in Wood, Gundy & Co. in June 1988 for C$203 million.[2] Wood Gundy was established in Toronto in 1905 by George Herbert Wood and James Henry Gundy. At the time of its acquisition, Wood Gundy was the leading Canadian investment dealer. Following the acquisition, the CIBC formed CIBC Wood Gundy, which offered primarily asset management services for corporate and institutional clients. Two years later, in 1990, they continued to expand the Canadian securities business by acquiring much of Merrill Lynch & Company's Canadian business.
For a period of time, CIBC Wood Gundy operated as CIBC Eyers Reed in Australia following the acquisition of the broker-dealer.
Acquisition of the Argosy Group[edit]
Main article: The Argosy Group
In April 1995, CIBC's investment banking subsidiary, then known as CIBC Wood Gundy announced the acquisition of The Argosy Group, a New York-based investment banking firm involved primarily in the high yield debt market. Argosy had been founded by three Drexel Burnham Lambert alumni: Jay Bloom, Andrew Heyer and Dean Kehler who had worked together in Drexel's New York office in the 1980s. Argosy was founded in 1990 as a 9-person advisory firm.
The acquisition of Argosy marked an aggressive push by CIBC into the US investment banking business. Prior to that point, CIBC had never done a junk bond deal. Argosy's three major principals had worked on some of the biggest junk bond deals of the 1980s while at Drexel Burnham Lambert. The 52 Argosy employees constituted the core of what would become CIBC's High Yield Group and CIBC Argosy Merchant Banking funds that were responsible for, among other things, the $1 billion windfall that CIBC would earn from its early investments in Global Crossing. The Argosy principals also managed two collateralized debt obligation vehicles known as Caravelle Funds I and II.[3]




CIBC Oppenheimer
(1997 - 1999)


CIBC Oppenheimer[edit]
See also: Oppenheimer & Co.
In 1997, CIBC Wood Gundy (New York) under the direction of Michael S. Rulle acquired the U.S. brokerage house Oppenheimer & Co. CIBC wanted to expand its brokerage business and was interested in the New York-based firm which had annual revenues of $800 million and a network of 680 brokers, primarily selling stocks and bonds. Oppenheimer also included a small investment banking group.
Negotiations began talks with Oppenheimer in July 1997 and CIBC closed on the transaction in November 1997, paying $525 million over the next three years, including $175 million in retention payments to key Oppenheimer professionals. After the acquisition the U.S. division took the name CIBC Oppenheimer, eliminating the use of the Wood Gundy brand through much of the bank.
Creating the CIBC World Markets platform[edit]
By 1999, CIBC would scale back the usage of the Oppenheimer name in favor of CIBC World Markets. The business in Canada was centered around providing mergers and acquisitions advisory services and various equity offerings for large Canadian companies. However, with the acquisition of Argosy, the center of gravity of the investment bank began to shift toward the United States.




CIBC World Markets
(1998 - 2002)


Although initially intended to represent a foray into a variety of global markets, CIBC World Markets ultimately focused on three markets: Canada, the United States and to a lesser extent the United Kingdom. The CIBC World Markets unit suffered a net loss of C$186 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 which dragged down the performance of the parent bank's stock by almost one-third. The loss in 1998 was due primarily to very rapid expansion into regions impacted by the various financial crises in 1998 in Asia. As a result, CIBC World Markets refocused its efforts primarily on the U.S. and Canadian markets, despite the seemingly global ambitions implied in the unit's name.
CIBC World Markets reached a peak in 1999 and 2000, when the investment bank cracked the top ten of U.S. issuers of high yield bonds and the top twenty in mergers and acquisitions advisory. In 1999, CIBC World Markets, backed Gary Winnick and his company Global Crossing to build optical fiber cable connections under the ocean. CIBC would ultimately realize a gain of $2.0 billion from its relatively small equity investment in Global Crossing, representing more than 20% of the bank's profits in 2000.[4] On the back of the success in Global Crossing, CIBC backed the three heads of its CIBC Argosy Merchant Banking funds in a new private equity operation known as Trimaran Capital Partners. Trimaran closed on a $1 billion fund in April 2001, with capital provided primarily by CIBC.[3]
In June 2001, CIBC announced the construction of a new $800 million office tower at 300 Madison Avenue (At the corner of Madison Avenue and 42nd Street). The 35-story, 1,200,000-square-foot (110,000 m2) building was originally expected to house up to 3,000 employees, bringing CIBC's entire New York staff under one roof.[5] Following the crash of the dot-com bubble and the shutdown of the high yield markets in late 2000, CIBC World Markets began to suffer a series of setbacks. When the 300 Madison building was completed in 2004, CIBC's diminished workforce took up only a few floors, leasing the remainder to PriceWaterhouseCoopers.[6]
Decline of CIBC World Markets[edit]
In July 2001, the Wall Street Journal profiled CIBC World Markets, chronicling the rapid decline of the bank from the peaks of Wall Street's league table rankings.[7] At the same time, the High Yield Group was restructured with the original Argosy Group founders focusing their efforts solely on their private equity and merchant banking operations, known as Trimaran Capital Partners. Bloom, Heyer and Kehler were replaced by managing directors Edward Levy and Bruce Spohler. The Trimaran operations would subsequently spinout completely from CIBC World Markets.
By 2002 CIBC was forced to set aside C$1.5 billion for bad corporate loans, primarily from CIBC World Markets and the bank was linked two of the most famous victims of the corporate accounting scandals of the early 2000s: Enron Corporation and Global Crossing.[4] As a result of these developments, the parent bank implemented a strategy to reallocate resources away from the riskier CIBC World Markets division in favor of its retail operations.[4]
As part of this strategy, in 2003, CIBC sold an asset management division along with retail brokerage to Fahnestock Viner along with the Oppenheimer & Co. name. Upon doing so CIBC Wood Gundy (in Canada) and CIBC Oppenheimer (in US) became jointly known as CIBC World Markets. The Wood Gundy nomenclature lives on today as the retail brokerage division of CIBC World Markets Inc., however only operates in Canada; the U.S. operation lacking a retail arm. Also in September 2003, a jury found that CIBC had failed to provide complete financial information to investors in a high-yield bond offering. Just a few months later, at the end of 2003, CIBC reached an $80 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over its various financings for Enron, representing far more than the bank had earned in fees.[4]
Sale to Oppenheimer & Co. (Fahnestock Viner)[edit]
By 2004, CIBC had begun winding down much of its investment banking business in the United States. CIBC World Markets reduced its staff by two-thirds from 2001 through 2004.
In November 2007, the new Oppenheimer & Co. (Fahnestock) announced that it would purchase a major part of CIBC World Markets' U.S. Investment Banking, Corporate Syndicate, Institutional Sales and Trading, Equity Research, Options Trading and a portion of the Debt Capital Markets business which includes Convertible Bond Trading, Loan Syndication, High Yield Origination and Trading as well as related operations located in the UK, Israel and Hong Kong. The deal closed January 14, 2008 and essentially reunited the original Oppenheimer & Co. which CIBC divided in the sale to Fahnestock.
On February 29, 2008, CIBC World Markets Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian Shaw (Encana Corp) was replaced in both capacities by Richard Nesbitt, a former TSX Group CEO.[8][9]

CIBC Wood Gundy
(1988 - 1997)


CIBC Wood Gundy[edit]
See also: CIBC Wood Gundy and Wood, Gundy & Co.
CIBC purchased a majority stake in Wood, Gundy & Co. in June 1988 for C$203 million.[2] Wood Gundy was established in Toronto in 1905 by George Herbert Wood and James Henry Gundy. At the time of its acquisition, Wood Gundy was the leading Canadian investment dealer. Following the acquisition, the CIBC formed CIBC Wood Gundy, which offered primarily asset management services for corporate and institutional clients. Two years later, in 1990, they continued to expand the Canadian securities business by acquiring much of Merrill Lynch & Company's Canadian business.
For a period of time, CIBC Wood Gundy operated as CIBC Eyers Reed in Australia following the acquisition of the broker-dealer.
Acquisition of the Argosy Group[edit]
Main article: The Argosy Group
In April 1995, CIBC's investment banking subsidiary, then known as CIBC Wood Gundy announced the acquisition of The Argosy Group, a New York-based investment banking firm involved primarily in the high yield debt market. Argosy had been founded by three Drexel Burnham Lambert alumni: Jay Bloom, Andrew Heyer and Dean Kehler who had worked together in Drexel's New York office in the 1980s. Argosy was founded in 1990 as a 9-person advisory firm.
The acquisition of Argosy marked an aggressive push by CIBC into the US investment banking business. Prior to that point, CIBC had never done a junk bond deal. Argosy's three major principals had worked on some of the biggest junk bond deals of the 1980s while at Drexel Burnham Lambert. The 52 Argosy employees constituted the core of what would become CIBC's High Yield Group and CIBC Argosy Merchant Banking funds that were responsible for, among other things, the $1 billion windfall that CIBC would earn from its early investments in Global Crossing. The Argosy principals also managed two collateralized debt obligation vehicles known as Caravelle Funds I and II.[3]




CIBC Oppenheimer
(1997 - 1999)


CIBC Oppenheimer[edit]
See also: Oppenheimer & Co.
In 1997, CIBC Wood Gundy (New York) under the direction of Michael S. Rulle acquired the U.S. brokerage house Oppenheimer & Co. CIBC wanted to expand its brokerage business and was interested in the New York-based firm which had annual revenues of $800 million and a network of 680 brokers, primarily selling stocks and bonds. Oppenheimer also included a small investment banking group.
Negotiations began talks with Oppenheimer in July 1997 and CIBC closed on the transaction in November 1997, paying $525 million over the next three years, including $175 million in retention payments to key Oppenheimer professionals. After the acquisition the U.S. division took the name CIBC Oppenheimer, eliminating the use of the Wood Gundy brand through much of the bank.
Creating the CIBC World Markets platform[edit]
By 1999, CIBC would scale back the usage of the Oppenheimer name in favor of CIBC World Markets. The business in Canada was centered around providing mergers and acquisitions advisory services and various equity offerings for large Canadian companies. However, with the acquisition of Argosy, the center of gravity of the investment bank began to shift toward the United States.




CIBC World Markets
(1998 - 2002)


Although initially intended to represent a foray into a variety of global markets, CIBC World Markets ultimately focused on three markets: Canada, the United States and to a lesser extent the United Kingdom. The CIBC World Markets unit suffered a net loss of C$186 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 which dragged down the performance of the parent bank's stock by almost one-third. The loss in 1998 was due primarily to very rapid expansion into regions impacted by the various financial crises in 1998 in Asia. As a result, CIBC World Markets refocused its efforts primarily on the U.S. and Canadian markets, despite the seemingly global ambitions implied in the unit's name.
CIBC World Markets reached a peak in 1999 and 2000, when the investment bank cracked the top ten of U.S. issuers of high yield bonds and the top twenty in mergers and acquisitions advisory. In 1999, CIBC World Markets, backed Gary Winnick and his company Global Crossing to build optical fiber cable connections under the ocean. CIBC would ultimately realize a gain of $2.0 billion from its relatively small equity investment in Global Crossing, representing more than 20% of the bank's profits in 2000.[4] On the back of the success in Global Crossing, CIBC backed the three heads of its CIBC Argosy Merchant Banking funds in a new private equity operation known as Trimaran Capital Partners. Trimaran closed on a $1 billion fund in April 2001, with capital provided primarily by CIBC.[3]
In June 2001, CIBC announced the construction of a new $800 million office tower at 300 Madison Avenue (At the corner of Madison Avenue and 42nd Street). The 35-story, 1,200,000-square-foot (110,000 m2) building was originally expected to house up to 3,000 employees, bringing CIBC's entire New York staff under one roof.[5] Following the crash of the dot-com bubble and the shutdown of the high yield markets in late 2000, CIBC World Markets began to suffer a series of setbacks. When the 300 Madison building was completed in 2004, CIBC's diminished workforce took up only a few floors, leasing the remainder to PriceWaterhouseCoopers.[6]
Decline of CIBC World Markets[edit]
In July 2001, the Wall Street Journal profiled CIBC World Markets, chronicling the rapid decline of the bank from the peaks of Wall Street's league table rankings.[7] At the same time, the High Yield Group was restructured with the original Argosy Group founders focusing their efforts solely on their private equity and merchant banking operations, known as Trimaran Capital Partners. Bloom, Heyer and Kehler were replaced by managing directors Edward Levy and Bruce Spohler. The Trimaran operations would subsequently spinout completely from CIBC World Markets.
By 2002 CIBC was forced to set aside C$1.5 billion for bad corporate loans, primarily from CIBC World Markets and the bank was linked two of the most famous victims of the corporate accounting scandals of the early 2000s: Enron Corporation and Global Crossing.[4] As a result of these developments, the parent bank implemented a strategy to reallocate resources away from the riskier CIBC World Markets division in favor of its retail operations.[4]
As part of this strategy, in 2003, CIBC sold an asset management division along with retail brokerage to Fahnestock Viner along with the Oppenheimer & Co. name. Upon doing so CIBC Wood Gundy (in Canada) and CIBC Oppenheimer (in US) became jointly known as CIBC World Markets. The Wood Gundy nomenclature lives on today as the retail brokerage division of CIBC World Markets Inc., however only operates in Canada; the U.S. operation lacking a retail arm. Also in September 2003, a jury found that CIBC had failed to provide complete financial information to investors in a high-yield bond offering. Just a few months later, at the end of 2003, CIBC reached an $80 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over its various financings for Enron, representing far more than the bank had earned in fees.[4]
Sale to Oppenheimer & Co. (Fahnestock Viner)[edit]
By 2004, CIBC had begun winding down much of its investment banking business in the United States. CIBC World Markets reduced its staff by two-thirds from 2001 through 2004.
In November 2007, the new Oppenheimer & Co. (Fahnestock) announced that it would purchase a major part of CIBC World Markets' U.S. Investment Banking, Corporate Syndicate, Institutional Sales and Trading, Equity Research, Options Trading and a portion of the Debt Capital Markets business which includes Convertible Bond Trading, Loan Syndication, High Yield Origination and Trading as well as related operations located in the UK, Israel and Hong Kong. The deal closed January 14, 2008 and essentially reunited the original Oppenheimer & Co. which CIBC divided in the sale to Fahnestock.
On February 29, 2008, CIBC World Markets Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian Shaw (Encana Corp) was replaced in both capacities by Richard Nesbitt, a former TSX Group CEO.[8][9]

CIBC Wood Gundy
(1988 - 1997)


CIBC Wood Gundy[edit]
See also: CIBC Wood Gundy and Wood, Gundy & Co.
CIBC purchased a majority stake in Wood, Gundy & Co. in June 1988 for C$203 million.[2] Wood Gundy was established in Toronto in 1905 by George Herbert Wood and James Henry Gundy. At the time of its acquisition, Wood Gundy was the leading Canadian investment dealer. Following the acquisition, the CIBC formed CIBC Wood Gundy, which offered primarily asset management services for corporate and institutional clients. Two years later, in 1990, they continued to expand the Canadian securities business by acquiring much of Merrill Lynch & Company's Canadian business.
For a period of time, CIBC Wood Gundy operated as CIBC Eyers Reed in Australia following the acquisition of the broker-dealer.
Acquisition of the Argosy Group[edit]
Main article: The Argosy Group
In April 1995, CIBC's investment banking subsidiary, then known as CIBC Wood Gundy announced the acquisition of The Argosy Group, a New York-based investment banking firm involved primarily in the high yield debt market. Argosy had been founded by three Drexel Burnham Lambert alumni: Jay Bloom, Andrew Heyer and Dean Kehler who had worked together in Drexel's New York office in the 1980s. Argosy was founded in 1990 as a 9-person advisory firm.
The acquisition of Argosy marked an aggressive push by CIBC into the US investment banking business. Prior to that point, CIBC had never done a junk bond deal. Argosy's three major principals had worked on some of the biggest junk bond deals of the 1980s while at Drexel Burnham Lambert. The 52 Argosy employees constituted the core of what would become CIBC's High Yield Group and CIBC Argosy Merchant Banking funds that were responsible for, among other things, the $1 billion windfall that CIBC would earn from its early investments in Global Crossing. The Argosy principals also managed two collateralized debt obligation vehicles known as Caravelle Funds I and II.[3]




CIBC Oppenheimer
(1997 - 1999)


CIBC Oppenheimer[edit]
See also: Oppenheimer & Co.
In 1997, CIBC Wood Gundy (New York) under the direction of Michael S. Rulle acquired the U.S. brokerage house Oppenheimer & Co. CIBC wanted to expand its brokerage business and was interested in the New York-based firm which had annual revenues of $800 million and a network of 680 brokers, primarily selling stocks and bonds. Oppenheimer also included a small investment banking group.
Negotiations began talks with Oppenheimer in July 1997 and CIBC closed on the transaction in November 1997, paying $525 million over the next three years, including $175 million in retention payments to key Oppenheimer professionals. After the acquisition the U.S. division took the name CIBC Oppenheimer, eliminating the use of the Wood Gundy brand through much of the bank.
Creating the CIBC World Markets platform[edit]
By 1999, CIBC would scale back the usage of the Oppenheimer name in favor of CIBC World Markets. The business in Canada was centered around providing mergers and acquisitions advisory services and various equity offerings for large Canadian companies. However, with the acquisition of Argosy, the center of gravity of the investment bank began to shift toward the United States.




CIBC World Markets
(1998 - 2002)


Although initially intended to represent a foray into a variety of global markets, CIBC World Markets ultimately focused on three markets: Canada, the United States and to a lesser extent the United Kingdom. The CIBC World Markets unit suffered a net loss of C$186 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 which dragged down the performance of the parent bank's stock by almost one-third. The loss in 1998 was due primarily to very rapid expansion into regions impacted by the various financial crises in 1998 in Asia. As a result, CIBC World Markets refocused its efforts primarily on the U.S. and Canadian markets, despite the seemingly global ambitions implied in the unit's name.
CIBC World Markets reached a peak in 1999 and 2000, when the investment bank cracked the top ten of U.S. issuers of high yield bonds and the top twenty in mergers and acquisitions advisory. In 1999, CIBC World Markets, backed Gary Winnick and his company Global Crossing to build optical fiber cable connections under the ocean. CIBC would ultimately realize a gain of $2.0 billion from its relatively small equity investment in Global Crossing, representing more than 20% of the bank's profits in 2000.[4] On the back of the success in Global Crossing, CIBC backed the three heads of its CIBC Argosy Merchant Banking funds in a new private equity operation known as Trimaran Capital Partners. Trimaran closed on a $1 billion fund in April 2001, with capital provided primarily by CIBC.[3]
In June 2001, CIBC announced the construction of a new $800 million office tower at 300 Madison Avenue (At the corner of Madison Avenue and 42nd Street). The 35-story, 1,200,000-square-foot (110,000 m2) building was originally expected to house up to 3,000 employees, bringing CIBC's entire New York staff under one roof.[5] Following the crash of the dot-com bubble and the shutdown of the high yield markets in late 2000, CIBC World Markets began to suffer a series of setbacks. When the 300 Madison building was completed in 2004, CIBC's diminished workforce took up only a few floors, leasing the remainder to PriceWaterhouseCoopers.[6]
Decline of CIBC World Markets[edit]
In July 2001, the Wall Street Journal profiled CIBC World Markets, chronicling the rapid decline of the bank from the peaks of Wall Street's league table rankings.[7] At the same time, the High Yield Group was restructured with the original Argosy Group founders focusing their efforts solely on their private equity and merchant banking operations, known as Trimaran Capital Partners. Bloom, Heyer and Kehler were replaced by managing directors Edward Levy and Bruce Spohler. The Trimaran operations would subsequently spinout completely from CIBC World Markets.
By 2002 CIBC was forced to set aside C$1.5 billion for bad corporate loans, primarily from CIBC World Markets and the bank was linked two of the most famous victims of the corporate accounting scandals of the early 2000s: Enron Corporation and Global Crossing.[4] As a result of these developments, the parent bank implemented a strategy to reallocate resources away from the riskier CIBC World Markets division in favor of its retail operations.[4]
As part of this strategy, in 2003, CIBC sold an asset management division along with retail brokerage to Fahnestock Viner along with the Oppenheimer & Co. name. Upon doing so CIBC Wood Gundy (in Canada) and CIBC Oppenheimer (in US) became jointly known as CIBC World Markets. The Wood Gundy nomenclature lives on today as the retail brokerage division of CIBC World Markets Inc., however only operates in Canada; the U.S. operation lacking a retail arm. Also in September 2003, a jury found that CIBC had failed to provide complete financial information to investors in a high-yield bond offering. Just a few months later, at the end of 2003, CIBC reached an $80 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over its various financings for Enron, representing far more than the bank had earned in fees.[4]
Sale to Oppenheimer & Co. (Fahnestock Viner)[edit]
By 2004, CIBC had begun winding down much of its investment banking business in the United States. CIBC World Markets reduced its staff by two-thirds from 2001 through 2004.
In November 2007, the new Oppenheimer & Co. (Fahnestock) announced that it would purchase a major part of CIBC World Markets' U.S. Investment Banking, Corporate Syndicate, Institutional Sales and Trading, Equity Research, Options Trading and a portion of the Debt Capital Markets business which includes Convertible Bond Trading, Loan Syndication, High Yield Origination and Trading as well as related operations located in the UK, Israel and Hong Kong. The deal closed January 14, 2008 and essentially reunited the original Oppenheimer & Co. which CIBC divided in the sale to Fahnestock.
On February 29, 2008, CIBC World Markets Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian Shaw (Encana Corp) was replaced in both capacities by Richard Nesbitt, a former TSX Group CEO.[8][9]

CIBC Wood Gundy
(1988 - 1997)


CIBC Wood Gundy[edit]
See also: CIBC Wood Gundy and Wood, Gundy & Co.
CIBC purchased a majority stake in Wood, Gundy & Co. in June 1988 for C$203 million.[2] Wood Gundy was established in Toronto in 1905 by George Herbert Wood and James Henry Gundy. At the time of its acquisition, Wood Gundy was the leading Canadian investment dealer. Following the acquisition, the CIBC formed CIBC Wood Gundy, which offered primarily asset management services for corporate and institutional clients. Two years later, in 1990, they continued to expand the Canadian securities business by acquiring much of Merrill Lynch & Company's Canadian business.
For a period of time, CIBC Wood Gundy operated as CIBC Eyers Reed in Australia following the acquisition of the broker-dealer.
Acquisition of the Argosy Group[edit]
Main article: The Argosy Group
In April 1995, CIBC's investment banking subsidiary, then known as CIBC Wood Gundy announced the acquisition of The Argosy Group, a New York-based investment banking firm involved primarily in the high yield debt market. Argosy had been founded by three Drexel Burnham Lambert alumni: Jay Bloom, Andrew Heyer and Dean Kehler who had worked together in Drexel's New York office in the 1980s. Argosy was founded in 1990 as a 9-person advisory firm.
The acquisition of Argosy marked an aggressive push by CIBC into the US investment banking business. Prior to that point, CIBC had never done a junk bond deal. Argosy's three major principals had worked on some of the biggest junk bond deals of the 1980s while at Drexel Burnham Lambert. The 52 Argosy employees constituted the core of what would become CIBC's High Yield Group and CIBC Argosy Merchant Banking funds that were responsible for, among other things, the $1 billion windfall that CIBC would earn from its early investments in Global Crossing. The Argosy principals also managed two collateralized debt obligation vehicles known as Caravelle Funds I and II.[3]




CIBC Oppenheimer
(1997 - 1999)


CIBC Oppenheimer[edit]
See also: Oppenheimer & Co.
In 1997, CIBC Wood Gundy (New York) under the direction of Michael S. Rulle acquired the U.S. brokerage house Oppenheimer & Co. CIBC wanted to expand its brokerage business and was interested in the New York-based firm which had annual revenues of $800 million and a network of 680 brokers, primarily selling stocks and bonds. Oppenheimer also included a small investment banking group.
Negotiations began talks with Oppenheimer in July 1997 and CIBC closed on the transaction in November 1997, paying $525 million over the next three years, including $175 million in retention payments to key Oppenheimer professionals. After the acquisition the U.S. division took the name CIBC Oppenheimer, eliminating the use of the Wood Gundy brand through much of the bank.
Creating the CIBC World Markets platform[edit]
By 1999, CIBC would scale back the usage of the Oppenheimer name in favor of CIBC World Markets. The business in Canada was centered around providing mergers and acquisitions advisory services and various equity offerings for large Canadian companies. However, with the acquisition of Argosy, the center of gravity of the investment bank began to shift toward the United States.




CIBC World Markets
(1998 - 2002)


Although initially intended to represent a foray into a variety of global markets, CIBC World Markets ultimately focused on three markets: Canada, the United States and to a lesser extent the United Kingdom. The CIBC World Markets unit suffered a net loss of C$186 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 which dragged down the performance of the parent bank's stock by almost one-third. The loss in 1998 was due primarily to very rapid expansion into regions impacted by the various financial crises in 1998 in Asia. As a result, CIBC World Markets refocused its efforts primarily on the U.S. and Canadian markets, despite the seemingly global ambitions implied in the unit's name.
CIBC World Markets reached a peak in 1999 and 2000, when the investment bank cracked the top ten of U.S. issuers of high yield bonds and the top twenty in mergers and acquisitions advisory. In 1999, CIBC World Markets, backed Gary Winnick and his company Global Crossing to build optical fiber cable connections under the ocean. CIBC would ultimately realize a gain of $2.0 billion from its relatively small equity investment in Global Crossing, representing more than 20% of the bank's profits in 2000.[4] On the back of the success in Global Crossing, CIBC backed the three heads of its CIBC Argosy Merchant Banking funds in a new private equity operation known as Trimaran Capital Partners. Trimaran closed on a $1 billion fund in April 2001, with capital provided primarily by CIBC.[3]
In June 2001, CIBC announced the construction of a new $800 million office tower at 300 Madison Avenue (At the corner of Madison Avenue and 42nd Street). The 35-story, 1,200,000-square-foot (110,000 m2) building was originally expected to house up to 3,000 employees, bringing CIBC's entire New York staff under one roof.[5] Following the crash of the dot-com bubble and the shutdown of the high yield markets in late 2000, CIBC World Markets began to suffer a series of setbacks. When the 300 Madison building was completed in 2004, CIBC's diminished workforce took up only a few floors, leasing the remainder to PriceWaterhouseCoopers.[6]
Decline of CIBC World Markets[edit]
In July 2001, the Wall Street Journal profiled CIBC World Markets, chronicling the rapid decline of the bank from the peaks of Wall Street's league table rankings.[7] At the same time, the High Yield Group was restructured with the original Argosy Group founders focusing their efforts solely on their private equity and merchant banking operations, known as Trimaran Capital Partners. Bloom, Heyer and Kehler were replaced by managing directors Edward Levy and Bruce Spohler. The Trimaran operations would subsequently spinout completely from CIBC World Markets.
By 2002 CIBC was forced to set aside C$1.5 billion for bad corporate loans, primarily from CIBC World Markets and the bank was linked two of the most famous victims of the corporate accounting scandals of the early 2000s: Enron Corporation and Global Crossing.[4] As a result of these developments, the parent bank implemented a strategy to reallocate resources away from the riskier CIBC World Markets division in favor of its retail operations.[4]
As part of this strategy, in 2003, CIBC sold an asset management division along with retail brokerage to Fahnestock Viner along with the Oppenheimer & Co. name. Upon doing so CIBC Wood Gundy (in Canada) and CIBC Oppenheimer (in US) became jointly known as CIBC World Markets. The Wood Gundy nomenclature lives on today as the retail brokerage division of CIBC World Markets Inc., however only operates in Canada; the U.S. operation lacking a retail arm. Also in September 2003, a jury found that CIBC had failed to provide complete financial information to investors in a high-yield bond offering. Just a few months later, at the end of 2003, CIBC reached an $80 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over its various financings for Enron, representing far more than the bank had earned in fees.[4]
Sale to Oppenheimer & Co. (Fahnestock Viner)[edit]
By 2004, CIBC had begun winding down much of its investment banking business in the United States. CIBC World Markets reduced its staff by two-thirds from 2001 through 2004.
In November 2007, the new Oppenheimer & Co. (Fahnestock) announced that it would purchase a major part of CIBC World Markets' U.S. Investment Banking, Corporate Syndicate, Institutional Sales and Trading, Equity Research, Options Trading and a portion of the Debt Capital Markets business which includes Convertible Bond Trading, Loan Syndication, High Yield Origination and Trading as well as related operations located in the UK, Israel and Hong Kong. The deal closed January 14, 2008 and essentially reunited the original Oppenheimer & Co. which CIBC divided in the sale to Fahnestock.
On February 29, 2008, CIBC World Markets Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian Shaw (Encana Corp) was replaced in both capacities by Richard Nesbitt, a former TSX Group CEO.[8][9]

The acquisition of Argosy marked an aggressive push by CIBC into the US investment banking business. Prior to that point, CIBC had never done a junk bond deal. Argosy's three major principals had worked on some of the biggest junk bond deals of the 1980s while at Drexel Burnham Lambert. The 52 Argosy employees constituted the core of what would become CIBC's High Yield Group and CIBC Argosy Merchant Banking funds that were responsible for, among other things, the $1 billion windfall that CIBC would earn from its early investments in Global Crossing. The Argosy principals also managed two collateralized debt obligation vehicles known as Caravelle Funds I and II.[3]




CIBC Oppenheimer
(1997 - 1999)


CIBC Oppenheimer[edit]
See also: Oppenheimer & Co.
In 1997, CIBC Wood Gundy (New York) under the direction of Michael S. Rulle acquired the U.S. brokerage house Oppenheimer & Co. CIBC wanted to expand its brokerage business and was interested in the New York-based firm which had annual revenues of $800 million and a network of 680 brokers, primarily selling stocks and bonds. Oppenheimer also included a small investment banking group.
Negotiations began talks with Oppenheimer in July 1997 and CIBC closed on the transaction in November 1997, paying $525 million over the next three years, including $175 million in retention payments to key Oppenheimer professionals. After the acquisition the U.S. division took the name CIBC Oppenheimer, eliminating the use of the Wood Gundy brand through much of the bank.
Creating the CIBC World Markets platform[edit]
By 1999, CIBC would scale back the usage of the Oppenheimer name in favor of CIBC World Markets. The business in Canada was centered around providing mergers and acquisitions advisory services and various equity offerings for large Canadian companies. However, with the acquisition of Argosy, the center of gravity of the investment bank began to shift toward the United States.




CIBC World Markets
(1998 - 2002)


Although initially intended to represent a foray into a variety of global markets, CIBC World Markets ultimately focused on three markets: Canada, the United States and to a lesser extent the United Kingdom. The CIBC World Markets unit suffered a net loss of C$186 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 which dragged down the performance of the parent bank's stock by almost one-third. The loss in 1998 was due primarily to very rapid expansion into regions impacted by the various financial crises in 1998 in Asia. As a result, CIBC World Markets refocused its efforts primarily on the U.S. and Canadian markets, despite the seemingly global ambitions implied in the unit's name.
CIBC World Markets reached a peak in 1999 and 2000, when the investment bank cracked the top ten of U.S. issuers of high yield bonds and the top twenty in mergers and acquisitions advisory. In 1999, CIBC World Markets, backed Gary Winnick and his company Global Crossing to build optical fiber cable connections under the ocean. CIBC would ultimately realize a gain of $2.0 billion from its relatively small equity investment in Global Crossing, representing more than 20% of the bank's profits in 2000.[4] On the back of the success in Global Crossing, CIBC backed the three heads of its CIBC Argosy Merchant Banking funds in a new private equity operation known as Trimaran Capital Partners. Trimaran closed on a $1 billion fund in April 2001, with capital provided primarily by CIBC.[3]
In June 2001, CIBC announced the construction of a new $800 million office tower at 300 Madison Avenue (At the corner of Madison Avenue and 42nd Street). The 35-story, 1,200,000-square-foot (110,000 m2) building was originally expected to house up to 3,000 employees, bringing CIBC's entire New York staff under one roof.[5] Following the crash of the dot-com bubble and the shutdown of the high yield markets in late 2000, CIBC World Markets began to suffer a series of setbacks. When the 300 Madison building was completed in 2004, CIBC's diminished workforce took up only a few floors, leasing the remainder to PriceWaterhouseCoopers.[6]
Decline of CIBC World Markets[edit]
In July 2001, the Wall Street Journal profiled CIBC World Markets, chronicling the rapid decline of the bank from the peaks of Wall Street's league table rankings.[7] At the same time, the High Yield Group was restructured with the original Argosy Group founders focusing their efforts solely on their private equity and merchant banking operations, known as Trimaran Capital Partners. Bloom, Heyer and Kehler were replaced by managing directors Edward Levy and Bruce Spohler. The Trimaran operations would subsequently spinout completely from CIBC World Markets.
By 2002 CIBC was forced to set aside C$1.5 billion for bad corporate loans, primarily from CIBC World Markets and the bank was linked two of the most famous victims of the corporate accounting scandals of the early 2000s: Enron Corporation and Global Crossing.[4] As a result of these developments, the parent bank implemented a strategy to reallocate resources away from the riskier CIBC World Markets division in favor of its retail operations.[4]
As part of this strategy, in 2003, CIBC sold an asset management division along with retail brokerage to Fahnestock Viner along with the Oppenheimer & Co. name. Upon doing so CIBC Wood Gundy (in Canada) and CIBC Oppenheimer (in US) became jointly known as CIBC World Markets. The Wood Gundy nomenclature lives on today as the retail brokerage division of CIBC World Markets Inc., however only operates in Canada; the U.S. operation lacking a retail arm. Also in September 2003, a jury found that CIBC had failed to provide complete financial information to investors in a high-yield bond offering. Just a few months later, at the end of 2003, CIBC reached an $80 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over its various financings for Enron, representing far more than the bank had earned in fees.[4]
Sale to Oppenheimer & Co. (Fahnestock Viner)[edit]
By 2004, CIBC had begun winding down much of its investment banking business in the United States. CIBC World Markets reduced its staff by two-thirds from 2001 through 2004.
In November 2007, the new Oppenheimer & Co. (Fahnestock) announced that it would purchase a major part of CIBC World Markets' U.S. Investment Banking, Corporate Syndicate, Institutional Sales and Trading, Equity Research, Options Trading and a portion of the Debt Capital Markets business which includes Convertible Bond Trading, Loan Syndication, High Yield Origination and Trading as well as related operations located in the UK, Israel and Hong Kong. The deal closed January 14, 2008 and essentially reunited the original Oppenheimer & Co. which CIBC divided in the sale to Fahnestock.
On February 29, 2008, CIBC World Markets Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian Shaw (Encana Corp) was replaced in both capacities by Richard Nesbitt, a former TSX Group CEO.[8][9]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
