About James Thomas Snyder

(c) 2013 Elizabeth Preovolos
James Thomas Snyder is my real name. I have used this site primarily to write short essays on political theory, public diplomacy, and propaganda. I have used it historically (that is, within the short time that I have created the site) to post, archive and curate my previously published work. This site is no longer active and I do not update it regularly.
I am a Foreign Service Officer with the U.S. Department of State. Formerly I served as a defense contractor, member of NATO’s International Staff in Brussels, Belgium, and U.S. Congressional Staff.  My published work has appeared in Foreign Policy, Military Review, The Hague Journal of Diplomacy, Joint Force Quarterly, Small Wars Review, Public Diplomacy Magazine, the International Herald Tribune, Los Angeles Review of Books, The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, Internationale Politik and Dissent, among other outlets. I have spoken at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, the National Defense University in Washington, D.C., the University of Copenhagen, Kent State University, and the London Metropolitan University, among other fora.
I am the author or translator of three books. In October 2013, Palgrave Macmillan published my book, The United States and the Challenge of Public Diplomacy. In July 2013, I published my book of political theory, American Republic: Essays on the Nature of Politics. In 2004 Texas A&M University Press published my translation of Pierre Hazan’s history of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, Justice in a Time of War.  I am a former contributor to cultureshutdown.net, which is concerned about the survival of cultural institutions in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
In 1995 I graduated from UCLA where I was an award-winning writer and editor for the Daily Bruin. In 2001 I received a joint J.D.-M.A. in law and international affairs from American University in Washington, D.C., where I won an award for Outstanding Scholarship at the Graduate Level.  I also studied at Meiji Gakuin University in Yokohama, Japan, the University of Paris X in Nanterre, France, and the University of Califoria’s Center for American Politics and Public Policy in Washington.
Please note that all posts, opinions and articles published here by me — except those works specifically commissioned — reflect my personal interests and do not represent the positions of any employer, past or present.
