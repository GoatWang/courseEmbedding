Holley Performance Products is an automotive performance company based in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Holley, when based in Michigan, was one of the major producers of carburetors, being supplied as standard equipment on many Detroit-built automobiles.
Later they manufactured carburetors for both street and racing applications such as the Holley "Double Pumper" and "Dominator". Holley-style carburetors have powered every NASCAR Sprint Cup team and every NHRA Pro Stock champion until both series eventually switched to electronic fuel injection. NASCAR Sprint Cup engines still utilize a Holley throttle body and Holley EFI is the spec EFI system in NHRA Pro Stock. Holley's product range has expanded to include the aforementioned fuel injection systems, performance fuel pumps, intake manifolds, superchargers, nitrous oxide injection, performance plumbing parts, exhaust systems, engine dress–up products, ignition products, datalogging & display products, handheld programmers, bellhousings, and clutches for street performance, race, and marine applications. Among the company's owned divisions are brand names MSD Performance, Nitrous Oxide Systems (NOS), Weiand, Flowtech, Earl's Performance Plumbing, Hooker Headers, Demon Carburetion, Racepak, Superchips, Diablosport, Edge Products, Accel Ignition, Quick Time, Hays Clutches, Mr. Gasket, Lakewood, and Mallory Ignition.

History[edit]




Holley Brothers Company advertisement for carburetors in the Automobile Trade Journal, 1916.


Holley began in Bradford, Pennsylvania in 1896 when brothers George (1878-1963) and Earl Holley started a company to produce a small one-cylinder three-wheeled vehicle they dubbed the "Runabout", with a top speed of 30 mph. At the eve of the era of motorcars, the brothers decided to start the Holley Motor Company, and produced one four-wheeled model: "The Holley brothers built their first marketable automobile in 1902. They called it the Holley Motorette and it sold for $550. More than 600 were produced." [1]
"Their first original carburetor, called the iron pot, appeared on the curved-dash Oldsmobile in 1904." [2] In April 1905 Holley Brothers Company was established with an address at 661-75 Beaubien St., Detroit, Michigan.[3] The brothers then concentrated on the manufacturing of carburetors and ignition systems.[4] As a result of the Motorette Henry Ford commissioned the brothers to produce a carburetor for his Model T. "The carburetor they built for Ford was an immediate success and the brothers founded Holley Carburetor Co., which became one of Ford's biggest suppliers." [5]
In 1913 George Holley made a tour of Germany to study manufacturing methods, accompanied by Henry M. Leland, when it was said that a Holley carburetor: "was on more than one-half of the automobiles sent out from American factories this year." [6]
In 1925 a Holley employee, Daniel H. Meloche, was awarded the Edward Longstreth Medal by the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia.[7] He had invented an improved refractory coating for casting molds, allowing permanent iron molds to make gray iron castings over many cycles, whereas earlier iron molds were quickly consumed when casting iron.[8] The process employing long-life molds was leased to the River Rouge plant of the Ford Motor Company, the Harrison Radiator Corporation, and the plant of Ludwig, Loewe & Co., of Berlin.[9]
In 1929 the Los Angeles Times reported that George M. Holley of Pasadena and Detroit and a director of the Aviation Corporation of Delaware, has been elected a director of the Bach Aircraft Corporation. Holley, while serving as president of the Holley Carburetor Company, was also a director of National Air Transport, Kinner Airplane and Motor, Stinson Aircraft of Detroit, Air Investors Inc., Towie Aircraft Company of Detroit, and one of the original stockholders of Western Air Express Inc.[10] In 1931 Holley became a director of the Warner Aircraft Corporation.[11]
In 1952 Holley closed a plant at Portland, Michigan, which moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky.[12] That year Holley produced the Visi-flo carburetor, with a glass inspection window to make a visual check of the fuel level, sediment, flooding and float action. The glass fuel bowl was manufactured by the Lancaster Lens company of Lancaster, Ohio.[13] In 1955 the Wall Street Journal reported: "Bowling Green Manufacturing Co., a subsidiary of Holley Carburetor Co., each year sends its employes dummy "checks" made out for the amount each employee has received indirectly through fringe benefits." [14]
In 1968 the Plain Dealer reported: "Colt Industries Inc. has acquired Holley Carburetor Co., of Warren, Michigan, following approval by directors of both companies. Holley Carburetor which makes auto ignition systems and aviation fuel controls, employs about 3,000 at four facilities in three states." [15] At this time the corporate, engineering and sales headquarters were in Warren, with plants in Bowling Green, Kentucky; Paris, Tennessee and Clare, Michigan.[16] Holley was said to have a turnover of $40 million in 1967. At the time of the sale the company was primarily owned by members of the Holley family.[17]
In 1974 Holley was making carburetors for Ford and some under its own name at Paris, Tennessee.[18] "Significant facilities expansions were initiated in 1979 at Water Valley, Mississippi to meet carburetor requirements for the new Ford Motor Company four-cylinder car, code named Erika, and in Bowling Green, Kentucky; Paris, Tennessee and Sallisaw, Oklahoma." [19] In 1993 Coltec Industries Inc., of New York, closed the administrative offices at Warren, Michigan, and a warehouse at Goodlettsville, Tennessee. These functions were moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky.[20]
Holley continued its dominance in racing, powering all winning NHRA Pro Stock racers and all NASCAR Sprint Cup Series™ teams. The 1980s also saw Holley's entrance into the fuel injection market where OEM EFI components and analog Pro-Jection® retrofit fuel-injection systems for carbureted cars were introduced.
In the early 1990s Holley continued new product introductions with the HP Pro Series race-ready carburetors. During this time Holley also introduced SysteMAX® engine kits that included matched cylinder heads, intakes and cams. The Dominator also evolved in the 1990s into the HP Dominator; huge billet electric fuel pumps were introduced, and retrofit EFI kits evolved into digital Pro-Jection 4D and 4Di.
In 1998 Coltec Industries sold Holley Performance for $100 million to a management-led team backed by Kohlberg & Co., L.L.C. [21]
In 1999, after becoming independent of Coltec Industries, the management team purchased a number of other aftermarket companies in an effort to provide a "full package" to their customers/dealers. These companies include: Weiand (intake manifolds and superchargers), B&M's supercharger division, Hooker Headers, Earl's Performance Plumbing, Flow Tech exhaust, Lunati (camshafts, crankshafts, pistons and connecting rods), NOS (Nitrous Oxide Systems, Inc), and So-Cal Speed Shop, as well as a few ancillary companies.
In 2000, Holley leased a facility in Aberdeen, Mississippi, with a plan to centralize five existing plants in the U.S., Mexico and Canada.[22]
2010 Holley creates the LS Fest, a show, race and celebration of vehicles that utilize a GM LSV8 engine.[23] The LS-Fest has a variety of bracket racing, engine swap, braking, autocross, show & shine and other events that attracted large crowds and participants to the show's venue September 10–12, 2010, at Beech Bend Raceway in Bowling Green, KY. The LS Fest has been continuing every year since in September.
2013 marked Holley's 110th anniversary.
On December 8, 2014, Holley acquired DiabloSport Inc. The industry leader in vehicle calibration.
On September 22, 2015, Holley acquired MSD Group, which includes brands MSD, Mr. Gasket, Lakewood, Accel, Mallory, Hays, and SuperChips.
Standard equipment on modern race cars[edit]
2011 - NASCAR decides to switch from carburetors to fuel injection systems for the 2012 Sprint Cup racing season. Holley's billet aluminum throttle bodies were selected in conjunction with a McLaren Electronic Systems and Freescale Semiconductor.[24]
2012 - Holley Hi-Ram intake manifold becomes standard equipment on GM COPO Camaros equipped with the LS7 aluminum block.[25]
2012 - Holley's Earl's Performance Plumbing brand transmission coolers become standard equipment on GM COPO Camaros.[25]
2013 - Holley HP EFI engine control unit (ECU) became standard equipment used on all of Chevrolet Performance's COPO Camaro factory-built race cars.[25]
2015 - Holley HP EFI engine control unit (ECU) became optional equipment used in conjunction with the Ilmor 396 engine package which is legal for use in the ARCA racing series.[26]
2016 - Holley HP EFI engine control unit (ECU) became standard equipment used on all cars in the NHRA's Pro Stock class, the world premier class for naturally aspirated drag cars.[27]
Bankruptcy facts[edit]
As of February 12, 2008, Holley filed for bankruptcy.[28] The 2008 bankruptcy led Holley to transfer its equity to holders of $95 million in second-lien debt. During 2009 Holley closed a plant at Tijuana, Mexico, that made Hooker Headers, and transferred the work to Aberdeen, Mississippi.[29] As of September 28, 2009, Holley filed for bankruptcy Chapter 11 protection.[30]
Effective June 22, 2010, Holley emerged from bankruptcy protection.[31]
In 2012, the private equity firm Monomoy Capital Partners acquired Holley Performance Products.[32]
In 2013, Monomoy Capital Partners sold Holley to Lincolnshire Equity Fund IV, L.P.[33]
In 2015, Holley acquired the MSD Group which includes MSD Performance, Mr. Gasket, Accel, Superchips, Edge, Racepak, Mallory, Hays, QuickTime, and Lakewood.[34]

Holley Performance Products is an automotive performance company based in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Holley, when based in Michigan, was one of the major producers of carburetors, being supplied as standard equipment on many Detroit-built automobiles.
Later they manufactured carburetors for both street and racing applications such as the Holley "Double Pumper" and "Dominator". Holley-style carburetors have powered every NASCAR Sprint Cup team and every NHRA Pro Stock champion until both series eventually switched to electronic fuel injection. NASCAR Sprint Cup engines still utilize a Holley throttle body and Holley EFI is the spec EFI system in NHRA Pro Stock. Holley's product range has expanded to include the aforementioned fuel injection systems, performance fuel pumps, intake manifolds, superchargers, nitrous oxide injection, performance plumbing parts, exhaust systems, engine dress–up products, ignition products, datalogging & display products, handheld programmers, bellhousings, and clutches for street performance, race, and marine applications. Among the company's owned divisions are brand names MSD Performance, Nitrous Oxide Systems (NOS), Weiand, Flowtech, Earl's Performance Plumbing, Hooker Headers, Demon Carburetion, Racepak, Superchips, Diablosport, Edge Products, Accel Ignition, Quick Time, Hays Clutches, Mr. Gasket, Lakewood, and Mallory Ignition.

History[edit]




Holley Brothers Company advertisement for carburetors in the Automobile Trade Journal, 1916.


Holley began in Bradford, Pennsylvania in 1896 when brothers George (1878-1963) and Earl Holley started a company to produce a small one-cylinder three-wheeled vehicle they dubbed the "Runabout", with a top speed of 30 mph. At the eve of the era of motorcars, the brothers decided to start the Holley Motor Company, and produced one four-wheeled model: "The Holley brothers built their first marketable automobile in 1902. They called it the Holley Motorette and it sold for $550. More than 600 were produced." [1]
"Their first original carburetor, called the iron pot, appeared on the curved-dash Oldsmobile in 1904." [2] In April 1905 Holley Brothers Company was established with an address at 661-75 Beaubien St., Detroit, Michigan.[3] The brothers then concentrated on the manufacturing of carburetors and ignition systems.[4] As a result of the Motorette Henry Ford commissioned the brothers to produce a carburetor for his Model T. "The carburetor they built for Ford was an immediate success and the brothers founded Holley Carburetor Co., which became one of Ford's biggest suppliers." [5]
In 1913 George Holley made a tour of Germany to study manufacturing methods, accompanied by Henry M. Leland, when it was said that a Holley carburetor: "was on more than one-half of the automobiles sent out from American factories this year." [6]
In 1925 a Holley employee, Daniel H. Meloche, was awarded the Edward Longstreth Medal by the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia.[7] He had invented an improved refractory coating for casting molds, allowing permanent iron molds to make gray iron castings over many cycles, whereas earlier iron molds were quickly consumed when casting iron.[8] The process employing long-life molds was leased to the River Rouge plant of the Ford Motor Company, the Harrison Radiator Corporation, and the plant of Ludwig, Loewe & Co., of Berlin.[9]
In 1929 the Los Angeles Times reported that George M. Holley of Pasadena and Detroit and a director of the Aviation Corporation of Delaware, has been elected a director of the Bach Aircraft Corporation. Holley, while serving as president of the Holley Carburetor Company, was also a director of National Air Transport, Kinner Airplane and Motor, Stinson Aircraft of Detroit, Air Investors Inc., Towie Aircraft Company of Detroit, and one of the original stockholders of Western Air Express Inc.[10] In 1931 Holley became a director of the Warner Aircraft Corporation.[11]
In 1952 Holley closed a plant at Portland, Michigan, which moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky.[12] That year Holley produced the Visi-flo carburetor, with a glass inspection window to make a visual check of the fuel level, sediment, flooding and float action. The glass fuel bowl was manufactured by the Lancaster Lens company of Lancaster, Ohio.[13] In 1955 the Wall Street Journal reported: "Bowling Green Manufacturing Co., a subsidiary of Holley Carburetor Co., each year sends its employes dummy "checks" made out for the amount each employee has received indirectly through fringe benefits." [14]
In 1968 the Plain Dealer reported: "Colt Industries Inc. has acquired Holley Carburetor Co., of Warren, Michigan, following approval by directors of both companies. Holley Carburetor which makes auto ignition systems and aviation fuel controls, employs about 3,000 at four facilities in three states." [15] At this time the corporate, engineering and sales headquarters were in Warren, with plants in Bowling Green, Kentucky; Paris, Tennessee and Clare, Michigan.[16] Holley was said to have a turnover of $40 million in 1967. At the time of the sale the company was primarily owned by members of the Holley family.[17]
In 1974 Holley was making carburetors for Ford and some under its own name at Paris, Tennessee.[18] "Significant facilities expansions were initiated in 1979 at Water Valley, Mississippi to meet carburetor requirements for the new Ford Motor Company four-cylinder car, code named Erika, and in Bowling Green, Kentucky; Paris, Tennessee and Sallisaw, Oklahoma." [19] In 1993 Coltec Industries Inc., of New York, closed the administrative offices at Warren, Michigan, and a warehouse at Goodlettsville, Tennessee. These functions were moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky.[20]
Holley continued its dominance in racing, powering all winning NHRA Pro Stock racers and all NASCAR Sprint Cup Series™ teams. The 1980s also saw Holley's entrance into the fuel injection market where OEM EFI components and analog Pro-Jection® retrofit fuel-injection systems for carbureted cars were introduced.
In the early 1990s Holley continued new product introductions with the HP Pro Series race-ready carburetors. During this time Holley also introduced SysteMAX® engine kits that included matched cylinder heads, intakes and cams. The Dominator also evolved in the 1990s into the HP Dominator; huge billet electric fuel pumps were introduced, and retrofit EFI kits evolved into digital Pro-Jection 4D and 4Di.
In 1998 Coltec Industries sold Holley Performance for $100 million to a management-led team backed by Kohlberg & Co., L.L.C. [21]
In 1999, after becoming independent of Coltec Industries, the management team purchased a number of other aftermarket companies in an effort to provide a "full package" to their customers/dealers. These companies include: Weiand (intake manifolds and superchargers), B&M's supercharger division, Hooker Headers, Earl's Performance Plumbing, Flow Tech exhaust, Lunati (camshafts, crankshafts, pistons and connecting rods), NOS (Nitrous Oxide Systems, Inc), and So-Cal Speed Shop, as well as a few ancillary companies.
In 2000, Holley leased a facility in Aberdeen, Mississippi, with a plan to centralize five existing plants in the U.S., Mexico and Canada.[22]
2010 Holley creates the LS Fest, a show, race and celebration of vehicles that utilize a GM LSV8 engine.[23] The LS-Fest has a variety of bracket racing, engine swap, braking, autocross, show & shine and other events that attracted large crowds and participants to the show's venue September 10–12, 2010, at Beech Bend Raceway in Bowling Green, KY. The LS Fest has been continuing every year since in September.
2013 marked Holley's 110th anniversary.
On December 8, 2014, Holley acquired DiabloSport Inc. The industry leader in vehicle calibration.
On September 22, 2015, Holley acquired MSD Group, which includes brands MSD, Mr. Gasket, Lakewood, Accel, Mallory, Hays, and SuperChips.
Standard equipment on modern race cars[edit]
2011 - NASCAR decides to switch from carburetors to fuel injection systems for the 2012 Sprint Cup racing season. Holley's billet aluminum throttle bodies were selected in conjunction with a McLaren Electronic Systems and Freescale Semiconductor.[24]
2012 - Holley Hi-Ram intake manifold becomes standard equipment on GM COPO Camaros equipped with the LS7 aluminum block.[25]
2012 - Holley's Earl's Performance Plumbing brand transmission coolers become standard equipment on GM COPO Camaros.[25]
2013 - Holley HP EFI engine control unit (ECU) became standard equipment used on all of Chevrolet Performance's COPO Camaro factory-built race cars.[25]
2015 - Holley HP EFI engine control unit (ECU) became optional equipment used in conjunction with the Ilmor 396 engine package which is legal for use in the ARCA racing series.[26]
2016 - Holley HP EFI engine control unit (ECU) became standard equipment used on all cars in the NHRA's Pro Stock class, the world premier class for naturally aspirated drag cars.[27]
Bankruptcy facts[edit]
As of February 12, 2008, Holley filed for bankruptcy.[28] The 2008 bankruptcy led Holley to transfer its equity to holders of $95 million in second-lien debt. During 2009 Holley closed a plant at Tijuana, Mexico, that made Hooker Headers, and transferred the work to Aberdeen, Mississippi.[29] As of September 28, 2009, Holley filed for bankruptcy Chapter 11 protection.[30]
Effective June 22, 2010, Holley emerged from bankruptcy protection.[31]
In 2012, the private equity firm Monomoy Capital Partners acquired Holley Performance Products.[32]
In 2013, Monomoy Capital Partners sold Holley to Lincolnshire Equity Fund IV, L.P.[33]
In 2015, Holley acquired the MSD Group which includes MSD Performance, Mr. Gasket, Accel, Superchips, Edge, Racepak, Mallory, Hays, QuickTime, and Lakewood.[34]

Holley Performance Products is an automotive performance company based in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Holley, when based in Michigan, was one of the major producers of carburetors, being supplied as standard equipment on many Detroit-built automobiles.
Later they manufactured carburetors for both street and racing applications such as the Holley "Double Pumper" and "Dominator". Holley-style carburetors have powered every NASCAR Sprint Cup team and every NHRA Pro Stock champion until both series eventually switched to electronic fuel injection. NASCAR Sprint Cup engines still utilize a Holley throttle body and Holley EFI is the spec EFI system in NHRA Pro Stock. Holley's product range has expanded to include the aforementioned fuel injection systems, performance fuel pumps, intake manifolds, superchargers, nitrous oxide injection, performance plumbing parts, exhaust systems, engine dress–up products, ignition products, datalogging & display products, handheld programmers, bellhousings, and clutches for street performance, race, and marine applications. Among the company's owned divisions are brand names MSD Performance, Nitrous Oxide Systems (NOS), Weiand, Flowtech, Earl's Performance Plumbing, Hooker Headers, Demon Carburetion, Racepak, Superchips, Diablosport, Edge Products, Accel Ignition, Quick Time, Hays Clutches, Mr. Gasket, Lakewood, and Mallory Ignition.

History[edit]




Holley Brothers Company advertisement for carburetors in the Automobile Trade Journal, 1916.


Holley began in Bradford, Pennsylvania in 1896 when brothers George (1878-1963) and Earl Holley started a company to produce a small one-cylinder three-wheeled vehicle they dubbed the "Runabout", with a top speed of 30 mph. At the eve of the era of motorcars, the brothers decided to start the Holley Motor Company, and produced one four-wheeled model: "The Holley brothers built their first marketable automobile in 1902. They called it the Holley Motorette and it sold for $550. More than 600 were produced." [1]
"Their first original carburetor, called the iron pot, appeared on the curved-dash Oldsmobile in 1904." [2] In April 1905 Holley Brothers Company was established with an address at 661-75 Beaubien St., Detroit, Michigan.[3] The brothers then concentrated on the manufacturing of carburetors and ignition systems.[4] As a result of the Motorette Henry Ford commissioned the brothers to produce a carburetor for his Model T. "The carburetor they built for Ford was an immediate success and the brothers founded Holley Carburetor Co., which became one of Ford's biggest suppliers." [5]
In 1913 George Holley made a tour of Germany to study manufacturing methods, accompanied by Henry M. Leland, when it was said that a Holley carburetor: "was on more than one-half of the automobiles sent out from American factories this year." [6]
In 1925 a Holley employee, Daniel H. Meloche, was awarded the Edward Longstreth Medal by the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia.[7] He had invented an improved refractory coating for casting molds, allowing permanent iron molds to make gray iron castings over many cycles, whereas earlier iron molds were quickly consumed when casting iron.[8] The process employing long-life molds was leased to the River Rouge plant of the Ford Motor Company, the Harrison Radiator Corporation, and the plant of Ludwig, Loewe & Co., of Berlin.[9]
In 1929 the Los Angeles Times reported that George M. Holley of Pasadena and Detroit and a director of the Aviation Corporation of Delaware, has been elected a director of the Bach Aircraft Corporation. Holley, while serving as president of the Holley Carburetor Company, was also a director of National Air Transport, Kinner Airplane and Motor, Stinson Aircraft of Detroit, Air Investors Inc., Towie Aircraft Company of Detroit, and one of the original stockholders of Western Air Express Inc.[10] In 1931 Holley became a director of the Warner Aircraft Corporation.[11]
In 1952 Holley closed a plant at Portland, Michigan, which moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky.[12] That year Holley produced the Visi-flo carburetor, with a glass inspection window to make a visual check of the fuel level, sediment, flooding and float action. The glass fuel bowl was manufactured by the Lancaster Lens company of Lancaster, Ohio.[13] In 1955 the Wall Street Journal reported: "Bowling Green Manufacturing Co., a subsidiary of Holley Carburetor Co., each year sends its employes dummy "checks" made out for the amount each employee has received indirectly through fringe benefits." [14]
In 1968 the Plain Dealer reported: "Colt Industries Inc. has acquired Holley Carburetor Co., of Warren, Michigan, following approval by directors of both companies. Holley Carburetor which makes auto ignition systems and aviation fuel controls, employs about 3,000 at four facilities in three states." [15] At this time the corporate, engineering and sales headquarters were in Warren, with plants in Bowling Green, Kentucky; Paris, Tennessee and Clare, Michigan.[16] Holley was said to have a turnover of $40 million in 1967. At the time of the sale the company was primarily owned by members of the Holley family.[17]
In 1974 Holley was making carburetors for Ford and some under its own name at Paris, Tennessee.[18] "Significant facilities expansions were initiated in 1979 at Water Valley, Mississippi to meet carburetor requirements for the new Ford Motor Company four-cylinder car, code named Erika, and in Bowling Green, Kentucky; Paris, Tennessee and Sallisaw, Oklahoma." [19] In 1993 Coltec Industries Inc., of New York, closed the administrative offices at Warren, Michigan, and a warehouse at Goodlettsville, Tennessee. These functions were moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky.[20]
Holley continued its dominance in racing, powering all winning NHRA Pro Stock racers and all NASCAR Sprint Cup Series™ teams. The 1980s also saw Holley's entrance into the fuel injection market where OEM EFI components and analog Pro-Jection® retrofit fuel-injection systems for carbureted cars were introduced.
In the early 1990s Holley continued new product introductions with the HP Pro Series race-ready carburetors. During this time Holley also introduced SysteMAX® engine kits that included matched cylinder heads, intakes and cams. The Dominator also evolved in the 1990s into the HP Dominator; huge billet electric fuel pumps were introduced, and retrofit EFI kits evolved into digital Pro-Jection 4D and 4Di.
In 1998 Coltec Industries sold Holley Performance for $100 million to a management-led team backed by Kohlberg & Co., L.L.C. [21]
In 1999, after becoming independent of Coltec Industries, the management team purchased a number of other aftermarket companies in an effort to provide a "full package" to their customers/dealers. These companies include: Weiand (intake manifolds and superchargers), B&M's supercharger division, Hooker Headers, Earl's Performance Plumbing, Flow Tech exhaust, Lunati (camshafts, crankshafts, pistons and connecting rods), NOS (Nitrous Oxide Systems, Inc), and So-Cal Speed Shop, as well as a few ancillary companies.
In 2000, Holley leased a facility in Aberdeen, Mississippi, with a plan to centralize five existing plants in the U.S., Mexico and Canada.[22]
2010 Holley creates the LS Fest, a show, race and celebration of vehicles that utilize a GM LSV8 engine.[23] The LS-Fest has a variety of bracket racing, engine swap, braking, autocross, show & shine and other events that attracted large crowds and participants to the show's venue September 10–12, 2010, at Beech Bend Raceway in Bowling Green, KY. The LS Fest has been continuing every year since in September.
2013 marked Holley's 110th anniversary.
On December 8, 2014, Holley acquired DiabloSport Inc. The industry leader in vehicle calibration.
On September 22, 2015, Holley acquired MSD Group, which includes brands MSD, Mr. Gasket, Lakewood, Accel, Mallory, Hays, and SuperChips.
Standard equipment on modern race cars[edit]
2011 - NASCAR decides to switch from carburetors to fuel injection systems for the 2012 Sprint Cup racing season. Holley's billet aluminum throttle bodies were selected in conjunction with a McLaren Electronic Systems and Freescale Semiconductor.[24]
2012 - Holley Hi-Ram intake manifold becomes standard equipment on GM COPO Camaros equipped with the LS7 aluminum block.[25]
2012 - Holley's Earl's Performance Plumbing brand transmission coolers become standard equipment on GM COPO Camaros.[25]
2013 - Holley HP EFI engine control unit (ECU) became standard equipment used on all of Chevrolet Performance's COPO Camaro factory-built race cars.[25]
2015 - Holley HP EFI engine control unit (ECU) became optional equipment used in conjunction with the Ilmor 396 engine package which is legal for use in the ARCA racing series.[26]
2016 - Holley HP EFI engine control unit (ECU) became standard equipment used on all cars in the NHRA's Pro Stock class, the world premier class for naturally aspirated drag cars.[27]
Bankruptcy facts[edit]
As of February 12, 2008, Holley filed for bankruptcy.[28] The 2008 bankruptcy led Holley to transfer its equity to holders of $95 million in second-lien debt. During 2009 Holley closed a plant at Tijuana, Mexico, that made Hooker Headers, and transferred the work to Aberdeen, Mississippi.[29] As of September 28, 2009, Holley filed for bankruptcy Chapter 11 protection.[30]
Effective June 22, 2010, Holley emerged from bankruptcy protection.[31]
In 2012, the private equity firm Monomoy Capital Partners acquired Holley Performance Products.[32]
In 2013, Monomoy Capital Partners sold Holley to Lincolnshire Equity Fund IV, L.P.[33]
In 2015, Holley acquired the MSD Group which includes MSD Performance, Mr. Gasket, Accel, Superchips, Edge, Racepak, Mallory, Hays, QuickTime, and Lakewood.[34]

Holley Performance Products Inc. - Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on Holley Performance Products Inc.










1801 Russellville RoadBowling Green, Kentucky 42101U.S.A.


Company Perspectives:

For over a century, since before the Holley Brothers Company was founded in 1903, the Holley name has been synonymous with high performance.
History of Holley Performance Products Inc.








Holley Performance Products Inc., based in Bowling Green, Kentucky, is a major manufacturer of aftermarket components used in racing, street, marine, powersports, and industrial high-performance engines. Holley's extensive product lines include performance carburetors, superchargers, intake manifolds, ignition systems, fuel pumps, exhaust systems, internal engine components, and engine kits. The company also produces remanufactured carburetors and fuel injection components. In addition to Holley, brands include NOS, Hooker, Weiand, Flow Tech, General Kinetics, Lunati, Earl's, and Annihilator. Holley Performance products are found at major retailers such as Advance Auto Parts, AutoZone, and O'Reilly.

Holley Brothers As Automotive Pioneers at the Dawn of the 20th Century

The founders of the company that would evolve into today's Holley Performance Products were brothers George and Earl Holley, who grew up in Bradford, Pennsylvania. The eldest, George, was born in 1878, and Earl was born three years later. At a young age George became fascinated with motorcycles and the internal combustion engine. In the 1860s there had been some experimentation in powering a bicycle with a steam engine, but the combination proved far too bulky. Then came the invention of the four-cycle gasoline engine by Nikolaus August Otto. A German engineer named Gottlieb Daimler, who worked with Otto, began developing engines and a reliable self-firing ignition system in order to propel a vehicle. He and his collaborator, Wilhelm Maybach, first powered a boat with their engine, then in 1885 fitted it to a wooden bicycle frame, producing the world's first motorcycle. Almost 20 years would pass before the motorcycle developed into a truly commercial vehicle. In the meantime, Daimler and Maybach moved on to produce one of the earliest automobiles and form Daimler Motor Company. Daimler's legacy is still recalled in the name of one of today's top automakers, DaimlerChrysler.
George Holley was one of many inventors who followed in Daimler and Maybach's footsteps. As a teenager he built and raced his own motorcycles, and Earl soon began to help him. In 1897 they designed and built a three-wheeled, single-cylinder automobile capable of going 30 miles per hour, which they dubbed The Runabout.
Earl was working as a bank teller, when in 1899 the 18-year-old put his limited business knowledge to work by joining forces with his brother to form Holley Motor Company to manufacture motorcycle engines. Earl, serving as president, handled the administrative end, while George, the chairman of the concern, was in charge of engineering and sales. The demand for motorcycle engines, however, proved to be limited because what customers wanted were complete motorcycles. The brothers began making motorcycles, and George promoted the business with his considerable driving skills. In 1902 he won the first Motorcycle Endurance Contest, and set a number of world speed records for motorcycles at the prestigious Pan American Exposition in Buffalo, New York.

Introducing the Iron Pot Carburetor in 1904

The Holley brothers turned their focus to automobiles after they gained the U.S. rights to a French carburetor. In 1903 they produced their first four-wheel automobile, The Holley Motorette, and although they would sell more than 600 over the next three years, the Holley brothers sensed the need to specialize as the automotive industry began to sort itself out. They were approached by Henry Ford in 1903 to produce carburetors for the Model T, and along with partner George Welch they formed a new corporation, Holley Brothers Company, to produce carburetors as well as ignition-system components.
In 1904 they introduced their first carburetor, the "iron pot," for use in the curved-dash Oldsmobile. When it also began to be used by Ford, the brothers decided to move their operations from Bradford to Detroit, the heart of the rapidly growing U.S. automotive industry. Their first Detroit plant opened in 1907, the same year that their ignition business got a boost when a car using a Holley Magneto won a major 24-hour race.
Over the next ten years the Holley brothers prospered in Detroit, growing in tandem with Ford, and even starting a plant to produce a kerosene carburetor for Ford tractors. In 1917, Henry Ford, who liked to control all aspects of automobile manufacture, decided to acquire the Holleys' car carburetor business. Following the sale, the brothers reorganized around the tractor division, forming Holley Kerosene Carburetor Company, and in addition to Ford they began selling their product to Chevrolet and International Harvester. During World War I, Holley not only sold carburetors and ignition components to the army, but also brass heads for artillery shells. In the final year of the war, because they were no longer limited to the manufacture of kerosene carburetors, the brothers changed their company name to Holley Carburetor Company.








In the 1920s the Holleys branched out into a number of directions. In 1926 they built another Detroit factory, which included an advanced research facility. It was also during this period that the company began to provide carburetors for the airplane industry. Only used at first by Curtiss-Wright, Holley's airplane carburetors were quickly adopted by American Airlines and Pan-American Airlines, as well as the U.S. Coast Guard and armed forces around the world. In 1935 the company introduced a variable venturi carburetor that overcame icing problems. The popular DC-3 airplane adopted the new carburetor, and then during World War II it was adapted for use by bombers and PT boats. Also during the 1930s, Holley expanded its range of automotive parts to include distributors, circuit breakers, heat regulators, and fuel pumps. To help support the growing business, in 1939 Holley opened yet another plant, this one in Portland, Michigan. The extra capacity would soon be vitally needed for the war effort. According to Holley, half of all carburetors used by U.S. troops were made by its factories, whether they were used in cars, trucks, boats, or airplanes.
Because of wartime restrictions, new commercial vehicles were not produced during World War II. With the economy booming after a decade of depression and pent-up consumer demand, the automotive industry was set for a period of explosive growth. Holley, with a second generation getting ready to take charge of the business, also was prepared to prosper in the postwar environment. In 1946 the company opened a new plant in Clare, Michigan, and two years later a factory in Paris, Tennessee. During this period Holley introduced fuel control devices for gas turbine and jet airplane engines. The company also began to produce a line of side air inlet carburetors for use in trucks and buses. On the automotive side, Holley improved ignition efficiency by developing the first pressure distributor. To accommodate the new robust automobiles that Americans wanted, Holley brought out a four-barrel carburetor. In addition, the company became involved in the aftermarket business, offering genuine Holley parts and carburetor repair kits.
The 1950s saw a number of changes at Holley. In 1951 the main Detroit plant was closed and a new factory was established in Warren, Michigan. Holley then moved into Bowling Green, Kentucky, opening a factory in 1952. The following year, management began to turn over the reins to a new generation. Earl Holley retired from day-to-day responsibilities and George Holley, Jr., became president of the company. Also taking top positions were Danforth Holley, director of Cost Savings, and Jack Holley, vice-president of Sales. Earl Holley stayed on as vice-chairman of the corporation until his death in 1958. Older brother George outlived him, eventually passing away in 1963 at the age of 86. As automobiles changed during the 1950s, becoming ever more powerful, Holley's research and development team kept pace. Today's modular carburetor is the result of work from this time, which resulted in the development of the 4150-four-barrel carburetor used in the 1957 T-Bird. On the other side of the spectrum, compact cars also were becoming popular with the car-buying public. To accommodate the specific needs of this market, Holley designed a single bore carburetor, which was then modified for each compact model.
In 1965 Holley manufactured its 100 millionth carburetor. Although the carburetor remained the company's signature product, Holley had branched into numerous other directions since the introduction of the iron pot. Not only were Holley parts sold around the world, in 1963 a European subsidiary opened a factory in Turin, Italy, to manufacture carburetors, governors, and fuel pumps overseas. To take the next step in growing its business, as well as achieving diversification, Holley chose in 1968 to merge with Colt Industries in a tax-free merger. Colt ultimately changed its name to Coltec Industries, a company with aerospace and industrial operations in addition to automotive parts. Holley merged its Clare, Michigan operation with Colt's Chandlier aircraft division and, renamed as Holley Replacement Parts, the business began a period of expansion. Factories in Water Valley, Mississippi, and Sallisaw, Oklahoma, were acquired in 1973, and the Paris, Tennessee facility built a test laboratory. Holley's popular DOMINATOR racing carburetor, which was launched in 1968, was now modified to produce a consumer line of DOMINATOR intake manifolds. To accommodate fuel-efficient cars, which were becoming increasingly more important, the company developed economy carburetors to fill out their product line. In 1985 Holley also became involved in the fuel injection market.
Around 1980 Holley reached its peak in employment with 2,800 workers. Also at this time the company decided to stop manufacturing original-equipment carburetors and focus on the growing auto-racing market. By the mid-1990s employment dipped below 1,000. Holley Replacement Parts Division was renamed Holley Performance Products in 1994 and subsequently moved its administrative offices to Bowling Green, Kentucky, as well as its warehouse operations, which had been located in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. In addition, a state-of-the art research and development center was built in the Bowling Green facility. A Detroit sales office, however, was retained to serve automakers and other regional customers.
As a result of these changes, all of Holley's operations were brought closer together, allowing for greater efficiency and better coordination. Centralization was especially helpful in bringing new products to the market, with engineering, research and development, testing, and manufacturing better able to function as a team. Product development also was enhanced by the rise of new technologies, from modeling techniques to automated production equipment and assembly systems.

Management-Led Buyout in 1998

Coltec decided in 1996 to focus its resources on the aerospace and industrial divisions, and it began to divest itself of its automotive components businesses. In 1997 Jeffrey G. King was named president of the Holley Performance Products Division. He came to the company with ten years of experience at Arvin Industries, an automotive systems and components company, and three years at Lincoln Brass Works, where he quickly rose to the rank of executive vice-president and chief operating officer. After only a year with Holley, in 1998, King led a management group in a buyout of the subsidiary, which at the time was generating annual sales of $100 million. Sponsoring the buyout was Kohlberg & Co., a private merchant banking firm operating out of Mount Kisco, New York. Kohlberg invested $51 million in the $100 million deal, gaining a 97 percent stake in Holley. King quickly made it known that the newly independent company would be aggressive about buying into new markets, and was especially interested in moving into the expanding power sports area, which in addition to motorcycles included personal watercraft, snowmobiles, and four wheelers. King's vision, in essence, was to make Holley into a one-stop shop for engines, with the intention of controlling the fuel air from the point it entered an engine to where it exited through the exhaust.
King soon backed up his words with actions, as over the next two years Holley completed a number of acquisitions. On the day the management buyout was completed, in fact, the company announced the acquisition of the fuel injection division of Florida-based Hirel Technologies, which added to Holley's marine product line. Several months later in November 1998, Weiand Automotive Industries of Los Angeles was acquired. Weiand was a highly regarded name in the performance market, manufacturing intake manifolds, water pumps, and supercharger technology for the marine, street performance, and racing markets. Also that month, Holley acquired Lunati Cams and Lunati Pistons of Memphis, Tennessee, adding lines of camshafts, crankshafts, pistons, and connecting rods. In October 1999 Holley bought the Marine and Automotive Supercharger Division of B&M Racing and Performance Products of Chatsworth, California. Holley soon made other important acquisitions, adding Hooker Headers and FlowTech Exhaust Systems of Phoenix, Arizona, followed by the purchase of Nitrous Oxide Systems, Inc. (NOS).
To support its growing stable of subsidiaries and product lines, Holley supplemented its salesforce by forming strategic alliances with several regional sales agencies in 2000. Also in that year, Holley added to its production capacity by striking a deal to move into a 350,000-square-foot facility in Aberdeen, Mississippi. The building, jointly owned by the city of Aberdeen and the county, was formerly used by Walker Manufacturing Co. to produce automobile exhaust systems. Holley personnel originally visited the site to consider buying some of Walker's equipment, but quickly recognized that the plant, which had undergone major renovations, was an attractive site. Moreover, Walker was leaving behind an available trained workforce. With Walker also leaving a vacuum in the local economy, Holley was able to negotiate favorable terms from area officials. Operations at Aberdeen began in January 2001, with 70 percent of the workforce former Walker employees. Holley was then able to close an Arizona facility as well as two Mexican plants, which had been purchased only two years earlier, and transfer those operations to Aberdeen. With a downturn in the economy the level of new business failed to meet Holley's expectations and Aberdeen employed only about 100 instead of the 150 originally projected. As a consequence the Bowling Green distribution center did not hire an additional 100 workers as planned. Although Holley was now generating $160 million in annual revenues, it was not performing at an acceptable level. In August 2002 King resigned and was replaced by the chairman of the board, James Wiggins, who announced his goal of making Holley into "a lean manufacturing operation." Several days later 23 employees were laid off.
Holley approached its centennial as an important player in the aftermarket parts industry. To celebrate its past the company prepared a fleet of ten unique stock vehicles, representing the ten decades of the company's history, each one relying heavily on Holley high-performance parts. One of the two existing Motorettes would be part of the touring show. With 100 years of accomplishments behind it, Holley, despite some bumps in the road, looked forward to many more years of success.

Overview



Love lasts forever in this value-priced paranormal romance collection featuring eight couples who discover that eternal happiness is the key to conquering evil.The Demigod’s Legacy: Demigod cougar shifter Tito Perez couldn’t protect his family in pre-colonial Tenochtitlan, so he won’t risk endangering another in modern New Mexico. But when December Farmer shows up to collect child support for a daughter he never knew about, danger of all sorts finds them. This immortal shapeshifter may have no choice but to cast aside his precious humanity and become the unflinching warrior he’s never wanted to be. Immortal Flame: After a horrific accident, Peter Blackstone arrives in Allison La Croix’s ER and heals himself before her eyes. Peter traded his soul to save his wife, and now he will hunt criminals forever. Can Allison find a way to unlock his forgotten, passionate spirit? Of Eternal Life: Dr. Abilene Miller is shocked when a dead man jerks back to life in her arms and infuriated when he kidnaps her. He thinks she’s part of a conspiracy; she thinks he’s insane. Only together can they find out the truth—and brave the risks they run in loving each other. The Nymph’s Labyrinth: Shapeshifting nymph Ariadne Papadakis must keep the truth of the nymphs’ existence far out of reach from American archeologist Beau Morris. But will the task force her to sacrifice her own happiness? Secrets of the Sky: Sparrow Reed might look like an angel, but she’s actually a witch who can change into a songbird. When her best friend’s problems drop Sparrow in an underworld fraught with threats, Rowen Aerion of the Knights of the Fog has his hands full trying to keep her alive—and his love may be her biggest danger of all. Embrace the Desire: Destroyer Payne can’t believe his good luck when his father, the lord of the underworld, orders him to take the lovely Chanta Timbers through her transition from human to half-goddess. Chanta is both drawn to and frightened by the beast that lurks under his skin. But only by defying the gods to pursue this attraction do they stand a chance in the coming war. Immortal Love: Bécquer is handsome, well-read, poetic, and … an immortal literary agent who exists on human blood. Not that it matters since his relationships are strictly business—until he crosses paths with Carla, who rewrites his script. The Gettysburg Vampire: College student Abby Potter takes advantage of ghosts’ popularity in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, by inventing a vampire folktale for the annual holiday production. Problem is, her leading man—a history professor at the college and a renowned Civil War reenactor—is a little too convincing in the role. Sensuality Level: Sensual
