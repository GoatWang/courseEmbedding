NRRI’s Victor Krause does strength testing for many Minnesota wood products companies.
NRRI is helping Northern Sheer Veneer launch a new product: the wood hotel key card.
NRRI’s Pat Donahue and Hill Wood Products’ Randy Rosandich discuss flooring veneers.


NRRI helps wood products companies through the recession
 Northern Sheer Veneer
Tim Doyle couldnt have picked a worse time to start a new business venture with a unique new product  October, 2007. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the U.S. recession officially started just two months later. 
So 2008 was an R & D year, but when we were ready with products in 2009 nobody wanted to buy anything or try anything new, Doyle said. Luckily our investors continued to believe in us and invest and we stayed alive with a skeleton crew.        
But as Northern Sheer Veneer in Spooner, Wisc., heads into 2010, everythings taking off againnew orders every day and one especially promising European customer with a new product that NRRI is helping to develop.  NRRI is the Natural Resources Research Institute, a part of the University of Minnesota Duluth.
The key to this has been Pat [Donahue], said Doyle. He put us with suppliers, sourced adhesives and carrier paper for the veneer, and found us the connections with logs. Without the assistance of NRRI, we would not be where were at today.        
Donahue is director of NRRIs Market Oriented Wood Technology group. He calls Sheer Veneers unique ability to produce paper thin, real wood veneers the last gold nugget in the wood products industry.        
NRRI scientist Matt Aro is kept busy testing adhesives, pressing temperature, and other manufacturing variables for the company to produce a sustainable, green key card for a Swedish company that is selling them to upscale European hotels. The idea was very popular at the recent Copenhagen Climate Change Convention, Doyle said.  


This is what NRRI does. It supports industry in many behind-the-scenes ways, in good times and bad, to improve their product and productivity… and keep people working. 


We have an order to make 13.5 million key cards, and we dont even have a press yet, said Doyle. Hes relying on NRRIs press to fill the order while Donahue helps them find one to purchase.        
Northern Contours
This is what NRRI does. It supports industry in many behind-the-scenes ways, in good times and bad, to improve their product and productivity and keep people working.
        With the regional wood products industry down by 20-30 percent in 2009, simply holding steady through the recession is something many of NRRIs clientslike Northern Contoursare proud of. 
The Minnesota-based company launched successfully in 1992 making kitchen cabinets with the help of NRRI research on a new membrane press technology. As they grew (today employing 450-500 people in five plants) they continued to use NRRIs expertise to help expand their product line and maintain manufacturing efficiencies.        
Through the recession we maintained and increased our customer base and created a number of new products that have expanded our footprint in the market, said National Sales Manager Lary Skow. We also focused on some specific markets that are generating new sales and new customers.        
Like the new flat-pack cabinet. Northern Contours developed cabinet components in custom sizes that can be assembled by the purchaser, and faced to match their existing cabinets. In addition to regular product testing, NRRI did the full battery of performance testing required by the Kitchen Cabinet Manufacturing Association.  
We work hand-in-glove with NRRI and thats just really great for us, said Skow. It saves us from having to think about it every time we need testing done. We just go right to NRRI. They know us and know our products and we trust them.        
Over the years, NRRI technician Victor Krause has done countless tests for Northern Contours:  scratch and mar, impact testing, ultra-violet light and chemical resistance testing.  And this winter he developed a device to determine the critical temperature and press time to bond finicky high gloss laminates to the cabinet doors. 
If we can shave some time off on the press cycle, they can press more cabinet doors a day and make more money each day, explained Krause.        
During the recession Northern Contours experienced some loss in sales with some large accounts and trimmed their workforce a bit, but also used the slowdown to focus on new projects that were in the pipeline. 
Its early yet, but were very optimistic for 2010, said Skow. Even with a reduction in sales, we have enough diversification and our selling price is such that we remain a very profitable company.        
Hill Wood Products
Hill Wood Products in Cook, Minn., a third generation wood products company, credits their engineered flooring product with carrying them through the recession. And according to sales manager Randy Rosandich the key to the success of the flooring product was NRRIs expertise and technology for the baseline work on the floors.        
NRRI lab technician Scott Johnson made the prototypes and did product testing. He helped Hill Wood understand the technicalities of adhesive performance, dimensional stability and the effects of moisture on the product. 
We didnt have the technology here to make the floor boards, so we made them at NRRI and learned from their expertise to help us have a product ready for market, Rosandich said. When we were ready to make the jump into flooring, we were really ready.        
Epicurean Cutting Surfaces
Duluth-based Epicurean Cutting Surfaces started in 2003 when business owner Tony Ciardelli looked for new uses for waste material from manufacturing skate board ramps. The new cutting board product took off. Through the recession, they focused on developing new products using NRRIs testing facilities. Ciardelli says consumers are attracted to their green products and appreciate that they are made completely in the USA. He anticipates 2010 to be promising.  
NRRIs lean manufacturing training has really helped us with manufacturing efficiency as a first thought, not an afterthought, said Ciardelli. Were committed to being made in the USA and that means we have to be as efficient as possible to compete with China. With our new products, NRRI helps us figure out the best way to move from raw materials coming in to products going out the door.        
Loll Designs
Their sister company, Loll Designs, actually grew over 50 percent in production during the recession. The company makes durable outdoor furniture with recycled plastics. Company president Greg Benson relied on Brian Brashaw, director of NRRIs Wood Materials and Manufacturing group, to help them set up an efficient manufacturing flow and used NRRI for product performance testing which led to improved designs.  
We started growing really fast, and were running our machines 24/7, said Benson. Our commercial sales took off and we got some really big orders. It was great to be able to pick up the phone and call Brian to figure out how to handle it and get the products out the door.        
For all four companies, diversified and new products that they developed with the help of NRRI was key to getting through the recession and keeping people employed. 
The development of these products not only increased our revenues but also allowed us to retain jobs and to add some new jobs as well, added Hill Woods Rosandich.

About Randy Scherkenbach



Randy Scherkenbach

I'm a part time photographer based in Wisconsin. I enjoy all types of photography, especially long exposures, landscapes and architectural shots. 

I also enjoy the social side of the photography hobby.  I love to organize and participate in photowalks and to pass on to others what I know about photography, and also learn from them as well.

When I'm not out chasing sunsets, doing photowalks or shooting pictures of just about anything, I work in Information Technology.

Here are links to where you can find me elsewhere on the internet.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
