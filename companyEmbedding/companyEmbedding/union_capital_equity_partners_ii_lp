      Union Capital Associates (together with its affiliates, “Union 
      Capital”), a lower middle-market private equity firm, announced today 
      the closing of its most recent pool of capital - Union Capital Equity 
      Partners II, L.P. (the “Fund” or “Fund II”). The oversubscribed Fund 
      closed at its hard cap of $200 million.
    
      The Fund will invest in smaller U.S. founder-owned businesses, where 
      Union Capital is typically the first institutional investor. Union 
      Capital has a 50 year history of successfully partnering with business 
      owners, entrepreneurs and management teams. Union Capital’s investment 
      team has spent 12 years working together on private investments, and is 
      supported by several of its former CEOs that provide general operations 
      expertise to assist portfolio company management teams as well as 
      provide deep industry knowledge in the areas of Union Capital’s focuses: 
      food processing, specialty manufacturing, business process outsourcing, 
      marketing services and franchised restaurants.
    




      “We are pleased to announce the final and very successful closing of 
      Fund II. We appreciate the trust that our investors have shown us,” said 
      Bill Ogden, Managing Partner. Reis Alfond, Managing Partner added, “This 
      rewarding fundraising underscores our investors’ enthusiasm for our 
      investment approach, our disciplined focus on the lower middle market 
      and the strength of our team. We look forward to investing Fund II on 
      behalf of our investors.”
    
      The Fund received strong support from a globally diverse group of 
      investors including endowments, foundations, pension funds, financial 
      institutions and family offices.
    
      Alicia Cooney, Managing Director at Monument Group added, “Monument 
      Group was privileged to work with Union Capital on this very successful 
      fundraise. The diversified investor interest is a testament to the Union 
      Capital team’s breadth of experience and their strong track record, 
      achieved over more than a decade of working together.”
    
      Proskauer Rose LLP served as legal counsel on the Fund II capital raise.

 Union Capital Equity Partners Closes on $200 Million 
 Union Capital Associates (together with its affiliates, “Union Capital”), a lower middle-market private equity firm, announced today the closing of its most recent pool of capital - Union Capital Equity Partners II, L.P. (the “Fund” or “Fund II”). The oversubscribed Fund closed at its hard cap of $200 million. 






 The Fund will invest in smaller U.S. founder-owned businesses, where Union Capital is typically the first institutional investor. Union Capital has a 50 year history of successfully partnering with business owners, entrepreneurs and management teams. Union Capital’s investment team has spent 12 years working together on private investments, and is supported by several of its former CEOs that provide general operations expertise to assist portfolio company management teams as well as provide deep industry knowledge in the areas of Union Capital’s focuses: food processing, specialty manufacturing, business process outsourcing, marketing services and franchised restaurants. 
 “We are pleased to announce the final and very successful closing of Fund II. We appreciate the trust that our investors have shown us,” said Bill Ogden, Managing Partner. Reis Alfond, Managing Partner added, “This rewarding fundraising underscores our investors’ enthusiasm for our investment approach, our disciplined focus on the lower middle market and the strength of our team. We look forward to investing Fund II on behalf of our investors.” 
 The Fund received strong support from a globally diverse group of investors including endowments, foundations, pension funds, financial institutions and family offices. 
 Alicia Cooney, Managing Director at Monument Group added, “Monument Group was privileged to work with Union Capital on this very successful fundraise. The diversified investor interest is a testament to the Union Capital team’s breadth of experience and their strong track record, achieved over more than a decade of working together.” 
 Proskauer Rose LLP served as legal counsel on the Fund II capital raise.

Union Capital is the successor to Union Capital Corporation founded by Jim Marlas, and has a nearly 50 year reputation with lenders, co-investors and business owners for operating with the highest integrity. Today, Union Capital is managed by its three managing partners – Reis Alfond, Bill Ogden and Jay Landauer and has offices in Connecticut and Chicago.
