	Notes to the Financial Statements



	 







	1.




	NATURE OF OPERATIONS






	 



	Jin Wan Hong International Holding Ltd., formerly Karnet Capital
	Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 31, 2014. On January 14, 2016, Shu Feng Lu
	(President and Director of the Company), Hong Xia Li, and Chen Yang took control of the Company by purchasing shares of common
	stock from existing shareholders.


	 


	The Company plans to operate in cultural related business in the
	future. The Company’s currently operates in Room 1101, Block E, Guang Hua Yuan, 2031 Bin He Nan Road, FuTian District, Shenzhen,
	Guangdong, China.



	 








	2.




	GOING CONCERN






	 



	The Company has generated limited revenues and incurred a loss since
	Inception (January 31, 2014) resulting in an accumulated deficit of $53,219 as of November 30, 2016, and further losses are anticipated
	in the development of its business. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a
	going concern.


	 


	The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the
	Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or, obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay
	its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over
	the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, loans from directors and, or, the private placement of common stock.


	 


	Because of the Company’s history of losses, its independent
	auditors, in the reports on the financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2016, expressed substantial doubt about the Company’s
	ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying unaudited financial statements for the period ended November 30, 2016
	have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate
	continuation of the Company as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability
	and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that could result from the outcome
	of this uncertainty.


	 


	Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the
	near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses The Company intends to position itself so that it may
	be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management’s efforts, there are no assurances
	that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.

	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	 




	Basis of Presentation



	 


	The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared
	in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, and pursuant to the rules and regulations
	of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments,
	which management believes are necessary to fairly present the financial position, results of operations, stockholders’ equity
	and cash flows of the Company for the period ended November 30, 2016.


	 






	 



	7



	 







	 




	 



	Accounting Basis



	 


	The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP” accounting). The Company has adopted a May 31
	fiscal year end.


	 



	Use of Estimates



	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
	accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
	and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount
	of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 



	Cash and Cash Equivalents



	 


	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with the original
	maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents as of November 30, 2016.


	 



	Fair Value of Financial Instruments



	 


	The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash
	equivalents, and amounts due to a shareholder, who is director and president of the Company. The carrying amount of these financial
	instruments approximates fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates
	unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements.


	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method.
	Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between
	the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws.
	A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to
	be realized.


	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	The Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting
	Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned.
	The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence
	of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales
	price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.


	 



	Stock-Based Compensation



	 


	We account for equity-based transactions with nonemployees under
	the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50,

	Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees

	(“ASC 505-50”). ASC 505-50 establishes
	that equity-based payment transactions with nonemployees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the
	fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The fair value of common stock issued for payments
	to nonemployees is measured at the market price on the date of grant. The fair value of equity instruments, other than common stock,
	is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. In general, we recognize the fair value of the equity instruments
	issued as deferred stock compensation and amortize the cost over the term of the contract.


	 


	We account for employee stock-based compensation in accordance with
	the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 718,

	Compensation—Stock Compensation,

	which requires all share-based payments to employees,
	including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values.


	 


	The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation
	expense and credited to additional paid-in capital over the period during which services are rendered.

	Basic Income (Loss) Per Share



	 


	Basic income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s
	net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. Diluted earnings
	per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s net income available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average
	number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number
	of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. There are no such common stock equivalents outstanding as of April
	8, 2017.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update “ASU”
	2014-15 on “Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) –Disclosure of Uncertainties about
	an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern” (“Update”). Currently, there is no guidance in U.S.
	GAAP about management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to
	continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this Update provide that guidance. In
	doing so, the amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require
	management to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles
	that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term

	substantial
	doubt,

	(2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the
	mitigating effect of management’s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result
	of consideration of management’s plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is
	not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued
	(or available to be issued). The amendments in this Update are effective for public and nonpublic entities for annual periods ending
	after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted.


	 


	The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that
	are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and
	the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material
	impact on its financial position or results of operations.

	LOAN FROM SHAREHOLDERS






	 



	As of November 30, 2016, the Company owed its President, Director,
	and major shareholder, Shu Feng Lu $11,364. The total loan of $11,364 was unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand.

	Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
	Results of Operations



	 


	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our
	financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains
	forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs.  Our actual results could differ materially from
	those discussed in the forward-looking statements.   Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars
	and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.


	 




	General




	 


	On January 14, 2016, Shu Feng Lu, Hong Xia Li, and Chen Yang took
	control of the Company by purchasing shares of common stock from existing shareholders. After the transaction our management is
	currently working on a new business plan and winding up the current business plan. The Company plans on operating in cultural related
	business in the future.


	 




	Results of Operations




	 


	We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements
	have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating
	to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to
	continue in operation.


	 


	We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term
	operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.

	Three Month and Six Month Period Ended November 30, 2016 Compared
	To Three Month and Six Month Period Ended November 30, 2015.



	 




	Revenue




	 


	We recognized revenue of $0 for the three month period ended November
	30, 2016, and for the three month period ended November 30, 2015. We recognized revenue of $0 for the six month period ended November
	30, 2016, and for the six month period ended November 30, 2015.


	 




	Operating expenses




	 


	We incurred operating expenses of $8,819 for the three month period
	ended November 30, 2016 compared to $2,364 for the three month period ended November 30, 2015, due to an increase in legal expenses.
	We incurred operating expenses of $14,519 for the six month period ended November 30, 2016 compared to $21,973 for the six month
	period ended November 30, 2015.


	 




	Net Losses




	 


	Our net loss for the three month period ended November 30, 2016
	was $8,819 compared to a net loss of $2,364 as of the three month period ended November 30, 2015, due to an increase in legal expenses.
	  Our net loss for the six month period ended November 30, 2016 was $14,519, compared to a net loss of $21,973 for the
	six month period ended November 30, 2015.


	 




	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	 


	As of November 30, 2016, our total assets were $0. Our total liabilities
	were $14,519, comprised of a loan of $11,364 from Shu Feng Lu, who is the Company’s President and Director, and payable to
	transfer agent of $3,155. As of May 31, 2016, our total assets were $0 and our total liabilities were $0.


	 


	Shareholders’ equity was ($14,519) as of November 30, 2016.
	As of May 31, 2016, shareholder’s equity was $0.


	 


	The Company has accumulated a deficit of ($53,219) as of November
	30, 2016, and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about
	the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.


	 


	The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the
	Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or, obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay
	its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over
	the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, sales, loans from directors and, or, the private placement of common stock.


	 


	Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the
	near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses The Company intends to position itself so that it may
	be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management’s efforts, there are no assurances
	that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.


	 




	Cash Flow from Operating Activities




	 


	We have not generated positive cash flow from operating activities.
	For the six month period ended November 30, 2016, net cash flow used in operating activities was ($11,364) compared to ($21,973)
	for the six month period ended November 30, 2015, due to lack of business transactions.






	 



	12



	 







	 




	 




	Cash Flow from Investing Activities




	 


	We neither used, nor generated cash from investing activities for
	the six month period and three month period ended November 30, 2016 and November 30, 2015.


	 




	Cash Flow from Financing Activities




	 


	For the six month period ended November 30, 2016, net cash provided
	by financing activities was $11,364. The loans are from a shareholder of the Company, Shu Feng Lu, who is also the President and
	Director of the Company. The loans are unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand. For the six month period ended November
	30, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $21,000.


	 




	Plan of Operation and Funding




	 


	We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be
	funded through a combination of our existing funds, sales, loans from a director and further issuances of securities. Our working
	capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business


	 


	We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements.
	Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity, and debt instruments. In
	connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating
	to:


	 



	·


	Legal and professional fees




	·


	Website development




	·


	Purchase of inventory




	·


	Marketing Campaign



	 


	We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities,
	and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating
	requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders.
	Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not
	be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we
	may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially
	restrict our business operations.


	 




	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements




	 


	As of the date of this Report, we do not have any off balance sheet
	arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
	condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material
	to investors.


	 




	Significant Accounting Policies




	 



	Basis of Presentation



	 


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance
	with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
	Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments,
	which management believes are necessary to fairly present the financial position, results of operations, stockholders’ equity
	 and cash flows of the Company for three month period ended November 30, 2016.


	 






	 



	13



	 







	 




	 



	Accounting Basis



	 


	The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP” accounting).  The Company has adopted
	a May 31 fiscal year end.


	 



	Cash and Cash Equivalents



	 


	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with the original
	maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company had $0 cash as of November 30, 2016.


	 



	Fair Value of Financial Instruments



	 


	The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash
	equivalents and amounts due to shareholder. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value due either
	to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial
	statements.


	 



	Inventories



	 


	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is principally
	determined using the first-in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company had $0 in inventory as of November 30, 2016.


	 



	Depreciation, Amortization, and Capitalization



	 


	The Company records depreciation and amortization when appropriate
	using both straight-line and declining balance methods over the estimated useful life of the assets (five to seven years). Expenditures
	for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Additions, major renewals and replacements that increase the property's
	useful life are capitalized. Property sold or retired, together with the related accumulated depreciation is removed from the appropriated
	accounts and the resultant gain or loss is included in net income.


	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method.
	 Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences
	between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates
	and laws.  A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are
	not expected to be realized.


	 



	Use of Estimates



	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
	accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
	and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount
	of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	The Company recognizes revenue when products are fully delivered
	or services have been provided and collection is reasonably assured.


	 



	Stock-Based Compensation



	 


	Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance
	with ASC Topic 718.  To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options.

	Basic Income (Loss) Per Share



	 


	Basic income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s
	net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. Diluted earnings
	per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s net income available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average
	number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number
	of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. There are no such common stock equivalents outstanding as of November
	30, 2016.


	 



	Comprehensive Income



	 


	The Company has standards for reporting and display of comprehensive
	income, its components and accumulated balances.  When applicable, the Company would disclose this information on its Statement
	of Stockholders’ Equity.  Comprehensive income comprises equity except those resulting from investments by owners and
	distributions to owners. The Company has not had any significant transactions that are required to be reported in other comprehensive
	income.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	The Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting
	pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flow.



	 







	Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
	Risk



	 


	Not applicable to smaller reporting companies.



	 







	Item 4. Controls and Procedures



	 




	Disclosure Controls and Procedures




	 


	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
	internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company’s internal control over
	financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
	the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
	United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
	misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
	become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
	Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
	the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
	November 30, 2016 using the criteria established in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee
	of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO").


	 


	A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies,
	in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s
	annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness
	of internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2016, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies
	that constituted material weaknesses, as described below.


	 






	1.


	We do not have an Audit Committee – While not being
	legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management’s view that such a committee, including a financial expert
	member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company’s financial statement. Currently the Board of Directors
	acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management
	to provide the necessary oversight over management’s activities.




	 






	2.


	We did not maintain appropriate cash controls – As
	of November 30, 2016, the Company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process,
	including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions, and did not require dual signature on the Company’s
	bank accounts. Alternatively, the effects of poor cash controls were mitigated by the fact that the Company had limited transactions.




	 






	 



	15



	 







	 




	 






	3.


	We did not implement appropriate information technology
	controls – As at November 30, 2016, the Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however there
	is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company’s data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft,
	misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors.




	 


	Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies
	resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements may not be prevented
	or detected on a timely basis by the Company’s internal controls.


	 


	As a result of the material weaknesses described above, management
	has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2016 based
	on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by COSO.


	 




	System of Internal Control over Financial Reporting




	 


	Although our Company is unable to meet the standards under COSO
	because of the limited funds available to a company of our size and stage of development, we are committed to improving our financial
	organization. As funds become available, we will undertake to: (1) create a position to  segregate duties consistent with
	control objectives, (2) increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function (3)
	appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to the audit committee of our Company resulting
	in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal
	controls and procedures; and (4) prepare and implement sufficient written policies and checklists which will set forth procedures
	for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements.


	 


	We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our
	internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking
	further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.  However, because
	of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements
	due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected.
	 These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can
	occur because of simple error or mistake. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the
	likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
	potential future conditions.  Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks.

	(Unaudited)



	 








	1.




	NATURE OF OPERATIONS






	 



	JIN WAN HONG INTERNATIONAL HOLDING LTD., former Karnet Capital Corp.
	(the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 31, 2014. On January 14, 2016, Shu Feng Lu, Hong
	Xia Li, and Chen Yang took control of the Company by purchasing shares of common stock from existing shareholders.


	 


	Shu Feng Lu purchased 6,700,000 shares of common stock in exchange
	for $235,740 of personal funds, Hong Xia Li purchased 700,000 shares of common stock in exchange for $24,630 of personal funds,
	and Chen Yang purchased 700,000 shares of common stock in exchange for $24,630 of personal funds.


	 


	After the transaction, Shu Feng Lu is the beneficial owner of 82.72%
	of the voting securities of the Company, Hong Xia Li is the beneficial owner of 8.64% of the voting securities of the Company,
	and Chen Yang is beneficial owner of 8.64% of the voting securities of the Company.


	 


	The Company plans to operate in cultural related business in the
	future. The Company’s currently operates in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.


	 







	2.




	GOING CONCERN






	 



	The Company has generated limited revenues and incurred a loss since
	Inception (January 31, 2014) resulting in an accumulated deficit of $44,400 as of August 31, 2016, and further losses are anticipated
	in the development of its business. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a
	going concern.


	 


	The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the
	Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or, obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay
	its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over
	the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, loans from directors and, or, the private placement of common stock.


	 


	Because of the Company’s history of losses, its independent
	auditors, in the reports on the financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2016, expressed substantial doubt about the Company’s
	ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying audited financial statements for the three month period ended August 31,
	2016 have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate
	continuation of the Company as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability
	and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that could result from the outcome
	of this uncertainty.


	 


	Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the
	near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses The Company intends to position itself so that it may
	be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management’s efforts, there are no assurances
	that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.

	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFCANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	 




	Basis of Presentation



	 


	The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared
	in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, and pursuant to the rules and regulations
	of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments,
	which management believes are necessary to fairly present the financial position, results of operations, stockholders’ equity
	and cash flows of the Company for the twelve months period ended August 31, 2016


	 



	Accounting Basis



	 


	The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP” accounting). The Company has adopted a May 31
	fiscal year end.


	 



	Use of Estimates



	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
	accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
	and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount
	of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 



	Cash and Cash Equivalents



	 


	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with the original
	maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents as of August 31, 2016.


	 



	Fair Value of Financial Instruments



	 


	The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash
	equivalents, and amounts due to a shareholder. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value due either
	to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial
	statements.


	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method.
	Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between
	the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws.
	A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected to
	be realized.

	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFCANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)





	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	The Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting
	Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned.
	The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence
	of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales
	price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.


	 



	Stock-Based Compensation



	 


	We account for equity-based transactions with nonemployees under
	the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50,

	Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees

	(“ASC 505-50”). ASC 505-50 establishes
	that equity-based payment transactions with nonemployees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the
	fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The fair value of common stock issued for payments
	to nonemployees is measured at the market price on the date of grant. The fair value of equity instruments, other than common stock,
	is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. In general, we recognize the fair value of the equity instruments
	issued as deferred stock compensation and amortize the cost over the term of the contract.


	 


	We account for employee stock-based compensation in accordance with
	the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 718,

	Compensation—Stock Compensation,

	which requires all share-based payments to employees,
	including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values.


	 


	The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation
	expense and credited to additional paid-in capital over the period during which services are rendered.


	 



	Basic Income (Loss) Per Share



	 


	Basic income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s
	net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. Diluted earnings
	per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s net income available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average
	number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number
	of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. There are no such common stock equivalents outstanding as of January
	9, 2017.

	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update “ASU”
	2014-15 on “Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) –Disclosure of Uncertainties about
	an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern” (“Update”). Currently, there is no guidance in U.S.
	GAAP about management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to
	continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this Update provide that guidance. In
	doing so, the amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require
	management to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles
	that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term

	substantial
	doubt,

	(2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the
	mitigating effect of management’s plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result
	of consideration of management’s plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is
	not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued
	(or available to be issued). The amendments in this Update are effective for public and nonpublic entities for annual periods ending
	after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted.


	 


	The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that
	are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and
	the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material
	impact on its financial position or results of operations.

	Feng Lu $5,700. The total loan of $5,700 was unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand.

	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS


	 


	This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements. These

	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our

	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


	 


	We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements
	have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating
	to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to
	continue in operation.


	 


	We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term
	operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.


	 


	THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2016 COMPARED TO AUGUST 31,
	2015.


	 




	Revenue




	 


	We recognized revenue of $0 for the three month period ended August
	31, 2016, and for the three month period ended August 31, 2015.


	 




	Operating expenses




	 


	We incurred operating expenses of $5,700 for the three month period
	ended August 31, 2016 compared to $19,609 for the three month period ended August 31, 2015, due to lack of actual business transactions.


	 




	Net Losses




	 


	Our net loss for the three month period ended August 31, 2016 was
	$5,700 compared to a net loss of $19,609 as of the three month period ended August 31, 2015 due to the decrease in expenses.    


	 




	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	 


	As of August 31, 2016, our total assets were $0. Our total liabilities
	were $5,700, comprised of a loan from shareholders.. As of August 31, 2015, our total assets were $5,466. Our total liabilities
	were $11,500.


	 


	Shareholders’ equity was $5,700 as of August 31, 2016.


	 


	The Company has accumulated a deficit of ($44,400) as of August
	31, 2016, and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about
	the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  


	 


	The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the
	Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or, obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay
	its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over
	the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, sales, loans from directors and, or, the private placement of common stock.
	 


	 


	Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the
	near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses The Company intends to position itself so that it may
	be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management’s efforts, there are no assurances
	that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.


	 




	Cash Flows from Operating Activities




	 


	We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities.
	For the three month period ended August 31, 2016, net cash flows used in operating activities was $5,700 compared to ($19,609)
	for August 31, 2015, due to lack of actual business transactions.


	 





	13

	 





	 




	 




	Cash Flows from Investing Activities




	 


	We neither used nor generated cash from investing activities for
	the three month period ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015.


	 




	Cash Flows from Financing Activities




	 


	For the three month period ended August 31, 2016, net cash provided
	by financing activities was $5,700. For the three month period ended August 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities
	was $21,000.

	We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be
	funded through a combination of our existing funds, sales, loans from a director and further issuances of securities. Our working
	capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business


	 


	We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements.
	Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity, debt instruments, and limited
	sales. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures
	relating to:


	 







	·




	Legal
	and professional fees










	·




	Website
	development










	·




	Purchase
	of inventory










	·




	Marketing
	Campaign





	 


	We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities,
	debt issuances and sales. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term
	operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders.
	Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not
	be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we
	may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially
	restrict our business operations.


	 


	OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS


	 


	As of the date of this Report, we do not have any off balance sheet
	arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
	condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material
	to investors.


	 


	SIGNIFCANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


	 



	Basis of Presentation



	 


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance
	with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
	Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments,
	which management believes are necessary to fairly present the financial position, results of operations, stockholders’ equity
	 and cash flows of the Company for three month period ended August 31, 2016.


	 





	14

	 





	 




	 



	Accounting Basis



	 


	The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP” accounting).  The Company has adopted
	a May 31 fiscal year end.


	 



	Cash and Cash Equivalents



	 


	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with the original
	maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company had $0 cash as of three months period ended August 31, 2016.


	 



	Fair Value of Financial Instruments



	 


	The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash
	equivalents and amounts due to shareholder. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value due either
	to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial
	statements.


	 



	Inventories



	 


	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is principally
	determined using the first-in, first out (FIFO) method. The Company had $0 in inventory as of August 31, 2016.


	 



	Depreciation, Amortization, and Capitalization



	 


	The Company records depreciation and amortization when appropriate
	using both straight-line and declining balance methods over the estimated useful life of the assets (five to seven years). Expenditures
	for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Additions, major renewals and replacements that increase the property's
	useful life are capitalized. Property sold or retired, together with the related accumulated depreciation is removed from the appropriated
	accounts and the resultant gain or loss is included in net income.


	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method.
	 Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences
	between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates
	and laws.  A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are
	not expected to be realized.


	 



	Use of Estimates



	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
	accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
	and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount
	of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	The Company recognizes revenue when products are fully delivered
	or services have been provided and collection is reasonably assured.


	 



	Stock-Based Compensation



	 


	Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance
	with ASC Topic 718.  To date, the Company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options.


	 





	15

	 





	 




	 



	Basic Income (Loss) Per Share



	 


	Basic income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s
	net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the period. Diluted earnings
	per share is calculated by dividing the Company’s net income available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average
	number of shares outstanding during the year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number
	of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. There are no such common stock equivalents outstanding as of August
	31, 2016.


	 



	Comprehensive Income



	 


	The Company has standards for reporting and display of comprehensive
	income, its components and accumulated balances.  When applicable, the Company would disclose this information on its Statement
	of Stockholders’ Equity.  Comprehensive income comprises equity except those resulting from investments by owners and
	distributions to owners. The Company has not had any significant transactions that are required to be reported in other comprehensive
	income.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	The Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting
	pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flow.

	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
	Risk





	 


	Not applicable to smaller reporting companies.



	 











	Item 4.




	Controls and Procedures





	 




	Disclosure Controls and Procedures




	 


	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
	internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company’s internal control over
	financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
	the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
	United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
	misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
	become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
	Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
	the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
	August 31, 2016 using the criteria established in “Internal Control - Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee
	of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). 


	 


	A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies,
	in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s
	annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness
	of internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2016, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies
	that constituted material weaknesses, as described below.


	 






	1.


	We do not have an Audit Committee – While not being
	legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management’s view that such a committee, including a financial expert
	member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company’s financial statement. Currently the Board of Directors
	acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management
	to provide the necessary oversight over management’s activities.




	 





	16

	 





	 




	 






	2.


	We did not maintain appropriate cash controls – As
	of August 31, 2016, the Company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process,
	including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions, and did not require dual signature on the Company’s
	bank accounts. Alternatively, the effects of poor cash controls were mitigated by the fact that the Company had limited transactions
	in their bank accounts.




	 






	3.


	We did not implement appropriate information technology
	controls – As at August 31, 2016, the Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however there
	is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company’s data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft,
	misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors.




	 


	Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies
	resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
	or detected on a timely basis by the company’s internal controls.


	 


	As a result of the material weaknesses described above, management
	has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2016 based
	on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by COSO.


	  




	System of Internal Control over Financial Reporting




	 


	Although our Company is unable to meet the standards under COSO
	because of the limited funds available to a company of our size and stage of development, we are committed to improving our financial
	organization. As funds become available, we will undertake to: (1) create a position to  segregate duties consistent with
	control objectives, (2) increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function (3)
	appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to the audit committee of our Company resulting
	in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal
	controls and procedures; and (4) prepare and implement sufficient written policies and checklists which will set forth procedures
	for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements.


	 


	We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our
	internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking
	further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.  However, because
	of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements
	due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected.
	 These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can
	occur because of simple error or mistake. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the
	likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
	potential future conditions.  Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks.
