History[edit]
Founding[edit]
In 1996, physicist and investment manager David Harding left Man AHL (formerly Adam, Harding and Lueck), a systematic managed futures fund and created Winton.[4][5] Using Harding's middle name,[6] the firm began trading in October 1997 with the company's flagship fund, Winton Futures Fund.[7] When conceptualizing the firm, Harding drew inspiration from Renaissance Technologies, a Long Island, New York hedge fund management company. Winton employs statisticians, engineers and physicists, to pursue investment strategies based on scientific research and analysis.[8]
According to Harding, Winton had difficulty attracting clients as a commodity trading advisor (CTA), because investors preferred hedge fund strategies that focused on the equity market rather than futures contracts.[6] However, using fees that were lower than industry standards, the firm was able to secure investors.[6][9]
Early years[edit]
In October 1997, Winton's first futures fund was launched with approximately $1.6 million in assets. The fund lost nearly 13% of its value in the first month but ended the year up 3.49%. In the following three years Winton returned gains of: 52.18% in 1998, 15.07% in 1999 and 10.44% in 2000. By November 1999, the firm had raised $100 million in capital from investors.[4] That same year, Winton sought investors in the Japanese markets.[10] The positive returns continued until late 2001, when there was a four-month period of drawdowns following the September 11 attacks.[4]
From the company's inception through the mid-2000s, its annual rate of return was approximately 19%.[11] The number of employees and the firm's assets under advisement grew significantly in 2004, reaching $1 billion.[4]
Expansion[edit]
In September 2005, the firm launched the Winton Evolution Fund, which was designed as a mixed arbitrage and multi-strategy fund investing in a variety of financial instruments and securities.[4] The launch of this fund was part of the firm's transition, away from the futures market, and towards a more diversified strategy.[4][8] In July 2007, Petershill Fund, a private equity fund set up by Goldman Sachs Asset Management International, acquired a 9.99% stake in Winton.[11][12] According to the firm, it believed the acquisition would further increase market confidence in its operations.[11]
By 2007, Winton was managing $10 billion in total assets,[12] and was ranked as the third largest CTA by the industry journal Absolute Return.[4] In 2007 it was a founder member of the Hedge Fund Standards Board which sets a voluntary code of standard of best practice endorsed by its members.[13] The following year, Winton was named Real Business's "most profitable" company of 2008, having achieved margins of 65%,[14] and was ranked the third largest private finance company in Britain by The Daily Telegraph.[15]
The firm continued to expand and "become more of a general investment firm".[8] In late 2008, the company opened a Hong Kong office, its first office outside of the UK.[10] During the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 the firm's Diversified Trading Program held up relatively well with a loss of -5.38% in 2009 after a 20.25% return the previous year.[16][17][18] The company launched the Winton Global Equity Fund in 2010 and it received UCITS approval in Europe. The fund was designed to be a long-only, portfolio using quantitative analysis.[19] The Winton Futures Fund returned an approximate annualised rate of 17% net from its inception in 1997 through 2010.[19]
Through the end of 2012, Winton had a positive return on its investments every year, except 2009 and 2012.[20][21] While Winton's individual funds are established in offshore locations, the investment advisor fees are repatriated to the United Kingdom where they are taxed.[21][22] In 2013, media coverage of the firm's founder reported that since 2006, Winton has paid nearly £521 million in British taxes, including £133 million in 2011.[23]
In September 2012, Winton became research consultants with Fortune SG Fund Management of Shanghai to help develop China's first managed futures fund.[24][25]
Organization[edit]
Operations[edit]
David Harding is the company's founder, executive chairman and chief executive officer of Winton Group.[2] Andrew Moss is the chief executive officer of Winton Investment Management[26] and Nicholas Saunders is the chief operating officer.[27] Approximately 70% of the firm's employees own shares or share options in the company.[11] Winton employs approximately 450 staff members.[1]
More than 100 of the firm's employees are academics doing mathematical research [11] and studying statistical relationships and trading patterns.[9] These highly trained specialists are organized into research teams, which peer review and test new strategies, gather data and identify trends.[7] While quant hedge funds broadly have struggled for several years just following the 2008 financial crisis, Winton remains a top recruit of quantitative minds.[28]
The majority of the firm's clients reside outside the UK and many are from the United States.[4][5]
Investment strategy[edit]
Since its inception, Winton has traded as a commodity trading advisor (CTA). It is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a CTA[6] and by the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK. Winton is also registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as an investment advisor.[29]
The firm refers to itself as a "modern investment management company" [30] and employs managed futures strategies using data analysis and modelling to follow trends in global futures markets such as commodities and bonds.[31] After establishing the Winton Evolution Fund and Winton Global Equity Strategy, the firm began offering multi-strategy and equity investment programs that invest in equity markets around the world.[4][32] [33]
Winton uses research and quantitative data analysis to identify favourable trends in the market[34][32] and its focus on research differentiates it from its industry companions.[4][34] The firm uses scientific research to collect data [32] and identify patterns and develop statistical tools, which are applied to its investments.[35] Winton relies on continuous research to ensure its trading models have the highest potential for positive returns.[36] Its trading models are informed by relationships identified through applied research of market data;[32] such as volatility estimations derived from a study of the 1988 corn bull market.[36] In recent years, Winton has further developed its statistical research, focusing on big data; according to the Financial Times, in 2013 its machines processed "the equivalent of 30m King James bibles' worth of information every day".[21] In April 2013, Winton was featured in the BBC2 program Horizon: The Age of Big Data for its use of scientific analysis of data, particularly for its capture and processing of large data sets including historical data for the markets that it trades in and newly produced data from thousands of companies.[37]
Winton's futures trading is highly automated and systematic and uses computer algorithms[6] to trade futures in financial assets including equities, currencies, bonds, commodities, livestock and energy [10] in over 100 futures markets worldwide.[4] Winton uses a mix of long-term and short-term trading as part of its strategy[4] and combines uncorrelated strategies to maximize their risk-return ratio.[4][32][31] According to the firm, it uses the same mathematical tools, for research, statistical data analysis, stock selection, and futures investments.[38] From around 2008, the Winton Futures Fund has increased its allocation to cash equities.[39][40]
Funds[edit]
Winton's Diversified Program, comprising its managed accounts and Winton Futures Fund, uses different models to trade in more than 100 futures markets.[20] Winton Futures Fund is Winton's flagship and its longest running fund; a managed futures fund[41] traded on the Irish Stock Exchange.[9] The fund is trend following, focusing on longer-term trends, and as of April 2011[update], has returned an annualised rate of almost 17%.[20] The second fund launched by Winton was its Winton Evolution Fund, which began trading in September 2005. It is a multi-strategy fund with no restrictions on its investment mandate.[6][42] The Winton Global Equity Fund, designed to employ Winton's mathematical analytical methods to invest in one class of asset, was given UCITS regulatory approval in Europe in 2010.[38][19]
Assets under advisement[edit]
When Winton launched in October 1997, it held $1.6 million in assets.[4] Over the next 3 years the assets held by the firm grew to over $150 million at the end of 2000.[43] By 2004, the firm's seventh year in operation, its assets under advisement reached $1 billion.[44] In the mid-to-late 2000s, the firm experienced large inflows of capital, leading to its assets under advisement increasing rapidly from $4.8 billion in mid-2006,[5][11][45] to $12.4 billion in 2009.[31][46] Between 2010 and 2012, Winton's total assets under advisement increased by almost $15 billion, from $13.7 billion in June 2010 to $28.5 billion in February 2012.[38] As at November 2016, Winton's assets under advisement totaled $32 billion.[1]

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
In 1996, physicist and investment manager David Harding left Man AHL (formerly Adam, Harding and Lueck), a systematic managed futures fund and created Winton.[4][5] Using Harding's middle name,[6] the firm began trading in October 1997 with the company's flagship fund, Winton Futures Fund.[7] When conceptualizing the firm, Harding drew inspiration from Renaissance Technologies, a Long Island, New York hedge fund management company. Winton employs statisticians, engineers and physicists, to pursue investment strategies based on scientific research and analysis.[8]
According to Harding, Winton had difficulty attracting clients as a commodity trading advisor (CTA), because investors preferred hedge fund strategies that focused on the equity market rather than futures contracts.[6] However, using fees that were lower than industry standards, the firm was able to secure investors.[6][9]
Early years[edit]
In October 1997, Winton's first futures fund was launched with approximately $1.6 million in assets. The fund lost nearly 13% of its value in the first month but ended the year up 3.49%. In the following three years Winton returned gains of: 52.18% in 1998, 15.07% in 1999 and 10.44% in 2000. By November 1999, the firm had raised $100 million in capital from investors.[4] That same year, Winton sought investors in the Japanese markets.[10] The positive returns continued until late 2001, when there was a four-month period of drawdowns following the September 11 attacks.[4]
From the company's inception through the mid-2000s, its annual rate of return was approximately 19%.[11] The number of employees and the firm's assets under advisement grew significantly in 2004, reaching $1 billion.[4]
Expansion[edit]
In September 2005, the firm launched the Winton Evolution Fund, which was designed as a mixed arbitrage and multi-strategy fund investing in a variety of financial instruments and securities.[4] The launch of this fund was part of the firm's transition, away from the futures market, and towards a more diversified strategy.[4][8] In July 2007, Petershill Fund, a private equity fund set up by Goldman Sachs Asset Management International, acquired a 9.99% stake in Winton.[11][12] According to the firm, it believed the acquisition would further increase market confidence in its operations.[11]
By 2007, Winton was managing $10 billion in total assets,[12] and was ranked as the third largest CTA by the industry journal Absolute Return.[4] In 2007 it was a founder member of the Hedge Fund Standards Board which sets a voluntary code of standard of best practice endorsed by its members.[13] The following year, Winton was named Real Business's "most profitable" company of 2008, having achieved margins of 65%,[14] and was ranked the third largest private finance company in Britain by The Daily Telegraph.[15]
The firm continued to expand and "become more of a general investment firm".[8] In late 2008, the company opened a Hong Kong office, its first office outside of the UK.[10] During the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 the firm's Diversified Trading Program held up relatively well with a loss of -5.38% in 2009 after a 20.25% return the previous year.[16][17][18] The company launched the Winton Global Equity Fund in 2010 and it received UCITS approval in Europe. The fund was designed to be a long-only, portfolio using quantitative analysis.[19] The Winton Futures Fund returned an approximate annualised rate of 17% net from its inception in 1997 through 2010.[19]
Through the end of 2012, Winton had a positive return on its investments every year, except 2009 and 2012.[20][21] While Winton's individual funds are established in offshore locations, the investment advisor fees are repatriated to the United Kingdom where they are taxed.[21][22] In 2013, media coverage of the firm's founder reported that since 2006, Winton has paid nearly £521 million in British taxes, including £133 million in 2011.[23]
In September 2012, Winton became research consultants with Fortune SG Fund Management of Shanghai to help develop China's first managed futures fund.[24][25]
Organization[edit]
Operations[edit]
David Harding is the company's founder, executive chairman and chief executive officer of Winton Group.[2] Andrew Moss is the chief executive officer of Winton Investment Management[26] and Nicholas Saunders is the chief operating officer.[27] Approximately 70% of the firm's employees own shares or share options in the company.[11] Winton employs approximately 450 staff members.[1]
More than 100 of the firm's employees are academics doing mathematical research [11] and studying statistical relationships and trading patterns.[9] These highly trained specialists are organized into research teams, which peer review and test new strategies, gather data and identify trends.[7] While quant hedge funds broadly have struggled for several years just following the 2008 financial crisis, Winton remains a top recruit of quantitative minds.[28]
The majority of the firm's clients reside outside the UK and many are from the United States.[4][5]
Investment strategy[edit]
Since its inception, Winton has traded as a commodity trading advisor (CTA). It is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a CTA[6] and by the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK. Winton is also registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as an investment advisor.[29]
The firm refers to itself as a "modern investment management company" [30] and employs managed futures strategies using data analysis and modelling to follow trends in global futures markets such as commodities and bonds.[31] After establishing the Winton Evolution Fund and Winton Global Equity Strategy, the firm began offering multi-strategy and equity investment programs that invest in equity markets around the world.[4][32] [33]
Winton uses research and quantitative data analysis to identify favourable trends in the market[34][32] and its focus on research differentiates it from its industry companions.[4][34] The firm uses scientific research to collect data [32] and identify patterns and develop statistical tools, which are applied to its investments.[35] Winton relies on continuous research to ensure its trading models have the highest potential for positive returns.[36] Its trading models are informed by relationships identified through applied research of market data;[32] such as volatility estimations derived from a study of the 1988 corn bull market.[36] In recent years, Winton has further developed its statistical research, focusing on big data; according to the Financial Times, in 2013 its machines processed "the equivalent of 30m King James bibles' worth of information every day".[21] In April 2013, Winton was featured in the BBC2 program Horizon: The Age of Big Data for its use of scientific analysis of data, particularly for its capture and processing of large data sets including historical data for the markets that it trades in and newly produced data from thousands of companies.[37]
Winton's futures trading is highly automated and systematic and uses computer algorithms[6] to trade futures in financial assets including equities, currencies, bonds, commodities, livestock and energy [10] in over 100 futures markets worldwide.[4] Winton uses a mix of long-term and short-term trading as part of its strategy[4] and combines uncorrelated strategies to maximize their risk-return ratio.[4][32][31] According to the firm, it uses the same mathematical tools, for research, statistical data analysis, stock selection, and futures investments.[38] From around 2008, the Winton Futures Fund has increased its allocation to cash equities.[39][40]
Funds[edit]
Winton's Diversified Program, comprising its managed accounts and Winton Futures Fund, uses different models to trade in more than 100 futures markets.[20] Winton Futures Fund is Winton's flagship and its longest running fund; a managed futures fund[41] traded on the Irish Stock Exchange.[9] The fund is trend following, focusing on longer-term trends, and as of April 2011[update], has returned an annualised rate of almost 17%.[20] The second fund launched by Winton was its Winton Evolution Fund, which began trading in September 2005. It is a multi-strategy fund with no restrictions on its investment mandate.[6][42] The Winton Global Equity Fund, designed to employ Winton's mathematical analytical methods to invest in one class of asset, was given UCITS regulatory approval in Europe in 2010.[38][19]
Assets under advisement[edit]
When Winton launched in October 1997, it held $1.6 million in assets.[4] Over the next 3 years the assets held by the firm grew to over $150 million at the end of 2000.[43] By 2004, the firm's seventh year in operation, its assets under advisement reached $1 billion.[44] In the mid-to-late 2000s, the firm experienced large inflows of capital, leading to its assets under advisement increasing rapidly from $4.8 billion in mid-2006,[5][11][45] to $12.4 billion in 2009.[31][46] Between 2010 and 2012, Winton's total assets under advisement increased by almost $15 billion, from $13.7 billion in June 2010 to $28.5 billion in February 2012.[38] As at November 2016, Winton's assets under advisement totaled $32 billion.[1]

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
In 1996, physicist and investment manager David Harding left Man AHL (formerly Adam, Harding and Lueck), a systematic managed futures fund and created Winton.[4][5] Using Harding's middle name,[6] the firm began trading in October 1997 with the company's flagship fund, Winton Futures Fund.[7] When conceptualizing the firm, Harding drew inspiration from Renaissance Technologies, a Long Island, New York hedge fund management company. Winton employs statisticians, engineers and physicists, to pursue investment strategies based on scientific research and analysis.[8]
According to Harding, Winton had difficulty attracting clients as a commodity trading advisor (CTA), because investors preferred hedge fund strategies that focused on the equity market rather than futures contracts.[6] However, using fees that were lower than industry standards, the firm was able to secure investors.[6][9]
Early years[edit]
In October 1997, Winton's first futures fund was launched with approximately $1.6 million in assets. The fund lost nearly 13% of its value in the first month but ended the year up 3.49%. In the following three years Winton returned gains of: 52.18% in 1998, 15.07% in 1999 and 10.44% in 2000. By November 1999, the firm had raised $100 million in capital from investors.[4] That same year, Winton sought investors in the Japanese markets.[10] The positive returns continued until late 2001, when there was a four-month period of drawdowns following the September 11 attacks.[4]
From the company's inception through the mid-2000s, its annual rate of return was approximately 19%.[11] The number of employees and the firm's assets under advisement grew significantly in 2004, reaching $1 billion.[4]
Expansion[edit]
In September 2005, the firm launched the Winton Evolution Fund, which was designed as a mixed arbitrage and multi-strategy fund investing in a variety of financial instruments and securities.[4] The launch of this fund was part of the firm's transition, away from the futures market, and towards a more diversified strategy.[4][8] In July 2007, Petershill Fund, a private equity fund set up by Goldman Sachs Asset Management International, acquired a 9.99% stake in Winton.[11][12] According to the firm, it believed the acquisition would further increase market confidence in its operations.[11]
By 2007, Winton was managing $10 billion in total assets,[12] and was ranked as the third largest CTA by the industry journal Absolute Return.[4] In 2007 it was a founder member of the Hedge Fund Standards Board which sets a voluntary code of standard of best practice endorsed by its members.[13] The following year, Winton was named Real Business's "most profitable" company of 2008, having achieved margins of 65%,[14] and was ranked the third largest private finance company in Britain by The Daily Telegraph.[15]
The firm continued to expand and "become more of a general investment firm".[8] In late 2008, the company opened a Hong Kong office, its first office outside of the UK.[10] During the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 the firm's Diversified Trading Program held up relatively well with a loss of -5.38% in 2009 after a 20.25% return the previous year.[16][17][18] The company launched the Winton Global Equity Fund in 2010 and it received UCITS approval in Europe. The fund was designed to be a long-only, portfolio using quantitative analysis.[19] The Winton Futures Fund returned an approximate annualised rate of 17% net from its inception in 1997 through 2010.[19]
Through the end of 2012, Winton had a positive return on its investments every year, except 2009 and 2012.[20][21] While Winton's individual funds are established in offshore locations, the investment advisor fees are repatriated to the United Kingdom where they are taxed.[21][22] In 2013, media coverage of the firm's founder reported that since 2006, Winton has paid nearly £521 million in British taxes, including £133 million in 2011.[23]
In September 2012, Winton became research consultants with Fortune SG Fund Management of Shanghai to help develop China's first managed futures fund.[24][25]
Organization[edit]
Operations[edit]
David Harding is the company's founder, executive chairman and chief executive officer of Winton Group.[2] Andrew Moss is the chief executive officer of Winton Investment Management[26] and Nicholas Saunders is the chief operating officer.[27] Approximately 70% of the firm's employees own shares or share options in the company.[11] Winton employs approximately 450 staff members.[1]
More than 100 of the firm's employees are academics doing mathematical research [11] and studying statistical relationships and trading patterns.[9] These highly trained specialists are organized into research teams, which peer review and test new strategies, gather data and identify trends.[7] While quant hedge funds broadly have struggled for several years just following the 2008 financial crisis, Winton remains a top recruit of quantitative minds.[28]
The majority of the firm's clients reside outside the UK and many are from the United States.[4][5]
Investment strategy[edit]
Since its inception, Winton has traded as a commodity trading advisor (CTA). It is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a CTA[6] and by the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK. Winton is also registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as an investment advisor.[29]
The firm refers to itself as a "modern investment management company" [30] and employs managed futures strategies using data analysis and modelling to follow trends in global futures markets such as commodities and bonds.[31] After establishing the Winton Evolution Fund and Winton Global Equity Strategy, the firm began offering multi-strategy and equity investment programs that invest in equity markets around the world.[4][32] [33]
Winton uses research and quantitative data analysis to identify favourable trends in the market[34][32] and its focus on research differentiates it from its industry companions.[4][34] The firm uses scientific research to collect data [32] and identify patterns and develop statistical tools, which are applied to its investments.[35] Winton relies on continuous research to ensure its trading models have the highest potential for positive returns.[36] Its trading models are informed by relationships identified through applied research of market data;[32] such as volatility estimations derived from a study of the 1988 corn bull market.[36] In recent years, Winton has further developed its statistical research, focusing on big data; according to the Financial Times, in 2013 its machines processed "the equivalent of 30m King James bibles' worth of information every day".[21] In April 2013, Winton was featured in the BBC2 program Horizon: The Age of Big Data for its use of scientific analysis of data, particularly for its capture and processing of large data sets including historical data for the markets that it trades in and newly produced data from thousands of companies.[37]
Winton's futures trading is highly automated and systematic and uses computer algorithms[6] to trade futures in financial assets including equities, currencies, bonds, commodities, livestock and energy [10] in over 100 futures markets worldwide.[4] Winton uses a mix of long-term and short-term trading as part of its strategy[4] and combines uncorrelated strategies to maximize their risk-return ratio.[4][32][31] According to the firm, it uses the same mathematical tools, for research, statistical data analysis, stock selection, and futures investments.[38] From around 2008, the Winton Futures Fund has increased its allocation to cash equities.[39][40]
Funds[edit]
Winton's Diversified Program, comprising its managed accounts and Winton Futures Fund, uses different models to trade in more than 100 futures markets.[20] Winton Futures Fund is Winton's flagship and its longest running fund; a managed futures fund[41] traded on the Irish Stock Exchange.[9] The fund is trend following, focusing on longer-term trends, and as of April 2011[update], has returned an annualised rate of almost 17%.[20] The second fund launched by Winton was its Winton Evolution Fund, which began trading in September 2005. It is a multi-strategy fund with no restrictions on its investment mandate.[6][42] The Winton Global Equity Fund, designed to employ Winton's mathematical analytical methods to invest in one class of asset, was given UCITS regulatory approval in Europe in 2010.[38][19]
Assets under advisement[edit]
When Winton launched in October 1997, it held $1.6 million in assets.[4] Over the next 3 years the assets held by the firm grew to over $150 million at the end of 2000.[43] By 2004, the firm's seventh year in operation, its assets under advisement reached $1 billion.[44] In the mid-to-late 2000s, the firm experienced large inflows of capital, leading to its assets under advisement increasing rapidly from $4.8 billion in mid-2006,[5][11][45] to $12.4 billion in 2009.[31][46] Between 2010 and 2012, Winton's total assets under advisement increased by almost $15 billion, from $13.7 billion in June 2010 to $28.5 billion in February 2012.[38] As at November 2016, Winton's assets under advisement totaled $32 billion.[1]

About Winton









 
Why Invest        Philosophy & Investment Systems        Team     
 













 








Why Invest 

Led by David Harding, who has  been at the forefront of systematic investment for over 25 years,* having  founded two of the world’s leading quantitative investment firms.
Employs over 100 Research and Data staff continually working on enhancements to Winton’s investment systems.  
Manages assets on behalf of some of the largest and  most sophisticated institutional investors, including pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and global financial institutions, as well as wholesale clients.
Over 400 employees, with offices in  London, Oxford, New York, San Francisco, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Tokyo and Zurich.



Investment Philosophy

Winton’s investment solutions are based on the belief that profitable investment opportunities can be identified through the application of advanced statistical and pattern recognition techniques to large datasets.
 Such systems employ forecasts or signals that are typically weak and barely distinguishable from noise. Consequently, Winton focuses much of its efforts on establishing the statistical significance of signals and devising appropriate risk and cost controls.
Winton believes more reliable investment decisions can be made using statistical inference from empirical evidence than deductive reasoning from economic axioms.

Investment Systems

 Winton's investment systems are the  product of nearly two decades of applying science, technology and statistical  research to investment management. The systems combine forecasts of returns, volatilities and correlations with estimates of transaction costs to arrive at  daily investment decisions.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
