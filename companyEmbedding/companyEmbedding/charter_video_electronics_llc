Charter Hires Andrew Ip as SVP, Technology & Innovation
Former MSG, Cablevision exec reports to EVP Blackley
7/06/2017  4:21 PM Eastern
 

By: MCN Staff 






Charter Communications said it has hired Andrew Ip as senior vice president, emerging technology & innovation. Charter said he will lead the charge for introducing, developing and commercializing new technology that will enable enhanced customer experiences and help the company expand into new marketplaces. He will report to Jim Blackley, executive VP, engineering & IT, and will be based out of Charter's regional offices in Denver.
"We are very pleased to welcome Andrew to the engineering team at Charter," Blackley said in a release. "Andrew brings a wealth of technical expertise and a unique vision that will enable Charter to further drive the adoption and roll-out of emerging technologies."
Ip most recently was senior VP and managing director at Madison Square Garden Ventures. Before that, he spent nearly five years at Cablevision where his positions included leading the teams responsible for the design and operation of the WiFi and HFC networks, as well as leading the Optimum Labs group. He also was a partner at Meridian Advisory Group, working with clients in the Cable, Wireless, and Media segments.

Some of these dealers may have Internet sites on which they are authorized by Klipsch to sell a select mix of our products. Klipsch dealers have been chosen for their ability to properly represent, sell and, in most cases, service Klipsch products. Klipsch provides a warranty on products sold only by our authorized dealers. Unfortunately, Klipsch products are sometimes sold by companies that are not authorized to do so. Goods sold by these unauthorized companies are not purchased from Klipsch; instead they are acquired from a host of other sources. Due to the nature of the goods sold by unauthorized dealers and their business practices, products sold by unauthorized dealers are not entitled to Klipsch warranty coverage. We are using our best efforts (including this warning) to prohibit these companies from taking advantage of consumers, but these practices still exist. We urge you to use diligence when selecting a dealer to make your purchase.Klipsch products sold by unauthorized dealers sometimes are purchased on a secondary "gray" market and can be pirated goods not produced by Klipsch, damaged, defective or so-called "B" stock goods, or stolen goods.Beware of counterfeit Klipsch products.Like many premium goods, Klipsch products are being duplicated and sold, usually at drastically reduced prices and diminished quality. These products do not meet Klipsch standards and are not covered under Klipsch warranty. If you would like to report a suspected counterfeit Klipsch product or have questions concerning this issue, please contact Customer Service at 1-800-KLIPSCH. We appreciate your help in maintaining the integrity of the Klipsch brand.Beware of serial number alterations.Many times, these products have serial numbers that have been changed or even removed all together by the unauthorized reseller. Any product represented to be built by Klipsch that does not have a serial number issued by Klipsch should be held suspect by the customer. Removal or alteration of the original Klipsch serial number will automatically void the warranty on that product. Unauthorized dealers either knowingly deceive the consumer by telling them the product is covered by the manufacturer's warranty, or they attempt to make repairs themselves. Repairs made by an unauthorized dealer may not meet Klipsch standards due to the use of inappropriate parts or repair by untrained personnel.  Some unauthorized resellers remove serial numbers and product registration cards or replace our mailing address with their own to avoid detection. For that reason, if your new Klipsch product has no serial number or an obviously altered serial number label, or if there are not matching serial numbers both on the product and on a bar code label on the Klipsch box it was received in, immediately contact whoever you purchased that product from for resolution.Also, if there is no registration card, or if the mailing address on the card is not either P.O. Box 688, Hope, AR 71802 or 3502 Woodview Trace, Suite 200, Indianapolis, IN 46268 or you are directed to not send in a registration card to Klipsch, you should immediately contact whoever you purchased that product from for resolution. The best resolution would be shipment back to that seller for a full refund. Many web sites change names and locations frequently so they cannot be reached to solve customer problems. Other sites simply go out of business.Make sure you purchase from an authorized Klipsch dealer.Visit our Dealer Locator, choose your country, enter your zip code (US only) and click "Search". Please call 1-800-KLIPSCH to speak with a customer service representative or contact us via our support portal should you have any questions.
