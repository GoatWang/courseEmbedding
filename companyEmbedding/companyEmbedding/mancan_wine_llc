Great California Blends
MANCAN sources great California grapes for a set of specially-designed blends: a light and refreshing white, a rich and satisfying red, and a bright and delicious fizz. We probably could have skimped with wine that tastes just OK. We didn’t. This wine is delicious and easy to drink. It’s your everyday wine.













Consistently great, consistently
We want to make sure you don’t have to worry about how your wine will taste. That’s why we blend our wine to match our specific taste profile – so we can ensure that it will have the same great taste can after can, year after year. You don’t spend time wondering how your favorite beer will taste each time you order it. Why do that with your favorite wine?







Why Cans?
Cans are easier to drink from and to take with you, and they eliminate the barriers of stemware and corkscrews. Cans are also 35x lighter than wine bottles which means they’re easier to ship, and they create fewer carbon emissions. Cans are also far easier to recycle than glass or plastic containers.













Does it affect the taste?
No way. All of our cans have a special lining on the interior, so the wine never touches aluminum, and the taste isn’t affected. Same great taste if you pour it into a tumbler glass or swig it straight from the can like we do.

Why wine is actually better in a can!
Why wine is better in a can! Although we prefer jokes over debating the merits of wine-in-a-can, it is important that you know: 1. Our wine is all handcrafted in Sonoma County. After long production days, we’re zonked and quite sore as each case is 21.6 lbs and we quality control each can to make sure […]

What’s with the name: MANCAN?
What’s with the name: MANCAN? by Graham: MANCAN was the name that popped into my head the night at the bar when I wished that there was an option to order a wine-in-a-can. I had been working on a construction site all day and was covered in drywall dust and met up with a buddy […]

Gracey - our dog
Gracey – Our Dog The dog on MANCAN is Gracey. Marika and I adopted her in 2011 from the Animal Protective League in Cleveland. People like to say they rescue dogs but Gracey rescues us all the time. Her personality makes us laugh and she makes friends with more people we can keep track of. […]

Member­ship Plan



            Your membership is no-risk, and you can cancel at any time. Every membership comes with a Kuvée dispenser: just send it back if you decide to cancel your plan. If you do not send the dispenser back, you will be charged $199 to your card. Pricing for monthly shipments is reflective of the wines that you receive.
          



            Your membership is no-risk, and you can change or cancel at any time.
          

            Shipment charges will vary based upon the individual wine pricing in each shipment. You have the ability to switch out the wines that are recommended for each shipment prior to the order being placed.
          

            Every plan includes a Kuvée wine dispenser which is yours to keep after 12 membership wine shipments. If you choose to cancel before the 12 shipments, simply send the Kuvée back at no charge (Kuvée will send you a pre-paid shipping label). If you do not send back the Kuvée dispenser within 30 days of cancellation, you’ll be charged $199.

If you choose to cancel before the 12 shipments, simply send the Kuvée back at no charge (Kuvée will send you a pre-paid shipping label). If you do not send back the Kuvée dispenser within 30 days of cancellation, you’ll be charged $120 less the amount you’ve already paid.
          




First Wine Package


          Choose between all red wine, all white wines, or a mixed pack for your first order. Your ongoing wine shipments will be personalized recommendations based on your ratings, favorites and wine profile.
        



Cus­to­mi­zed First Ship­ment


          Pricing on your first package may change as you customize the wines you receive. The wines you see here are not reflective of the full Kuvée portfolio that you will have access to ongoing.
        

          Ongoing, Kuvée will make recommendations for your wine shipments, or you can choose which wines you’d like to receive. Pricing for monthly shipments is reflective of the wines that you receive.

Wine Gift Baskets & Gift Sets
My best friend and her husband finally got the house of their dreams in Colorado, and I thought I'd surprise them with a housewarming gift. Their schedule for getting the keys to the new place was tricky, but I wanted to make sure that my gift arrived on the same day as their first night in their new home. I thought that proposing a toast across the miles would be a great touch, so I decided to send them a bottle of wine. Then I decided, why not make it a wine gift basket - a whole basket of delicious food and great wine that they can enjoy altogether? I needed to make sure my wine gift basket shipped at precisely the right time, and GiftTree.com's amazing wine gift basket delivery options made it so easy - I was able to have the perfect wine gift basket delivered right to their door on their first night in the new house. In case you were looking for great gifts without wine, check out our gift baskets.
Superior Wine and Food Pairings
From the connoisseur to the casual wine lover, GiftTree's selection of wine gift baskets has something for anyone who deserves a toast. Whether you choose a lively champagne, velvety red, crisp white wine or all three, the knowledgeable sommeliers at GiftTree have taken great care in choosing superior wines for our wine gift baskets. When expertly paired with the finest gourmet chocolates, cheeses, snacks, nuts and more, our impressive wine gift basket delivery promises to send your warmest wishes in the most elegant fashion.
