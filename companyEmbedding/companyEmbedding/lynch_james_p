About one fifth of the people diagnosed with Crohn’s disease have a blood relative – most often a brother or sister – who have some form of IBD. Crohn’s disease creates inflammation usually in the small intestine and colon, but can affect any part of the digestive tract. Crohn’s disease is sometimes referred to as “ileitis or enteritis” because it commonly affects the end of the small intestine, the terminal ileum. Inflammation from Crohn’s disease often causes diarrhea, abdominal pain and weight loss.Smoking CessationColon Rectal Specialists has been leaders in the area in regards to implementing an enhanced recovery program for their patients. Historically, patients have been ill informed about their surgery and what to expect. In addition, surgical care was fragmented into several phases of care that did not communicate with each other (preoperative care, surgical care, anesthesia care, postoperative hospital care, and postoperative home care). The surgeons at Colon Rectal Specialists have been leaders in creating a program that integrates all phases of care. Through an enhanced recovery program, the patients are empowered to take control of their care. Information regarding smoking cessation and the benefits of exercise prior to surgery are provided as well as helpful tools to achieve those goals. Patients are also given healthy expectation of what to expect during and after their hospitalization. Along with nurses, therapists, anesthesiologists, care is provided in a coordinated manner to ensure minimal narcotic medication use and a healthy recovery for the patient. Throughout the world, programs such as this has proven to show reduced complications after surgery, shorter hospitalizations, quicker return from surgery, reduced readmissions to the hospital, and overall better patient satisfaction which is the ultimate goal at Colon Rectal Specialists. When scheduling your surgery, please ask your surgeon about the ERAS program.ColonoscopySigmoidoscopy is similar to colonoscopy, but is restricted to the last 2 feet of the colon and goes no farther. It is usually performed on younger patients who don’t clinically require a colonoscopy. Sigmoidoscopy provides a direct visualization of the lining of the colon and rectum. If anything unusual is detected – such as a polyp or inflamed tissue – a biopsy can be taken and sent for evaluation.ConstipationIrritable Bowel SyndromeThese inflammatory conditions should be distinguished from Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) which is a functional bowel disorder where there is no evidence of bowel inflammation to correspond to a patients symptoms.Urinary IncontinenceA rectocele may be present without any other abnormalities. In some cases, a rectocele may be part of a more generalized weakness of pelvic support and may exist along with a cystocele, urethrocele, and enterocele, or with uterine or vaginal prolapse, rectal prolapse, and fecal or urinary incontinence.DiarrheaIncontinence is the impaired ability to control gas or stool and it ranges from mild difficulty with gas control to severe loss of control over liquid and formed stools. Incontinence to stool is a common problem, but one that’s rarely discussed in public. Both bladder and bowel incontinence are problems that tend to increase with age.NeurologistsMultiple SclerosisThere may be several causes, including inadequate intake of both fiber and fluid. Constipation may be aggravated by travel, pregnancy or change in diet. And, in some people, it may occur as the result of repeatedly ignoring the urge to have a bowel movement. Other, more serious causes include narrowing of the colon or growths in the bowel; certain thyroid diseases, such as under active thyroid; plus disorders of the nervous system, such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson’s disease. Also, many medications – including pain killers, antidepressants, blood pressure medicine, iron or calcium supplements and antacids containing aluminum – can cause constipation. That’s why it’s important to talk to us if constipation persists for several weeks – and sooner if blood appears in your stool.RadiologistX-RaysComputed TomographyCheckups may include a physical exam (including a digital rectal exam), lab tests (including fecal occult blood test and CEA test), colonoscopy, X-rays, CT scans or other tests.ChemotherapySystemic therapy. Chemotherapy and biological therapy are systemic therapies. The drugs enter the bloodstream and destroy or control cancer throughout the body.Radiation TherapyLocal therapy. Surgery and radiation therapy are local therapies. They remove or destroy cancer in or near the colon or rectum. When colorectal cancer has spread to other parts of the body, local therapy may be used to control the disease in those specific areas.UltrasoundA physical exam of the anal region should be performed, because it may identify an obvious injury to the anal muscles. In a test called manometry, a small catheter is placed into the anus to record pressure as patients relax and tighten the anal muscles. This test reveals the strength of the muscle. A separate test may also be conducted to determine if the nerves that go to the anal muscles are functioning properly. Finally, an ultrasound probe can be used within the anal area to provide a picture of the muscles and show areas in which the anal muscles have been injured.InternistsColon CancerThe colon is susceptible to several problems, the most severe of which is colon cancer. However, other problems can occur that result in painful symptoms. Many of these diseases can be treated successfully or prevented altogether. That’s why regular screening is so important.EndoscopyA critical step in the patient’s evaluation involves examination of the intestine with a fiberoptic instrument called a colonoscope. Under light sedation the entire large intestine can be inspected and biopsies can be performed for microscopic evaluation. Usually the most terminal portion of the small intestine can be visualized as well. Occasionally, colonoscopy might be supplemented by X-Ray testing or even “capsule endoscopy” which has caught the public’s imagination as the “camera pill.”SurgeonsMinimally Invasive SurgeryMinimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) is an advanced technique of surgery that uses a series of small incisions that allows the surgeon to perform surgery through small channels called ports. It allows the surgeon to look inside of a person through a fiber optic camera and perform the necessary surgery without having to create a large incision. The obvious benefits of minimally invasive surgery is smaller incisions, less pain, shorter hospital stays, a quicker return to normal activities, and decreased costs.   Despite the obvious benefits, MIS is technically challenging and so recent data shows that less only than 40% of colorectal surgery is being performed via a minimally invasive technique. Colon Rectal Specialists has been early adopters in these techniques for the sake of their patients and has been performing minimally invasive colon surgery for more than 20 years. If in need of colorectal surgery, please consult with one of our board certified surgeons about laparoscopic minimally invasive surgery.Robotic SurgeryThe newest form of minimally invasive surgery these days is robotic surgery. Though it is a fairly new platform, the surgeons at Colon Rectal Surgery have more than 5 years of experience providing surgery with some of the newest and greatest technology available. The beauty of robotic surgery is that it has allowed us to perform surgeries in a minimally invasive way that may not have been feasible before. The robotic platform provides the surgeon with better visualization during surgery, more flexible wristed movement of instruments for better control, and the ability to access very difficult areas for delicate surgery. Please contact us to see if robotic colon and rectal surgery would be of benefit to you.HysterectomyIn addition, a history of constipation and straining with bowel movements, or hysterectomy may contribute to the development of a rectocele. Commonly, these problems develop with age but they may occasionally occur in younger women or in those that have not delivered children.LaparoscopyLaparoscopy: Using minimally invasive techniques, select colon cancers may be removed with the aid of the laparoscope. Three or four tiny cuts are made into your abdomen. The surgeon sees inside your abdomen with the laparoscope. The tumor and lymph nodes with a margin of normal tissue are removed. The surgeon checks the rest of your abdomen to see if the cancer has spread.GynecologistsPregnancyLabor and DeliveryThere are many causes of incontinence, one of the most common being injury during childbirth. Such an injury may cause a separation in the anal muscles and a decrease in muscle strength. Also, the nerves supplying the anal muscles may also be injured. Some of these injuries may become apparent immediately following childbirth; others, however, can go unnoticed until later in life.DermatologistsEczemaPsoriasisOther, rare, causes of anal itching may include pinworms, psoriasis, eczema, dermatitis, homorrhoids, anal fissures and infections, and allergies.Physical TherapistsPhysical TherapyAs many as 18 million Americans (about 1 in 12) are affected by fecal or bowel incontinence. Symptoms can be varied resulting in stool urgency, lack of sensation, anal leakage, staining of underwear and a full loss of control leading to the need for adult diapers. It is often an embarrassing topic for patients to mention to friends, family members, and even to their own doctors so it tends to go undiagnosed for many years. There have been many therapies over the years. Sometimes dietary therapy and physical therapy to help build pelvic floor muscles is all that is needed but often that is not enough. Colon Rectal Specialists now offers a new and exciting therapy called sacral nerve neuromodulation, delivered by InterStim® Therapy, to manage chronic bowel incontinence. This device consists of a wire and an implantable pacemaker-like device that is placed by the surgeon. The InterStim device delivers tiny electrical pulses to pelvic nerves which help the brain and nerves to communicate so the bowel, pelvic floor, and related muscles can function and interact correctly. Prior to permanent implantation, patients are able to test InterStim Therapy during an evaluation period to see if it works for their symptoms. Please schedule an appointment today to have your fecal incontinence evaluated and to see if InterStim® Therapy is for you.Plastic SurgeonsLaparoscopic SurgeryLaparoscopic surgery cannot be performed by every surgeon – even surgeons who are highly skilled in conventional surgical techniques. It requires extensive training and a dedicated team.PsychiatristsStress ManagementIn addition to diet and stress management, medications are often used to relieve the symptoms of IBS. We may suggest fiber supplements or laxatives for constipation or medicines such as antidiarrheals to decrease diarrhea. We may also prescribe an antispasmodic to help control colon muscle spasms and reduce abdominal pain. Working together, we can find the best combination of medicine, diet, counseling, and support to control your symptoms.Send to PhoneLynch, James P, MD11051 Hall Rd Ste 210, Utica, MI 48317(586) 739-5220Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailLynch, James P, MD11051 Hall Rd Ste 210, Utica, MI 48317(586) 739-5220Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend

James P. LynchJames P. Lynch is a trial lawyer who represents victims and their families in catastrophic personal injury and wrongful death cases.  Prior to joining Taxman, Pollock, Murray & Bekkerman, LLC, he practiced commercial litigation at a prominent Chicago law firm, where he defended some of the largest trucking companies, bus operators, and insurance companies in the country against personal injury claims. Jim’s experience defending against such personal injury claims gives him valuable insight to maximize his clients’ recovery due to the negligence of others.  In the short time period that Jim has represented the injured and their families throughout Illinois, he has been selected as a “Rising Star” by Illinois Super Lawyers (2016, 2017) and featured in Chicago Magazine for this distinction, which is limited to fewer than 2.5% of attorneys in Illinois. To be eligible for inclusion in Rising Stars, a candidate must be under 40 years old or in practice for 10 years or less. During this same time period, Mr. Lynch has recovered millions in the process for injured clients through settlement, mediation and trial. Jim received his J.D. from Loyola University Chicago School of Law in 2007, where he was a recipient of the Corboy Trial Advocacy Fellowship, the CALI Award for the highest grade in Appellate Advocacy, and a member of the Dean’s List. He received a Bachelor of Arts in Public Administration from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. At Miami University, Jim served as a justice on the faculty-selected Student Court and was a member of the Dean’s List. Jim is a lifelong Chicago area resident, first raised in Chicago’s Beverly neighborhood and later in suburban Western Springs, where he graduated from Nazareth Academy in LaGrange Park. Mr. Lynch is currently admitted to the Illinois bar and the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. He has previously been admitted pro hac vice in cases across the Midwest. When not working, Jim loves to spend time with his wife, family and friends.Results$15,000,000.00 settlement on behalf of several mattress retailers in In re: Polyurethane Foam Antitrust Litigation (N.D.

He examined my eye gave me the correct meds and explained my condition. After he finished I asked if he wanted my insurance information or payment and he replied just stop in in the next few days and see the girl at the desk. Not since the 50s have I seen a doctor like this man. He came in on a Sunday and opened the office just for me even though he had no idea who I was, he didn't care about being paid, made the correct diagnosis, stopped the pain and most of all eased my mind as to my condition. Why? Because he cared.Ragoor, Vijayalaksh, MDkelly.m.giles ratedDr. Ragoor scores a 5+! She is awesome! The office staff however, has brought the rating down to a 2. POOR POOR SERVICE.  Didn't get the preapproval and order my med for a month then recvieved a call from ins co as courtesty call, the got on the line with Dr office, then the office staff left a rude message on my voicemail. UNPROFESSIONAL. Said you called the ins co ( which I did not) also said you were to call Dr **** to make an appt ( they told me they were doing it-they even wrote it on the script not to call-they were calling) Carosso, John EJessica T. ratedOnly had one appt so far but I'd recommend him to anyone, he seen my then 2 year old and was really great with him, they also sent me his evaluation report and I was able to understand all of it! Anyone looking for a place to take their child I would recommend you calling him.Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.
