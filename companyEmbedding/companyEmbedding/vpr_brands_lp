All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Report regarding the prospects of our industry or our prospects, plans, financial position or business strategy, may constitute forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as "may," "will," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "foresee," "project," "anticipate," "believe," "plans," "forecasts," "continue" or "could" or the negatives of these terms or variations of them or similar terms. Furthermore, such forward-looking statements may be included in various filings that we make with the SEC or press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot assure you that these expectations will prove to be correct. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain known and unknown risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in these forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements contained herein, which reflect management's opinions only as of the date hereof. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to any forward-looking statements. You are advised, however, to consult any additional disclosures we make in our reports to the SEC. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in this Report.  Unless stated otherwise, the words "we," "us," "our," the "Company," in this section collectively refer to VPR Brands, LP.  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  The Company was incorporated in New York on July 19, 2004, as Jobsinsite.com, Inc. The Company's articles of incorporation were amended on August 5, 2004, to change our name to Jobsinsite, Inc. On June 18, 2009, we merged with a Delaware corporation and became Jobsinsite, Inc. On July 1, 2009 we filed articles of conversion with the secretary of state of Delaware and became Soleil Capital L.P., a Delaware limited partnership. On September 2, 2015, we amended our articles of incorporation to change our name to VPR Brands, LP. We are managed by Soleil Capital Management LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.  On December 27, 2013, the Company entered into a patent acquisition agreement (the "Purchase Agreement"), by and among VPR Brands and Guocheng "Greg" Pan, a natural person, pursuant to which VPR Brands agreed to purchase certain electronic cigarette and personal vaporizer patents owned and invented by Mr. Pan (the "Purchased Assets"). Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement and in consideration for the acquisition of the Purchased Assets, VPR Brands issued to Mr. Pan (and certain of his designees) 10,501,700 common units representing limited partnership units of VPR Brands and a warrant to purchase 2,000,000 common units representing limited partnership units of VPR Brands. The warrants entitle Mr. Pan (or his designees) to purchase VPR Brands common units at $0.15 per common unit with an expiration date ten years from the effective date of the Purchase Agreement.  The patents were originally valued based on number of shares issued, warrants issued, valuation of the traded stock at the time of issuance and similar patents sold during the year. Based on these assumptions the Company has valued the assets purchased at approximately $5.5 million at the time of purchase. During the year ended December 31, 2014 the Company determined due to lack of sales and projected sales and completion in the industry the value of the patent should be significantly reduced. As a result the Company has written off the entire patent.  On May 29, 2015, the Company, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Kevin Frija ("Frija Share Purchase Agreement") for a private placement ("Private Placement") of up to 50,000,000 common units representing limited partnership interest of the Company. The Private Placement has been expected to occur in multiple tranches. For the first tranche, on June 4, 2015, the Company issued 10,000,000 shares of its Common Units to Kevin Frija at a purchase price of $0.01 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $100,000 to the Company. In subsequent tranches, Kevin Frija has the right to buy an additional 40,000,000 Common Units at a purchase price of $0.01 per share. The Company has been expecting to receive gross proceeds of $400,000 in the aggregate upon the closing of the subsequent tranches of the Private Placement, which is expected to be completed by September, 2016. No placement agent has participated in the Private Placement.  In connection with the Share Purchase Agreement, the Company named Kevin Frija chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of the Company and as a manager of the Company's General Partner. Contemporaneous with Mr. Frija's appointment as chief executive officer and chairman of the board of Directors, the Company's current chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors, Messrs. Jon Pan and Greg Pan, respectively, have resigned from their respective positions. Notwithstanding, Mr. Greg Pan continues to serve as a member of the board of directors of the Company and as a manager of the General Partner and Mr. Jon Pan continues to serve as a consultant to the Company. In consideration and as severance, for Jon Pan's resignation as chief executive officer, the Company and the General Partner have entered into that certain Share Purchase Agreement with Jon Pan wherein the Company agreed to grant Jon Pan the right to purchase 10,000,000 of the Company's Common Units, at a price of $0.01 per share.  On September 2, 2015, in accordance with authority granted to the General Partner under the Company's Limited Partnership Agreement, the General Partner changed the Company's name ("Name Change") from Soleil Capital L.P. to VPR Brands, LP by filing an amendment to the Company's Certificate of Limited Partnership with the Delaware Secretary of State. Accordingly, on September 10, 2015, the Company's General Partner also amended the Company's Limited Partnership Agreement to reflect the Name Change from Soleil Capital L.P. to VPR Brands, LP. On September 17, 2015, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) approved the Name Change and the Company's new trading symbol VPRB.  On December 9, 2015, Kevin Frija sold an aggregate of 9,000,000 of his shares of Common Units at a sale price of $0.01 per share (for an aggregate of $90,000) to Jacob Levy (1,000,000 shares), Nissim Levy (1,000,000 shares), Sara Morad (1,000,000 shares), Yaron Edery (1,000,000 shares), Barry Rub (2,000,000 shares), Hannah Frija (2,000,000 shares), and Ralph Frija (1,000,000 shares).  On March 28, 2016, Mr. Frija exercised a right to buy 15,000,000 shares of the Common Units at a purchase price of $0.01 per share, resulting in 15,000,000 shares of Common Units issued to Mr. Frija in exchange for gross proceeds of $150,000 to the Company, pursuant to the terms of the Frija Share Purchase Agreement, leaving a balance of 25,000,000 shares of Common Units to purchase at $0.01 per share under the right to buy under the Frija Share Purchase Agreement.  On July 29, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Vapor Corp. ("Vapor") and the Company' Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Frija (the former Chief Executive Officer of Vapor), pursuant to which Vapor sold Vapor's wholesale operations and inventory related thereto (collectively, "Assets") to the Company, which Vapor's business is operated at 3001 Griffin Road, Dania Beach, Florida 33312 (the "Dania Beach Premises"). The transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement closed on July 29, 2016.  In connection to the business acquisition there was a $500,000 loan from Vapor to the Company, a secured, 36-month promissory note from the Company to Vapor in the principal amount of $500,000 (the "Secured Promissory Note"; together with the Acquisition Note, are referred to herein as the "Notes") bearing an interest rate of prime plus 2% (which rate resets annually on July 29th), which payments thereunder are $14,000 per month, with such payments deferred and commencing on January 26, 2017, with subsequent installments payable on the same day of each month thereafter and in the 37th month (on July 29, 2019), a balloon payment for all remaining accrued interest and principal. In March 2017 this note was sold by Vapor Corp to DiamondRock, LLC.  The new note is convertible at the following terms:  DiamondRock has the right to convert the outstanding and unpaid principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest of the respective tranche of the Note into shares of common stock of the Company, subject to the limitation that DiamondRock may not complete a conversion if doing so would cause DiamondRock to own in excess of 4.99% of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock, provided that DiamondRock may waive that limitation and increase the ownership cap to up to 9.99%. The conversion price for any conversion under the Note is equal to the lesser of (i) $0.50 and (ii) 65% of the volume weighted average trading price of the Company's common over the 7 trading days ending on the last complete trading day prior to the date of the conversion. In addition, in the event that the Company enters into certain transactions with other parties that provide for a conversion price at a larger discount (than 35%) to the trading price of the Company's common stock, or provides for a longer look-back period, then the conversion price and look-back period under the Note will be adjusted to be such lower conversion price and longer look-back period, as applicable.  As per the convertible note with Diamond Rock in November 2016 Diamond Rock has converted $25,000 into 87,108 shares in March 2017 and $25,000 into 86,147 shares in April 2017 and $25,000 into 97,364 shares on May 5, 2017.  On January 3, 2017, the Board of Directors of VPR Brands, LP appointed Mr. Daniel Hoff, as its Chief Operating Officer ("COO"). Mr. Hoff previously served as a consultant to the Company since August 2016, serving as head of wholesale operations and Director of Alternative Products. He will retain these positions as COO.  On March 13, 2017, the Company entered into Agreement, dated March 11, 2017, (the "Agreement") with MAPH Enterprises, LLC ("MAPH") pursuant to which MAPH agreed to provide certain business advisory and consulting services in exchange for payment by the Company of $75,000 and the issuance by the Company of 600,000 restricted shares of Company common stock. The term of the Agreement begins on March 13, 2017 and ends on May 1, 2017. Either party may terminate the Agreement prior to its expiration upon written notice to the other party upon (a) the failure of any party to cure a material default under the Agreement within five business days after receiving written notice of such default from the terminating party; (b) the bankruptcy or liquidation of either party; (c) the use by any party of any insolvency laws; (d) the performance of MAPH's services under the Agreement; and (e) the appointment of a receiver for all or a substantial portion of either parties' assets or business. If terminated, MAPH shall not be required to perform any additional services beyond the termination date and all fees described in the Agreement shall be deemed earned in full.  Business Description  The Company is engaged in various monetization strategies of a portfolio of patents the Company owns in both the US and China, covering electronic cigarette, electronic cigar and personal vaporizer patents. We currently market a brand of electronic cigarette e liquids marketed under the brand "Helium" in the United States and are undertaking efforts to establish distribution of our electronic cigarette brand in China. We are currently also identifying electronic cigarette companies that may be infringing our patents and exploring options to license and or enforce our patents.  Since our inception the company has generated nominal revenues through the sale of software items related to the job search industry and in 2009 management actively explored opportunities to manage private capital, specifically the Company had plans to sponsor and manage limited partnerships organized for the purpose of exploring opportunities to acquire securities in secondary transactions of venture backed businesses and dispensing capital to seed stage venture capital opportunities. As a result of the Company's new business direction and in an effort to establish operations in the venture capital and private equity industry, the Company has reorganized the business and restructured the Company as a public limited partnership. In 2013, management identified an opportunity to acquire a portfolio of electronic cigarette and personal vaporizers patents. In connection with this transaction the Company's business objectives pivoted and the Company is now focusing its efforts on the electronic cigarette and personal vaporizer industry and is pursuing plans to commercialize and monetize its portfolio of electronic cigarette and personal vaporizer patents.  How We Plan to Generate Revenue  VPR Brands is a holding company, whose assets include issued U.S. and Chinese patents for atomization related products including technology for medical marijuana vaporizers and electronic cigarette products and components. The company is also engaged in product development for the vapor or vaping market, including e-liquids. Electronic cigarettes (also known as ecigs or e-cigs) are electronic devices which deliver nicotine through atomization, or vaping of e-liquids and without smoke and other chemicals constituents typically found in traditional tobacco burning cigarette products.  Our portfolio of electronic cigarette and personal vaporizer patents (the "Patents") are the basis for our efforts to:   Design, market and distribute a line of e liquids under the "HELIUM" brand;   Design, market and distribute electronic cigarettes;   Prosecute and enforce our patent rights;   License our intellectual property; and   Develop private label manufacturing programs.  Our branded electronic cigarette e-liquids: HELIUM  We design, develop and market electronic cigarette e liquids sold under the Helium brand. Our electronic cigarette e liquids are marketed as an alternative to tobacco burning cigarettes. We launched the Helium brand in limited U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016 and grow distribution through third party distributors. Shortly after our U.S. launch we plan to introduce our electronic cigarette brand to the Chinese market. China is the largest producer and consumer of tobacco products in the world, however we believe that Chinese consumption of electronic cigarettes trails U.S. adoption and use. We believe that an opportunity exists to develop and expand our business and our Helium brand electronic cigarette e-liquids in China.  On March 4, 2016, the Company announced a new e-liquid innovation, namely Helium Hi Definition E-Liquid, that is chilled 20 degrees below room temperature by mini-chillers or desktop chillers designed by the Company to maintain optimum flavor, freshness and aroma by cooling the e-liquids (reducing the escape of molecules from the mixture of e-liquids into the headspace). Helium Hi Definition E-Liquid will come in (i) a 50ml, squeezable bottle with a drip tip, for our mini chillers, (ii) a 180ml bottle for our personal desktop chiller, or  On July 29, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Vapor Corp. ("Vapor") and the Company' Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Frija (the former Chief Executive Officer of Vapor), pursuant to which Vapor sold Vapor's wholesale operations and inventory related thereto (collectively, "Assets") to the Company, which Vapor's business is operated at 3001 Griffin Road, Dania Beach, Florida 33312 (the "Dania Beach Premises"). The transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement closed on July 29, 2016.  From the acquisition of Vapor Corp's wholesale operations, VPR Brands, LP has inherited a significant client base consisting of private label vaporizers within the medical cannabis industry. VPR Brands, LP is a private label manufacturing partner and we provide them with their own branded vape equipment and accessories . The company has focused efforts on building this portfolio and aggressively pursuing this market space. The company has also since taken the inherited HONEYSTICK brand of high end vaporizers and focused on expanding the product line of lifestyle vaporizers targeted towards cannabis concentrates and extracts. VPR Brands, LP has attended and featured this brand at all relevant industry trade shows and has created new marketing materials to spread its awareness and acceptance. This product line has become the premier brand within the VPR Brands portfolio of house brands with expanding into several new high end distributors and also won a 2nd place finish in the 2017 Socal High Times Cannabis Cup within the Vape Pen category.  The Vapor Corp. asset acquisition will comprise almost all of the Company's revenue going forward.  Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2016  Revenues  Our revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $786,535 and $-0-, respectively. The increase is a result of the asset acquisition from Vapor Corp. of its wholesale business.  Cost of Sales  Cost of sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $511,521 and $-0-, respectively. The increase is a result of the asset acquisition from Vapor Corp. of its wholesale business.  Operating Expenses  Operating expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 were $598,556 as compared to $61,005 for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The increase in expenses is due to increased general, selling and administrative costs for the asset acquisition from Vapor Corp. Payroll made up $250,482 of the difference and marketing expense another $162,330. The rest of the difference included travel expenses and professional fees related to the Vapor Corp. asset acquisition.  Other Income (Expense)  Other income (expense) for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $31,248 and $-0-, respectively. Increase is a result of the interest expense for the loans associated with Vapor Corp acquisition and offset by gains on the calculation of the derivatives also associated with these loans.  Net Loss  Net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $(292,294) compared to a net loss of $(61,005) for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The net loss has increased mainly as the result of the expense related to the increased expenses and interest expense from loans related to the acquisition.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The Company used cash in operating activities of $(196,315) for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 as compared to $(119,180) used in the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in cash used is mainly a result of the loss for the year.  During the quarters ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 the Company was provided cash from financing activities of $127,716 of which $225,000 was proceeds of note from the DiamondRock. and $75,000 of which was from the sale of common units. The Company had separate private placements in 2017 and 2016.  Assets  At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had total assets of $1,033,662 and $970,241, respectively. Assets consist primarily of the cash accounts held by the Company, inventory and accounts receivable in 2017 and 2016.  Liabilities  Our total liabilities were $1,320,183 at March 31, 2017, compared to $1,103,440 at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increased accounts payable, customer deposits and notes payable related to the acquisition.  Off -Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.  May 22, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

We will continue to innovate, grow our product lines & distribution model as this is just the beginning, said Kevin Frija CEO of VPR Brands.     $VPRB LP Announces 2016 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results  http://marijuanastocks.com/vprb-10/  http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/default.aspx?cik=1376231  VPR Brands, LP (OTC PINK: VPRB) released 2016 fourth quarter and full year revenue and financials. 2016 revenue totaled $1,580,676, which represents a 4,620.85% increase over 2015 revenue of $342. , For 2016, VPR Brands had a gross profit margin of 30.42%, gross profit of $480,852 and a net operating loss of $327,757.  Fourth quarter 2016 revenue totaled $972,322, representing a 59.82% increase over third quarter 2016 revenue of $608,354. Fourth quarter 2016 operating margins were down slightly compared to the third quarter 2016 to 29.03%, with $282,298 in gross profit and a net operating loss of $206,174.  “The acquisition we made in 2016 was a bold move that has added incremental business and value to the Company for the last half of 2016 and has given us a running start into 2017. We believe that the Company is now well positioned to take advantage of the growing cannabis market segment,” said Kevin Frija, CEO of VPR Brands, LP. “We will continue to stay focused on our mission of building long-term value for the Company, both organically or through additional acquisitions that make sense for the Company.”  “I couldn’t be more excited for our portfolio of brands, our team of people, our great clients, our strategic alliances and our growth potential within the rapidly expanding cannabis space. Although 2016 was a short year for us, I believe we have set a solid foundation for growth that we can build upon for years to come,” commented Daniel Hoff, COO of VPR Brands, LP.  Although our sales are not segregated by brand or product category, our primary revenue source is from vaporization devices specifically created for use with medical cannabis and recreational marijuana. These devices are specifically created for use with extract oils and concentrates which are vaped, providing optimal results and the best experience for patients and recreational users. Vaporizers are far more convenient and discrete compared to traditional cannabis use methods. These units are compact, easy to carry and concealable. Modern cannabis vaporizers do not emit distinct and lingering odors that are affiliated with traditional marijuana use. We believe that portable vaporizers as the fastest growing delivery mechanism for marijuana. Our team is currently working with other market leaders within cannabis growth and extraction to innovate and further educate the marketplace on its advantages.  http://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/VPRB/news  MINIMAX to become the hottest selling new oil extract Vapor battery: throw out your old Vape Pen    FORT LAUDERDALE, FL -- (Marketwired) -- 02/24/17 -- VPR Brands, LP (OTC PINK: VPRB) is revolutionizing the market for vaporizer batteries with the launch of the proprietary MINIMAX Key FOB Battery.

VPR Brands LP has launched their new product line, Helium Hi Definition e-liquid.  The Helium brand is an interesting innovation in e-liquids. Specifically, called Helium Hi Definition E-Liquid, it is a product that is cooled to 20 degrees below room temperature by mini-chillers or desktop chillers that are designed by the Company. This chilling process allows for the maintenance of optimum flavor and aroma and helps to preserve overall freshness of the liquid. This chilling process significantly reduces the escape of molecules from the e-liquid, providing the customer with a better overall vaping experience.  http://www.vprbrands.com/ https://www.facebook.com/VPRBrands http://vapehelium.com/ http://www.vapehoneystick.com/ http://vaporin.com/ http://www.ivaporx.com/ http://www.kusharmyknife.com/ http://www.alphapuff.com/

VPR Brands, LP announces First Quarter 2017 Results










 VPR Brands, LP (OTC PINK:VPRB) has released its first quarter 2017 results of operations. Revenue for first quarter 2017 totaled $786,535 with a gross profit of $275,014 and a gross margin of 34.96%. In comparison, the first quarter 2016 revenue and gross profit was $-0- and $-0-, respectively. The increase is a result of the asset acquisition from Vapor Corp. of its wholesale business.





















Cost of sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $511,521 and $-0-, respectively. The increase is a result of the asset acquisition from Vapor Corp. of its wholesale business.
Operating expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 were $598,556 as compared to $61,005 for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The increase in expenses is due to increased general, selling and administrative costs for the asset acquisition from Vapor Corp. Payroll made up $250,482 of the difference and marketing expense another $162,330. The rest of the difference included travel expenses and professional fees related to the Vapor Corp. asset acquisition.
Net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $(292,294), compared to a net loss of $(61,005) for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The net loss has increased mainly as the result of the expense related to the increased expenses and interest expense from loans related to the acquisition.
“The Company has completely shifted its focus to service the cannabis sector and is increasing its investment into our award winning HONEYSTICK brand,” said Kevin Frija, CEO of VPR Brands, LP. “We’re excited about our new trajectory and believe that our focus on the HONEYSTICK brand will lead to increased sales of our branded products, which should translate into increased margins and ultimately, profitability.”
“The first quarter was a true transitional quarter, where the Company made the switch from distributing popular vaporizer brands and liquids, to building, expanding, and focusing on the HONEYSTICK brand and further expanding its presence in the cannabis space. I believe this transition was in the long term best interest of VPR Brands LP and look forward to the further emergence and expansion of the HONEYSTICK brand as well as our portfolio of cannabis business,” said Dan Hoff, COO of VPR Brands, LP.
Although our sales are not segregated by brand or product category, our primary revenue source is from vaporization devices specifically created for use with medical cannabis and recreational marijuana. These devices are specifically created for use with extract oils and concentrates which are vaped, providing optimal results and the best experience for patients and recreational users. Vaporizers are far more convenient and discrete compared to traditional cannabis use methods. These units are compact, easy to carry and concealable. Modern cannabis vaporizers do not emit distinct and lingering odors that are affiliated with traditional marijuana use. We believe that portable vaporizers are the fastest growing delivery mechanism for marijuana. Our team is currently working with other market leaders within cannabis growth and extraction to innovate and further educate the marketplace on its advantages.
About VPR Brands LP:
VPR Brands is a technology company whose assets include issued U.S. and Chinese patents for atomization related products including technology for medical marijuana vaporizers and electronic cigarette products and components.

Revenue for first quarter 2017 totaled $786,535 with a gross profit of $275,014 and a gross margin of 34.96%. In comparison, the first quarter 2016 revenue and gross profit was $-0- and $-0-, respectively. The increase is a result of the asset acquisition from Vapor Corp. of its wholesale business.Cost of sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $511,521 and $-0-, respectively. The increase is a result of the asset acquisition from Vapor Corp. of its wholesale business.Operating expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 were $598,556 as compared to $61,005 for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The increase in expenses is due to increased general, selling and administrative costs for the asset acquisition from Vapor Corp. Payroll made up $250,482 of the difference and marketing expense another $162,330. The rest of the difference included travel expenses and professional fees related to the Vapor Corp. asset acquisition. Net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $(292,294), compared to a net loss of $(61,005) for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The net loss has increased mainly as the result of the expense related to the increased expenses and interest expense from loans related to the acquisition. “The Company has completely shifted its focus to service the cannabis sector and is increasing its investment into our award winning HONEYSTICK brand,” said Kevin Frija, CEO of VPR Brands, LP. "We’re excited about our new trajectory and believe that our focus on the HONEYSTICK brand will lead to increased sales of our branded products, which should translate into increased margins and ultimately, profitability.""The first quarter was a true transitional quarter, where the Company made the switch from distributing popular vaporizer brands and liquids, to building, expanding, and focusing on the HONEYSTICK brand and further expanding its presence in the cannabis space. I believe this transition was in the long term best interest of VPR Brands LP and look forward to the further emergence and expansion of the HONEYSTICK brand as well as our portfolio of cannabis business," said Dan Hoff, COO of VPR Brands, LP.Although our sales are not segregated by brand or product category, our primary revenue source is from vaporization devices specifically created for use with medical cannabis and recreational marijuana. These devices are specifically created for use with extract oils and concentrates which are vaped, providing optimal results and the best experience for patients and recreational users. Vaporizers are far more convenient and discrete compared to traditional cannabis use methods. These units are compact, easy to carry and concealable. Modern cannabis vaporizers do not emit distinct and lingering odors that are affiliated with traditional marijuana use. We believe that portable vaporizers are the fastest growing delivery mechanism for marijuana. Our team is currently working with other market leaders within cannabis growth and extraction to innovate and further educate the marketplace on its advantages.About VPR Brands LP:VPR Brands is a technology company whose assets include issued U.S. and Chinese patents for atomization related products including technology for medical marijuana vaporizers and electronic cigarette products and components. The Company is also engaged in product development for the vapor or vaping market, including e-liquids, vaporizers and electronic cigarettes (also known as e-cigarettes) which are devices which deliver nicotine and or cannabis through atomization or vaping, and without smoke and other chemical constituents typically found in traditional products.

We are excited to inform our shareholders that the transition of our management and business operations are proceeding on schedule. The Companys wholesale division, along with current product lines have never stopped generating revenue since we took over. The transition has been seamless and this is partly due to the fact that we kept many of the former employees and sales associates on board, while strategically lowering costs by eliminating corporate redundancies and creating a business culture that is efficient and fiscally responsible.On the corporate side, it is important to note that VPRB has no toxic debt. The company has a very low float of 2,343,816 and is widely held by insiders and management. Under my previous management we were able to uplist Vapor Corp from pink sheets all the way to the Nasdaq in 2014 just prior to my departure. Our management is again focused on building shareholder value while increasing sales and profit margins on our product lines.The current brands under management are:HoneyStick brand (vapehoneystick.com) a premium open tank mod specifically designed and intended to be used for essential oils and which is becoming popular in medical and recreational marijuana legal states.Vaporin brand (vaporin.com) is a high quality entry-level range of product sold nationwide in smoke shops, convenience stores and gas stations.VaporX brand (iVaporX.com) a premium mod and open tank system program for the experienced Vape customer all for under $100 and available at retail in custom display.Hookah Stix brand Hookah flavor inspired cigalikes (which are electronic cigarettes designed to look as much as a tobacco cigarette as possible).Helium brand (vapehelium.com) the very first eliquid to be sold chilled to stay fresh in its unique customer counter top display chiller.With regards to the legal Medical and Recreational cannabis markets we have heavy market penetration in California, Colorado, Oregon, Connecticut, and Minnesota as well as service and have accounts in Washington, Nevada, Michigan, New Mexico, Alaska, , Vermont‎, and Illinois.Our products are sold in dispensaries with both private label and our flagship Honeystick brand. The Company has aligned with key partners in the states whether on the extraction or distribution side to service dispensaries within each market. We will be providing further updates on these partnerships, but expect our Co-branded items to be rolled into the market in Q4 2016.As stated previously we are fully operational at the original Vapor Corp offices and warehouse‎ located at 3001 Griffin Rd, in Ft Lauderdale FL and have even negotiated a reduction in our monthly facility rent by 30% per month. The core team employed in the wholesale operation of Vapor Corp. have been integrated into VPR Brands, LP (VPRB) assuming similar roles in sales and logistics. This is important as it will preserve continuity in the business allowing for the preservation of current customer relationships. Additional continuity is being preserved because all the brands, trademarks, websites and customer accounts were also transferred over to VPR Brands. Integration has been going smoothly and the wholesale and distributor accounts are pleased to have original Vapor Corp management back‎ at the helm.Vapor Corp name recognition, existing relationships with both suppliers and customers since 2008 is one of the longest running in the industry and is invaluable to VPR Brands, LP (VPRB). Vapor Corp has previously sold to over 25 of the countrys largest distributors and retail chain store customer and has existing vendor # 's with these accounts. It is our goal to reignite our business relationships with all the previous customers who helped make our products the most widely recognized in the industry. Under my previous management (of Vapor corp) sales peaked close to $25 million in 2014.Although Vapor Corp was once among the strongest in the industry, previously reported revenues for their wholesale business dropped from a reported$1,889,777 in the first quarter of 2016 by approximately $520,000 to a reported $1,369,415 for the 2nd quarter ending Jul 31, 2016. Considering the acquisition of the Vapor Corp wholesale business occurred at the end of July 2016, VPR Brands will report only two months of acquired wholesale business in this coming 3rd quarter 2016. Prior to the acquisition, VPR Brands previously reported $61,526 in revenue for the 2nd quarter related to sales of its Helium brand e-liquid.Read MoreThe timing of the acquisition of Vapor Corps wholesale business was also very important. Within the E-cigarette and vapor industry significant upheaval is occurring due to a change in regulatory treatment by the FDA of these products. The government had set August 8, 2016 as the cutoff date of any new product from being introduced at retail in the U.S. without first receiving premarket approval from the FDA. It is expected this provision will allow for products that were currently available prior to August 8, 2016 to remain in the marketplace likely through 2019. Considering that no new products are being allowed to come into the marketplace, current wholesalers, such as VPR Brands, are especially well-positioned to provide product to retailers and consumers via online assets.There is a massive shift occurring in the market for electronic cigarettes and other related products. Where several years ago the major use of electronic cigarettes was as a replacement for traditional cigarettes, the prevalence of using electronic cigarette technologies for the consumption of cannabis is quickly sweeping the marketplace. Whether for traditional tobacco product use or as a delivery mechanism for either medical or recreational cannabis usage, there is simply no debate about the sheer size of this market and the growth the market has experienced. We are positioned to be a large part of this industry.Sincerely,Kevin Frija CEO VPR Brands, LP.SOURCE: VPR Brands, LPReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextTobacco Bondholders Shrug Off FDA News While Cigarette Stocks Are Hit HardBloombergEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredHere are the US targets North Korea most likely wants to nukeBusiness InsiderThe 'two pizza rule' is a secret to productive meetings that helped Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos become one of the world's richest menBusiness InsiderAPNewsBreak: Yellowstone park cracks down on sex harassmentAssociated PressThis Will Be In Everyone's Household By 2020Banyan HillSponsoredChevron and Exxon Mobil have a tough path ahead: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoStocks mixed after heavy earnings weekTrump to cops: 'Please don't be too nice' while arresting 'thugs,' and don't worry about their heads when you toss them in the 'paddy wagon'Business InsiderThe Travel Card That Is Breaking thWise BreadSponsoredWells Fargo faces angry questions after new sales abuses uncoveredReuters9 ways to break free from your credit card debtYahoo FinanceMy bullish view on stocks hasn't changed one iota: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoAvoid Mattress MarkupsSaatva MattressSponsoredBlue Apron: Bullish calls not all they're cooked up to beThe real reason overseas manufacturing is coming to AmericaYahoo FinanceTrump replaces chief of staff Reince Priebus with homeland security chief John KellyDanielle: This "presidency" is out of control.
