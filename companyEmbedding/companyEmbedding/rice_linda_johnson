Background[edit]
Johnson Publishing Company is privately held, and its chairman is the founder's daughter Linda Johnson-Rice. Desiree Rogers serves as the chief executive officer since 2010. In January 2011, the company sold its headquarters of 39 years located at 820 S. Michigan Avenue to Columbia College Chicago. Completed in 1972, the building was the first African-American owned in downtown Chicago.[5] In July 2011, it was announced that JPMorgan was to become a partner in the company. CEO Desiree Rogers stated that they hold a 'minority stake' and presence on the board.[6]

Ebony/Jet Celebrity Showcase[edit]
The company produced Ebony/Jet Celebrity Showcase, a spinoff television show from the two magazines that debuted in August 1982.[7] It was eventually pulled off the air because Johnson H. Johnson was dissatisfied with the quality of the guests.[8] After a one-year hiatus, it returned to syndication with a shortened title and an expanded format with segments on diet, fashion and health.[9] Ebony/Jet Showcase, a weekly, nationally syndicated TV show hosted by Greg Gumbel and Deborah Crable debuted in September 1985.[10][11] By the show's third year in 1987, it became the only Black-syndicated program to reach 92 percent of Black U.S television households and 73 percent of U.S. television households, strengthening its position as the No. 1 Black-oriented interview and entertainment show.[12]
Hair Care Cosmetics/Ebony Fashion Fair[edit]
In addition, Johnson Publishing produces a line of hair care products (Supreme Beauty) and cosmetics (Fashion Fair) marketed for African-American women. Each year it hosts the Ebony Fashion Fair, a traveling fashion show started in 1958 by Eunice W. Johnson that raises money for scholarships and charities in cities across the US and Canada.

 Tesla Adds Ebony Magazine Heir Linda Johnson Rice to Its Board
Johnson Rice has served on the board of several other prestigious companies

Linda Johnson Rice, CEO of Ebony Media Operations and Chairman Emeritus of Ebony Media Holdings, the parent company for the brands Ebony and Jet, has been appointed to the board of Tesla, as per a press release on the electric vehicle manufacturer’s site.

Rumors of Investor Grumblings
 
The appointment follows what many see as pressure from Tesla investors to revamp the board. Investors accuse Tesla founder Elon Musk of too close ties to current board directors reports The Telegraph.
Meanwhile, Tesla will soon ship its highly-anticipated Model 3 electric sedan. Although sales of electric vehicles have been somewhat sluggish in general, there are already over 400,000 people on the waiting list. Some are slated to receive their vehicle this month.
Johnson Rice brings vast corporate board experience to Tesla. She has served on the boards of several large companies including Bausch & Lomb, Kimberly-Clark Corp., Dial Corp., and Quaker Oats.
She is the daughter of John H. Johnson who built the iconic Johnson Publishing Co. Last year, Johnson Rice oversaw the sale of Ebony magazine and Jet to Clear View Group, a Texas-based, black-owned private equity firm.
Johnson Rice said about the sale at the time, “This is the next chapter in retaining the legacy that my father, John H. Johnson, built to ensure the celebration of African Americans. You’ve got two African American companies coming together and doing business with each other.”

There have been several promotions of black women recently to prominent business positions. Earlier this month, Twitter announced it brought on former University of Pittsburgh Medical Center executive Candi Castleberry Singleton as its new VP of diversity and inclusion.
And Apple recently named Denise Young Smith, as its VP of diversity and inclusion. And just last month Ghanaian-born Bozoma Saint John was appointed Uber’s chief brand officer.

      Address: Johnson Publishing, 820 S. Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois
      60605; http://www.ebony.com.
    

      ■ Linda Johnson Rice was the first African American woman to be
      named chief executive officer of a company listed among the top five of
      the Black Enterprise 100s, the nation's largest black-owned
      companies. Johnson Publishing, founded by Rice's father, John H.
      Johnson, had more than $400 million in sales as of 2002 and was the number
      one black-owned, privately held publishing company in the world, worth
      $350 million and employing more than 2,500 people. The company opened the
      eyes of mainstream American businesses to the multibillion-dollar
      influence of the African American consumer market by convincing mainstream
      companies that they would be well served by advertising in magazines aimed
      at black readers. At the same time, the company played a key role in
      establishing the careers of many African American professionals in
      publishing and advertising.
    

      EARLY LIFE
    

      Born in Chicago, Rice developed interests as an equestrian and opera
      singer. However, she always had a keen interest in the family business.
      From the age of six, she often went straight from school to the Johnson
      Publishing headquarters south of Chicago's downtown loop.
      "It was a giant baby-sitter," Rice recalled (
      
        USC Trojan Family Magazine
      
      , Winter 2002). As she grew, the young Rice began to play a role in the
      family business. Her father would often include her in meetings with
      editors debating about which photos to feature as 
      
        Ebony
      
       covers, and the precocious schoolgirl participated actively in the
      discussions. In addition, Rice would often travel with her mother to
      France and Italy to shop for haute couture for the Ebony Fashion Fair, a
      traveling fashion show that raised money for charity.
    

      Rice attended the University of Southern California (USC), earning a BA in
      journalism in 1980. She collected her first full-time paycheck in 1980
      when she became the fashion editor at Johnson Publishing. Over the next
      several years she held the titles of vice president, president, and chief
      operating officer. At the same time, she attended Northwestern
      University's J. L. Kellogg School of Management, earning an MBA in
      1988. Rice's early years at Johnson Publishing were noted by
      William Berry, a University of Illinois journalism professor who was an
      editor at 
      
        Ebony
      
       for seven years: "I've watched her career over the years,
      and she's retained the availability of an ordinary person who has
      extraordinary access to power and capital" (
      
        USC Trojan Family Magazine
      
      , Winter 2002).
    

      BUSINESS ACHIEVEMENTS
    

      After her promotion to CEO in 2002, Rice oversaw the production of 
      
        Ebony
      
       and 
      
        Jet
      
       magazines and was executive producer of a television show, 
      
        Ebony/Jet Showcase
      
      . In addition, she developed an aggressive advertising campaign for
      Fashion Fair Cosmetics, which included special events, more gifts with
      purchases, and glitzier signage in stores. Without changing any of the
      products, she attempted to further brand them in various arenas, such as
      video and television.
    

      Rice sat on several corporate boards of directors, including Continental
      Bank Corporation, Kimberly Clark, and Bausch & Lomb. She was also
      on the board of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Chicago, the board of
      directors of Magazine Publishers of
       America, the Museum of Contemporary Art Board of Trustees, and the USC
      Board of Trustees. She was also a member of the National Association of
      Black Journalists.
    

      MANAGEMENT AND LEADERSHIP STRATEGIES
    

      Johnson Publishing's change in leadership from John H. Johnson to
      Linda Johnson Rice was managed sensitively and smoothly, said employees,
      because of Rice's vision and ability to inspire. In her first few
      months as CEO, she spent a large portion of each day meeting with groups
      of employees at all levels of the company. "My door is hardly ever
      closed," she said. "I'm not the type of CEO that runs
      a dictatorship, because I don't think that gets you
      anywhere" (
      
        USC Trojan Family Magazine
      
      , Winter 2002). Like her father, Rice took pride in knowing the details of
      the company, approving story lists for each issue and making the final
      decisions on 
      
        Ebony
      
       covers. According to Rice, "Out of 12 covers a year, you want 12
      hits. You want something out there that is appealing and eyecatching.
      I'd be crazy not to look at them" (
      
        USC Trojan Family Magazine
      
      , Winter 2002).
    

      With the transition in leadership came a change in managerial style. Rice
      described her father as an entrepreneur with a fiery temper and the vision
      required for the birth and growth of a business, while she described
      herself as a more patient operations person dedicated to managing the size
      and growth of an established business. Even with more than 2,500 employees
      nationwide, Johnson Publishing maintained a family atmosphere that
      reflected the company's leadership, keeping an open-door policy,
      hand-signing paychecks, and retaining many employees 30 years or longer.
      Rice was also dedicated to maintaining a healthy mix of business and
      family time, making a habit of eating Sunday dinners at various local
      restaurants with her daughter and friends.
    

      BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND PHILOSOPHY
    

      Rice responded to critics that claimed 
      
        Ebony
      
       and 
      
        Jet
      
       were not serious reflections of African American issues by stating,
      "We are not an investigative magazine…. We are a feature
      magazine. We are not here to pick apart African Americans. We are here to
      celebrate, and uplift, and inspire" (
      
        USC Trojan Family Magazine
      
      , Winter 2002). Nonetheless, Rice planned to devote more space in both
      magazines to the issues of economic equality, education, and drug abuse.
    

      Not a believer in complacency or stagnation, Rice said her drive was
      inspired both by seeing employees work hard to put out the magazines and
      hearing the positive responses of readers. "My father built an
      incredible business, and I don't want to let him down," she
      said (
      
        USC Trojan Family Magazine
      
      , Winter 2002). Despite several offers, Rice never considered selling the
      family business, maintaining the spirit of family pride in ownership and
      control that outweighed the spirit of capitalism.
    

      Rice took the reins to guide the company through a turbulent time in
      publishing, with advertising revenues throughout the industry the lowest
      in years. Although 
      
        Ebony
      
       and 
      
        Jet
      
       overwhelmingly dominated the black publishing market in 2002, they faced
      mounting competition from emerging niche magazines, such as 
      
        Essence, Vibe
      
      , and 
      
        Black Enterprise
      
      . Despite the proliferation of magazine titles, however, 
      
        Jet
      
       had a circulation of more than 950,000, and 
      
        Ebony
      
       maintained a circulation of more than 10 million readers and 1 million
      subscribers.
    

      At the same time, Fashion Fair Cosmetics competed with major makeup
      manufacturers such as Estée Lauder for consumers of various ethnic
      backgrounds. However, Fashion Fair Cosmetics, the largest black-owned
      cosmetics firm in the world, selling in 2,500 stores on three continents,
      was the world's number one line of makeup and skin care products
      for women of color. In addition, as of 2004 more than 300,000 patrons
      attended the Ebony Fashion Fair per year, and the show had raised a total
      of $49 million for charity, the majority of which was used for
      scholarships for 475 students.

 Linda Johnson Rice Says Ebony Sell Is Smart Business Move
New venture Ebony Media Operations is still black-owned

      by Carolyn M. Brown   
      Posted: June 23, 2016

Last week marked the end of an era for the historic Chicago-based Johnson Publishing Co.
After a 71-year run, the family-owned business has sold its iconic Ebony magazine and the now digital-only Jet magazine to Clear View Group, a private equity firm in Denton, Texas. Johnson Publishing retained ownership of Fashion Fair cosmetics and its photo archives valued at $40 million.
 
Ebony Is Still Black-Owned
 
The new publishing entity, Ebony Media Operations, is maintaining the magazine’s Chicago headquarters and its New York editorial office, as well as much of the current staff.
Linda Johnson Rice, chairman of Johnson Publishing and daughter of founder John H. Johnson, said in a statement, “This is the next chapter in retaining the legacy that my father, John H. Johnson, built to ensure the celebration of African Americans.” She is quick to point out the Ebony remains black-owned, “You’ve got two African American companies coming together and doing business with each other.”
 
A Media Titan
 
Chicago-based Johnson Publishing Co. was founded in 1942 by John H. and Eunice Johnson and curates the African American experience–past, present, and future.
Johnson began his publishing conglomerate with a mere $500 dollars borrowed against his mother’s home furnishings. The Negro Digest was the first publication, folding in 1951.The couple’s second publication, Ebony, a pictorial news magazine fashioned after Life magazine first appeared in November 1945. Jet magazine was launched in 1951 to highlight the news of African Americans in a social limelight with politics, entertainment, business, and sports.
A touring fashion show in 1958 gave birth to the Ebony Fashion Fair. In 1973, the Johnsons started their Fashion Fair cosmetics line for runway models that were having trouble finding makeup for darker skin complexions.
 
BE 100s Pioneer
 
The first time Black Enterprise compiled its BE 100s annual report of the nation’s largest black-owned businesses in 1973, Johnson Publishing made the cut; it ranked No. 2 on the inaugural list with $22.1 million in revenues.
By the end of the first decade for the BE 100, three companies on the list had broken the $100 million sales barrier. The perennial top 10 sales leaders included Motown Industries and Johnson Publishing Co.
It not only remained on the list, but ranked among the top 25 companies consecutively. This is, until 2011, when it fell to the No. 30 spot, and 2012, which marked last time it appeared on the BE 100s list. Johnson Publishing’s media revenues struggled to evolve from print to digital platforms.
 
Savvy Business Move
 
NPR recently spoke with Johnson Rice and Kyra Kyles, vice president of digital content who will serve as the new editor-in-chief of Ebony and Jet.
Johnson Rice described this as a bitter sweet moment to interviewer Michael Martin; “The bitter might be just an initial reaction of, ‘Oh my goodness, it’s sold,’ but not really understanding fully that I will be chairman emeritus of the new company, which is Ebony Media Operations. It is African American-led and owned, and I have a seat on the board. I also have an equity position in the company, so I’m still there. I’ve not walked away from this at all. I love Ebony, I love Jet, so I think the audience needs to understand that.”
When asked if it was painful to sell the business that had been in her family for seven decades, Johnson Rice replied, “I think if I have to be honest with you, I’m very excited. There are different emotions that you go through at different stages. But I think when you come to a realization that this is really in the best interest of the brand and that it really is in our best interest to be able to expand our audience and reach, then you get to a point where you decide that this really is a decision that needs to be made. You have to be confident and feel very good about that.”

Bad move.  I recently cancelled my subscription because I haven’t been getting my magazines.  They’re either extremely late or not coming at all.  You can definitely see the difference between the old and the new.  Terrible!

Jet and Ebony is more out of date. They don’t recognize biracial and multiracial people. It like you are black it is. For example Tiger Woods he fit in that category. It best days long gone before digital age.

It time for it move on. Shut down magazines of Jet and Ebony

Publisher of Ebony shrinks in search of growth


Johnson Publishing, parent company of Ebony magazine, has the weighty title of “curator of the African-American experience.” But the corporate base supporting that role keeps shrinking.The company's recent decision to sell its historic photo collection is the latest example of downsizing, following the cancellation of Jet magazine's print version, the sale of Johnson's 11-story Michigan  Avenue headquarters and the paring of its workforce by a third since 2007. Now it's trying to sublet one of two floors it rented at its new digs, after giving up a third earlier.Johnson Publishing Chairman Linda Johnson Rice and CEO Desiree Rogers say they're positioning the 73-year-old publisher for growth, but even a 2011 cash infusion from JPMorgan Chase hasn't prevented reductions. Rogers won't comment on the private company's financial results, but she acknowledges that print advertising revenue for its remaining title, Ebony, fell 8 percent last year over 2013, or only 3 percent if digital is included. She has cut costs and outsourced to buoy the bottom line."A lot of these decisions that are being made are decisions to right-size the company," says Rogers, who took the CEO post in 2010 after leaving her job as White House social secretary.Johnson Publishing, with estimated revenue of about $90 million in 2013, isn't the only magazine company struggling. Revenue for the industry sank 4.9 percent last year from 2013, according to New York-based Standard Media Index, which tracks spending by the biggest U.S. ad agencies.Publishers have scrambled to replace lost print ad sales, which still make up the bulk of industry income. Meredith, Hearst Communications and Atlantic Media, all of which own magazine portfolios, have bolstered revenue through acquisitions, digital offerings and advertiser-sponsored events. But Time and Conde Nast, a unit of Advance Publications, each recently have cut 10 percent or more of the employees in their magazine divisions, according to news reports.Johnson has a steep challenge because it can't offer advertisers an array of audiences in different publications. “It's very difficult for a single-title magazine company to survive unless they have an extraordinarily strong and loyal readership,” says New York-based industry consultant Peter Kreisky.Ebony and Jet long have had a devoted African-American audience, but their allure is waning. While Ebony's circulation makes it the most popular African-American title, circulation slipped to an average 1.26 million for the six months ended June 30, from 1.29 million for the year-earlier period, according to the Alliance for Audited Media.

Standard Media Index says Ebony's income fell 24 percent in 2014, compared with 7.5 percent at its chief rival, Essence, which is owned by New York-based Time. Rogers says SMI misses three-quarters of Johnson's advertising, especially spending by smaller agencies and by advertisers that work directly with the publisher. She is  pleased Ebony met its 1.25 million circulation pledge the past three years because that let Ebony raise rates this year and attract new advertisers, such as Apple.She also notes the company has a growing online enterprise, including a store with Ebony- and Jet-emblazoned items. In addition, the company's events business is profitable, with sponsors such as Comcast and Toyota funding parties like the Ebony Power 100 Gala in Los Angeles last year.Still, Samir Husni, director of the Magazine Innovation Center at the University of Mississippi, says it was “a big mistake” to fold Jet because print ad sales are a moneymaker and the brand is likely to disappear online. “It's like someone just plucking the chicken one feather at a time,” Husni says.

'Incredibly historical' photos seek a deep-pocketed buyer
Johnson Publishing is asking $40 million for its historic photo collection, but photo appraisers say the ultimate purchase price for the 5 million images will depend on their historical value, condition and who owns the copyrights, among other things.The photos were taken for the company's magazines, principally Ebony and Jet, which have been widely read by African-Americans for decades."It's documentation of black American culture since the magazine started," says Lorraine Davis, who owns a photo appraisal firm in Houston. "It's an incredibly historical document."Johnson Publishing CEO Desiree Rogers won't say how the company determined the $40 million asking price but notes that the company is in the early stages of a process that could take years.Typically, 5 to 25 percent of such collections is valuable, but in this case it could be as much as 30 percent, says Marie Martin, who leads a photo appraisal firm in St. Michaels, Md. A price of $40 million isn't unreasonable, but it's difficult to say without seeing the photos, she and other appraisers say.The work of Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer Moneta Sleet Jr., now deceased, is a prominent feature of the collection. Bidding for his images has varied widely in recent years, Martin says, with one photo selling at auction for $9,000 in 2009 and another for $700 in 2010.Mark Lubell, executive director of the International Center of Photography in New York, is advising Johnson Publishing. He led the Magnum Photo agency when it sold its collection to billionaire Michael Dell in 2010. (The price wasn't disclosed.) The Johnson collection "has great academic and scholarship value," he says.It may take another deep-pocketed buyer to acquire the Johnson archive. "I doubt we could afford it," says Mary Yearwood, curator of photographs and prints at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York.Another institution that could be interested is the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., where Linda Johnson Rice, chairman of Johnson Publishing, is council co-chair. A spokeswoman for the museum declines to comment.
In the past, Johnson Publishing could lean on its Fashion Fair cosmetics business if its magazine business was under pressure, and vice versa. Today, that approach isn't working as well, with Fashion Fair facing increased competition for the African-American consumer. Rogers appointed Clarisa Wilson president of Fashion Fair, but she left after two years and wasn't replaced for months until the hiring last year of Amy Hilliard, formerly CEO of Chicago-based ComfortCake.Johnson Publishing beefed up sales and marketing staff for both businesses and added a chief revenue officer for media. It's also added cosmetics counters at stores in France and South Africa, although the number of U.S. outlets dropped by about a fifth to 530."We have turned the corner—the business is now positioned for growth and investment," Rogers says.Today, the company's headcount is 960 worldwide, with the bulk being Fashion Fair workers in department stores. There are 110 at the company in Chicago and New York. That's down from 1,500 full- and part-time employees in 2007.The decline is occurring despite the millions raised in 2011 when JPMorgan invested in the company and acquired a minority stake. The 2010 sale of the company's historic headquarters only extinguished debt and didn't provide any capital for growth, Rogers says.Ron Childs, who worked at now-defunct Ebony Man, says the editorial product is stronger than it has been in years. But founder John Johnson's strategy of dominating the African-American market is increasingly outdated as readership is wooed by mainstream magazines.Johnson “wanted to be the king of the black hill, and he was that for a long time,” Childs says. “But I don't think we paid enough attention to the segmentation of media that was coming.”

A spokeswoman for the museum declines to comment.
In the past, Johnson Publishing could lean on its Fashion Fair cosmetics business if its magazine business was under pressure, and vice versa. Today, that approach isn't working as well, with Fashion Fair facing increased competition for the African-American consumer. Rogers appointed Clarisa Wilson president of Fashion Fair, but she left after two years and wasn't replaced for months until the hiring last year of Amy Hilliard, formerly CEO of Chicago-based ComfortCake.Johnson Publishing beefed up sales and marketing staff for both businesses and added a chief revenue officer for media. It's also added cosmetics counters at stores in France and South Africa, although the number of U.S. outlets dropped by about a fifth to 530."We have turned the corner—the business is now positioned for growth and investment," Rogers says.Today, the company's headcount is 960 worldwide, with the bulk being Fashion Fair workers in department stores. There are 110 at the company in Chicago and New York. That's down from 1,500 full- and part-time employees in 2007.The decline is occurring despite the millions raised in 2011 when JPMorgan invested in the company and acquired a minority stake. The 2010 sale of the company's historic headquarters only extinguished debt and didn't provide any capital for growth, Rogers says.Ron Childs, who worked at now-defunct Ebony Man, says the editorial product is stronger than it has been in years. But founder John Johnson's strategy of dominating the African-American market is increasingly outdated as readership is wooed by mainstream magazines.Johnson “wanted to be the king of the black hill, and he was that for a long time,” Childs says. “But I don't think we paid enough attention to the segmentation of media that was coming.”

Linda Johnson Rice '87
New ideas, strong legacy brand, spell success for publisher Linda Johnson Rice 
By Adrienne Murrill 
Driving positive change is rarely easy, but an effective leader   					must do it to deliver results. 

That has been the goal of Linda Johnson Rice '87 at Johnson Publishing Company, producer of Ebony, the world's   					No. 1 African-American magazine, and Jet, the No. 1 African-American   					news weekly. 

Her father, John H. Johnson, founded the company in the 1940s   					with a dream and $500. While the business grew into a success,   					Rice held positions including vice president and special assistant   					to the publisher, vice president and fashion coordinator for   					Ebony and fashion coordinator for Ebony Fashion Fair. She earned   					a bachelor's degree in journalism from USC and became Johnson   					Publishing's president and COO in 1987, soon after receiving   					her Kellogg MBA. In 2002, she became CEO, a role she considers   					to be her highest professional accomplishment. 

"It wasn't something that was handed to me on a silver platter,   					even though I worked for it throughout my whole adult life."   					Rice says her father, who died in 2005, was a man who demanded   					dedication, discipline and excellence. When he congratulated   					her on becoming CEO, she realized it was a turning point for   					her and the company. 

Changing roles has challenged Rice '87 to scout new talent for   					the company and integrate it with what she calls the "legacy   					talent" that was already established at Johnson Publishing.   					"It has been important to manage that change, not just in the   					business sense, but in the human sense. You have to take into   					mind how people feel about their jobs, how they feel about new   					people coming in and integrating that together." 

Rice has managed these changes well, which in turn has led to   					new divisions in the company. This includes a licensing division   					that has signed agreements with American Greetings for Ebony   					Inspirations cards, and another that works with Dan River Bedding   					to produce an Ebony home décor line. In addition, the company   					has created a new venture with the Associate Press to digitize   					and sell photos from Johnson Publishing's extensive archives,   					which date back to the 1940s. "It's a great growth strategy   					for the company because we have such iconic brands in Ebony   					and Jet, and I don't think we had capitalized on how strong   					those two brands are outside of the publishing field." 

Rice says her management style, which emphasizes the strength   					of teams, received its foundation at the Kellogg School, where   					she was enrolled in the  Part-Time MBA Program. She says the team-based approach   					has made employees feel more energized and a part of the company   					and its decision-making process. 

"Bringing in new people and having them help me create a vision   					and strategy for the company — and then allowing them to execute   					that — that's a tremendous value that you need to have in leadership,"   					Rice says. "What I learned from my MBA is to think through strategies   					very clearly: What are your barriers, your competitors, what   					sets you apart and how to reach your goals." 

Like any good leader, Rice's values are evident in the product.   					With the addition of new editorial and creative directors, she   					says, their energy and ideas "have excited the team ... and   					brought about sharper covers and stories that are evocative." 

Fresh ideas at Johnson Publishing are also a benefit of the   					relationship that the company has with Northwestern's Medill   					School of Journalism and with Kellogg. Rice has remained connected   					with the Kellogg community in many ways, including as a speaker   					at the Black Management Association Conference in 2005. "We   					look to Northwestern for intern candidates whether in journalism,   					or in business and administration," she says. 

Overall, Rice believes in refining ideas to deliver results,   					something she learned from her father. "If you have a vision,   					you have to make sure that you have thought it through, that   					you have used all the knowledge and resources of those you respect   					... so you can hone that vision. Then be passionate, disciplined   					and willing to make changes as you go."

The 20 Most Powerful Women in Chicago Business
















































































Yes, corporate America still has a woman problem. And Chicago isn't exactly a capital of progress on this front: Of the area's 100 largest public companies, only seven are helmed by women. Now for some good news. We've recently witnessed a string of high-profile promotions of female executives, and more local female business leaders are being named to major corporate boards outside of the city. This movement prompted Crain's to assemble this first-ever ranking. The list below is strictly business: No politicians, or philanthropists, or cultural leaders appear here. Editors considered four criteria: size and importance of a company; title and performance; career trajectory; and an individual's sphere of influence. Tell us how you think we did, WITH THIS HANDY INTERACTIVE TOOL HERE. And find our full 2014 Who's Who list of 500-plus movers and shakers HERE. Illustrations by Jode Thompson.
