 Career History



Managing Member

                                    2004 - Current                


Praesidium Investment Management Co. LLC


                  Praesidium Investment Management Co. seeks to generate superior, absolute returns for their clients through the implementation of a private enterprise approach to investing. Their strategy focuses on identifying long-only equity investments in the securities of undervalued public companies using in depth, bottoms-up research. The firm often works with the management teams of portfolio companies with the goal of increasing the value of the company. Praesidium's investment process is based on fundamental business and credit analysis, capital structure and liquidation analysis, a review of all legal documentation surrounding an issuer’s securities and identification of an investment catalyst.During the research process, Praesidium makes an assessment of the quality of the security in question by examining, among other things, financial metrics of the relevant company, the integrity and strategic vision of the management team and the ability to execute such strategy, as well as the attractiveness and risks of the company’s industry. They then determine what they believe is a fair valuation for the security based on a combination of its future earnings, operating cash flow, free cash flow, liquidation value and revenues. If the public market price for the security is significantly below their fair valuation, Praesidium may attempt to purchase the security for their clients’ portfolios. If they believe the security is priced significantly above their fair valuation and the security is currently included in a client’s portfolio, the firm will generally sell some or all of the position in the security.
