WOODBRIDGE, N.J., July  26, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NORTHFIELD BANCORP, INC.(Nasdaq:NFBK), the holding company for Northfield Bank, reported diluted earnings per common share of $0.18 and $0.39 for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, compared to diluted earnings per common share of $0.15 and $0.23 for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively. In the first quarter of 2017, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) ("ASU 2016-09") which resulted in a $593,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, and a $2.3 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, reduction in income tax expense for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively. Earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2017, also reflect $1.5 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, of tax-exempt income from bank owned life insurance proceeds in excess of the cash surrender value of the policies, recorded in the first quarter of 2017. Earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2016, included merger-related expenses associated with the acquisition of Hopewell Valley Community Bank ("Hopewell Valley") of approximately $2.1 million, net of tax, or $0.05 per diluted share.
John W. Alexander, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Our solid financial performance for the quarter continues to be driven by the fundamentals of disciplined growth, pricing, and expense management. Originated loans held-for-investment have increased over seven percent for the year, asset quality continues to remain strong, our net interest margin experienced a slight increase over the comparable six month prior year period, and our efficiency ratio continues to improve. On the customer experience side, we continue to enhance our online banking system by now providing auto enrollment for mobile deposits and have added Android and Samsung Pay to our existing Apple Pay. Also, we have expanded our online account opening opportunities and added the ability for online customers to transfer funds between banks."
Mr. Alexander further noted, "I am pleased to announce the declaration of a $0.08 per common share dividend by the Board of Directors. This dividend will be payable on August 23, 2017, to stockholders of record on August 9, 2017."
Results of Operations
Comparison of Operating Results for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 and 2016
Net income was $18.4 million and $10.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, and June 30, 2016, respectively. Significant variances from the comparable prior year period are as follows: a $3.2 million increase in net interest income, a $1.0 million increase in the provision for loan losses, a $1.8 million increase in non-interest income, a $4.8 million decrease in non-interest expense, and a $1.2 million increase in income tax expense. 
Net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2017, increased $3.2 million, or 6.4%, to $53.6 million, from $50.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to a $189.0 million, or 5.5%, increase in our average interest-earning assets and a four basis point increase in our net interest margin to 3.01%. The increase in average interest-earning assets was due primarily to an increase in average loans outstanding of $307.3 million, partially offset by decreases in average mortgage-backed securities of $105.3 million and interest-earning deposits in financial institutions of $15.9 million. The increase in average loans was primarily due to originated loan growth. Net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2017, included loan prepayment income of $520,000 as compared to $935,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Yields earned on interest-earning assets increased one basis point to 3.63% for the six months ended June 30, 2017, from 3.62% for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased three basis points to 0.80% for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to 0.83% for the six months ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to lower rates on borrowed funds.
The provision for loan losses increased by $1.0 million to $883,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, from a negative provision of $117,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to growth in the loan portfolio, partially offset by declines in non-performing loans and net recoveries during the six months ended June 30, 2017. Net recoveries, primarily resulting from insurance proceeds received related to a previously impaired loan, were $127,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to net charge-offs of $336,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Non-interest income increased $1.8 million, or 38.3%, to $6.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, from $4.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to an increase of $1.5 million in income on bank owned life insurance, attributable to insurance proceeds in excess of the related cash surrender value of the policies, and an increase of $415,000 in gains on securities transactions, net. Securities gains, net, during the six months ended June 30, 2017, included gains of $668,000 related to the Company's trading portfolio, compared to gains of $44,000 in the comparative prior year period. The trading portfolio is utilized to fund the Company's deferred compensation obligation to certain employees and directors of the Company's deferred compensation plan (the Plan). The participants of this Plan, at their election, defer a portion of their compensation. Gains and losses on trading securities have no effect on net income since participants benefit from, and bear the full risk of, changes in the trading securities market values. Therefore, the Company records an equal and offsetting amount in compensation expense, reflecting the change in the Company's obligations under the Plan.
Non-interest expense decreased $4.8 million, or 12.4%, to $34.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, from $39.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a $3.5 million reduction in merger-related expenses associated with the Hopewell Valley acquisition reflected in the first six months of 2016. Compensation and employee benefits expense decreased $1.6 million, due primarily to a reduction in severance, retention, and change-in-control compensation associated with the Hopewell Valley acquisition in the prior year period, partially offset by annual merit-related salary increases and an increase in expense related to the Company's deferred compensation plan, which is described above, and which has no effect on net income. Data processing fees decreased $964,000, primarily due to non-recurring conversion costs associated with the Hopewell Valley acquisition incurred in the prior year period. Professional fees decreased $472,000 due to $557,000 of non-recurring merger-related professional fees associated with the Hopewell Valley acquisition incurred in the prior year period, partially offset by an increase in other professional fees. FDIC insurance expense decreased by $446,000 due to a reduction in the FDIC's assessment rates for depository institutions with less than $10.0 billion in assets, which became effective in the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Other expense decreased by $1.1 million, primarily due to lower Directors' equity award expense, related to the retirement of three directors, and lower advertising expense, due in part to lower printing and production costs associated with Hopewell Valley customer communications and data conversion mailings in the first six months of 2016.
The Company recorded income tax expense of $6.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $5.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2017, was 26.9% compared to 34.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of 2017, which resulted in, among other things, a $2.3 million reduction in income tax expense related to the exercise or vesting of equity awards during the six months ended June 30, 2017. Previously, these tax benefits were recorded through equity as an adjustment to additional paid in capital. In addition, the effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2017, also was affected by $1.5 million of tax-exempt income from bank owned life insurance proceeds in excess of the cash surrender value of the policies. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the tax effect will be recognized evenly throughout the year.
Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 and 2016
Net income was $8.4 million and $7.0 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2017, and June 30, 2016, respectively. Significant variances from the comparable prior year quarter are as follows: a $1.3 million increase in net interest income, a $497,000 increase in the provision for loan losses, a $96,000 decrease in non-interest income, an $876,000 decrease in non-interest expense, and a $126,000 increase in income tax expense. 
Net interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, increased $1.3 million, or 4.9%, primarily due to a $193.1 million, or 5.6%, increase in our average interest-earning assets, partially offset by a three basis point decrease in our net interest margin to 2.97%. The increase in average interest-earning assets was primarily attributable to an increase in average loans outstanding of $320.8 million, partially offset by decreases in average mortgage-backed securities of $124.0 million and interest-earning deposits in financial institutions of $3.3 million. The increase in average loans was primarily due to originated loan growth. Net interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, included loan prepayment income of $193,000 as compared to $691,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Yields earned on interest-earning assets decreased four basis points to 3.61% for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, from 3.65% for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased one basis point to 0.82% for the current quarter as compared to 0.83% for the comparable prior year quarter.
The provision for loan losses increased by $497,000 to $511,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, from $14,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to growth in the loan portfolio and higher net charge-offs, partially offset by declines in non-performing loans. Net charge-offs were $190,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to net charge-offs of $75,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.
Non-interest income remained relatively stable at $2.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $2.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.
Non-interest expense decreased $876,000, or 5.0%, to $16.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, from $17.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The decrease was due primarily to decreases of $266,000 in data processing fees, $101,000 in other professional fees, $229,000 in FDIC insurance expense due to a reduction in the FDIC's assessment rates for depository institutions with less than $10.0 billion in assets, which became effective in the quarter ended September 30, 2016, and $332,000 in other expense, primarily due to lower Directors' equity award expense related to the retirement of three directors.
The Company recorded income tax expense of $3.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to $3.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The effective tax rate for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, was 31.2% compared to 34.5% for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of 2017, the effect of which was a $593,000 reduction in income tax expense related to the exercise or vesting of equity awards during the quarter ended June 30, 2017, which was previously recorded through equity as an adjustment to additional paid in capital.
Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2017, and March 31, 2017
Net income was $8.4 million and $9.9 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2017, and March 31, 2017, respectively.  Significant variances from the prior quarter are as follows: a $232,000 increase in net interest income, a $139,000 increase in the provision for loan losses, a $1.7 million decrease in non-interest income, a $926,000 decrease in non-interest expense, and an $847,000 increase in income tax expense.
Net interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, was relatively flat compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017, as the increase in our average interest-earning assets of $66.8 million, or 1.9%, was offset by a decrease in our net interest margin of seven basis points to 2.97%. The increase in our average interest-earning assets was due primarily to increases in average loans outstanding of $67.2 million and interest-earning deposits in financial institutions of $19.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in average mortgage-backed securities of $22.8 million. Net interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, included loan prepayment income of $193,000 as compared to $327,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Yields earned on interest-earning assets decreased four basis points to 3.61% for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, from 3.65% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased three basis points to 0.82% for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, as compared to 0.79% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to higher rates on certificates of deposits and borrowed funds.
The provision for loan losses increased by $139,000 to $511,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, from $372,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, due primarily to growth in the portfolio and higher net charge-offs. Net charge-offs were $190,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to net recoveries of $317,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.
Non-interest income decreased $1.7 million, or 41.2%, to $2.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, from $4.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily the result of a $1.5 million decrease in income on bank owned life insurance, attributable to insurance proceeds in excess of the related cash surrender value of the policies received in the quarter ended March 31, 2017, and, to a lesser extent, decreases of $152,000 in gains on securities transactions, net, and $111,000 in fees and service charges for customers.
Non-interest expense decreased $926,000, or 5.3%, to $16.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, from $17.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, due primarily to a decrease of $198,000 in compensation and employee benefits, the majority of which is due to a decrease in expense related to the Company's deferred compensation plan, which is described above, and has no effect on net income, a decrease of $261,000 in occupancy costs, consisting primarily of lower repairs and maintenance costs associated with snow removal costs incurred in the first quarter, a decrease of $275,000 in other professional fees, related to lower recruiting fees and regulatory review fees, and a decrease of $133,000 in other expenses.
The Company recorded income tax expense of $3.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to $3.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The effective tax rate for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 was 31.2% compared to 22.9% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of 2017, which resulted in a reduction in income tax expense of $593,000, and $1.7 million, for the quarters ended June 30, 2017, and March 31, 2017, respectively, related to the exercise or vesting of equity awards. Previously, these tax benefits were recorded through equity as an adjustment to additional paid in capital. In addition, the effective tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, was affected by $1.5 million of tax-exempt income from bank owned life insurance proceeds in excess of the cash surrender value of the policies. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the tax effect will be recognized evenly throughout the year.
Financial Condition
Total assets increased $9.5 million, or 0.2%, to $3.86 billion at June 30, 2017, from $3.85 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in loans held-for-investment, net, of $79.8 million, partially offset by decreases in cash and cash equivalents of $45.8 million and securities available-for-sale of $25.9 million.
As of  June 30, 2017, we estimate that our non-owner occupied commercial real estate concentration (as defined by regulatory guidance issued in 2006) to total risk-based capital was approximately 386%. Management believes that Northfield Bank (the Bank) has implemented appropriate risk management practices including risk assessments, board approved underwriting policies and related procedures which include, monitoring bank portfolio performance, performing market analysis (economic and real estate), and stressing of the Bank's commercial real estate portfolio under severe adverse economic conditions. Although management believes the Bank has implemented appropriate policies and procedures to manage our commercial real estate concentration risk, the Bank's regulators could require us to implement additional policies and procedures or could require us to maintain higher levels of regulatory capital, which might adversely affect our loan originations, ability to pay dividends, and profitability.
Loans held-for-investment, net, increased $79.8 million to $3.05 billion at June 30, 2017, from $2.97 billion at December 31, 2016. Originated loans held-for-investment, net, totaled $2.30 billion at June 30, 2017, as compared to $2.14 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in multifamily real estate loans of $151.9 million, or 10.1%.

Acquired loans decreased by $74.0 million to $719.2 million at June 30, 2017, from $793.2 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to paydowns.
Purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans totaled $28.0 million at June 30, 2017, as compared to $30.5 million at December 31, 2016. The majority of the PCI loan balance consists of loans acquired as part of a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-assisted transaction. The Company accreted interest income of $1.3 million and $2.8 million attributable to PCI loans for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, as compared to $1.4 million and $2.7 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively.
The Company's available-for-sale securities portfolio totaled $473.0 million at June 30, 2017, compared to $498.9 million at December 31, 2016, with the decrease being primarily attributable to paydowns. At June 30, 2017, $407.8 million of the portfolio consisted of residential mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae. In addition, the Company held $63.0 million in corporate bonds, all of which were considered investment grade at June 30, 2017, and other securities of $2.1 million (including $314,000 of equity investments in money market mutual funds).
Total liabilities decreased $7.8 million, or 0.2%, to $3.22 billion at June 30, 2017, from $3.23 billion at December 31, 2016.  The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in deposits of $35.1 million and securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $4.0 million, partially offset by an increase in other borrowings of $31.5 million.
Deposits decreased $35.1 million, or 1.3%, to $2.68 billion at June 30, 2017, as compared to $2.71 billion at December 31, 2016.  The decrease was attributable to decreases of $95.0 million in transaction accounts and $38.4 million in savings accounts, partially offset by increases of $11.9 million in money market accounts and $86.4 million in certificates of deposit accounts.
Borrowings and securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased by $27.5 million, or 5.8%, to $500.7 million at June 30, 2017, from $473.2 million at December 31, 2016. Management utilizes borrowings to mitigate interest rate risk, for short-term liquidity, and to a lesser extent as part of leverage strategies. The following is a table of term borrowing maturities (excluding capitalized leases and overnight borrowings) and the weighted average rate by year at June 30, 2017 (dollars in thousands):

Total stockholders' equity increased by $17.3 million to $638.5 million at June 30, 2017, from $621.2 million at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to net income of $18.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, and to a lesser extent a $4.4 million increase related to equity award activity, and a $1.9 million reduction in unrealized losses on our securities available-for-sale portfolio. These increases were partially offset by dividend payments of $7.4 million.
