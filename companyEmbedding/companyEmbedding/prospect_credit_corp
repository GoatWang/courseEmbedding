Prospect Capital's New 2019 Notes Yield 5.85% - Prospect Capital Corporation (NASDAQ:PSEC) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGOÂ»Prospect Capital's New 2019 Notes Yield 5.85%Sep.22.12 | About: Prospect Capital (PSEC) Charles Margolis Bonds, long-term horizon, Growth, valueProspect Capital Corporation (NASDAQ:PSEC) has just issued new senior notes. The new bonds are callable and are currently priced at $100.00 with a 5.85% coupon. The notes are not listed as being convertible, the prospectus for Prospect Capital Corp. 5.85% Senior Notes states:
...we expect to use the net proceeds from the sale of the notes initially to maintain balance sheet liquidity, involving repayment of debt under our credit facility, investments in high quality short-term debt instruments or a combination thereof, and thereafter to make long-term investments in accordance with our investment objective.
Unfortunately the new Prospect Capital bonds are not rated by Moody's and they are callable. Moody's does rate Prospect Funding LLC., which is a "senior secured revolving credit facility for Prospect Capital Corporation." The credit facility is rated far better than Prospect Capital Corp.'s own credit rating.
Here is a comparison between Prospect Capital's new issue and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A; BRK.B), General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) call protected Corp. bonds:

Two recent Seeking Alpha articles offer opposing views of Prospect Capital. In Be Wary of Prospect Capital SA author Hype Zero does not mince words:

... an investor's $15 initial investment is worth $20.83 ($10 in dividend + $10.83 in n.a.v). That is an anemic return of almost 39% over 8 years. That return is definitely not worth the risk!
In 10.50% Yielding Prospect Capital Offers Growth SA Author Todd Johnson points out "the company pays monthly dividends." Of Prospect Capital's 'peer group' he writes:
I prefer to buy additional shares in American Capital (NASDAQ:ACAS). American Capital receives quarterly fees upon shareholder equity in American Capital Agency Corp. (NASDAQ:AGNC) and American Capital Mortgage (NASDAQ:MTGE).
Debt to Equity

PSEC Debt to Equity Ratio data by YCharts
Though the new Prospect Capital Corp. bonds are callable, some investors could consider the 5.8% yield to be a good deal, (even though the bonds could be called.) It is of the utmost importance that investors refer to the company's prospectus for details:

Redemption Information: Callable at 100.000% on 09/15/2013 and every coupon date thereafter...The date from which interest shall accrue on the Notes is Thursday, September 27, 2012. The "Interest Payment Dates" for the Notes shall be March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing March 15, 2013...
The prospectus states that the redemption price is $1,000. The price of the bonds could go down if the company's credit is downgraded, if interest rates go up or if the company defaults. Another recent prospectus for Prospect Capital 6.95% senior notes (PRY) states:

Convertible Bonds Buyback
Between January 30, 2012 and February 2, 2012, we repurchased $5.0 million of our August 2016 convertible bonds at a price of 97.5% of par, including commissions. The transactions will result in our recognizing $10,000 of loss in the quarter ended March 31, 2012.


Layered Strategy
For the purposes of an example an investor could consider mixing the lower credit quality Prospect Capital Corp. bonds with call protected, higher credit quality Corp. bonds. Or another favored call protected bond.
The reasoning is simple, diversification. The fact is I tend to avoid General Electric Corp. bonds, even though they are rated well and yield more than several contemporaries. This is because General Electric has a ton of debt.
When Prospect Capital's debt to equity ratio chart is juxtaposed with General Electric, the jagged graph appears to be small and smooth:

Let's compare them to Berkshire Hathaway and Wal-Mart' debt to equity ratio, however this time let's look at the maximum available history:

A Diversified Approach
The Prospect Capital senior notes should be considered with caution (due to the credit quality and call feature.) Larger market cap. does not mean a company's bonds are safer, however there is a huge difference between these companies. Notice Prospect Capital is a flat line at the bottom of the chart:

Individual and institutional investors should be mindful of appropriate allocations based on size and 'strength.'. An allocation into Prospect Capital Corp. bonds would probably be smaller than an allocation into larger higher rated companies.
Here is a diversified example for an individual and institutional portfolio.

This is a bond-heavy example. Keep in mind that when interest rates go up, the prices of the bonds will fall. Investors might consider using the income from the bonds to go into more income funds over time.
Overall, Prospect Capital's yield is attractive and the company's stock currently has a 10.4% dividend. However, dividends can be cut, credit ratings can be downgraded. So it is important to consider the balance between quality and yield.
This is an example and is not a recommendation to buy or sell. It is important to consult a financial advisor in order to determine proper allocations (if any) for your objectives. If you have any thoughts about Prospect Capital or this example, please leave a comment below.

TECHNOLOGY CREDIT CORPORATION OPERATING LEASE
Our Operating Lease is a very flexible lease offering, with a variety of end-of-term options. This also has the lowest monthly payment and most aggressive credit approval of any of our lease offerings. A Technology Credit Corporation operating lease will help you better manage your cash flow.
How the Operating Lease Works 
This lease offers terms of 12-48 months. End-of-term flexibility gives you the option of purchasing the equipment or renewing the lease (both at fair market value), or returning the equipment. The Operating Lease includes several accounting benefits, such as not carrying the equipment on your balance sheet and being able to consider the lease payments operating expenses (payments are also usually tax deductible). 
Operating Lease Benefits



Flexible payment terms



Low payments



Aggressive credit approval



End-of term flexibility



 
TECHNOLOGY CREDIT CORPORATION CAPITAL LEASE 
The Capital Lease helps you answer the question of whether to Lease or Buy. This Lease combines the benefits of leasing and ownership, allowing you to know your total cost up front. The Capital Lease allows you to pay for the equipment over an extended period of time and then own your Technology equipment at the end of the lease term for the purchase price of either one dollar or a set amount (e.g. 10% of equipment value).
How the Capital Lease Works 
This lease offers terms of 12-48 months. The end of lease purchase option can either be $1.00 or a set amount (e.g. 10% of original equipment value). The Capital Lease offers you the tax benefits of the interest portion of the periodic payments and the option of taking depreciation on the equipment.
Capital Lease Benefits



Flexible payment terms



Conservation of capital



Competitive rates



One-stop shopping allows you to include hardware and service



TECHNOLOGY CREDIT CORPORATION INSTALLMENT PAYMENT AGREEMENT
The Installment Payment Agreement (âIPAâ) is a straight loan for  the identified product. Unlike a traditional Capital Lease or Operating Lease, all the benefit of ownership inure to you as of the IPA start date. For you, the IPA is treated just as a cash purchase from an accounting standpoint, but allows for you to pay the purchase price over time.
How the Installment Payment Agreement Works 
This is essentially an extended term purchase option with varying from 12-48 months. There are no end of term options or negotiations as you own the product from the inception of the IPA. 
IPA Benefits



Flexible payment terms with competitive rates



Conservation of capital



Ideal for Software License Agreements



No end of term negotiation to finalize the transaction

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moodyâs publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
