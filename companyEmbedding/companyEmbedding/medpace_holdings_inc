Quality assurance, core laboratory, pharmacoviligance, biometrics, and medical writing are just a few of the many areas Medpace covers.

Healthcare deals have been the most popular in the last 12 months, with 50 deals raising $4.1 billion and mostly performing well.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

History[edit]
Medpace was founded in 1992 in Cincinnati, Ohio as Medical Research Services by Dr. August Troendle with several partners. Dr. Troendle first became interested in the CRO sector after working in both the regulatory and pharmaceutical area. He began his career specializing in the development of lipid lowering therapies to treat high cholesterol as a reviewer with the FDA.
Medpace with a team of industry physicians, Dr. Jonathan Issacsohn and Dr. Evan Stein completed many early studies while at Medpace and Medpace Reference Laboratories on the use of statin therapies for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.[6] Another Medpace physician, Dr. David Orloff is regarded as an industry opinion leader in the study of metabolic diseases - most specifically diabetes and obesity.[7] Dr. Troendle was honored for his work as a Medpace founder in 2012 by the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce.[8]
Medpace completed construction on a new campus in 2012 in Madisonville, a village in the city of Cincinnati.[9] This was a project completed in cooperation with Madisonville, the City of Cincinnati Department of Economic Development, and the State of Ohio. The project encompassed revitalizing an urban brownfield site formerly occupied by NuTone, and creating a state of the art LEED certified campus.[10]
Recognition[edit]
In May 2009, Medpace was recognized by CenterWatch, a CRO industry publication as a top CRO by investigative sites.[11]
In 2011 and 2012 Medpace was given the Eagle Award, an industry award by investigative sites for criteria including professionalism, partnership, efficiencies and financial considerations[11]

History[edit]
Medpace was founded in 1992 in Cincinnati, Ohio as Medical Research Services by Dr. August Troendle with several partners. Dr. Troendle first became interested in the CRO sector after working in both the regulatory and pharmaceutical area. He began his career specializing in the development of lipid lowering therapies to treat high cholesterol as a reviewer with the FDA.
Medpace with a team of industry physicians, Dr. Jonathan Issacsohn and Dr. Evan Stein completed many early studies while at Medpace and Medpace Reference Laboratories on the use of statin therapies for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.[6] Another Medpace physician, Dr. David Orloff is regarded as an industry opinion leader in the study of metabolic diseases - most specifically diabetes and obesity.[7] Dr. Troendle was honored for his work as a Medpace founder in 2012 by the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce.[8]
Medpace completed construction on a new campus in 2012 in Madisonville, a village in the city of Cincinnati.[9] This was a project completed in cooperation with Madisonville, the City of Cincinnati Department of Economic Development, and the State of Ohio. The project encompassed revitalizing an urban brownfield site formerly occupied by NuTone, and creating a state of the art LEED certified campus.[10]
Recognition[edit]
In May 2009, Medpace was recognized by CenterWatch, a CRO industry publication as a top CRO by investigative sites.[11]
In 2011 and 2012 Medpace was given the Eagle Award, an industry award by investigative sites for criteria including professionalism, partnership, efficiencies and financial considerations[11]
