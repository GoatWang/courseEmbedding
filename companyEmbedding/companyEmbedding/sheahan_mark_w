UK pack innovator Mark Sheahan set to make fortune 
























Packaging News:

By Des  
King






UK pack innovator set to 
		make fortune 





A UK 
		packaging inventor could make millions of pounds in royalties after 
		signing an exclusive licensing arrangement with a leading but 
		undisclosed Japanese packaging manufacturer.


Mark 
		Sheahan, based in Brockley,  
South 
		London, confirmed the deal on 24 January after 18 months of negotiations 
		over his patented Squeezeopen easy-open and closure plastics technology 
		(see box).


The 
		deal includes a  
large 
		signing fee for Sheahan�s firm, Compgen  
Ltd. 
		With many 

        possible applications identified within the cosmetics and toiletries, 
		healthcare and food sectors, royalty earnings could run to millions of 
		pounds when products are eventually rolled out. 
        
        Meanwhile, US-based Silgan Corporation has renewed its own five-year old 
         
        
        non-exclusive 
        licensing agreement across  

        many
        different application markets.



        However, the system is still to breakthrough  

        big 

        in the UK.



        Sheahan, listed at number 49 in last year�s Packaging News Power 
		50 (Packaging News), has spent years and more than �lm 
		in the UK largely without success in trying to convince the domestic 
		packaging industry and brand owners of the potential of his closure.  
		This is despite the fact that he has picked up more than 30 top-line 
		awards worldwide.


Sheahan 
		said: �When it comes to innovation, UK manufacturers might talk a good 
		talk but either they�re nervous about taking a new step to achieve 
		differentiation or else prone to a �not invented here� mentality.

		 In the latter case, that�s proving rather ironic as things are turning 
		out'�

         








        The patented
        Squeezeopen, first conceived to aid easier pack opening and closure 
		among the manually impaired, comprises of a lid that snap-fits onto the 
		base of any container, with only a light one- handed squeeze on the side 
		of the lid needed to open the pack. The only Squeezeopen packaging 
		applications made in the UK so far have been for the South African 
		�SquidgeMe� aroma dough retail product, and for a range of promotional 
		items  

        with
        the British Library.

        & Rubber Weekly:

Compgen
        Ltd managing director Mark Sheahan was crowned 'Innovator of the Year'  at
        the London Innovation Awards.  The
        company's  Squeezeopen� 
  PET/PP 
        packaging closure also won the Visteon sponsored Award for Manufacturing 
        Innovation and the 'Premier Award for Innovation'.  The closure was 
        designed to make opening containers easy and help prevent some of the 67,000 
        packaging related accidents a year that require hospital treatment.

Page two: 
        
''In the rapidly growing plastics packaging sector,
        it is refreshing to see a new and innovative design spring open in the
        marketplace.  Mark Sheahan of Compgen Ltd has invented a container
        that is opened by squeezing the lid, which in turn pops off with little
        effort.  Still in sample format, the containers are aimed at most
        markets, from shoe creams to snack food. 
        Compgen's easy open closure, manufactured in PP and PET but
        available in a range of materials, is pleasingly tactile - which may
        have contributed to its winning the 'Best  Innovation' award at the
        PackAge Business Convention at the NEC''

Publisher's Description▼▲
A simple prayer can be an act of physical, spiritual, and emotional healing for everyone involved. Healing Prayer on Holy Ground conveys a message of hope in the presence of a loving God who longs to hear from us. Readers will be encouraged as you read Dr. Sheehans transformative story and the experiences of his patients, including example after example of the powerful presence of God inside the rooms of dying patients. This is a hopeful, helpful resource for doctors and patients seeking a biblical interpretation of experiences with the afterlife and for those desiring to better understand the balance between medical and spiritual healing.
