Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

This article is missing information about 12 year gap from 1984-1996. Please expand the article to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page. (May 2014)


CCMP has been known by several names over the past two decades, founded as Chemical Venture Partners in 1984, to serve as the private equity and venture capital arm of Chemical Bank.
Following Chemical's acquisition of Chase Manhattan Bank in 1996, Chemical adopted the Chase name and Chemical Venture Partners changed its name to Chase Capital Partners. Similarly, following the 2000 acquisition of J.P. Morgan & Co. and the formation of JPMorgan Chase, the group changed its name yet again to JP Morgan Partners. Over this time, the platform grew through its integration of the private equity organizations of Manufacturers Hanover, Chase Manhattan, Hambrecht & Quist, Robert Fleming & Co., The Beacon Group and J.P. Morgan & Co.

JPMorgan Partners Logo (2000-2006)


In 2004, JPMorgan Chase completed its acquisition of Bank One which had its own in house private equity investment group, One Equity Partners.[3] One Equity, led by Dick Cashin was ultimately designated as the lead private equity platform for JPMorgan Chase at which point JP Morgan Partners formalized plans to spin out of JPMorgan Chase.[4]
JP Morgan Partners announced the spinout in March 2005 and completed the separation from JPMorgan Chase effective July 31, 2006.[5] The new firm adopted the CCMP acronym in reference to its predecessor entities (i.e., Chemical and Chase and JP Morgan Partners). In April 2006, JPMorgan Chase completed the sale of a $925 million interest in JP Morgan Partners Global Fund to a consortium of secondary investors.[6]
The spinout of CCMP came at the same time as the spinouts of private equity groups from other leading investment banks including: Morgan Stanley (Metalmark Capital), Citigroup (Court Square Capital Partners), Deutsche Bank (MidOcean Partners) and Credit Suisse First Boston (Avista Capital Partners, Diamond Castle Holdings).
In 2007, CCMP completed fundraising for its most recent fund, closing on $3.4 billion in commitments from institutional investors for CCMP Capital Investors II. CCMP Capital Investors II, represented the first fund raised by the CCMP team subsequent to its split from JPMorgan Chase and came in slightly below the original $3.5 billion target that CCMP set for the fundraising.
In February 2014, CCMP sold the pharmaceutical contract research organisation Medpace to Cinven for around $900 million.[7]
In August 2016, CCMP Capital Advisors acquired Badger Sportswear, a Statesville, N.C.-based maker of team uniforms, performance athletic wear and fanwear.[8]
Panorama Capital[edit]
Prior to its spin out from JPMorgan Chase in 2006, JP Morgan Partners made investments in leveraged buyout, growth capital and venture capital transactions. Following the spinout, the investment professionals focused on venture capital transactions separated from the CCMP Capital team to form a new firm, Panorama Capital.
Based in Menlo Park, California, Panorama continues to focus on early and expansion-stage opportunities in both the information technology and life sciences sectors. Panorama began raising its first independent fund in October 2005, with a target size of $500 million. After more than a year of fundraising, Panorama closed on approximately $240 million of investor commitments.[9][10]
Unitas Capital[edit]
In December 2008, CCMP Capital Asia, which had operated increasingly autonomously of the US and European teams, completed a formal separation from CCMP Capital, changing its name to Unitas Capital. CCMP Capital Asia, which operated separate private equity investment funds had co-invested in several transactions alongside the global funds.[11]
Linzor Capital[edit]
Among the other notable spinouts from CCMP's predecessor, JPMorgan Partners was Linzor Capital Partners. Linzor, which focuses on private equity investments in Latin America, was founded in 2006 by Tim Purcell, Alfredo Irigoin and Carlos Ingham.[12] In 2000, Tim Purcell and Alfredo Irigoin had founded J.P. Morgan Partners Latin America a leading investor in private equity transactions in Latin America. Prior to the merger of J.P. Morgan and Chase in 2000, Purcell had been responsible for J.P. Morgan Capital’s Latin American private equity portfolio from the mid-1990s.[13][14]

CCMP has been known by several names over the past two decades, founded as Chemical Venture Partners in 1984, to serve as the private equity and venture capital arm of Chemical Bank.
Following Chemical's acquisition of Chase Manhattan Bank in 1996, Chemical adopted the Chase name and Chemical Venture Partners changed its name to Chase Capital Partners. Similarly, following the 2000 acquisition of J.P. Morgan & Co. and the formation of JPMorgan Chase, the group changed its name yet again to JP Morgan Partners. Over this time, the platform grew through its integration of the private equity organizations of Manufacturers Hanover, Chase Manhattan, Hambrecht & Quist, Robert Fleming & Co., The Beacon Group and J.P. Morgan & Co.

JPMorgan Partners Logo (2000-2006)


In 2004, JPMorgan Chase completed its acquisition of Bank One which had its own in house private equity investment group, One Equity Partners.[3] One Equity, led by Dick Cashin was ultimately designated as the lead private equity platform for JPMorgan Chase at which point JP Morgan Partners formalized plans to spin out of JPMorgan Chase.[4]
JP Morgan Partners announced the spinout in March 2005 and completed the separation from JPMorgan Chase effective July 31, 2006.[5] The new firm adopted the CCMP acronym in reference to its predecessor entities (i.e., Chemical and Chase and JP Morgan Partners). In April 2006, JPMorgan Chase completed the sale of a $925 million interest in JP Morgan Partners Global Fund to a consortium of secondary investors.[6]
The spinout of CCMP came at the same time as the spinouts of private equity groups from other leading investment banks including: Morgan Stanley (Metalmark Capital), Citigroup (Court Square Capital Partners), Deutsche Bank (MidOcean Partners) and Credit Suisse First Boston (Avista Capital Partners, Diamond Castle Holdings).
In 2007, CCMP completed fundraising for its most recent fund, closing on $3.4 billion in commitments from institutional investors for CCMP Capital Investors II. CCMP Capital Investors II, represented the first fund raised by the CCMP team subsequent to its split from JPMorgan Chase and came in slightly below the original $3.5 billion target that CCMP set for the fundraising.
In February 2014, CCMP sold the pharmaceutical contract research organisation Medpace to Cinven for around $900 million.[7]
In August 2016, CCMP Capital Advisors acquired Badger Sportswear, a Statesville, N.C.-based maker of team uniforms, performance athletic wear and fanwear.[8]
Panorama Capital[edit]
Prior to its spin out from JPMorgan Chase in 2006, JP Morgan Partners made investments in leveraged buyout, growth capital and venture capital transactions. Following the spinout, the investment professionals focused on venture capital transactions separated from the CCMP Capital team to form a new firm, Panorama Capital.
Based in Menlo Park, California, Panorama continues to focus on early and expansion-stage opportunities in both the information technology and life sciences sectors. Panorama began raising its first independent fund in October 2005, with a target size of $500 million. After more than a year of fundraising, Panorama closed on approximately $240 million of investor commitments.[9][10]
Unitas Capital[edit]
In December 2008, CCMP Capital Asia, which had operated increasingly autonomously of the US and European teams, completed a formal separation from CCMP Capital, changing its name to Unitas Capital. CCMP Capital Asia, which operated separate private equity investment funds had co-invested in several transactions alongside the global funds.[11]
Linzor Capital[edit]
Among the other notable spinouts from CCMP's predecessor, JPMorgan Partners was Linzor Capital Partners. Linzor, which focuses on private equity investments in Latin America, was founded in 2006 by Tim Purcell, Alfredo Irigoin and Carlos Ingham.[12] In 2000, Tim Purcell and Alfredo Irigoin had founded J.P. Morgan Partners Latin America a leading investor in private equity transactions in Latin America. Prior to the merger of J.P. Morgan and Chase in 2000, Purcell had been responsible for J.P. Morgan Capital’s Latin American private equity portfolio from the mid-1990s.[13][14]
Investments[edit]
CCMP manages both the JP Morgan Partners Global Fund and CCMP Capital Investors II. Among CCMP's investments are the following portfolio companies:

1-800-Flowers[15]
AMC Entertainment
Aramark[16]
Berry Plastics[17]

CEO Corner
“We are excited to partner with CCMP, a group I have known for over 20 years and partnered with in two prior investments.  I believe their extensive experience and expertise will add lasting value to PQ.”
Mike Boyce, Chairman





PQ Corporation








   

CEO Corner
“I’ve been working with the CCMP team since 2007.  I can’t stress enough the value of CCMP’s dual model of having partners with both operating and financial backgrounds.  Collaborating with partners who have also been CEOs is invaluable, and clearly, their financial expertise is critical especially in the case of an IPO.”
Jim Gentilcore, CEO PQ & Former CEO Edwards



Edwards Group


PQ Corporation








 

CEO Corner
“Infogroup’s core values of trust, transparency and tenacity are embodied in our partnership with CCMP.  While all of these core values are important, trust is the one that has most enabled our partnership; decisions are made fast and efficiently and CCMP trusts me and my team to recommend the best path forward without second-guessing.”
Mike Iaccarino, Chairman & CEO





Infogroup








 

CEO Corner
“Our relationship and experience with CCMP has been nothing short of sensational.  The expertise and professionalism provided to us as we became a public company was priceless.   Perhaps even more important, CCMP’s approach from day one was to respect the operation of Ollie’s and personally honor our partnership.  GOOD STUFF.”
Mark Butler, President & CEO





Ollie's Bargain Outlet








 

CEO Corner
“Milacron is the 2nd company I have partnered with CCMP on as CEO, and I can honestly say that they are a game changer in terms of accelerating growth.  With CCMP’s support, Milacron has invested organically and via acquisition to build our base of technology and market reach, leading to top-line growth, an IPO and a bright future.”
Tom Goeke, CEO Milacron & Former CEO Klöckner Pentaplast





Milacron








   

CEO Corner
“Over the 20+ years I have worked with CCMP, first as CEO of Berry Plastics and now as Chairman of Milacron, I have found their ability to collaborate with management to take growth to the next level to be tremendous.  With their operating and financial expertise and deep network of relationships, CCMP adds real value and I feel fortunate to have partnered with them over the years.”
Ira Boots, Chairman Milacron & Former CEO Berry Plastics





Milacron








 

CEO Corner
“As a private equity firm, CCMP brings all the assets you would expect to drive rapid growth and value creation plus the unique ability to do so with a sense of “humanity”.  They value people!  This is not a little thing and in fact I think it is the CCMP difference.  CCMP is a “partner” in the truest sense of the word.”
Stuart Jenkins, President, CEO & Chief Innovation Officer





Shoes for Crews








   

CEO Corner
“CCMP treats management on an equal footing as shareholders, whilst not interfering on day-to-day matters.  Their contribution and connections have added real value to our business, enabling us to become the U.K.’s largest gym operator.”
Peter Roberts, Founder & Executive Chairman





Pure Gym








 

CEO Corner
“Over the last decade, our team has done a tremendous job earning customers’ trust through great products and service. Together we’ve built the market’s largest and most respected player.

This article is missing information about 12 year gap from 1984-1996. Please expand the article to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page. (May 2014)


CCMP has been known by several names over the past two decades, founded as Chemical Venture Partners in 1984, to serve as the private equity and venture capital arm of Chemical Bank.
Following Chemical's acquisition of Chase Manhattan Bank in 1996, Chemical adopted the Chase name and Chemical Venture Partners changed its name to Chase Capital Partners. Similarly, following the 2000 acquisition of J.P. Morgan & Co. and the formation of JPMorgan Chase, the group changed its name yet again to JP Morgan Partners. Over this time, the platform grew through its integration of the private equity organizations of Manufacturers Hanover, Chase Manhattan, Hambrecht & Quist, Robert Fleming & Co., The Beacon Group and J.P. Morgan & Co.

JPMorgan Partners Logo (2000-2006)


In 2004, JPMorgan Chase completed its acquisition of Bank One which had its own in house private equity investment group, One Equity Partners.[3] One Equity, led by Dick Cashin was ultimately designated as the lead private equity platform for JPMorgan Chase at which point JP Morgan Partners formalized plans to spin out of JPMorgan Chase.[4]
JP Morgan Partners announced the spinout in March 2005 and completed the separation from JPMorgan Chase effective July 31, 2006.[5] The new firm adopted the CCMP acronym in reference to its predecessor entities (i.e., Chemical and Chase and JP Morgan Partners). In April 2006, JPMorgan Chase completed the sale of a $925 million interest in JP Morgan Partners Global Fund to a consortium of secondary investors.[6]
The spinout of CCMP came at the same time as the spinouts of private equity groups from other leading investment banks including: Morgan Stanley (Metalmark Capital), Citigroup (Court Square Capital Partners), Deutsche Bank (MidOcean Partners) and Credit Suisse First Boston (Avista Capital Partners, Diamond Castle Holdings).
In 2007, CCMP completed fundraising for its most recent fund, closing on $3.4 billion in commitments from institutional investors for CCMP Capital Investors II. CCMP Capital Investors II, represented the first fund raised by the CCMP team subsequent to its split from JPMorgan Chase and came in slightly below the original $3.5 billion target that CCMP set for the fundraising.
In February 2014, CCMP sold the pharmaceutical contract research organisation Medpace to Cinven for around $900 million.[7]
In August 2016, CCMP Capital Advisors acquired Badger Sportswear, a Statesville, N.C.-based maker of team uniforms, performance athletic wear and fanwear.[8]
Panorama Capital[edit]
Prior to its spin out from JPMorgan Chase in 2006, JP Morgan Partners made investments in leveraged buyout, growth capital and venture capital transactions. Following the spinout, the investment professionals focused on venture capital transactions separated from the CCMP Capital team to form a new firm, Panorama Capital.
Based in Menlo Park, California, Panorama continues to focus on early and expansion-stage opportunities in both the information technology and life sciences sectors. Panorama began raising its first independent fund in October 2005, with a target size of $500 million. After more than a year of fundraising, Panorama closed on approximately $240 million of investor commitments.[9][10]
Unitas Capital[edit]
In December 2008, CCMP Capital Asia, which had operated increasingly autonomously of the US and European teams, completed a formal separation from CCMP Capital, changing its name to Unitas Capital. CCMP Capital Asia, which operated separate private equity investment funds had co-invested in several transactions alongside the global funds.[11]
Linzor Capital[edit]
Among the other notable spinouts from CCMP's predecessor, JPMorgan Partners was Linzor Capital Partners. Linzor, which focuses on private equity investments in Latin America, was founded in 2006 by Tim Purcell, Alfredo Irigoin and Carlos Ingham.[12] In 2000, Tim Purcell and Alfredo Irigoin had founded J.P. Morgan Partners Latin America a leading investor in private equity transactions in Latin America. Prior to the merger of J.P. Morgan and Chase in 2000, Purcell had been responsible for J.P. Morgan Capital’s Latin American private equity portfolio from the mid-1990s.[13][14]

CCMP has been known by several names over the past two decades, founded as Chemical Venture Partners in 1984, to serve as the private equity and venture capital arm of Chemical Bank.
Following Chemical's acquisition of Chase Manhattan Bank in 1996, Chemical adopted the Chase name and Chemical Venture Partners changed its name to Chase Capital Partners. Similarly, following the 2000 acquisition of J.P. Morgan & Co. and the formation of JPMorgan Chase, the group changed its name yet again to JP Morgan Partners. Over this time, the platform grew through its integration of the private equity organizations of Manufacturers Hanover, Chase Manhattan, Hambrecht & Quist, Robert Fleming & Co., The Beacon Group and J.P. Morgan & Co.

In 2004, JPMorgan Chase completed its acquisition of Bank One which had its own in house private equity investment group, One Equity Partners.[3] One Equity, led by Dick Cashin was ultimately designated as the lead private equity platform for JPMorgan Chase at which point JP Morgan Partners formalized plans to spin out of JPMorgan Chase.[4]
JP Morgan Partners announced the spinout in March 2005 and completed the separation from JPMorgan Chase effective July 31, 2006.[5] The new firm adopted the CCMP acronym in reference to its predecessor entities (i.e., Chemical and Chase and JP Morgan Partners). In April 2006, JPMorgan Chase completed the sale of a $925 million interest in JP Morgan Partners Global Fund to a consortium of secondary investors.[6]
The spinout of CCMP came at the same time as the spinouts of private equity groups from other leading investment banks including: Morgan Stanley (Metalmark Capital), Citigroup (Court Square Capital Partners), Deutsche Bank (MidOcean Partners) and Credit Suisse First Boston (Avista Capital Partners, Diamond Castle Holdings).
In 2007, CCMP completed fundraising for its most recent fund, closing on $3.4 billion in commitments from institutional investors for CCMP Capital Investors II. CCMP Capital Investors II, represented the first fund raised by the CCMP team subsequent to its split from JPMorgan Chase and came in slightly below the original $3.5 billion target that CCMP set for the fundraising.
In February 2014, CCMP sold the pharmaceutical contract research organisation Medpace to Cinven for around $900 million.[7]
In August 2016, CCMP Capital Advisors acquired Badger Sportswear, a Statesville, N.C.-based maker of team uniforms, performance athletic wear and fanwear.[8]
Panorama Capital[edit]
Prior to its spin out from JPMorgan Chase in 2006, JP Morgan Partners made investments in leveraged buyout, growth capital and venture capital transactions. Following the spinout, the investment professionals focused on venture capital transactions separated from the CCMP Capital team to form a new firm, Panorama Capital.
Based in Menlo Park, California, Panorama continues to focus on early and expansion-stage opportunities in both the information technology and life sciences sectors. Panorama began raising its first independent fund in October 2005, with a target size of $500 million. After more than a year of fundraising, Panorama closed on approximately $240 million of investor commitments.[9][10]
Unitas Capital[edit]
In December 2008, CCMP Capital Asia, which had operated increasingly autonomously of the US and European teams, completed a formal separation from CCMP Capital, changing its name to Unitas Capital. CCMP Capital Asia, which operated separate private equity investment funds had co-invested in several transactions alongside the global funds.[11]
Linzor Capital[edit]
Among the other notable spinouts from CCMP's predecessor, JPMorgan Partners was Linzor Capital Partners. Linzor, which focuses on private equity investments in Latin America, was founded in 2006 by Tim Purcell, Alfredo Irigoin and Carlos Ingham.[12] In 2000, Tim Purcell and Alfredo Irigoin had founded J.P. Morgan Partners Latin America a leading investor in private equity transactions in Latin America. Prior to the merger of J.P. Morgan and Chase in 2000, Purcell had been responsible for J.P. Morgan Capital’s Latin American private equity portfolio from the mid-1990s.[13][14]

Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
