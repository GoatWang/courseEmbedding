Jacobs Appoints Robert V. Pragada as President, Industrial Line of 
      Business






February 01, 2016 07:45 AM Eastern Standard Time



PASADENA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jacobs 
      Engineering Group Inc. (NYSE:JEC) announced today the appointment of 
      Robert V. Pragada as President for its Industrial Line of Business 
      (LOB), effective immediately. In addition, to take advantage of 
      Pragada’s broad experience in construction, Jacobs’ Field Services unit 
      will move under his leadership responsibility.
    

      Pragada is based in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania and reports directly to 
      Jacobs’ President and CEO Steve Demetriou. He replaces Andrew Kremer, 
      who has moved to an Executive Advisor role providing leadership to 
      several priority initiatives for the company.
    

      Pragada returns to Jacobs after serving as President and Chief Executive 
      Officer of The Brock Group since August 2014. While previously with 
      Jacobs, he held a number of senior management positions, including 
      Senior Vice President, Global Sales; Group Vice President, Northern 
      Region; and Vice President, Field Services.
    

      After graduating from the United States Naval Academy, Pragada began his 
      career in the Navy as a Civil Engineer Corps and Seabees officer, 
      providing base construction and maintenance services and international 
      contingency operations, rising to the rank of Lieutenant Commander. 
      Pragada also earned a Master of Science in Engineering and Management 
      from Stanford University.
    

      Commenting on the appointment, Demetriou said, “We are delighted to 
      welcome Bob back to Jacobs. He brings a strong reputation as a leader 
      and a demonstrated track record for driving successful results across 
      both Sales and Operations. I’m confident this appointment will leverage 
      Bob’s tremendous talents as he works closely with the rest of our 
      executive leadership team in steering the company’s continued success.”
    

      Jacobs is one of the world's largest and most diverse providers of 
      technical, professional and construction services.

Pragada
Robert V. Pragada has joined The Brock Group, Houston, one of the largest U.S. industrial services subcontractors, as president and CEO. In those roles he succeeds Jeff Davis, who continues as chairman. Pragada had been senior vice president of global sales at Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. and also served as chief operating officer at Kinetics, an industrial-process design-build firm. Davis was named CEO in 2008. Brock Group ranks at No. 6 on ENR's list of the Top 600 Specialty Contractors, with $1.34 billion in 2012 revenue, about 88% in industrial services.
Burns & McDonnell, the Kansas City engineering firm, has named Mike Brown president of its newly created international company. He was corporate vice president of global facilities. The firm will focus on infrastructure work, including in U.S. government markets. It now has offices in Doha, Qatar; Mumbai, India; and Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Brown told The Kansas City Business Journal that about 15% to 20% of firm revenue is non-U.S., with plans to double that amount in five years. Burns & McDonnell ranks at No. 18 on ENR's list of the Top 500 Design Firms, with $1 billion in 2013 revenue.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
