Optimizing new product features





Understanding buyer perceptionsA multinational computer technology company had lost competitive groundChallengeThe growth of the client’s enterprise server business had slowed considerably and they had little insight as to why they were losing market share. To gain competitive ground, the client needed to examine how to be more effective in retaining existing customers and enriching those relationships.
SolutionForrester designed a survey to uncover whether the experience of the salesperson played a role in the purchase decision or if it was solely based on the merits of the equipment, cost, or other product attributes.ResultA better informed growth strategy based on the mindset and perceptions of the client’s buyer.
Customer-Centric PackagingHear how data analyst Anjali Lai helped a mobility manufacturer build effective “customer-centric” service packages based on loyalty, satisfaction, and overall experience. (1:90)

Call center performanceA leading life insurance company invested in improvements to their call center to achieve a competitive advantageChallengeAs competitive advantage relies on increasingly positive customer interactions, the client wanted to revisit past call center performance work with Forrester to guide their current CX initiatives.SolutionForrester surveyed customers in a study that incorporated the CX Index framework and provided scores, drivers, and potential growth impact of improved call center scores.ResultA comprehensive analysis and call center benchmark study that improved upon past success and moved the client’s CX forward.Product feature optimization


“When my company wanted to launch a new service, we asked Forrester for guidance. They designed and delivered a custom conjoint analysis study that educated us on the expected price, speed, basic and advanced features our consumers expected. We then took that information and used it to build a service that we’re confident our customers will want to buy.”
— Marketing Manager, Telecommunications Provider

The company's infrastructure group handles security and data warehousing, while the applications group is in charge of project management, web development, and (enterprise resource planning) ERP applications. A third group is in charge of human resources IT, which includes the human resources information systems.
