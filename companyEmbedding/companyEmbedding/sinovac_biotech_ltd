Devel





Posted June 26th, 2017 for Sinovac Biotech 






Printer-friendly version
 BEIJING, June 26, 2017 / / -- Sinovac Biotech Ltd. (NASDAQ: SVA) (“Sinovac” or the “Company”), a leading provider of biopharmaceutical products in China, today announced that it has entered into a definitive amalgamation agreement (the “Amalgamation Agreement”) with Sinovac (Cayman) Limited (“Parent”) and Sinovac Amalgamation Sub Limited (“Amalgamation Sub”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, pursuant to which Sinovac will be acquired by Parent in a transaction valued at approximately US$401.8 million.
 
Pursuant to the Amalgamation Agreement, Parent will acquire the Company for cash consideration equal to US$7.00 per common share of the Company (each, a “Share”).  This represents a premium of 32.1% and 30%, respectively, over the Company’s 30- and 60-trading day volume-weighted average price as quoted by NASDAQ prior to the Company’s announcement on February 1, 2016 that it had received a non-binding “going-private” proposal from Mr. Weidong Yin, the chairman, president and chief executive officer of the Company, and SAIF Partners IV L.P. (“SAIF”) and/or its affiliates to acquire all of the outstanding Shares not already owned by them.
 
The consideration to be paid to holders of Shares pursuant to the Amalgamation Agreement also represents an increase of approximately 13.3% from the original US$6.18 per Share offer price in the “going-private” proposal announced on February 1, 2016.
 
Immediately following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Amalgamation Agreement, Parent will be beneficially owned by a consortium (the “Buyer Consortium”) comprising Mr. Yin, SAIF, C-Bridge Healthcare Fund II, L.P. (“C-Bridge Capital”), Advantech Capital L.P. (“Advantech Capital”), Vivo Capital Fund VIII, L.P. and Vivo Capital Surplus Fund VIII, L.P. (together with Vivo Capital Fund VIII, L.P., “Vivo Capital”).  As of June 23, 2017, the members of the Buyer Consortium beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 29.5% of the issued and outstanding Shares.
 
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Amalgamation Agreement, at the effective time of the amalgamation, Amalgamation Sub will be amalgamated with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Amalgamation”), and each of the Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Amalgamation will be canceled in consideration for the right to receive US$7.00 per Share in cash, without interest and net of any applicable withholding taxes, except for (i) 6,049,500 Shares held by Mr. Yin and 10,780,820 Shares held by SAIF (collectively, the “Rollover Shareholders”), (ii) Shares held by Parent, Parent’s affiliates, the Company or any of the Company’s subsidiaries, which Shares, in each case, will be canceled without payment of any consideration or distribution therefor and (iii) Shares owned by holders who have validly exercised and not effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to dissent from the Amalgamation in accordance with the provisions of Section 191 of the International Business Corporations Act, CAP. 222 of the Revised Laws of Antigua and Barbuda (as consolidated and revised) (the “IBCA”), which Shares will be canceled at the effective time of the Amalgamation for the right to receive the fair value of such Shares determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 191(4) or Section 195(2) of the IBCA, as applicable.
 
The Buyer Consortium intends to fund the Amalgamation through a combination of cash contributions from C-Bridge Capital, Advantech Capital and Vivo Capitalor their respective affiliates pursuant to equity commitment letters.
 
The Company’s board of directors, acting upon the unanimous recommendation of the special committee formed by the board of directors (the “Special Committee”), unanimously approved the Amalgamation Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Amalgamation Agreement, including the Amalgamation, and resolved to recommend that the Company’s shareholders authorize and approve the Amalgamation Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Amalgamation Agreement, including the Amalgamation.  The Special Committee, which is composed solely of independent directors of the Company who are unaffiliated with Parent, Amalgamation Sub or any member of the Buyer Consortium or management of the Company, exclusively negotiated the terms of the Amalgamation Agreement with the Buyer Consortium with the assistance of its independent financial and legal advisors.
 
The Amalgamation, which is currently expected to close during the second half of 2017, is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by an affirmative vote of holders of Shares representing at least two-thirds of the Shares present and voting in person or by proxy as a single class at a meeting of the Company’s shareholders, which will be convened to consider the authorization and approval of the Amalgamation Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Amalgamation Agreement, including the Amalgamation, and the other closing conditions specified in the Amalgamation Agreement.  As of June 23, 2017, the Rollover Shareholders beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 29.5% of the issued and outstanding Shares.  Pursuant to a support agreement among the Rollover Shareholders, Parent and Sinovac Holding (Cayman) Limited, the sole shareholder of Parent, the Rollover Shareholders have agreed to vote all their Shares in favor of the authorization and approval of the Amalgamation Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Amalgamation Agreement, including the Amalgamation.  If completed, the Amalgamation will result in the Company becoming a privately-held Company and the Shares will no longer be listed on NASDAQ.
 
Duff & Phelps LLC is serving as financial advisor to the Special Committee.  Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP is serving as U.S. legal counsel to the Special Committee, Leslie-Ann Brissett Legal Services is serving as Antigua and Barbuda legal counsel to the Special Committee and Haiwen & Partners is serving as PRC legal counsel to the Special Committee.
 
Latham & Watkins LLP is serving as U.S. legal counsel to the Company and Delaney Law is serving as Antigua and Barbuda legal counsel to the Company.
 
Lazard is serving as financial advisor to the Buyer Consortium.  Kirkland & Ellis is serving as U.S. legal counsel to Mr. Yin and the Buyer Consortium and Roberts & Co is serving as Antigua and Barbuda legal counsel to the Buyer Consortium.  Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP is serving as U.S. legal counsel to C-Bridge Capital and Advantech Capital.  Ropes & Gray LLP is serving as U.S. legal counsel to Vivo Capital.

Glancy 
      Prongay & Murray LLP (“GPM”) reminds investors of the September 
      1, 2017 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action 
      filed on behalf of investors who purchased Sinovac Biotech Ltd. 
      (“Sinovac” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: SVA) 
      securities between April 30, 2013 to May 16, 2017, inclusive (the 
      “Class Period”). Sinovac investors have until September 1, 2017 to 
      file a lead plaintiff motion in this class action. To obtain information 
      or participate in the class action, please visit the Sinovac page on our 
      website at http://www.glancylaw.com/case/sinovac-biotech-ltd.
    

      Sinovac is a Chinese biopharmaceutical company that engages in the 
      research, development, manufacture and commercialization of vaccines 
      against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, seasonal influenza, H5N1 and H1N1 
      pandemic influenza, and mumps.
    

      On December 21, 2016, a report was published on SeekingAlpha.com claiming 
      that Sinovac’s Chairman and CEO, Weidong Ying, bribed a member of the 
      Chinese Food and Drug Administration in connection with its vaccine 
      clinical trial and approval.
    

      On this news, the Company’s share price declined, thereby injuring 
      investors.
    

      Then, on May 16, 2017, the Company issued a press release disclosing 
      that the SEC notified the Company of an enforcement inquiry related to 
      the matters discussed in the SeekingAlpha.com report, and that 
      the SEC issued a subpoena requesting documents related to the Company’s 
      internal investigation into the matter. On this news, the Company’s 
      share price fell 4.6% on May 17, 2017, thereby injuring investors.
    

      The Complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the 
      Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading 
      statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Defendant Weidong Yin, 
      Sinovac’s Chairman and CEO, bribed a member of the Chinese Food and Drug 
      Administration to assist Sinovac’s vaccine clinical trial and approval; 
      (2) such conduct would subject Sinovac to heightened regulatory 
      scrutiny; and (3) as a result, Sinovac’s public statements were 
      materially false and misleading at all relevant times.
    

      Follow us for updates on Twitter: twitter.com/GPM_LLP.
    

      If you purchased shares of Sinovac during the Class Period you may move 
      the Court no later than September 1, 2017, to request 
      appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit. To 
      be a member of the class action you need not take any action at this 
      time; you may retain counsel of your choice or take no action and remain 
      an absent member of the class action. If you wish to learn more about 
      this class action, or if you have any questions concerning this 
      announcement or your rights or interests with respect to the pending 
      class action lawsuit, please contact Lesley Portnoy, Esquire, of GPM, 
      1925 Century Park East, Suite 2100, Los Angeles, California 90067 at 
      310-201-9150, Toll-Free at 888-773-9224, by email to shareholders@glancylaw.com, 
      or visit our website at www.glancylaw.com. 
      If you inquire by email please include your mailing address, telephone 
      number and number of shares purchased.
    

      This press release may be considered Attorney Advertising in some 
      jurisdictions under the applicable law and ethical rules.

BEIJING, Oct. 19, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Sinovac Biotech Ltd. (NASDAQ:   SVA), a leading provider of biopharmaceutical products in China, today provided an update on the Company's pipeline vaccines.








Sabin-inactivated polio vaccine (sIPV) -- The Company initiated the phase I clinical trial in October 2016. The phase I trial is designed to assess the safety and tolerance of the vaccine candidates. Subjects include adults aged 18-49 years old, young children aged 6-12 years old, and infants aged two months old for a total of 108 volunteers. The phase II trial is expected to be launched after the preliminary results of phase I trials are available. For Phase II, 600 infants (aged two months old) are expected to be enrolled to select the objective dosage and assess immunogenicity with a blinded, randomized and controlled design. The phase II clinical trial is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2017. The phase III clinical trial is expected to assess the immunogenicity and safety with the vaccine candidate of the selected dosage from the phase II trial. Sinovac originally obtained approval for sIPV clinical trials in December 2015.
Varicella vaccine -- The Company completed the phase I clinical trial in Henan Province with results showing that the varicella vaccine candidate has a good safety profile. In the third quarter of 2016, the Company initiated the phase III clinical trial, which measures efficacy and immunogenicity with a randomized, double-blind, parallel-treatment, placebo-controlled study in addition to safety. Over 6,000 subjects aged from one to twelve years old have been enrolled as volunteers for the phase III clinical trial. Sinovac obtained approval to commence human clinical trials in 2015.
Mr. Weidong Yin, Chairman, President and CEO of Sinovac commented, "We are pleased to provide an update on the advancement of our vaccine pipeline, which underscores our strong R&D capabilities and future growth prospects. As we progress closer towards development and commercialization, our varicella vaccine and sIPV are expected to contribute to our domestic and overseas expansion efforts. With our existing commercial vaccines as well as the advancement of our pipeline products, we are confident Sinovac will continue to expand its vaccine portfolio and overall market position."

					Full Description



Sinovac Biotech Ltd. (Sinovac), incorporated on March 1, 1999, is a holding company. The Company is a biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of vaccines that protect against human infectious diseases, including hepatitis A, hepatitis B, seasonal influenza, Haemagglutinase5 Neuraminidase1 (H5N1) and Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic influenza and mumps. The Company's pipeline consists of vaccine candidates in the clinical and pre-clinical development Phases in China. The Company is engaged in the sales, marketing, manufacturing and development of vaccines for infectious disease. The Company is engaged in developing various products, including Healive, Bilive, Anflu, Panflu Whole Viron Pandemic Influenza Vaccine, Split Viron Pandemic Influenza Vaccine, Panflu.1, RabEnd, Mumps Vaccine, Enterovirus 71 (EV71) Vaccine, Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine, Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine, Rubella Vaccine, Varicella Vaccine and Sabin Inactivated Polio Vaccine.The Company's product, Healive, is an inactivated Hepatitis A vaccine. The hepatitis A virus primarily impacts the liver by causing it to swell and preventing it from functioning properly. Healive is available in different doses for use by both adults (approximately one milliliter per dose) and children (approximately 0.5 milliliter per dose). The Company's product, Bilive, is a combination vaccine formulated with purified inactivated hepatitis A virus antigen and recombinant (yeast) hepatitis B surface antigen. Bilive is available in different doses for use in both adults and children. The Bilive vaccination schedule consists of over three doses. The second dose is administered one month after the first dose and the third dose is administered approximately six months after the first dose. Booster vaccinations are recommended approximately five years after the initial immunization.The Company's product, Anflu vaccine, is an inactivated split viron influenza vaccine formulated from approximately three split inactivated viron solutions. The Company sells Anflu in Mexico, Guatemala, Mongolia, Philippines, Tajikistan and Bangladesh. The Company's product, Panflu, is an approved vaccine available in China against the H5N1 influenza virus. The vaccine is approved for supply within China to the Chinese national vaccine stockpiling program. The Company's product, Panflu.1, is an approved vaccine against the influenza A H1N1 virus. The Company was granted a production license for mumps vaccine. The Company's split viron pandemic influenza vaccine has been developed in conjunction with its whole viron pandemic influenza vaccine. This product has been developed to address the needs of young children, who may be more susceptible to adverse reactions to whole viron pandemic influenza vaccine than to a split viron vaccine. The Company was granted the production license of split viron pandemic influenza vaccine that is to be used among the teenagers aged from 12 to 17.
