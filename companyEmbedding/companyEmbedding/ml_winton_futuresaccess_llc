 Managed Future Funds Fees & Expenses Class Action Lawsuit 

 
  

In November 2013, Bloomberg published a startling report about the fees and expenses some fund managers charge investors in “managed-futures” funds.  The conclusion was that in dozens and dozens of managed futures funds, the managers charged fees and expenses that totaled 89% of all the profit of that given fund.
A managed-futures fund  is an alternative investment, which is often defined as an investment other than cash, stocks, or bonds.  Typically these investments are sold to investors through brokers and many large brokerage houses have there own proprietary managed futures investments.  BarcalyHedge estimates that over $331 billion was invested in managed accounts in mid 2013.

SEC reporting requirements 
One difference between managed futures funds and say typical stocks and bonds is that in general managed futures funds are not required to file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The SEC does however require that all managed futures funds with more than 500 investors and more than $10 million in assets file financial reports within 120 days of their fiscal year’s end.  Bloomberg as part of its investigation concluded that there are currently 63 managed-futures funds that fit into this category. The vast majority of managed-futures funds, therefore, have no reporting requirement, as they are not subject to the 500 Investor Rule.

	Bloomberg’s big ciscovery regarding managed futures funds fees and expenses
Bloomberg concluded that managed-futures funds can charge clients 7% to 9% each year of the investment amount in the fund plus 20 percent of the funds’ profits.  (Hedge funds typically only charge a 2% management fee plus 20% of investor profits.)
Bloomberg next concluded that for the period from Jan. 1, 2003 to Dec. 31, 2012, a stunning 89% of the $11.51 billion of gains in these 63 managed-futures funds went to fees, commissions and expenses collected by the fund managers—not to investors. 

	One example: Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Technical L.P.
30,000 people invested approximately $797 million in Morgan Stanley's managed-futures fund called Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Technical L.P. From 2002 through 2012, the fund made approximately $490 million in trading gains and interest income. However, investors ended up losing money because those profits were depleted by over $498 million in commissions, expenses and fees paid to fund managers and Morgan Stanley. Despite the fund's value increase of approximately $490 million, investors ended up losing approximately $8 million over the course of those 10 years. 

	Other managed future funds implicated

Merrill Lynch Managed-Futures Funds
Merrill Lynch Alternative Investments, LLC (MLAI) managed futures funds investment management services consist of acting as sponsor, general partner, manager, investment manager and investment advisor to pooled investment vehicles with portfolios of managed futures funds are marketed and sold to institutional and high-net-worth (HNW) investors through the Merrill Lynch FuturesAccess Platform. The FuturesAccess Platform provides access to MLAI Portfolio Funds or Portfolio Managers in MLAI’s advisory products or services.
Many high-net-worth investors understand very little about managed futures funds. Managed futures funds, touted by Merrill Lynch’s financial advisors, are recommended because the Merrill Lynch FuturesAccess Platform allegedly provides investors with access to an asset classes not readily available through traditional investments vehicles. Merrill Lynch financial advisors recommend the FuturesAccess managed futures funds to generate portfolio returns which they argue provide greater returns on a risk-adjusted basis. The purported low correlation of managed futures fund returns provides superior results for an investment portfolio during “down markets” which smooth portfolio returns over time. High-net-worth investors rely on Merrill Lynch managed futures fund managers as the experts at trading futures contracts. However, these highly misunderstood managed futures funds are laden with excessive fees, costs and commissions which may dramatically impact potential investor’s return on investment.
The Merrill Lynch’s FuturesAccess managed futures funds invest in asset classes that include trading futures contracts in equity indices (i.e. developed and emerging markets), interest rates (i.e. U.S. Bonds, Eurodollar Bonds, Euro-Bund), commodities (i.e. energy, agriculture and metals) and currencies (i.e. Dollar, Euro, Pound, Yen). Through investments in managed futures funds, investors are allegedly able to invest in asset classes that have a low correlation with traditional equity and fixed income securities markets which can result in greater risk-adjusted returns for an investor’s total portfolio.
At issue for investors is the performance of Merrill Lynch’s managed futures funds after the management fees have been deducted from the account. In most instances, the investment advisor is compensated by a flat management fee based on assets under management. Additionally, an “incentive-based” fee is deducted based on profits in “up” years. This “performance-based” fee is usually paid net of all fees. In addition to management and performance fees, a managed futures account has deducted from the balance expenses for transactions costs and commissions. The net result for investors has been the erosion of trading profits from a poorly-explained regime of excessive fees and conflicts of interest designed to enrich Merrill Lynch.
The MLAI FuturesAccess Platform are privately-placed and are sold to institutions and high-net-worth investors. Merrill Lynch Alternative Investments, LLC offers various managed futures funds, including:

ML Systematic Momentum FuturesAccess LLC
Man AHL FuturesAccess LLC
ML Aspect FuturesAccess LLC
ML Winton FuturesAccess LLC
ML BlueTrend FuturesAccess LLC
ML Transtrend DTP Enhanced FuturesAccess LLC

Silver Law Group is currently investigating whether Merrill Lynch Alternative Investments, LLC and the FuturesAccess Platform managed futures funds are in compliance with the securities industry’s rules and regulations concerning the suitability and disclosure requirements related to the risks, fees and terms associated with the management of their managed futures funds. The focus of the investigation includes whether the fees and terms were adequately disclosed to investors for potential FINRA sales practice violations of misrepresentation or omission of material facts, and excessive markups and markdowns, and whether the recommendations made to investors resulted in unsuitable investment advice based on client investment ability to understand and assume the risks associated with managed futures funds.

is made as of June 17, 2014 (the “Amendment”) among ML
WINTON FUTURESACCESS SM
LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company, ML WINTON FUTURESACCESS SM LTD., a
Cayman Islands exempted company (the “Onshore Fund” and
the “Offshore Fund,” respectively, and collectively,
the “Fund”), MERRILL LYNCH ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS LLC,
a Delaware limited liability company (the “Manager”)
and WINTON CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LIMITED (the “Trading
Advisor”).  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined
herein have those meanings set forth in the Agreement.


 


WHEREAS , the Fund, the Manager and the Trading Advisor
entered into an Advisory Agreement dated as of May 26, 2004, as
amended prior to the effective date set forth above (the
“Agreement”); and


 


NOW
THEREFORE , the parties
hereto agree to amend the Agreement as follows, for good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged:


 







1. 




Section 1(a)
shall be replaced in its entirety as follows:






 


“The
Trading Advisor agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with the Fund and the Manager in preparing the Memorandum
and any Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
filings of the Fund made pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”), by separately
providing its current Form ADV to the Manager as filed with the SEC
and made available to the public at www.adviserinfo.sec.gov
, provided that, upon the reasonable request of the Manager, the
Trading Advisor shall also provide, as promptly as may be
reasonably practicable, all other information (if any) regarding
the Trading Advisor, its “principals,” “trading
principals,” and “trading program” (each of the
foregoing as defined in Section 4.10 of the Commodity Regulations)
and “affiliates” (as defined in the Securities Act)
which the Manager reasonably believes to be necessary or advisable
to include in the Memorandum or in any SEC filings made pursuant to
the 1934 Act and hereby consents to the disclosure of any of the
above information in the Memorandum or such
filings.  Notwithstanding the foregoing the Manager may
make non-material changes to such information to conform the format
of such information to the format of the Memorandum and/or to
comply with Commodity Regulations without prior approval of the
Trading Advisor.”


 







2.  




Section 1(d)
shall be replaced in its entirety as follows:






 


“At all
times while any of the Interests continue to be offered, the
Trading Advisor, at its own expense, shall promptly provide the
Fund and the Manager with complete and accurate performance
information (in form and substance consistent with Sections 4.25
and 4.35 of the Commodity Regulations and with the NFA Rules)
reflecting the actual performance of the Winton Diversified Futures
Fund (US) L.P. (“WDFF”) up to the latest practicable
date (consistent with Sections 4.25 and 4.35 of the Commodity
Regulations), together with any

reports or
letters relating to such performance data received from accountants
and in the possession of the Trading Advisor.  The
Trading Advisor shall also provide the Fund and the Manager with
commentary pertaining to the performance of WDFF for each month in
a timely manner and hereby consents to the use of such commentary,
as may be modified by the Manager in any non-material way, in any
reports or marketing materials produced by the Fund or the Manager
and consents to the use of the information provided pursuant to
this Section 1 in any SEC filings made pursuant to the 1934
Act.”



 







3.  




Section 5 shall
replaced in its entirety with the following:






 







 



“
Management Fee .






 


As of the last
Business Day of each calendar month, the Fund shall pay the Trading
Advisor a Management Fee, calculated and payable in U.S. dollars,
equal to:


 







(a)  




0.0833% (a 1.0%
annual rate) of the aggregate gross asset value of the Class F and
Class F-1 Interests of the Onshore Fund (as described in the
Onshore Memorandum, including any supplements thereto);






 







(b)  




0.1041% (a
1.25% annual rate) of the aggregate gross asset value of the Class
G Interests of the Onshore Fund (as described in the Onshore
Memorandum, including any supplements thereto);






 







(c)  




0.125% (a 1.5%
annual rate) of the aggregate gross asset value of the Class DT
Interests (if any) of the Onshore Fund (as described in the Onshore
Memorandum, including any supplements thereto)  (the
“15% Class”);






 







(d)  




0.1667% (a 2%
annual rate) of the aggregate gross asset value of the Class A,
Class C, Class I, Class D, Class DS and Class M Interests of the
Onshore Fund (as described in the Onshore Memorandum, including any
supplements thereto) (together with the Class F, Class F-1 and
Class G Interests, collectively, the “20% Classes”);
and






 







(e)  




0.1667% (a 2%
annual rate) of the aggregate gross asset value of the Offshore
Fund






 


in each case,
for the avoidance of doubt, such aggregate gross asset value being
calculated prior to reduction for any accrued Incentive Fees or for
the Management Fee being calculated.  Such Management Fee
shall be pro rated in the case of partial calendar months,
but shall not be subject to rebate once paid.


 


 


 



 



2





 



 


 


For the
avoidance of doubt, Class F and Class F-1 Interests were initially
offered as of three subscription dates: May 1, 2013; May 16, 2013;
and June 1, 2013.  Following this initial offering
period, only investors who subscribed for Class F or Class F-1
Interests during the initial offering period and continue to hold
such Interests will be permitted to make additional subscriptions
to these Classes as determined by the Manager in its sole
discretion.”


 







4.  




Section 6 shall
be replaced in its entirety as follows:






 


“
Incentive Fee .


 


(a)  
(i)           
Onshore Fund .  The Onshore Fund will pay to the
Trading Advisor, as of December 31, 2013 and thereafter at the end
of each calendar quarter (i.e., the quarters ending on March 31,
June 30, September 30 and December 31) (each an “Incentive
Fee Calculation Date”), an incentive fee equal to 15% of the
Onshore New Trading Profit (defined below) allocated to the 15%
Class and 20% of the Onshore New Trading Profit allocated to the
20% Classes as of such Incentive Fee Calculation Date (as
applicable, the “Onshore Incentive
Fee”).  Onshore Incentive Fees shall be calculated
with respect to the 15% Class on the one hand and the 20% Classes
as a whole on the other hand, irrespective of the performance of
different investor’s Interests in such Classes.


 


(ii)            “Onshore
New Trading Profit” is calculated separately with respect to
the 15% Class and the 20% Classes and equals any increase in the
aggregate net asset value, subject to Section 6(a)(v), of the 15%
Class or the 20% Classes, as applicable, as of the current
Incentive Fee Calculation Date over the Onshore High Water Mark
attributable to the 15% Class or the 20% Classes, as
applicable.


 


(iii)            1.           The
“Onshore High Water Mark” attributable to each of the
15% Class and the 20% Classes shall be equal to the highest
aggregate net asset value of the 15% Class or the 20% Classes,
respectively, after reduction for the relevant Onshore Incentive
Fee then paid, as of any preceding Incentive Fee Calculation
Date.  The Onshore High Water Mark shall be increased
dollar-for-dollar by new subscriptions and decreased
proportionately when capital withdrawals from the Onshore
Fund’s account being traded by the Trading Advisor
(“Onshore Capital Withdrawals”) are made with respect
to the 15% Class or the 20% Classes.  The proportionate
Onshore High Water Mark reduction made as a result of Onshore
Capital Withdrawals shall be calculated by multiplying the Onshore
High Water Mark in effect immediately prior to such Onshore Capital
Withdrawal by a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate
net asset value of the 15% Class or the 20% Classes, as applicable,
immediately following such Onshore Capital Withdrawal and the
denominator of which is the aggregate net asset value of the 15%
Class or

 the 20% Classes, as applicable,
immediately before such Onshore Capital Withdrawal, in each case
prior to reduction for any accrued Onshore Incentive
Fee.  For the avoidance of doubt, the payment of expenses
shall not be deemed a Onshore Capital Withdrawal and shall not
reduce the Onshore High Water Mark.


 


2.            If
an Onshore Incentive Fee is paid with respect to the 15% Class or
the 20% Classes as of an Incentive Fee Calculation Date, the
relevant Onshore High Water Mark shall be reset to the aggregate
net asset value of the 15% Class or the 20% Classes, as applicable,
and at the Incentive Fee Calculation Date, immediately following
such payment and following the payment of the Sponsor’s Fees
(as defined in the Onshore Memorandum) and Management Fee charged,
in the aggregate, to each Class within such group.


 


3.            For
the avoidance of doubt, the Onshore High Water Mark shall be
determined on the basis of the 15% Class on the one hand and the
20% Classes on the other hand and not on the basis of any
individual investors or other group of investors.


 


(iv)            When
there is an accrued Onshore Incentive Fee at the time any net
Onshore Capital Withdrawal is m

Dear
Sirs:

 

Your
affiliate, Merrill Lynch Alternative Investments LLC , a
Delaware limited liability company (referred to herein in its
individual capacity and as sponsor as the
“Sponsor” or “MLAI” ), has
caused the formation of a group of managed futures funds comprising
the Merrill Lynch FuturesAccess SM
Program
(the “Program” ) which, at the effective date
hereof, consist of the limited liability companies formed pursuant
to the Limited Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware (the
“DLLCA” ) and the limited partnership formed
pursuant to the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act of the
State of Delaware (“ DRULPA ”) listed in the
Schedule of FuturesAccess Funds (the “Schedule”
) attached hereto as the Appendix.  Each company within
the Program is hereinafter referred to as a “FuturesAccess
Fund.”   It is intended that the terms and
conditions of this Amended and Restated Selling Agreement (the
“Agreement” ) shall apply to and be binding upon
any company which subsequently becomes a FuturesAccess Fund and,
likewise, shall cease to apply to any company which ceases, for
whatever reason, to be a FuturesAccess Fund.  It is
hereby agreed therefore that, in the event of any FuturesAccess
Fund’s joining or leaving the Program as the case may be, the
Schedule shall be amended accordingly with the intent and effect
that (from the effective date on which such Schedule is
acknowledged and accepted on behalf of the FuturesAccess Funds
specified therein, the Sponsor and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
& Smith Incorporated) any FuturesAccess Fund joining the
Program shall become, and any FuturesAccess Fund leaving the
Program shall cease to be, a party to this
Agreement.  Upon becoming a party hereto, a FuturesAccess
Fund shall agree to observe, perform and be bound by all the terms
of this Agreement which are capable of applying to it and which
have not been performed as at that time.  This Agreement
amends and restates in its entirety the Selling Agreement between
the parties hereto dated as of October 31, 2004 on the terms set
forth herein.

 

The
FuturesAccess Funds will operate as managed futures funds to which
professional trading advisors ( “Trading
Advisors” ) unaffiliated with MLAI will provide trading
advice on an independent contractor basis.

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

Capitalized
terms used herein, unless otherwise indicated, shall have the
meanings attributed to them in the Program’s “Part One
(A) Confidential Program Disclosure
Document:  FuturesAccess SM
Program
General Information,” “Part One (B) Confidential
Program Disclosure Document:  Trading Advisor
Information” and the “Part Two Confidential Program
Disclosure Document: Statement of Additional Information,” as
amended or supplemented from time to time (collectively, the
“Disclosure Document” ).  Defined
terms used herein shall have the meaning of both the singular and
the plural unless otherwise specified.

 

Section
1.  Representations and Warranties of the Sponsor
.  The Sponsor represents and warrants to Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, the selling agent for the
FuturesAccess Funds (the “ Selling Agent ”) as
follows:

 

(a)
    Each FuturesAccess Fund has been formed pursuant
to a Certificate of Formation or Certificate of Limited Partnership
(each a “Certificate” ) and a Limited Liability
Company Operating Agreement or Limited Partnership Agreement (each
a “Governing Agreement” ) which provide for the
subscription for and sale of each FuturesAccess Fund’s units
of limited liability company or limited partnership interest (
“Units” ) in classes; all action required to be
taken by the Sponsor and each FuturesAccess Fund as a condition to
the sale of the Units to subscribers who qualify as
“Accredited Investors” within the meaning of
the  Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“1933 Act” ),   has been, or prior
to the Initial and each Additional Closing Time (as defined in
Section 2 hereof) will have been taken, and, upon payment of
the consideration therefor specified in all accepted FuturesAccess
Program Subscription and Exchange Agreements and Signature Pages
thereto (collectively, the “Subscription
Agreements” ), the Units will constitute valid limited
liability company or limited partnership interests, as applicable,
in a FuturesAccess Fund.

 

(b)
    Each FuturesAccess Fund is a limited liability
company or limited partnership duly organized pursuant to a
Certificate and the DLLCA or DRULPA, as applicable, and validly
existing under the laws of the State of Delaware with full power
and authority to conduct its business and operations, as described
in the Disclosure Document; each FuturesAccess Fund has received
(or will receive prior to the Initial Closing Time) a certificate
of authority to do business in the State of New Jersey.

 

(c)
    The Sponsor is duly organized and validly
existing and in good standing as a limited liability company under
the laws of the State of Delaware and in good standing as a foreign
limited liability company under the laws of the State of New Jersey
and in each other jurisdiction in which the nature or conduct of
its business requires such qualification and the failure to so
qualify would materially adversely affect the FuturesAccess
Funds’ or the Sponsor’s ability to perform its
obligations hereunder.

 

 

 

2

  

 

(d)
    Each FuturesAccess Fund and the Sponsor have
full power and authority under applicable law to perform their
respective obligations under the applicable Governing Agreement,
the Customer Agreement ( “Customer Agreement” )
and the Advisory Agreement ( “Advisory
Agreement” ) relating to the trading of commodity
interests and this Agreement, as described in the Disclosure
Document.

 

(e)
    The Disclosure Document as of its date of issue,
the Initial Closing Time and at each Additional Closing Time will
not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not
misleading.  This representation and warranty shall not,
however, apply to any statement or omission in the Disclosure
Document made in reliance upon and in conformity with information
relating to the Trading Advisors or the Selling Agent and furnished
or approved in writing by the Trading Advisors or the Selling
Agent; it being acknowledged that each of the Trading Advisors or
the Selling Agent have approved the information relating to such
party or its principals, as set forth in the Disclosure
Document.

 

(f)
    Since the respective dates as of which
information is given in the Disclosure Document, there has not been
any material adverse change in the condition (financial or
otherwise), business or prospects of the Sponsor or the
FuturesAccess Funds, whether or not arising in the ordinary course
of business.

 

(g)
    A Governing Agreement, a Customer Agreement, an
Advisory Agreement and this Agreement have each been duly and
validly authorized, executed and delivered by the Sponsor on behalf
of each FuturesAccess Fund, and each constitutes a valid, binding
and enforceable agreement of each FuturesAccess Fund, in accordance
with its terms.

 

(h)
    The execution and delivery of the Governing
Agreements, the Customer Agreements, the Advisory Agreements and
this Agreement, the incurrence of the obligations set forth in each
of such agreements and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated therein and in the Disclosure Document will not
constitute a breach of, or default under, any instrument by which
either the Sponsor or a FuturesAccess Fund is bound or any order,
rule or regulation applicable to the Sponsor or a FuturesAccess
Fund of any court or any governmental body or administrative agency
having jurisdiction over the Sponsor or a FuturesAccess
Fund.

 

(i)
    There is not pending, or, to the best of the
Sponsor’s knowledge, threatened, any action, suit or
proceeding before or by any court or other governmental body to
which the Sponsor or a FuturesAccess Fund is a party, or to which
any of the assets of the Sponsor or a FuturesAccess Fund is
subject, which is not referred to in the Disclosure Document and
which might reasonably be expected to result in any material
adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise), business
or prospects of the Sponsor or the FuturesAccess Fund.

(j)
    The Sponsor has all federal and state
governmental and regulatory approvals and licenses, and has
effected all filings and registrations with federal and state
governmental agencies required to conduct its business and to act
as described in the Disclosure Document or required to perform its
obligations as described under the Governing Agreements and this
Agreement, and the performance of such obligations will not
contravene or result in a breach of any provision of its
certificate of formation, operating agreement or any agreement,
order, law or regulation binding upon it.

 

(k)
    The FuturesAccess Funds do not require any
federal or state governmental or regulatory approvals or licenses,
or need to effect any filings or registrations with any federal or
state governmental agencies in order to conduct their business, to
act as contemplated by the Disclosure Document and to issue and
sell Units (other than filings relating solely to the offering of
the Units).

 

(l)
    The Sponsor’s and FuturesAccess
Funds’ auditors are independent public accountants within the
meaning of the 1933 Act and the regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission ( “SEC” ).

 

(m)
    The offer and sale of the Units in the manner
contemplated by this Agreement will be exempt from the registration
requirements of the 1933 Act by reason of Regulation D promulgated
thereunder.

 

Section
2.  Offering and Sale of Units .

 

(a)
    The Selling Agent and its affiliates are hereby
granted the exclusive right to distribute Units.  Subject
to the performance by the Sponsor of all its obligations to be
performed hereunder, and to the completeness and accuracy in all
material respects of all the representations and warranties of the
Sponsor contained herein, the Selling Agent hereby accepts such
agency and agrees on the terms and conditions herein set forth to
use its best efforts to find acceptable subscribers for the Units
as of the beginning of each calendar month.

 

It is
understood that the Selling Agent’s agreement to use its best
efforts to find acceptable subscribers for the Units shall not
prevent it from acting as a selling agent or underwriter for the
securities of other issuers which may be offered or sold during the
term of this Agreement.  The agency of the Selling Agent
hereunder shall continue until this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with the provisions of this Section or
Section 9.

 

(b)
    In the event insufficient subscriptions (as
described in the Disclosure Document) are received prior to the
intended close of the initial offering period, all funds received
from subscribers shall be returned in full, with any interest
payable thereon (irrespective of amount) and without deduction for
any fee or expense; and thereupon the Selling Agent’s duties
as agent and this Agreement shall terminate without further
obligation hereunder on the part of the Selling Agent, the Sponsor
or the FuturesAccess Fund.

(c)
    The Sponsor shall notify the Selling Agent of
the aggregate number of Units in each FuturesAccess Fund for which
the Sponsor has received acceptable subscriptions, and payment of
the purchase price for the Units of such FuturesAccess Fund may, if
the Sponsor so elects, be made at the office of the Sponsor, 4
World Financial Center, 250 Vesey Street, 10th Floor, New York, NY
10080, or at such other place as shall be agreed upon between the

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
