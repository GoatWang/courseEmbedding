Please remember that different types of investments involve varying degrees of risk, and there can be no assurance that the future performance of any specific investment or investment strategy (including those undertaken or recommended by Vista), will be profitable or equal any historical performance level(s).
Certain portions of Vista’s web site (i.e. newsletters, articles, commentaries, etc.) may contain a discussion of, and/or provide access to, Vista (and those of other investment and non-investment professionals) positions and/or recommendations as of a specific prior date.  Due to various factors, including changing market conditions, such discussion may no longer be reflective of current position(s) and/or recommendation(s).  Moreover, no client or prospective client should assume that any such discussion serves as the receipt of, or a substitute for, personalized advice from Vista, or from any other investment professional.  Vista is neither an attorney nor an accountant, and no portion of the web site content should be interpreted as legal, accounting or tax advice.
Rankings and/or recognition by unaffiliated rating services and/or publications should not be construed by a client or prospective client as a guarantee that he/she will experience a certain level of results if Vista Capital Partners is engaged, or continues to be engaged, to provide investment advisory services, nor should it be construed as a current or past endorsement of Vista Capital Partners by any of its clients.  Rankings published by magazines, and others, generally base their selections exclusively on information prepared and/or submitted by the recognized adviser. Rankings are generally limited to participating advisers.
To the extent that any client or prospective client utilizes any economic calculator or similar interactive device contained within or linked to Vista’s web site, the client and/or prospective client acknowledges and understands that the information resulting from the use of any such calculator/device, is not, and should not be construed, in any manner whatsoever, as the receipt of, or a substitute for, personalized individual advice from Vista, or from any other investment professional.
Each client and prospective client agrees, as a condition precedent to his/her/its access to Vista’s web site, to release and hold harmless Vista, its officers, directors, owners, employees and agents from any and all adverse consequences resulting from any of his/her/its actions and/or omissions which are independent of his/her/its receipt of personalized individual advice from Vista.

Lindsey WilliamsLead Advisor, PartnerMaking time to listen and build a connection is priority number one for Lindsey.
“It’s vital to take time to learn what is important in the lives of our clients,” she says. “Building a great relationship helps us better understand the big picture.”
Throughout her 10 years at Vista, Lindsey has worked with clients to focus on what really matters:  making progress toward a long-term goal.  Doing so helps liberate them from the anxiety which can arise from short-term fluctuations in the value of their portfolio.
How does Lindsey let off steam in her own life?  By skiing in Central Oregon with her family or helping her two daughters with their next Girl Scout patch.

As our Chief Investment Officer, Dougal is responsible for orchestrating and implementing the firm’s investment and wealth management research. In addition to developing close relationships with clients, this daily opportunity to learn and help teach others is what he enjoys most about his job.
One of the most energetic folks in the office, Dougal can be found trail running or on the tennis court, undoubtedly taking instruction from one of his three young daughters.
