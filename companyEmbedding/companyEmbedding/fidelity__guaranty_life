Sales In Line With Expectations
Sales of our core fixed indexed annuity product were $551 million in the current period, an increase of 26% over the prior year quarter. On a sequential basis, FIA sales increased 14% as compared to the fiscal fourth quarter 2016. FIA sales levels in recent quarters reflect continued strong and productive partnerships with our independent marketing organizations ("IMO's").  
Sales of multi-year guarantee annuities ("MYGA") were $97 million in the current quarter as compared to $52 million in the same period last year. Total annuity sales were $648 million for the current quarter, an increase of 33% over the prior year quarter.
Indexed universal life sales in the quarter were $17 million, an increase of 31% compared to $13 million last year. This increase reflects FGL's efforts to grow our IUL business with expanded distribution. 
Investment Portfolio Performing Well
Net investment income was $240 million for the quarter, an increase of 8% compared to $222 million for the same period last year. This growth was right in line with the increase in average assets under management ("AAUM"), which were up $1.5 billion or 8% over the prior year from sales and stable policy owner retention trends.
The average earned yield on the total portfolio in the quarter was 4.85%, consistent with 4.87% in the prior year quarter. Asset purchases during the quarter were $1.2 billion at an average yield of 4.78%. Asset purchases during the current quarter were primarily in investment grade corporate bonds and structured securities. The average NAIC rating for the portfolio remains approximately 1.5.
Net investment spread across all product lines increased 15 basis points to 229 basis points, compared to fiscal first quarter 2016. Net investment spread in the current quarter for fixed indexed annuities was consistent with recent performance at 300 basis points.
Capital Management Trends

GAAP book value per share at December 31, 2016 was $29.70 on a reported basis; book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") was $27.11, an increase of 9% year over year. 
As announced on February 2, 2017, the FGL Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.065 per share. The dividend is payable on March 6, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 21, 2017.

   Non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for additional information. 




Agreement and Plan of Merger with Anbang Insurance Group Co., Ltd. ("Anbang")
On November 8, 2015, FGL and Anbang entered into a definitive merger agreement (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which Anbang will acquire all outstanding shares of FGL (the "Merger") for $26.80 per share in cash, without interest. On November 3, 2016, FGL and Anbang extended the outside termination date for the completion of the merger to February 8, 2017. Accordingly, either party may terminate the merger agreement if the closing of the merger does not occur prior to February 8, 2017. The parties are in discussions regarding an extension of the outside termination date beyond February 8, 2017. We expect to make an announcement on or about February 9, 2017 regarding the outcome of our discussions.
The Merger remains subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals from the Iowa Insurance Division, the New York Department of Financial Services and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission ("CIRC").  The parties have obtained requisite regulatory approvals for the Merger from the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ("CFIUS").  The parties will not be required to file a notification of the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, due to an available exemption.
Non-GAAP Measures
Management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures may be useful in certain instances to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. Reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included herein.
AOI is calculated by adjusting net income to eliminate (i) the impact of net investment gains including other-than-temporary impairment ("OTTI") losses recognized in operations, but excluding gains and losses on derivatives hedging our indexed annuity policies, (ii) the effect of changes in the interest rates used to discount the FIA embedded derivative liability, and (iii) the effect of change in fair value of the reinsurance related embedded derivative. All adjustments to AOI are net of the corresponding VOBA and DAC impact. The income tax impact related to these adjustments is measured using an effective tax rate of 35%, as appropriate. 
While these adjustments are an integral part of the overall performance of FGL, market conditions impacting these items can overshadow the underlying performance of the business. Accordingly, we believe using a measure which excludes their impact is effective in analyzing the trends of our operations. Our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations because other organizations may not calculate such non-GAAP measures in the same manner as we do. 
Net investment spread is the excess of net investment income earned over the sum of interest credited to policyholders and the cost of hedging our risk on FIA policies.
Average assets under management ("AAUM") is the sum of (i) total invested assets at amortized cost, excluding derivatives, (ii) related party loans and investments and (iii) cash and cash equivalents at the end of each month in the period divided by the number of months in the period.
Book value per share excluding AOCI is calculated as total stockholders' equity excluding AOCI divided by the total number of shares of common stock outstanding.
Sales are not derived from any specific GAAP income statement accounts or line items and should not be viewed as a substitute for any financial measure determined in accordance with GAAP. For GAAP purposes annuity sales are recorded as deposit liabilities (i.e. contract holder funds). Management believes that presentation of sales as measured for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business and helps depict longer term trends that may not be apparent in the results of operations due to the timing of sales and revenue recognition. 
While management believes that non-GAAP measurements are useful supplemental information, such adjusted results are not intended to replace GAAP financial results and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results.
Conference Call and Earnings Release
In light of the announced merger with Anbang, FGL has elected to discontinue conference calls to discuss quarterly and annual results, pending the closing of the transaction. FGL will continue to issue its earnings press releases and quarterly financial supplement.

Fidelity and Guaranty Life Insurance Company provides annuities and life insurance for over 700,000 policyholders across the United States. The company was founded in 1959 and is based in Des Moines, Iowa. It was a wholly owned subsidiary of Harbinger Group prior to a partial initial public offering in 2013.[2]
In November 2015, Fidelity announced an agreement to sell the company to the Chinese insurance firm Anbang Insurance for a fee of around $1.57 billion.[3]

History[edit]
The company was incorporated in 1959 under the laws of Maryland and commenced business in 1960. The company was primarily formed to write individual life insurance and annuity products.
Until June 1, 1995, the company was a wholly owned subsidiary of United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company ("USF&G Company"), a Maryland-domiciled property and casualty insurer. USF&G Corporation, a Maryland-domiciled insurance holding company, was the company’s ultimate controlling entity.
Effective June 1, 1995, with the approval of the Maryland Insurance Administration, USF&G Company declared a dividend payable to USF&G Corporation consisting of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the company. As a result, the company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of USF&G Corporation. In 1996, then-CEO Norman Blake publicly discussed the possibility of selling the life insurance company as part of plan to grow the international operations of the property & casualty business.[4] By 1997, Blake told shareholders that several large carriers had approached management to purchase the entire organization.[5]
On January 20, 1998, St. Paul announced that it would acquire USF&G for $2.8 billion and merge both entities into a single organization.[6] On April 24, 1998, as a result of the merger of its parent, USF&G Corporation, with The St. Paul Companies, Inc. (St. Paul Travelers), an insurance holding company incorporated in the state of Minnesota, the company became an indirect subsidiary of St. Paul Companies, Inc.
Effective January 1, 1999, under a plan of merger, with the approval of the Maryland Insurance Administration, the company’s ultimate parent, USF&G Corporation, merged with St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company (Fire & Marine), a Minnesota corporation. As a result of this merger, the company became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Fire & Marine with St. Paul as its ultimate controlling entity.
On September 18, 2001, the Company was acquired by Old Mutual plc ("Old Mutual"), a London based financial services company, which was approved by the Maryland Insurance Administration on September 21, 2001.[7] As a result of the acquisition, the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Old Mutual U.S. Life Holdings, Inc. ("OMUSLH"), a Delaware holding company which is ultimately owned by Old Mutual. The listed purchase price was $635 million USD.[8]
On December 31, 2002, the Maryland Insurance Administration approved a reorganization plan within the Old Mutual plc holding company system. Old Mutual plc created a new Texas-domiciled life insurance company, Omnia Life Insurance Company, Inc., ("Omnia"), and all of the outstanding common stock of the Company was contributed to Omnia by the Company’s parent, OMULSH. As a result of the reorganization, the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Omnia.
Effective January 1, 2007, the company’s board of directors approved a resolution to amend the company’s charter to change its name to OM Financial Life Insurance Company. This name change was submitted and approved by the State of Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation and the Administration, effective January 1, 2007.
On January 16, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission(“SEC”) issued Rule 151A claiming indexed annuities should be regulated as securities and should only be sold by registered representatives.[9] A lawsuit was filed on the same day challenging the SEC’s ability to regulate fixed indexed annuities. Legislation was also introduced in Congress to exempt these annuities from securities regulation. Management of OM Financial Life Insurance actively participated in industry opposition to the proposal.[10] On July 13, 2010, The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated Rule 151A.[11] On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed HR 4173 (Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) which contained a last minute amendment by Senator Harkin (“Harkin Amendment”)[12] which exempted fixed index annuities from regulation by the SEC and left these products to be regulated by the state insurance departments.
In early 2010, reports surfaced that Old Mutual had placed the U.S. insurance operations for sale.[13] On April 6, 2011, Old Mutual announced the completion of sale of its life and annuity business to the Harbinger Group.[14] Harbinger expressed its intention to use cash flow from the company to fund future acquisitions for the conglomerate.[15] Harbinger appointed Lee Launer, a former senior executive of MetLife to run the company as CEO.[16]
At that time, "OM Financial Life Insurance Company" changed its name back to "Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company".
In August, 2013, Fidelity & Guaranty Life filed Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission expressing its intention to complete an initial public equity offering.[17]
The company currently writes various types of fixed annuities and life insurance products. Currently, the largest product line is fixed indexed annuity (FIA).

Fidelity and Guaranty Life Insurance Company provides annuities and life insurance for over 700,000 policyholders across the United States. The company was founded in 1959 and is based in Des Moines, Iowa. It was a wholly owned subsidiary of Harbinger Group prior to a partial initial public offering in 2013.[2]
In November 2015, Fidelity announced an agreement to sell the company to the Chinese insurance firm Anbang Insurance for a fee of around $1.57 billion.[3]

History[edit]
The company was incorporated in 1959 under the laws of Maryland and commenced business in 1960. The company was primarily formed to write individual life insurance and annuity products.
Until June 1, 1995, the company was a wholly owned subsidiary of United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company ("USF&G Company"), a Maryland-domiciled property and casualty insurer. USF&G Corporation, a Maryland-domiciled insurance holding company, was the company’s ultimate controlling entity.
Effective June 1, 1995, with the approval of the Maryland Insurance Administration, USF&G Company declared a dividend payable to USF&G Corporation consisting of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the company. As a result, the company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of USF&G Corporation. In 1996, then-CEO Norman Blake publicly discussed the possibility of selling the life insurance company as part of plan to grow the international operations of the property & casualty business.[4] By 1997, Blake told shareholders that several large carriers had approached management to purchase the entire organization.[5]
On January 20, 1998, St. Paul announced that it would acquire USF&G for $2.8 billion and merge both entities into a single organization.[6] On April 24, 1998, as a result of the merger of its parent, USF&G Corporation, with The St. Paul Companies, Inc. (St. Paul Travelers), an insurance holding company incorporated in the state of Minnesota, the company became an indirect subsidiary of St. Paul Companies, Inc.
Effective January 1, 1999, under a plan of merger, with the approval of the Maryland Insurance Administration, the company’s ultimate parent, USF&G Corporation, merged with St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company (Fire & Marine), a Minnesota corporation. As a result of this merger, the company became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Fire & Marine with St. Paul as its ultimate controlling entity.
On September 18, 2001, the Company was acquired by Old Mutual plc ("Old Mutual"), a London based financial services company, which was approved by the Maryland Insurance Administration on September 21, 2001.[7] As a result of the acquisition, the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Old Mutual U.S. Life Holdings, Inc. ("OMUSLH"), a Delaware holding company which is ultimately owned by Old Mutual. The listed purchase price was $635 million USD.[8]
On December 31, 2002, the Maryland Insurance Administration approved a reorganization plan within the Old Mutual plc holding company system. Old Mutual plc created a new Texas-domiciled life insurance company, Omnia Life Insurance Company, Inc., ("Omnia"), and all of the outstanding common stock of the Company was contributed to Omnia by the Company’s parent, OMULSH. As a result of the reorganization, the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Omnia.
Effective January 1, 2007, the company’s board of directors approved a resolution to amend the company’s charter to change its name to OM Financial Life Insurance Company. This name change was submitted and approved by the State of Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation and the Administration, effective January 1, 2007.
On January 16, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission(“SEC”) issued Rule 151A claiming indexed annuities should be regulated as securities and should only be sold by registered representatives.[9] A lawsuit was filed on the same day challenging the SEC’s ability to regulate fixed indexed annuities. Legislation was also introduced in Congress to exempt these annuities from securities regulation. Management of OM Financial Life Insurance actively participated in industry opposition to the proposal.[10] On July 13, 2010, The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated Rule 151A.[11] On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed HR 4173 (Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) which contained a last minute amendment by Senator Harkin (“Harkin Amendment”)[12] which exempted fixed index annuities from regulation by the SEC and left these products to be regulated by the state insurance departments.
In early 2010, reports surfaced that Old Mutual had placed the U.S. insurance operations for sale.[13] On April 6, 2011, Old Mutual announced the completion of sale of its life and annuity business to the Harbinger Group.[14] Harbinger expressed its intention to use cash flow from the company to fund future acquisitions for the conglomerate.[15] Harbinger appointed Lee Launer, a former senior executive of MetLife to run the company as CEO.[16]
At that time, "OM Financial Life Insurance Company" changed its name back to "Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company".
In August, 2013, Fidelity & Guaranty Life filed Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission expressing its intention to complete an initial public equity offering.[17]
The company currently writes various types of fixed annuities and life insurance products. Currently, the largest product line is fixed indexed annuity (FIA). In calendar year 2012, FIAs generated approximately 95% of total sales. See Annuity (US financial products) and Indexed annuity for description of these products. The company's National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) number is 63274.
In 2013, the company announced a move of its headquarters to Des Moines, Iowa, citing a lower cost of business and a desire to operate under a similar regulator as rival companies.[18] The company launched an initial public offering in late 2013[19] In October, 2014, the company hired Chris Littlefield, former CEO of Aviva USA, as President of the company.[20] The company subsequently appointed him CEO in April, 2014.[21]
Business[edit]
Policies are offered in every state and the District of Columbia; however, in New York, products are offered through a wholly owned subsidiary, Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company of New York.
In 2012, the majority of the company's direct premiums and annuity consideration business was written in the states of California (13.15%), Georgia (10.89%), Texas (8.81%), Florida (8.74%), Pennsylvania (6.07%), Michigan (5.62%), Arizona (5.41%), New Jersey (3.91%), Ohio (3.45%), Illinois (3.36%), North Carolina (3.03%), Missouri (1.97%), Tennessee (1.85%), Wisconsin (1.77%), and Indiana (1.61%). Total writings of $2,199,063,661 from these 15 states account for 79.6% of the total direct premiums and annuity consideration business written during 2012.
The company focuses on the sale of individual life insurance products and annuities, which include deferred annuities (fixed indexed and fixed rate annuities) and immediate annuities primarily sold through independent insurance marketing organizations (IMOs) that in turn represent independent agents. The major categories of direct premiums and annuity considerations written during 2012 were individual annuities (78.5%) and universal life insurance (21.4%).
From a statutory reporting perspective, the total adjusted statutory capital of Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company was $949 million and $870 million at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. Fidelity & Guaranty Life had statutory net income of $102 million and statutory net income of $110 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. As of December 31, 2012, the company had more than $85 billion of insurance in force with over $16 billion in assets . The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the investment firm Harbinger Group.[22]
A.M. Best rates the company and its subsidiaries in the ‘Very Good’ category of B++; Fitch Ratings maintains a BBB rating; and Moody's Investors Service holds the company at a Ba1 (adequate) position, and Standard & Poor's rates the company at BBB-.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Fidelity and Guaranty Life Insurance Company provides annuities and life insurance for over 700,000 policyholders across the United States. The company was founded in 1959 and is based in Des Moines, Iowa. It was a wholly owned subsidiary of Harbinger Group prior to a partial initial public offering in 2013.[2]
In November 2015, Fidelity announced an agreement to sell the company to the Chinese insurance firm Anbang Insurance for a fee of around $1.57 billion.[3]

History[edit]
The company was incorporated in 1959 under the laws of Maryland and commenced business in 1960. The company was primarily formed to write individual life insurance and annuity products.
Until June 1, 1995, the company was a wholly owned subsidiary of United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company ("USF&G Company"), a Maryland-domiciled property and casualty insurer. USF&G Corporation, a Maryland-domiciled insurance holding company, was the company’s ultimate controlling entity.
Effective June 1, 1995, with the approval of the Maryland Insurance Administration, USF&G Company declared a dividend payable to USF&G Corporation consisting of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the company. As a result, the company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of USF&G Corporation. In 1996, then-CEO Norman Blake publicly discussed the possibility of selling the life insurance company as part of plan to grow the international operations of the property & casualty business.[4] By 1997, Blake told shareholders that several large carriers had approached management to purchase the entire organization.[5]
On January 20, 1998, St. Paul announced that it would acquire USF&G for $2.8 billion and merge both entities into a single organization.[6] On April 24, 1998, as a result of the merger of its parent, USF&G Corporation, with The St. Paul Companies, Inc. (St. Paul Travelers), an insurance holding company incorporated in the state of Minnesota, the company became an indirect subsidiary of St. Paul Companies, Inc.
Effective January 1, 1999, under a plan of merger, with the approval of the Maryland Insurance Administration, the company’s ultimate parent, USF&G Corporation, merged with St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company (Fire & Marine), a Minnesota corporation. As a result of this merger, the company became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Fire & Marine with St. Paul as its ultimate controlling entity.
On September 18, 2001, the Company was acquired by Old Mutual plc ("Old Mutual"), a London based financial services company, which was approved by the Maryland Insurance Administration on September 21, 2001.[7] As a result of the acquisition, the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Old Mutual U.S. Life Holdings, Inc. ("OMUSLH"), a Delaware holding company which is ultimately owned by Old Mutual. The listed purchase price was $635 million USD.[8]
On December 31, 2002, the Maryland Insurance Administration approved a reorganization plan within the Old Mutual plc holding company system. Old Mutual plc created a new Texas-domiciled life insurance company, Omnia Life Insurance Company, Inc., ("Omnia"), and all of the outstanding common stock of the Company was contributed to Omnia by the Company’s parent, OMULSH. As a result of the reorganization, the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Omnia.
Effective January 1, 2007, the company’s board of directors approved a resolution to amend the company’s charter to change its name to OM Financial Life Insurance Company. This name change was submitted and approved by the State of Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation and the Administration, effective January 1, 2007.
On January 16, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission(“SEC”) issued Rule 151A claiming indexed annuities should be regulated as securities and should only be sold by registered representatives.[9] A lawsuit was filed on the same day challenging the SEC’s ability to regulate fixed indexed annuities. Legislation was also introduced in Congress to exempt these annuities from securities regulation. Management of OM Financial Life Insurance actively participated in industry opposition to the proposal.[10] On July 13, 2010, The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated Rule 151A.[11] On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed HR 4173 (Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) which contained a last minute amendment by Senator Harkin (“Harkin Amendment”)[12] which exempted fixed index annuities from regulation by the SEC and left these products to be regulated by the state insurance departments.
In early 2010, reports surfaced that Old Mutual had placed the U.S. insurance operations for sale.[13] On April 6, 2011, Old Mutual announced the completion of sale of its life and annuity business to the Harbinger Group.[14] Harbinger expressed its intention to use cash flow from the company to fund future acquisitions for the conglomerate.[15] Harbinger appointed Lee Launer, a former senior executive of MetLife to run the company as CEO.[16]
At that time, "OM Financial Life Insurance Company" changed its name back to "Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company".
In August, 2013, Fidelity & Guaranty Life filed Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission expressing its intention to complete an initial public equity offering.[17]
The company currently writes various types of fixed annuities and life insurance products. Currently, the largest product line is fixed indexed annuity (FIA). In calendar year 2012, FIAs generated approximately 95% of total sales. See Annuity (US financial products) and Indexed annuity for description of these products. The company's National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) number is 63274.
In 2013, the company announced a move of its headquarters to Des Moines, Iowa, citing a lower cost of business and a desire to operate under a similar regulator as rival companies.[18] The company launched an initial public offering in late 2013[19] In October, 2014, the company hired Chris Littlefield, former CEO of Aviva USA, as President of the company.[20] The company subsequently appointed him CEO in April, 2014.[21]
Business[edit]
Policies are offered in every state and the District of Columbia; however, in New York, products are offered through a wholly owned subsidiary, Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company of New York.
In 2012, the majority of the company's direct premiums and annuity consideration business was written in the states of California (13.15%), Georgia (10.89%), Texas (8.81%), Florida (8.74%), Pennsylvania (6.07%), Michigan (5.62%), Arizona (5.41%), New Jersey (3.91%), Ohio (3.45%), Illinois (3.36%), North Carolina (3.03%), Missouri (1.97%), Tennessee (1.85%), Wisconsin (1.77%), and Indiana (1.61%). Total writings of $2,199,063,661 from these 15 states account for 79.6% of the total direct premiums and annuity consideration business written during 2012.
The company focuses on the sale of individual life insurance products and annuities, which include deferred annuities (fixed indexed and fixed rate annuities) and immediate annuities primarily sold through independent insurance marketing organizations (IMOs) that in turn represent independent agents. The major categories of direct premiums and annuity considerations written during 2012 were individual annuities (78.5%) and universal life insurance (21.4%).
From a statutory reporting perspective, the total adjusted statutory capital of Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company was $949 million and $870 million at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. Fidelity & Guaranty Life had statutory net income of $102 million and statutory net income of $110 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. As of December 31, 2012, the company had more than $85 billion of insurance in force with over $16 billion in assets . The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the investment firm Harbinger Group.[22]
A.M. Best rates the company and its subsidiaries in the ‘Very Good’ category of B++; Fitch Ratings maintains a BBB rating; and Moody's Investors Service holds the company at a Ba1 (adequate) position, and Standard & Poor's rates the company at BBB-.

Fidelity and Guaranty Life Insurance Company provides annuities and life insurance for over 700,000 policyholders across the United States. The company was founded in 1959 and is based in Des Moines, Iowa. It was a wholly owned subsidiary of Harbinger Group prior to a partial initial public offering in 2013.[2]
In November 2015, Fidelity announced an agreement to sell the company to the Chinese insurance firm Anbang Insurance for a fee of around $1.57 billion.[3]

History[edit]
The company was incorporated in 1959 under the laws of Maryland and commenced business in 1960. The company was primarily formed to write individual life insurance and annuity products.
Until June 1, 1995, the company was a wholly owned subsidiary of United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company ("USF&G Company"), a Maryland-domiciled property and casualty insurer. USF&G Corporation, a Maryland-domiciled insurance holding company, was the company’s ultimate controlling entity.
Effective June 1, 1995, with the approval of the Maryland Insurance Administration, USF&G Company declared a dividend payable to USF&G Corporation consisting of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the company. As a result, the company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of USF&G Corporation. In 1996, then-CEO Norman Blake publicly discussed the possibility of selling the life insurance company as part of plan to grow the international operations of the property & casualty business.[4] By 1997, Blake told shareholders that several large carriers had approached management to purchase the entire organization.[5]
On January 20, 1998, St. Paul announced that it would acquire USF&G for $2.8 billion and merge both entities into a single organization.[6] On April 24, 1998, as a result of the merger of its parent, USF&G Corporation, with The St. Paul Companies, Inc. (St. Paul Travelers), an insurance holding company incorporated in the state of Minnesota, the company became an indirect subsidiary of St. Paul Companies, Inc.
Effective January 1, 1999, under a plan of merger, with the approval of the Maryland Insurance Administration, the company’s ultimate parent, USF&G Corporation, merged with St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company (Fire & Marine), a Minnesota corporation. As a result of this merger, the company became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Fire & Marine with St. Paul as its ultimate controlling entity.
On September 18, 2001, the Company was acquired by Old Mutual plc ("Old Mutual"), a London based financial services company, which was approved by the Maryland Insurance Administration on September 21, 2001.[7] As a result of the acquisition, the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Old Mutual U.S. Life Holdings, Inc. ("OMUSLH"), a Delaware holding company which is ultimately owned by Old Mutual. The listed purchase price was $635 million USD.[8]
On December 31, 2002, the Maryland Insurance Administration approved a reorganization plan within the Old Mutual plc holding company system. Old Mutual plc created a new Texas-domiciled life insurance company, Omnia Life Insurance Company, Inc., ("Omnia"), and all of the outstanding common stock of the Company was contributed to Omnia by the Company’s parent, OMULSH. As a result of the reorganization, the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Omnia.
Effective January 1, 2007, the company’s board of directors approved a resolution to amend the company’s charter to change its name to OM Financial Life Insurance Company. This name change was submitted and approved by the State of Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation and the Administration, effective January 1, 2007.
On January 16, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission(“SEC”) issued Rule 151A claiming indexed annuities should be regulated as securities and should only be sold by registered representatives.[9] A lawsuit was filed on the same day challenging the SEC’s ability to regulate fixed indexed annuities. Legislation was also introduced in Congress to exempt these annuities from securities regulation. Management of OM Financial Life Insurance actively participated in industry opposition to the proposal.[10] On July 13, 2010, The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated Rule 151A.[11] On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed HR 4173 (Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) which contained a last minute amendment by Senator Harkin (“Harkin Amendment”)[12] which exempted fixed index annuities from regulation by the SEC and left these products to be regulated by the state insurance departments.
In early 2010, reports surfaced that Old Mutual had placed the U.S. insurance operations for sale.[13] On April 6, 2011, Old Mutual announced the completion of sale of its life and annuity business to the Harbinger Group.[14] Harbinger expressed its intention to use cash flow from the company to fund future acquisitions for the conglomerate.[15] Harbinger appointed Lee Launer, a former senior executive of MetLife to run the company as CEO.[16]
At that time, "OM Financial Life Insurance Company" changed its name back to "Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company".
In August, 2013, Fidelity & Guaranty Life filed Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission expressing its intention to complete an initial public equity offering.[17]
The company currently writes various types of fixed annuities and life insurance products. Currently, the largest product line is fixed indexed annuity (FIA). In calendar year 2012, FIAs generated approximately 95% of total sales. See Annuity (US financial products) and Indexed annuity for description of these products. The company's National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) number is 63274.
In 2013, the company announced a move of its headquarters to Des Moines, Iowa, citing a lower cost of business and a desire to operate under a similar regulator as rival companies.[18] The company launched an initial public offering in late 2013[19] In October, 2014, the company hired Chris Littlefield, former CEO of Aviva USA, as President of the company.[20] The company subsequently appointed him CEO in April, 2014.[21]
Business[edit]
Policies are offered in every state and the District of Columbia; however, in New York, products are offered through a wholly owned subsidiary, Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company of New York.
In 2012, the majority of the company's direct premiums and annuity consideration business was written in the states of California (13.15%), Georgia (10.89%), Texas (8.81%), Florida (8.74%), Pennsylvania (6.07%), Michigan (5.62%), Arizona (5.41%), New Jersey (3.91%), Ohio (3.45%), Illinois (3.36%), North Carolina (3.03%), Missouri (1.97%), Tennessee (1.85%), Wisconsin (1.77%), and Indiana (1.61%). Total writings of $2,199,063,661 from these 15 states account for 79.6% of the total direct premiums and annuity consideration business written during 2012.
The company focuses on the sale of individual life insurance products and annuities, which include deferred annuities (fixed indexed and fixed rate annuities) and immediate annuities primarily sold through independent insurance marketing organizations (IMOs) that in turn represent independent agents. The major categories of direct premiums and annuity considerations written during 2012 were individual annuities (78.5%) and universal life insurance (21.4%).
From a statutory reporting perspective, the total adjusted statutory capital of Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company was $949 million and $870 million at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. Fidelity & Guaranty Life had statutory net income of $102 million and statutory net income of $110 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. As of December 31, 2012, the company had more than $85 billion of insurance in force with over $16 billion in assets . The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the investment firm Harbinger Group.[22]
A.M. Best rates the company and its subsidiaries in the ‘Very Good’ category of B++; Fitch Ratings maintains a BBB rating; and Moody's Investors Service holds the company at a Ba1 (adequate) position, and Standard & Poor's rates the company at BBB-.

Why buy an FGL annuity?
Annuities can serve as an important part of your retirement and investment plan. We design
            our annuities to help your assets grow and provide a steady stream of income when you decide to retire. Generally, when
            you purchase an annuity, your funds accumulate tax-deferred until you withdraw earnings and can later be turned in to a series of payments provided by our insurance company for a determined period of time. You may receive these
            funds over a number of years or for life, beginning right away, or in the future. We offer fixed indexed
            annuities (FIAs), fixed annuities and immediate annuities.

Range of options for retirees including accumulation potential, income,
                wealth transfer and illness protection

History[edit]
The company was incorporated in 1959 under the laws of Maryland and commenced business in 1960. The company was primarily formed to write individual life insurance and annuity products.
Until June 1, 1995, the company was a wholly owned subsidiary of United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company ("USF&G Company"), a Maryland-domiciled property and casualty insurer. USF&G Corporation, a Maryland-domiciled insurance holding company, was the company’s ultimate controlling entity.
Effective June 1, 1995, with the approval of the Maryland Insurance Administration, USF&G Company declared a dividend payable to USF&G Corporation consisting of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the company. As a result, the company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of USF&G Corporation. In 1996, then-CEO Norman Blake publicly discussed the possibility of selling the life insurance company as part of plan to grow the international operations of the property & casualty business.[4] By 1997, Blake told shareholders that several large carriers had approached management to purchase the entire organization.[5]
On January 20, 1998, St. Paul announced that it would acquire USF&G for $2.8 billion and merge both entities into a single organization.[6] On April 24, 1998, as a result of the merger of its parent, USF&G Corporation, with The St. Paul Companies, Inc. (St. Paul Travelers), an insurance holding company incorporated in the state of Minnesota, the company became an indirect subsidiary of St. Paul Companies, Inc.
Effective January 1, 1999, under a plan of merger, with the approval of the Maryland Insurance Administration, the company’s ultimate parent, USF&G Corporation, merged with St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company (Fire & Marine), a Minnesota corporation. As a result of this merger, the company became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Fire & Marine with St. Paul as its ultimate controlling entity.
On September 18, 2001, the Company was acquired by Old Mutual plc ("Old Mutual"), a London based financial services company, which was approved by the Maryland Insurance Administration on September 21, 2001.[7] As a result of the acquisition, the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Old Mutual U.S. Life Holdings, Inc. ("OMUSLH"), a Delaware holding company which is ultimately owned by Old Mutual. The listed purchase price was $635 million USD.[8]
On December 31, 2002, the Maryland Insurance Administration approved a reorganization plan within the Old Mutual plc holding company system. Old Mutual plc created a new Texas-domiciled life insurance company, Omnia Life Insurance Company, Inc., ("Omnia"), and all of the outstanding common stock of the Company was contributed to Omnia by the Company’s parent, OMULSH. As a result of the reorganization, the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Omnia.
Effective January 1, 2007, the company’s board of directors approved a resolution to amend the company’s charter to change its name to OM Financial Life Insurance Company. This name change was submitted and approved by the State of Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation and the Administration, effective January 1, 2007.
On January 16, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission(“SEC”) issued Rule 151A claiming indexed annuities should be regulated as securities and should only be sold by registered representatives.[9] A lawsuit was filed on the same day challenging the SEC’s ability to regulate fixed indexed annuities. Legislation was also introduced in Congress to exempt these annuities from securities regulation. Management of OM Financial Life Insurance actively participated in industry opposition to the proposal.[10] On July 13, 2010, The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated Rule 151A.[11] On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed HR 4173 (Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) which contained a last minute amendment by Senator Harkin (“Harkin Amendment”)[12] which exempted fixed index annuities from regulation by the SEC and left these products to be regulated by the state insurance departments.
In early 2010, reports surfaced that Old Mutual had placed the U.S. insurance operations for sale.[13] On April 6, 2011, Old Mutual announced the completion of sale of its life and annuity business to the Harbinger Group.[14] Harbinger expressed its intention to use cash flow from the company to fund future acquisitions for the conglomerate.[15] Harbinger appointed Lee Launer, a former senior executive of MetLife to run the company as CEO.[16]
At that time, "OM Financial Life Insurance Company" changed its name back to "Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company".
In August, 2013, Fidelity & Guaranty Life filed Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission expressing its intention to complete an initial public equity offering.[17]
The company currently writes various types of fixed annuities and life insurance products. Currently, the largest product line is fixed indexed annuity (FIA). In calendar year 2012, FIAs generated approximately 95% of total sales. See Annuity (US financial products) and Indexed annuity for description of these products. The company's National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) number is 63274.
In 2013, the company announced a move of its headquarters to Des Moines, Iowa, citing a lower cost of business and a desire to operate under a similar regulator as rival companies.[18] The company launched an initial public offering in late 2013[19] In October, 2014, the company hired Chris Littlefield, former CEO of Aviva USA, as President of the company.[20] The company subsequently appointed him CEO in April, 2014.[21]
Business[edit]
Policies are offered in every state and the District of Columbia; however, in New York, products are offered through a wholly owned subsidiary, Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company of New York.
In 2012, the majority of the company's direct premiums and annuity consideration business was written in the states of California (13.15%), Georgia (10.89%), Texas (8.81%), Florida (8.74%), Pennsylvania (6.07%), Michigan (5.62%), Arizona (5.41%), New Jersey (3.91%), Ohio (3.45%), Illinois (3.36%), North Carolina (3.03%), Missouri (1.97%), Tennessee (1.85%), Wisconsin (1.77%), and Indiana (1.61%). Total writings of $2,199,063,661 from these 15 states account for 79.6% of the total direct premiums and annuity consideration business written during 2012.
The company focuses on the sale of individual life insurance products and annuities, which include deferred annuities (fixed indexed and fixed rate annuities) and immediate annuities primarily sold through independent insurance marketing organizations (IMOs) that in turn represent independent agents. The major categories of direct premiums and annuity considerations written during 2012 were individual annuities (78.5%) and universal life insurance (21.4%).
From a statutory reporting perspective, the total adjusted statutory capital of Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company was $949 million and $870 million at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. Fidelity & Guaranty Life had statutory net income of $102 million and statutory net income of $110 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. As of December 31, 2012, the company had more than $85 billion of insurance in force with over $16 billion in assets . The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the investment firm Harbinger Group.[22]
A.M. Best rates the company and its subsidiaries in the ‘Very Good’ category of B++; Fitch Ratings maintains a BBB rating; and Moody's Investors Service holds the company at a Ba1 (adequate) position, and Standard & Poor's rates the company at BBB-.

In early 2010, reports surfaced that Old Mutual had placed the U.S. insurance operations for sale.[13] On April 6, 2011, Old Mutual announced the completion of sale of its life and annuity business to the Harbinger Group.[14] Harbinger expressed its intention to use cash flow from the company to fund future acquisitions for the conglomerate.[15] Harbinger appointed Lee Launer, a former senior executive of MetLife to run the company as CEO.[16]
At that time, "OM Financial Life Insurance Company" changed its name back to "Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company".
In August, 2013, Fidelity & Guaranty Life filed Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission expressing its intention to complete an initial public equity offering.[17]
The company currently writes various types of fixed annuities and life insurance products. Currently, the largest product line is fixed indexed annuity (FIA). In calendar year 2012, FIAs generated approximately 95% of total sales. See Annuity (US financial products) and Indexed annuity for description of these products. The company's National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) number is 63274.
In 2013, the company announced a move of its headquarters to Des Moines, Iowa, citing a lower cost of business and a desire to operate under a similar regulator as rival companies.[18] The company launched an initial public offering in late 2013[19] In October, 2014, the company hired Chris Littlefield, former CEO of Aviva USA, as President of the company.[20] The company subsequently appointed him CEO in April, 2014.[21]

History[edit]
The company was incorporated in 1959 under the laws of Maryland and commenced business in 1960. The company was primarily formed to write individual life insurance and annuity products.
Until June 1, 1995, the company was a wholly owned subsidiary of United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company ("USF&G Company"), a Maryland-domiciled property and casualty insurer. USF&G Corporation, a Maryland-domiciled insurance holding company, was the company’s ultimate controlling entity.
Effective June 1, 1995, with the approval of the Maryland Insurance Administration, USF&G Company declared a dividend payable to USF&G Corporation consisting of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the company. As a result, the company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of USF&G Corporation. In 1996, then-CEO Norman Blake publicly discussed the possibility of selling the life insurance company as part of plan to grow the international operations of the property & casualty business.[4] By 1997, Blake told shareholders that several large carriers had approached management to purchase the entire organization.[5]
On January 20, 1998, St. Paul announced that it would acquire USF&G for $2.8 billion and merge both entities into a single organization.[6] On April 24, 1998, as a result of the merger of its parent, USF&G Corporation, with The St. Paul Companies, Inc. (St. Paul Travelers), an insurance holding company incorporated in the state of Minnesota, the company became an indirect subsidiary of St. Paul Companies, Inc.
Effective January 1, 1999, under a plan of merger, with the approval of the Maryland Insurance Administration, the company’s ultimate parent, USF&G Corporation, merged with St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company (Fire & Marine), a Minnesota corporation. As a result of this merger, the company became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Fire & Marine with St. Paul as its ultimate controlling entity.
On September 18, 2001, the Company was acquired by Old Mutual plc ("Old Mutual"), a London based financial services company, which was approved by the Maryland Insurance Administration on September 21, 2001.[7] As a result of the acquisition, the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Old Mutual U.S. Life Holdings, Inc. ("OMUSLH"), a Delaware holding company which is ultimately owned by Old Mutual. The listed purchase price was $635 million USD.[8]
On December 31, 2002, the Maryland Insurance Administration approved a reorganization plan within the Old Mutual plc holding company system. Old Mutual plc created a new Texas-domiciled life insurance company, Omnia Life Insurance Company, Inc., ("Omnia"), and all of the outstanding common stock of the Company was contributed to Omnia by the Company’s parent, OMULSH. As a result of the reorganization, the Company became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Omnia.
Effective January 1, 2007, the company’s board of directors approved a resolution to amend the company’s charter to change its name to OM Financial Life Insurance Company. This name change was submitted and approved by the State of Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation and the Administration, effective January 1, 2007.
On January 16, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission(“SEC”) issued Rule 151A claiming indexed annuities should be regulated as securities and should only be sold by registered representatives.[9] A lawsuit was filed on the same day challenging the SEC’s ability to regulate fixed indexed annuities. Legislation was also introduced in Congress to exempt these annuities from securities regulation. Management of OM Financial Life Insurance actively participated in industry opposition to the proposal.[10] On July 13, 2010, The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated Rule 151A.[11] On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed HR 4173 (Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) which contained a last minute amendment by Senator Harkin (“Harkin Amendment”)[12] which exempted fixed index annuities from regulation by the SEC and left these products to be regulated by the state insurance departments.

At that time, "OM Financial Life Insurance Company" changed its name back to "Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company".

Moody's Investors Service

Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 in each generic rating classification from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the obligations ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category.
Aaa
Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, subject to the lowest level of credit risk.
Aa
Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality, and are subject to very low credit risk.
A
Obligations rated A are judged to be upper-medium grade and are subject to low credit risk.
Baa
Obligations rated Baa are judged to be medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics.
Ba
Obligations rated Ba are judged to be speculative and are subject to substantial credit risk.
B
Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk.
Caa
Obligations rated Caa are judged to be speculative of poor standing and are subject to very high credit risk.
Ca
Obligations rated Ca are highly speculative and are likely in, or very near, default, with some prospect of recovery of principal and interest.
C
Obligations rated C are the lowest rated and are typically in default, with little prospect for recovery of principal or interest.




Fitch Ratings

"+" or "-" may be appended to a rating to indicate the relative position of a credit within the rating category. Such suffixes are not added to ratings in the 'AAA' category or to ratings below the 'B' category.
AAA: Exceptionally Strong
'AAA' IFS Ratings denote the lowest expectation of ceased or interrupted payments. They are assigned only in the case of exceptionally strong capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations. This capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected by foreseeable events.
AA: Very Strong
'AA' IFS Ratings denote a very low expectation of ceased or interrupted payments. They indicate very strong capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations. This capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events.
A: Strong
'A' IFS Ratings denote a low expectation of ceased or interrupted payments. They indicate strong capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations. This capacity may, nonetheless, be more vulnerable to changes in circumstances or in economic conditions than is the case for higher ratings.
BBB: Good
'BBB' IFS Ratings indicate that there is currently a low expectation of ceased or interrupted payments. The capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations on a timely basis is considered adequate, but adverse changes in circumstances and economic conditions are more likely to impact this capacity.
BB: Moderately Weak
'BB' IFS Ratings indicate that there is an elevated vulnerability to ceased or interrupted payments, particularly as the result of adverse economic or market changes over time. However, business or financial alternatives may be available to allow for policyholder and contract obligations to be met in a timely manner.
B: Weak
'B' IFS Ratings indicate two possible conditions. If obligations are still being met on a timely basis, there is significant risk that ceased or interrupted payments could occur in the future, but a limited margin of safety remains. Capacity for continued timely payments is contingent upon a sustained, favorable business and economic environment, and favorable market conditions. Alternatively, a 'B' IFS Rating is assigned to obligations that have experienced ceased or interrupted payments, but with the potential for extremely high recoveries. Such obligations would possess a recovery assessment of 'RR1' (Outstanding).
CCC: Very Weak
'CCC' IFS Ratings indicate two possible conditions. If obligations are still being met on a timely basis, there is a real possibility that ceased or interrupted payments could occur in the future. Capacity for continued timely payments is solely reliant upon a sustained, favorable business and economic environment, and favorable market conditions. Alternatively, a 'CCC' IFS Rating is assigned to obligations that have experienced ceased or interrupted payments, and with the potential for average to superior recoveries. Such obligations would possess a recovery assessment of 'RR2' (Superior), 'RR3' (Good), and 'RR4' (Average).
CC: Extremely Weak
'CC' IFS Ratings indicate two possible conditions. If obligations are still being met on a timely basis, it is probable that ceased or interrupted payments will occur in the future. Alternatively, a 'CC' IFS Rating is assigned to obligations that have experienced ceased or interrupted payments, with the potential for average to below-average recoveries. Such obligations would possess a recovery assessment of 'RR4' (Average) or 'RR5' (Below Average).
C: Distressed
'C' IFS Ratings indicate two possible conditions. If obligations are still being met on a timely basis, ceased or interrupted payments are imminent. Alternatively, a 'C' IFS Rating is assigned to obligations that have experienced ceased or interrupted payments, and with the potential for below average to poor recoveries. Such obligations would possess a recovery assessment of 'RR5' (Below Average) or 'RR6' (Poor).




Standard & Poor's

Ratings from 'AA' to 'CCC' may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories.
AAA
An insurer rated 'AAA' has extremely strong financial security characteristics. 'AAA' is the highest insurer financial strength rating assigned by Standard & Poor's.
AA
An insurer rated 'AA' has very strong financial security characteristics, differing only slightly from those rated higher.
A
An insurer rated 'A' has strong financial security characteristics, but is somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than are insurers with higher ratings. 
BBB
An insurer rated 'BBB' has good financial security characteristics, but is more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than are higher-rated insurers.
BB
An insurer rated 'BB' has marginal financial security characteristics. Positive attributes exist, but adverse business conditions could lead to insufficient ability to meet financial commitments. 
B
An insurer rated 'B' has weak financial security characteristics. Adverse business conditions will likely impair its ability to meet financial commitments. 
CCC
An insurer rated 'CCC' has very weak financial security characteristics, and is dependent on favorable business conditions to meet financial commitments. 
CC
An insurer rated 'CC' has extremely weak financial security characteristics and is likely not to meet some of its financial commitments.
