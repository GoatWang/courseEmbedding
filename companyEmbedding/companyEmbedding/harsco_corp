COMPANY NEWS

                    HARSCO SHARES IN STEEP DROP AFTER EARNINGS WARNING                
Shares of the Harsco Corporation, the steel-mill services company based in Camp Hill, Pa., plummeted 35 percent yesterday after it said that profits in the third and fourth quarters would not meet estimates as business slowed in Asia, Russia and South America. The company said after the markets closed that profit from continuing operations would be $2.35 a share for the year, 32 cents lower than analysts' estimate of $2.67. Harsco expects to report third-quarter results on Oct. 16. Its shares tumbled $12.9375, to $24.3125, in trading of 2.26 million, wiping out more than $590 million in market capitalization. Harsco's board authorized the repurchase of 2 million shares, in addition to the 400,000 shares remaining from previous buyback plans.










COMPANY NEWS

                    HARSCO TO BUY FABER PREST FOR $95 MILLION IN CASH                
The Harsco Corporation agreed yesterday to acquire Faber Prest P.L.C., which handles waste for the steel industry, for $95 million in cash as it continues to expand its international industrial businesses. Harsco, an industrial-services and manufacturing company in Camp Hill, Pa., said its Heckett Multiserv subsidiary would pay about $8.20 for each Faber Prest share. Harsco has announced two other acquisitions in the last three months: the Chemi-Trol Chemical Company for $46 million, to build its steel pressure tank business, and the EFI Corporation, a composite-cylinder business, for $7.23 million.











                    Military Contractor Sold to Buyout Firm                
The FMC Corporation and the Harsco Corporation said yesterday that they had agreed to sell United Defense L.P., a joint-venture manufacturer of tanks and other armored vehicles, to the Carlyle Group, a leveraged-buyout firm, in a transaction that seems to have as much to do with politics as economics. FMC and Harsco, which respectively own 60 percent and 40 percent of United Defense, accepted the Carlyle offer, worth $850 million, even though the companies reportedly received a higher bid worth $1 billion from the General Dynamics Corporation.










COMPANY NEWS

                    GENERAL DYNAMICS SAID TO HAVE HIGH UNITED DEFENSE BID                
The General Dynamics Corporation has reportedly bid $1 billion for United Defense L.P., an armored-vehicle business owned by the FMC Corporation and the Harsco Corporation. General Dynamics was the highest bidder, offering more than Carlyle Group in Washington, people familiar with the offers said. A final decision on the winning bidder has not been announced. The bids were disclosed yesterday in The Wall Street Journal. The acquisition would make General Dynamics the only United States armored-combat-vehicle maker and could face antitrust scrutiny. It is the only United States tank producer and one of two makers of Navy submarines and destroyers.











                    Company Briefs                
HARSCO CORP., Camp Hill, Pa., said it would merge its Sherwood brass-fittings division into the Taylor-Wharton Gas Equipment division to cut costs and add marketing channels for both businesses. The merged businesses would have more than $300 million a year in revenue.

COMPANY NEWS

                    HARSCO HAS AGREED TO ACQUIRE MULTISERV OF LONDON                
The Harsco Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire Multiserv International of London for about $380 million. The acquisition will make Harsco the leading international provider of specialized steel mill services. Multiserv will be merged into Harsco's Heckett division, which provides services in metal reclamation and slag processing, recycling and environmental technologies. Multiserv operates in 21 nations and has annual revenue of about $350 million. Harsco's earnings this year may sustain a "minimal decrease" because of the acquisition, the company said. Harsco's stock rose 37.5 cents a share yesterday, to $38.75, on the New York Stock Exchange.











                    2 Military Contractors Plan A Joint Venture on Vehicles                
In the latest sign of retrenchment among military contractors, the FMC Corporation and the Harsco Corporation, two leading manufacturers of military vehicles, said they had reached a preliminary agreement to combine those operations in a joint venture to be controlled by FMC. The two companies estimated that the venture would have sales of $1.2 billion next year. It would be 60 percent owned by FMC, a mining, machinery and chemicals conglomerate that has its corporate headquarters here. FMC's military systems group, based in Santa Clara, Calif., is by far the larger of the two operations, but its orders have been dropping. Makes Bradley Fighting Vehicle "Neither one of us wanted to commit significant new investment to the industry," said Robert N. Burt, chairman, chief executive and president of FMC, when asked about the decision to pool interests instead of arranging for one company to sell its business to the other. Mr. Burt said FMC expected Army spending on tracked and armed vehicles, the company's most important market segment, to decline from $4 billion a year ago to about $1 billion by 1995.














COMPANY NEWS

                    Harsco Order Increased by $247 Million                
The Harsco Corporation said yesterday that it had received a $247 million expanded order for five-ton trucks destined for Saudi Arabia. The order, for 2,486 trucks, came about when the Saudi Government exercised an option for more vehicles under an original order placed in February for 2,633 trucks. It was the second option exercised by the Saudis under the original contract; in May, they called for 781 more trucks.

LEAD: The Carlyle Group, the Washington-based merchant bank, has raised its stake in the Harsco Corporation to 8.47 percent from 7.25 percent.

Burt, chairman, chief executive and president of FMC, when asked about the decision to pool interests instead of arranging for one company to sell its business to the other. Mr. Burt said FMC expected Army spending on tracked and armed vehicles, the company's most important market segment, to decline from $4 billion a year ago to about $1 billion by 1995.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

                     Forward-Looking StatementsThe nature of the Company's business and the many countries in which it operates subject it to changing economic, competitive, regulatory and technological conditions, risks and uncertainties. In accordance with the "safe harbor" provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company provides the following cautionary remarks regarding important factors that, among others, could cause future results to differ materially from the results contemplated by forward-looking statements, including the expectations and assumptions expressed or implied herein. Forward-looking statements contained herein could include, among other things, statements about management's confidence in and strategies for performance; expectations for new and existing products, technologies and opportunities; and expectations regarding growth, sales, cash flows, and earnings. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of such terms as "may," "could," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "believe," "likely," "estimate," "plan" or other comparable terms. Factors that could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those implied by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (1) changes in the worldwide business environment in which the Company operates, including general economic conditions; (2) changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity and fuel costs and capital costs; (3) changes in the performance of equity and bond markets that could affect, among other things, the valuation of the assets in the Company's pension plans and the accounting for pension assets, liabilities and expenses; (4) changes in governmental laws and regulations, including environmental, occupational health and safety, tax and import tariff standards; (5) market and competitive changes, including pricing pressures, market demand and acceptance for new products, services and technologies; (6) the Company's inability or failure to protect its intellectual property rights from infringement in one or more of the many countries in which the Company operates; (7) failure to effectively prevent, detect or recover from breaches in the Company's cybersecurity infrastructure; (8) unforeseen business disruptions in one or more of the many countries in which the Company operates due to political instability, civil disobedience, armed hostilities, public health issues or other calamities; (9) disruptions associated with labor disputes and increased operating costs associated with union organization; (10) the seasonal nature of the Company's business; (11) the Company's ability to successfully enter into new contracts and complete new acquisitions or strategic ventures in the time-frame contemplated, or at all; (12) the integration of the Company's strategic acquisitions; (13) the amount and timing of repurchases of the Company's common stock, if any; (14) the prolonged recovery in global financial and credit markets and economic conditions generally, which could result in the Company's customers curtailing development projects, construction, production and capital expenditures, which, in turn, could reduce the demand for the Company's products and services and, accordingly, the Company's revenues, margins and profitability; (15) the outcome of any disputes with customers, contractors and subcontractors; (16) the financial condition of the Company's customers, including the ability of customers (especially those that may be highly leveraged and those with inadequate liquidity) to maintain their credit availability; (17) the Company's ability to successfully implement and receive the expected benefits of cost-reduction and restructuring initiatives, including the achievement of expected cost savings in the expected time frame; (18) implementation of environmental remediation matters; (19) risk and uncertainty associated with intangible assets; (20) the impact of a transaction, if any, resulting from the Company's determination to explore strategic options for the separation of the Harsco Metals & Minerals Segment; and (21) other risk factors listed from time to time in the Company's SEC reports. A further discussion of these, along with other potential risk factors, can be found in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors," of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company cautions that these factors may not be exhaustive and that many of these factors are beyond the Company's ability to control or predict. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. The Company undertakes no duty to update forward-looking statements except as may be required by law. Data provided by Nasdaq.
