This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Modine Names Scott L. Bowser Regional Vice President - Americas | Business Wire
























































Modine Names Scott L. Bowser Regional Vice President - Americas






March 18, 2009 09:20 AM Eastern Daylight Time



RACINE, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Modine Manufacturing Company (NYSE: MOD), a diversified global leader in 
      thermal management technology and solutions, today announced that Scott 
      L. Bowser has been appointed Regional Vice President – Americas 
      effective immediately. Bowser, who previously served as Managing 
      Director for the company’s Brazilian operations, succeeds Thomas G. 
      Cromwell, who has resigned from the company.
    


      Bowser, an 11-year Modine veteran, will oversee the company’s North 
      American and South American Original Equipment operations. His focus 
      will be on implementing the reorganization announced late last year and 
      continuing to drive process and productivity improvements throughout 
      those businesses.
    

      “We are very pleased to have a seasoned executive like Scott step in to 
      lead our Americas’ region during these challenging times,” said Thomas 
      A. Burke, Modine President and Chief Executive Officer. “Scott, who 
      started his Modine career as a plant manager, is a proven leader with 
      deep experience in both operations and sales. Most recently, Scott 
      successfully integrated our Brazilian operations into the Modine global 
      organization and has been actively managing the notable success in that 
      business. During his tenure, Modine Brazil nearly doubled its revenue 
      and achieved the highest gross margins among our original equipment 
      businesses globally. His broad experience uniquely qualifies him to lead 
      our Americas Original Equipment business with a demonstrated ability to 
      understand and respond to the needs of our customers.”
    

      Since joining Modine in 1998, Bowser has served in numerous operations 
      and management positions, including Plant Manager in Pemberville, Ohio; 
      General Sales Manager – Truck; and Managing Director – Modine Brazil. 
      Bowser holds an undergraduate degree in physics and mathematics from 
      Anderson College and a Master of Business Administration from Bowling 
      Green State University.
    

      Prior to Modine, Bowser served in increasingly responsible leadership 
      roles in operations, sales, and general management and ultimately as 
      president at The Pierce Company, an automotive and industrial engine 
      components manufacturer.
    

      Bowser’s successor at Modine Brazil in Sao Paulo will be named at a 
      future date.
