Energy Management to Reduce Business Cost, CA | XsunX, Inc

Home›Energy Management


Energy Management



Did you know that 40% to 60% of your utility charges can be the result of only 1% of your usage!  
That’s right, the Demand Charges on your power bill are the result of “peak” energy usage. These peaks only have to occur for brief moments at any time over your entire billing cycle to incur these fees. And, once you’ve reached certain peak levels you can be forced into more costly rate programs.
As energy costs continue to rise, an area of your business operations that can provide significant savings is energy management.
The tools we offer are essential, and inexpensive, solutions that put the power of knowledge and control in your hands to:






Track energy usage real-time
Analyze peak demand and plan reductions
Measure power usage of essential equipment
Time shift power loads
Coordinate peak usage with solar production
Lower utility based energy costs
Establish building energy benchmarks and LEED points






We couple these technologies with our premium solar systems giving you the ability to achieve net-zero energy consumption, maximize your payback, and turn your monthly electricity bill into profits.





Monitor and Manage Usage with Real-Time Data

Sees Building Interest and Improving Sales for Its Solar Canopy OfferingsMarketwiredAugust 9, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareALISO VIEJO, CA--(Marketwired - Aug 9, 2016) -  XsunX, Inc. (  OTC PINK :  XSNX ), a leading solar and energy saving technologies provider, announced today that the Company is building a growing presence in the industry with its commercial solar carport and canopy offerings. "We are amazed at the amount of interest, and recent growth in new deals, that are being generated in response to our new marketing efforts following our shift in focus to highlight the benefits of our solar carports and canopies," stated Tom Djokovich, CEO of XsunX, Inc.According to comments contributed by prospective and actual clients, the solar canopy and carport options bring serious interest where rooftop applications, in many instances, had been previously considered and passed over by clients. Mr. Djokovich continued: "This product strategy has opened a whole new realm of marketing advantages. The upsurge in the level of genuine interest specific to solar carports and canopies makes it evident that we have hit a vital segment of the market."Having focused its resources over the previous few quarters on its design and delivery capabilities for solar canopies, the Company is now experiencing sales growth tied to solar canopy sales that include raised designs allowing for commercial truck passage, storage, work area, shaded parking, and roof-top solar carport combinations. Strategically designed to deliver multi-level benefits, the Company's carports and rooftop combinations enable the optimization of the client's return on their solar investment.The Company's newly enhanced web site, www.xsunx.com, outlines detailed information regarding installation possibilities for these multi-purpose shade coverings. Having recently revamped the corporate website, the Company is aggressively marketing its canopies and their robust advantages in an effort to develop this sector where the Company foresees the potential for substantial revenues and growth.The Company has positioned itself at the leading edge of a growing sector in the renewable energy market that provides solutions unhindered by common logistical challenges associated with traditional roof-top applications. XsunX continues to develop its strategy to market to a broad range of customers where it believes it can favorably compete.About XsunX: XsunX specializes in the sale, design, and installation of solar photovoltaic power generation (PV) and energy saving technologies that provide our clients long term savings, predictability, and control of their energy costs. We install thousands of solar panels each year offering residential and commercial clients solar roof-top and carport system design and installation, battery back-up, LED lighting upgrades, and technologies to help with consumption tracking and control. We guide our performance by striving to keep the customer's best interests at the forefront at all times and, delivering value through a focus on performance and follow-through that meets or exceeds customer expectations.
