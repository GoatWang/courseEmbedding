Roy Dunbar



						Roy Dunbar is Chairman of Luminous Star, including its property development subsidiary Luminous Developments; and Sustainable Star. These companies focus on lines of business in renewable energy and property development. 


He served as Chairman and CEO of Network Solutions between February 2008 and October 2009.  Based in Herndon, Virginia, Network Solutions was the original Domain Name registrar and today provides a suite of web services for Small and Medium enterprises.  Dunbar was formerly President of Global Technology and Operations at MasterCard from 2004, also serving as a member of MasterCard's Executive Committee.


Dunbar joined MasterCard from Eli Lilly where he worked for 14 years, serving as president, Intercontinental Region, and as Chief Information Officer.  As president Intercontinental Region he oversaw all operations in the world's fastest growing economies. In particular he was focused on growing Lilly's presence in Brazil, Russia, India and China.  He had served as vice president and Chief Information Officer from 1999 to 2003 and is credited with having led Eli Lilly to rank as the most innovative user of technology in the pharmaceutical industry.

 
Born in Jamaica, Dunbar graduated from Manchester University in the United Kingdom with a pharmacy degree and a master of business administration degree from Manchester Business School in 1990.  He joined Lilly as a market research analyst in Indianapolis and subsequently served in various management roles including, marketing, sales, new product development, and information technology in the UK, Venezuela, and the United States.


 ALM Builders



						ALM Builders is the exclusive construction partner of Luminous Star. ALM has been building homes in the Greater Washington DC area for over 20 years and has many exceptional projects in its portfolio. Mr. Reza Tafti is the founder and CEO of ALM.


					
Reza Tafti



						Born in Yazd, Persia, Reza has the imprint of the spectacular architecture of this city that has been the center of Persian architectural innovation and excellence for 3,000 years. Marco Polo remarked with wonder on the city as he passed through it in the year 1272.

A citizen of the USA, Reza has lived in Iran and the United Kingdom. He has traveled extensively through Europe, Middle East, Africa, and the Americas observing architecture and building techniques.  After leading the design and engineering of his first project, a four-level apartment complex in Tehran at the age of 22, Reza has spent a career focused on design, construction, and an unique understanding of materials that make for quality construction and result in breath-taking artistry and elegance.  In fact, those who have studied his work view him most simply as an artist who happens to work with building materials.

His great skill in construction is paired with an uncommon humility and a grace of character that makes it a real joy for Luminous Star prospects to tour a project and to own a home built by him.  The level of service he provides before purchase is only a foretaste of a dedication to the project, its quality, and the after sales service that the client is thrilled to receive.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Yesterday, iGATE Corporation (NASDAQ:IGTE) saw its Director, Webster Roy Dunbar, complete a disposition of 66,000 shares in Common Stock. The sale was executed directly, for a price of $38.00 per share and the insider also exercised his use of employee stock options. While this was Dunbar’s first stock disposition of the fiscal year, other insiders at the $2.2 billion market cap information technology firm have been more active. The firm’s Chief People Officer, Srinivas Kandula, for one, sold 3,561 shares of Common Stock last Monday, for a price of $37.75 per share.
However, the most interesting scenario was found amongst this quarter’s hedge funds, many of which augmented iGate’s portfolio participation considerably. Jim Simons, for example, increased the firm’s portfolio activity by 101% this quarter, and Renaissance Technologies now owns 444,449 shares, worth $14 million. Nevertheless, the leading shareholder position remains occupied by Joel Greenblatt’s Gotham Asset Management, with 487,180 company shares and an estimated value of $15.3 million.
