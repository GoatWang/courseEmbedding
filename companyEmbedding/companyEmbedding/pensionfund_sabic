What are analysts saying about Cintas Corporation stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Cintas Corporation stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "The acquisition of G&K Services is likely to fuel Cintas’ growth momentum with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. The synergies from the combined operations are expected to yield $130 million to $140 million in cost savings from the fourth year of its operation and the transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Cintas’ earnings. The company further aims to continually achieve revenue build-up by increasing penetration levels at existing customers and broadening the customer base. Cintas’ investment strategy takes a holistic view of the rapidly evolving market and deploys a dynamic capital allocation approach to focus on the relative value of the various sectors within the broader industry. Cintas has also outperformed the industry year to date. However, volatility in raw material prices and third-party supply constraints remain potential headwinds for the company." (7/10/2017)
2. Robert W. Baird analysts commented, "Great execution improves confidence in the long-term trajectory. Another excellent quarter of execution saw organic growth rates strengthen sequentially with CTAS firing on all cylinders in an environment that remains conducive for new business wins, arguably modestly improved. Focus now shifts to GK integration with long-term synergy targets/timeline unchanged and management cognizant of need to maintain service quality to achieve. Recent GK close "bump" and expected strength tomorrow leaves less incremental near-term opportunity though conviction in the long-term preserves our rating." (3/23/2017)
3. Piper Jaffray Companies analysts commented, "Cintas reported a healthy F3Q print, with the most significant development being the successful close of the $2.2B G&K acquisition on 3/21 following recent regulatory approval. We believe the transaction is highly strategic, and will lead to meaningful cost synergies and long-term margin expansion from improved utilization of GK's processing facilities, with incremental cross-selling opportunity of CTAS' diversified solutions into GK's customer base. We believe the improved long-term operating margin outlook for CTAS is balanced by near-term EPS dilution from deal amortization and additional anticipated SAP implementation costs." (3/23/2017)
4. Deutsche Bank AG analysts commented, "Market conditions aside, we don't have a great view for how the CTAS stock reacts tomorrow as the market discounts revenue + EPS of $1,281m + $1.11 that was mixed compared to DBe/Street of $1,296m/$1,280m + $1.05/$1.07 coupled with the company unexpectedly pulling its guidance for the balance of FY-2017 after closing its previously announced'August-16'$2.2b acquisition of GK yesterday. While Cintas continues to see annualized expense synergies of $130m-$140m the fourth full year following the deal, the integration process needed to achieve the annual synergies will result in certain non-recurring costs. In addition, Cintas hasn't completed its purchase accounting, including certain third-party valuations, which may significantly impact future results. While Cintas has estimated integration costs + its purchase price accounting from its due diligence, it has to confirm these assumptions. That said, we nudge our FY 2017E EPS to $4.63 up from $4.60 due to FQ3 outperformance + offer $4.90 FY18E. IMPORTANTLY, these estimates don't factor GK operations + synergies. We maintain our Hold, but nudge our PT to $125 up from $120." (3/23/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 8 Hold Ratings, 4 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.23)Consensus Price Target: $132.73 (2.28% downside)
