Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.

                Top JetBlue Shareholders in 2017            


    By Sheila Olson | April 14, 2017 — 3:33 PM EDT    






Share





















































Back in the late 1990s, after deregulation ushered in an era of lower costs and fewer creature comforts, Brazilian American airline entrepreneur David Neeleman launched a new airline with the goal of bringing "humanity back to air travel." JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU) was incorporated in 1998 under the name NewAir and began operations in February 2000.
Today, JetBlue is the sixth largest domestic airline with a market cap of $7 billion and a fleet of 230 aircraft flying to 97 destinations. It is beloved among air travelers who rave over the free perks – unlimited brand-name drinks and snacks, in-flight WiFi, satellite radio and DirecTV, not to mention its best-in-class legroom in coach. (See also: Big Carriers Taking Aim at JetBlue Market Share.)
JetBlue went public in 2002, and as of April 12, 2017, it's trading at $21.20, averaging roughly 7 percent annual returns since the initial IPO – a tidy sum compared to the 0.20 percent for American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL) over the past 10 years. (See also: American's Stock Tumbles After Q4 Report.)
 


A major chunk of JBLU is held by institutional investors such as Vanguard, Fidelity and BlackRock, Inc. (BLK). The top individual shareholders are current and former company executives and board members. Here are the top five shareholders as of April 2017. (See also: What's Behind JetBlue's 63.5% Rise Over 10 Years?)




Dave Barger
Dave Barger was a founding member of the JetBlue team and served as CEO from 2007 to 2015, when he stepped down under mounting pressure from Wall Street. The problem, it seems, was that Barger was less concerned with capital returns and overly committed to passenger comfort at the expense of shareholders. Barger's ouster did indeed lead to a rally in JetBlue's stock. Barger owned 830,544 shares of JetBlue as of 2015. (See also: The Industry Handbook: The Airline Industry.)
Joel Clinton Peterson
Joel Clinton Peterson is chairman of JetBlue Airways, a position he's had since the company's founding in 1999, and founding partner and chairman of Peterson Partners LP, a Utah-based investment management firm. Peterson has a long relationship with David Neeleman, JetBlue's founder, and in fact, Peterson's firm also handled venture capital for Neeleman's latest airline venture, Brazilian Azul S.A. (AZUL​), which made its market debut on April 11 on the NYSE. Joel Clinton Peterson owned 569,042 shares in JetBlue as of April 3, 2017, the date of the most recent filings. (See also: Azul, Shareholders Fetch $645 Mln in Bigger-Than-Expected Brazil, U.S. IPO.)
Robin Hayes
Robin Hayes assumed the reins at JetBlue in 2015 after Barger stepped aside. Hayes was a JetBlue exec for seven years before taking over as CEO; he joined the company after a 19-year career with British Airways. Hayes has overseen the expansion of Mint, JetBlue's extremely popular premium cabin with lie-flat seats and private suites. Hayes received $2.2 million in stock awards last year in addition to his $950,000 salary. He currently owns 414,005 shares according to filings dated April 3, 2017. (See also: JetBlue's Lower-Priced First-Class Seats.)
Mark Powers
Last November, Mark Powers stepped down from his role as executive vice president and chief financial officer for JetBlue, a position he held since 2011. Under his leadership during that time, JetBlue reduced debt by over $800 million, increased free cash flow by $1.6 billion and boosted return on invested capital by 12 percent. Powers will remain in an advisory role with JetBlue until November 2017. According to filings dated March 24, 2016, Powers owns 189,734 shares of JetBlue stock. (See also: TripAdvisor Ranks the World's Best Airlines.)
Frank V. Sica
Frank Sica is JetBlue's vice chairman, a position he's held since 1998 when the company was incorporated. He's currently a partner at Tailwind Capital, a private equity firm focused primarily on health care and industrial services. Prior to that, he spent 20 years at Morgan Stanley (MS) and Soros Fund Management. He is also a trustee for the Cancer Research Institute and a director at Nautilus Neurosciences Inc. and Nextremity Solutions Inc. Sica owns 96,000 shares according to filings dated February 24, 2017. (See also: Southwest vs. Virgin vs. JetBlue: Comparing Business Models.)
