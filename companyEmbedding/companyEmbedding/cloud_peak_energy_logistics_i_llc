Cloud Peak Energy Modifies Throughput and Transportation Agreements 
      with Westshore Terminals and BNSF Railway






February 15, 2017 04:13 PM Eastern Standard Time



GILLETTE, Wyo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cloud Peak Energy Inc. (NYSE:CLD), one of the largest U.S. coal 
      producers and the only pure-play Powder River Basin (“PRB”) coal 
      company, today announced that Cloud Peak Energy Logistics LLC replaced 
      its throughput agreement with Westshore Terminals Limited Partnership 
      (TMX: WTE) and its transportation agreement with BNSF Railway Company 
      (“BNSF”).
    


      Under the new agreements, which are effective commencing January 2017 
      for the throughput agreement and April 2017 for the transportation 
      agreement, Cloud Peak Energy made upfront payments and also committed to 
      minimum payments through 2018. The outstanding undiscounted commitments 
      are approximately $51 million through the current two year term of these 
      agreements.
    

      Both agreements provide that the parties may extend the agreements 
      through the end of 2019 if elected. In addition, Westshore has certain 
      priority rights on throughput capacity in respect of any export 
      shipments by Cloud Peak Energy through 2024. The original throughput and 
      transportation agreements and underlying take-or-pay commitments, which 
      have now been replaced, previously would have expired at the end of 2024.
    

      “Westshore and BNSF are critical parts of our effort to maintain a 
      viable long-term Asian export business. We value our strong 
      relationships with Westshore and BNSF and appreciate their willingness 
      to work with us. We believe in the long-term opportunity for Asian 
      exports of Powder River Basin coal,” said Colin Marshall, Cloud Peak 
      Energy’s President and Chief Executive Officer.

      This release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of 
      the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 
      and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking 
      statements are not statements of historical facts and often contain 
      words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “plan,” 
      “estimate,” “seek,” “could,” “should,” “intend,” “potential,” or words 
      of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements are based on management's 
      current expectations and beliefs as well as assumptions and estimates 
      regarding our company, industry, economic conditions, government 
      regulations, energy policies and other factors. Forward-looking 
      statements include the timing and volumes of any future Asian export 
      shipments, market conditions and growth opportunities for Asian exports 
      of Powder River Basin coal and other statements regarding the expected 
      benefits of this transaction and our plans, strategies, prospects and 
      expectations concerning our business, industry, economic conditions, 
      operating results, financial condition and other matters that do not 
      relate strictly to historical facts. These statements are subject to 
      significant risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to 
      predict and could cause actual results to differ materially and 
      adversely from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking 
      statements, including government energy and tax policies and the 
      political and regulatory environment impacting coal-fired generation and 
      exports of U.S. thermal coal, economic and industry conditions, demand 
      by Asian utilities for our coal and competition from other producers of 
      coal and sources of electricity generation, Newcastle benchmark prices 
      and prices we receive for delivered export sales, rail and terminal 
      performance and availability required to deliver our export tons, 
      demurrage costs, the impact of future take-or-pay commitments and other 
      factors. For a discussion of some of the additional factors that could 
      adversely affect our future results or the anticipated benefits of this 
      transaction, refer to the risk factors described from time to time in 
      the reports and registration statements we file with the Securities and 
      Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including those in Item 1A - Risk Factors 
      in our most recent Form 10-K and any updates thereto in our Forms 10-Q 
      and current reports on Forms 8-K. There may be other risks and 
      uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently 
      believe are not material. We make forward-looking statements based on 
      currently available information, and we assume no obligation to, and 
      expressly disclaim any obligation to, update or revise publicly any 
      forward-looking statements made in this release, whether as a result of 
      new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

Cloud Peak Energy Logistics LLC Key Developments

Cloud Peak Energy Modifies Throughput and Transportation Agreements with Westshore Terminals and BNSF Railway Company
Feb 15 17
Cloud Peak Energy Inc. announced that Cloud Peak Energy Logistics LLC replaced its throughput agreement with Westshore Terminals Limited Partnership and its transportation agreement with BNSF Railway Company (BNSF). Under the new agreements, which are effective commencing January 2017 for the throughput agreement and April 2017 for the transportation agreement, Cloud Peak Energy made upfront payments and also committed to minimum payments through 2018. The outstanding undiscounted commitments are approximately $51 million through the current two year term of these agreements. Both agreements provide that the parties may extend the agreements through the end of 2019 if elected. In addition, Westshore has certain priority rights on throughput capacity in respect of any export shipments by Cloud Peak Energy through 2024. The original throughput and transportation agreements and underlying take-or-pay commitments, which have now been replaced, previously would have expired at the end of 2024.


Cloud Peak Energy Logistics LLC Amends Throughput Agreement with Westshore Terminals Limited Partnership to Address Depressed International Conditions
Oct 28 15
Cloud Peak Energy Inc. announced that Cloud Peak Energy Logistics LLC entered into an amended throughput agreement with Westshore Terminals Limited Partnership to eliminate both parties’ volume obligations for the period 2016 through 2018 in exchange for a series of payments. Under the amended agreement, Cloud Peak Energy made an upfront payment to Westshore and will make quarterly payments from 2016 through 2018 in lieu of the previous take-or-pay commitments during this three-year period. If this amendment were in effect as of September 30, 2015, the company’s outstanding undiscounted port take-or-pay commitments at that time would have been approximately $454 million through the remaining term of the agreement if they do not ship any export tons. Except as amended, the original throughput agreement remains in place through the end of 2024. The parties will meet on a quarterly basis during the next several years to discuss market conditions and any potential shipments and the terms for any shipments. If export shipments do not occur, it is expected that Spring Creek Mine production volumes will be reduced accordingly.

About Us
Our Mission Statement
Cloud Peak Energy aims to be a leading energy producer operating in a safe, responsible and caring manner.

We will operate in accordance with our values.
We will not lose sight of our goal of maximizing the long-term financial return to our shareholders.
We believe that by ensuring the safety and long-term health of our employees are not compromised and that by being a good neighbor in the communities in which we live and work, value will be maximized.
We will run the business in a sustainable way to ensure we maintain our “license to operate” (i.e. support of employees, communities, regulators, elected officials, customers, suppliers).

Our current strategy is to build on our strong US domestic position to develop our export sales and explore international production opportunities.



Our Values
Cloud Peak Energy’s values are the underlying principles that guide the way we do business. We will hold each other accountable to not deviate from these values in all our business dealings.
Safety – The safety of everyone involved in our business will never be compromised.
Caring – We care about the impact of our actions on people and the environment both inside and outside the company.
Honesty – We are honest and transparent in all interactions with each other and those outside the company.
Courage – We will be courageous in all our dealings and will hold ourselves accountable for our actions and not avoid difficult issues.
Respect – We will show respect to all those involved in every interaction and work to engage all our employees in the business.

(CLD), one of the largest U.S. coal producers and the only pure-play Powder River Basin (“PRB”) coal company, today announced that Cloud Peak Energy Logistics LLC replaced its throughput agreement with Westshore Terminals Limited Partnership (TMX:WTE) and its transportation agreement with BNSF Railway Company (“BNSF”).Under the new agreements, which are effective commencing January 2017 for the throughput agreement and April 2017 for the transportation agreement, Cloud Peak Energy made upfront payments and also committed to minimum payments through 2018. The outstanding undiscounted commitments are approximately $51 million through the current two year term of these agreements.Both agreements provide that the parties may extend the agreements through the end of 2019 if elected. In addition, Westshore has certain priority rights on throughput capacity in respect of any export shipments by Cloud Peak Energy through 2024. The original throughput and transportation agreements and underlying take-or-pay commitments, which have now been replaced, previously would have expired at the end of 2024.“Westshore and BNSF are critical parts of our effort to maintain a viable long-term Asian export business. We value our strong relationships with Westshore and BNSF and appreciate their willingness to work with us. We believe in the long-term opportunity for Asian exports of Powder River Basin coal,” said Colin Marshall, Cloud Peak Energy’s President and Chief Executive Officer.About Cloud Peak Energy®Cloud Peak Energy Inc.
