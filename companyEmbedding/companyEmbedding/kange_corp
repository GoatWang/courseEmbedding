We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common stock offered
through this prospectus by the selling shareholders.


The use of mobile applications has increased in recent years due to the
introduction 3G and 4G. Smartphones running operating systems like Apple’s
iPhone, Google’s Android, and RIM’s Blackberry. These devices allow the download
of mobile applications to do everything from getting news and weather, to play
games, engage in social networking activities, or shop directly from
smartphones, and much more.

We believe that there are sufficient numbers of potential end users for the
applications we plan to build. We hope that we can provide a relatively low cost
solution to our customers available in the Apple App Store or for android
platform, giving them additional resources to market themselves.

BiznessApps offers a similar application for a starting cost of $59.00 per
month. A similar competitor is MutualMobile, who concentrates more on
development of mobile applications for larger companies. We believe that by
concentrating on small business owners in the industries of music and the arts,
we can provide an affordable solution for a personalized and customizable mobile
application for Apple’s iOS platform and for the android platform.

The market for iPhone 5S/5/iPod Touch mobile applications is highly competitive.
There are many international companies who are in business of developing
applications software. Some of those companies are well established companies
with large client base. We will attempt to compete with these competitors by
working with smaller business owners and give them a more personalized service.
We expect competition to continue to intensify in the future. Competitors
include companies with substantial customer bases and working history. There can
be no assurance that we can maintain a competitive position against current or
future competitors, particularly those with greater financial, marketing,
service, support, technical and other resources. Our failure to maintain a
competitive position within the market could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and
future competitors, and competitive pressures faced by us may have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


Company Description
We are a development stage company and we intend to commence business operations
in developing and selling mobile software products, for Apple and android
platforms. To date, we have not begun any business operations other than the
development of a business plan and the execution of an agreement.


 We executed an
agreement with a software developer, Aleksandr Mihailishin. We also began
developing the website www.kangecorp.com. We are a development stage company. We
cannot state with certainty whether we will achieve profitability. We do not
have revenues or operations; we have minimal assets and have incurred losses
since Inception (August 16, 2013).
---

KANGE CORP. anticipates that it will derive its income from the sale of software
products. Specifically, customers will be charged an initial fee to download our
basic software product. Additional software features will be available for
additional charges. Additionally, customers will be charged ongoing monthly fees
for continued use of our products and additional fees for, software upgrades and
other software modifications. We do not anticipate earning revenues until we
enter into commercial operation. Since we are presently in the development stage
of our business, we can provide no assurance that we will successfully sell any
products or mobile applications related to our planned activities.

The Company plans to develop and market software product for small business
owners as a mobile application for end users of the current generation iPhone
5S, 5, iPad from Apple, Inc. Additionally we plan to develop for the
applications for android platform. The mobile application’s digital content will
be customizable by the owner of the particular device using our software. As of
the date of this prospectus, neither our initial mobile application nor any
other application has been developed to the point that we can describe
specifically its nature and scope.
---

KANGE CORP. was incorporated in Nevada on August 16, 2013. Our principal
executive office is located at 848 N.Rainbow Blvd #3435, Las Vegas, NV,
