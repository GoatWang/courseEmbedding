FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

• Reduces time-to-market/manufacturing costs
• Allows single Bill-of-Material (BOM) for worldwide applications

Diagnostics
Employing a full suite of loop-backs, Exar devices can quickly identify a fault location, invoke a complete set of alarms, and easily determine the fault type for the network operator. This detection and diagnostic capability is critical to reliable data transmission. Exar's PDH products have the several client and facility side loop-backs for each function providing designers with a built-in diagnostic solution for the physical layer. A suite of Performance Monitoring (PMON) counters keep track of the integrity of each of section of the links.
Temperature
All of Exar's T/E Carrier and DS3/E3 products are industrial grade with a temperature of -40ºC to +85ºC.
Innovative Features
Redundancy
Internal switches help to implement 1:1 or 1+1 redundancy without the need for any relays, which helps to reduce cost and board space while improving reliability.
Hot Swapping
Exar's LIUs not only support 1:1 or 1+1 redundancy, but also support hot swapping without relays.
Integrated Timing Generators
An on-board timing circuit generates the appropriate system clocks from a single crystal. This again eliminates the need to change any components externally.
Design Flexibility
Choice of Host (software) or Hardware mode for interfacing and control provide design flexibility.


Extensive Diagnostic Capability
System users can quickly isolate a fault location, use alarms, and determine the nature of the fault.
