        Thursday, October 29, 2015 at 4:45pm
      




Plant Science Building, 233


This lecture will be presented by Jon Godsmark, Senior Vice President at Ernst & Young Infrastructure Advisors, LLC, an affiliate of Ernst & Young LLP and is part of its US infrastructure advisory group. He has experience providing strategic and financial advice to state and local governments on infrastructure projects in the US, UK, UAE and Bermuda, across a range of sectors including utilities, renewable energy, transportation, healthcare and justice. His advice has included helping governments analyze different financial and commercial structures for building new infrastructure or leveraging existing infrastructure to benefit the local region. These engagements have resulted in the development of projects using a variety of delivery structures including Design-Build-Operate-Maintain, Design-Build-Finance, User fee Concession and Availability Payments utilizing finance from tax-exempt toll revenue bonds, TIFIA, State Infrastructure Bank, bank debt and private equity.
Representative projects that Jon has advised include: I-95 HOT Lanes Project in Virginia, Bermuda’s King Edward VII Memorial Hospital Redevelopment Project, and the Palm Jumeirah Monorail in Dubai, UAE.
Jon received a BSc. (Hons) in Management from the London School of Economics and Political Science and is a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.

We can assist our clients in devising and comparing financial plans and delivery approaches for projects that involve public, federal or private financing, project revenues and/or grants — and provide support to our clients in their implementation of those plans.

For governmental clients considering new systems, major expansions, significant renewal work and/or PPP initiatives, we can assist in the development of long-term investment plans, as well as agency-wide programs and policy frameworks.	Our credentials	We often help clients navigate the array of potential public and private options so that they can accelerate projects and achieve efficient, innovative and ultimately successful outcomes — all while protecting the public interest.

LibraryContactsManaging capital and transactions in a changing world    16th US Capital Confidence Barometer 			Despite greater macro tumult than ever before, US executives are solidly optimistic, showing a meaningful increase in new deal activity since the start of 2017.     Using divestments to capitalize on disruption 			Unprecedented geopolitical uncertainty and technological change are making portfolio and divestment strategy more vital than ever. Read about leading practices in our Global Divestment Study.  Need to make better and more-informed decisions about how to strategically manage capital and transactions in a changing world? Let us help.	The Capital Agenda puts your capital needs at the heart of our strategy and focuses on the issues that matter most to you:               		Raising capital 		A company’s ability to raise capital quickly and effectively is integral to its growth potential and financial well-being. This is true in good times and in bad. 		Whatever the motivation for raising capital, companies can access new funds more effectively if they have planned ahead. They should know how and where they could access capital, if they need it. 		The focus should be:  			Fundraising (equity and debt): IPO readiness, right issues, PE, private placement and capital markets 			Optimizing funding structures 			Asset divestment 			Infrastructure projects 			Cost- and tax-efficient structures   See how we can help. × 		Investing capital 		Investors in your organization want to know why: why this transaction, why at this price and why now? 		Complicating matters, differing stakeholders increasingly bring differing expectations of investments and returns. 		The focus should be:  			Acquisition and alliances 			Delivery of synergies and effective integration 			Planning and structuring transactions to optimize stakeholder return 			Focused due diligence to mitigate risk and drive value 			Asset valuations 			Cost- and tax-efficient structures   See how we can help. × 		Preserving capital 		Every business needs to continuously assess the potential impact of evolving market conditions on the performance of its operations and its capital base. Even in a recovering market, companies believing themselves in a stable position can find their situation can change. 		The preservation of capital requires that companies continuously scour their strategies, markets and balance sheets to reassess strengths and weaknesses. 		The focus should be:  			Stress and distress — e.g., liquidity issues and turnaround plan 			Customer and supplier analysis 			Preserving tax assets and minimizing costs 			Refinancing and restructuring debt, equity and other obligations 			Dealing with stakeholder relationships and pressure 			Dispute resolution   See how we can help. × 		Optimizing capital 		Today’s economic climate is forcing businesses to candidly assess their financial fitness. 		More than a mere review of operations, companies today must conduct objective assessments of the alignment of their business strategies. 		The focus should be:  			Optimizing asset portfolio 			Delivery of synergies and effective integration 			Improving working capital and releasing cash 			Optimizing capital structure 			Optimizing tax and corporate structure   See how we can help. ×	 Related contentTransformation through M&A: US outlook Companies will use M&A to alter their DNA in 2017 as they remain focused on deals, joint ventures and alliances for fast and strategic solutions, notes EY.2017 Global Private Equity Survey PE firms have had to dedicate significant resources to non-investment-related tasks.
