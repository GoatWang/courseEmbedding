Dr. Sara’s Genius Bar:  The Best Natural Beauty Brands
By Sara Gottfried MD 







Since I talk so much about the importance of clean eating, I think it’s only fair to also address “clean beauty” – and how important it is to choose natural products for your hair, skin, and body.
I won’t lie: It’s easy to get confused these days. Labels like “natural,” “chemical free,” “noncomedogenic” (the products don’t block pores) or “for sensitive skin” can fool us into thinking we’re buying something safe. But that’s not always the case. According to the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, about 89 percent of the ingredients in all cosmetics (soaps, lotions, makeup, etc.) haven’t been evaluated by any publicly accountable agency or institution.
Yikes!
But if you do your homework, it’s not hard to find companies that both use safe ingredients and create products that actually perform well. Luckily, you don’t have to go digging around the Internet to find them, since I already have a few favorites I can strongly recommend.
 
Here are four natural beauty companies that might just inspire a medicine cabinet sweep of those conventional brands:
 
Julie Elliott’s In Fiore
How does, “total floral seduction for your skin and your soul” sound? Heavenly, right? In Fiore’s products are crafted by the talented Julie Elliott, who marries the aromas and healing properties of floral essences with luxurious oils and botanicals. Translation: lotions and potions that are safe, potent and smell oh-so-delicious. http://infiore.net/
 
Josie Maran
Using argan oil as her signature ingredient, model-turned-entrepreneur Josie Maran wanted to create a beauty brand that embodied “luxury with a conscience” – and I think she hit the nail on the head. Her products are completely natural, the ingredients are sourced in ethical ways, and even her packaging is eco-friendly. Everything from nail wipes and hair serum to lipstick and daily SPF is on the menu. http://www.josiemarancosmetics.com/
 
Tarte
A complete makeup and skincare line, Tarte cosmetics are my go-to products when I’m not really in the mood to go au naturale (like when I have a photo shoot or a hot date with the hubby). They’re free of the usual offenders (parabens, mineral oil, phlalates), and they’re also completely gluten-free – an added bonus for people with extreme gluten allergies. If you sign up for their newsletter, you also get 20 percent off your first order: http://tartecosmetics.com/
 
Annmarie Gianni
You know that intoxicating aroma you smell when you walk into a beauty spa? Annmarie’s products use aromatherapy to help soothe and uplift your mood while simultaneously beautifying your bod. Her hand-blended line of natural skin oils, scrubs and serums are free of synthetic chemicals or dangerous additives – nothing but nature’s ingredients. Best part? She’s offering a super-special discount to my readers! For a limited time, you can grab one of her sample kits for just $10 – and get FREE shipping to boot! 
I love that we have so many options these days when it comes to natural beauty products, and these brands definitely pass the tests of quality and safety. Share the good word with your sisters, your gal pals – even your grandma – because every woman has the right to be confident about what’s she’s putting on her skin.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
