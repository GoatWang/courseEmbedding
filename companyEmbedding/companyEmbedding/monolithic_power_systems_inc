Our values:
We cultivate creativity
As a company we believe in creating an environment that encourages and challenges our employees to collaborate and think outside the box to excel beyond their preconceived capabilities.
We do not accept the status quo
We do not believe in limitations. It is not about what is, but what can be. Possibilities are endless at MPS.
We are passionate about sustainability
It's about the future. From materials to finances, we are committed to conservation. We will not tolerate waste in an effort to improve and preserve
the quality of life.
We are committed to providing innovative products to our customers.
Let us do the heavy lifting. We strive relentlessly to make system design versatile and effortless to meet our customers' specific needs. We'll do the
work, so our customers can have the fun!

Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. was founded in 1997 by Michael Hsing, who is the current CEO. Prior to the founding of the corporation, Michael worked as a Senior Silicon Technology Developer at several analog integrated circuit companies.
In May 1998, the company launched a single-chip solution for powering CCFL backlighting in Notebook computers. The product substantially reduced the total solution cost and design complexity, as well as significantly improved power conversion.[4]
The company then diversified into DC/DC products, which again reset the industry standard. In November 2004, Michael took the company IPO. Since then, the company has grown to 6 product lines with more than 1000 products.[5][6]
