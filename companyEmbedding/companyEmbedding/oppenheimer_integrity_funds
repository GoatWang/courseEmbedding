1. 
Special Risks: Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks. Emerging and developing market investments may be especially volatile. Eurozone investments may be subject to volatility and liquidity issues.  Investments in securities of growth companies may be volatile.  Mid-sized company stock is typically more volatile than that of larger company stock.  It may take a substantial period of time to realize a gain on an investment in a mid-sized company, if any gain is realized at all. Diversification does not guarantee profit or protect against loss.




2. 
As of 4/12/13, the purchase and exchange of Fund shares is restricted, subject to certain exceptions.  Please see the prospectus for further information.

Special Risks:  Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks. Emerging and developing market investments may be especially volatile. Eurozone investments may be subject to volatility and liquidity issues.  Investments in securities of growth companies may be volatile.  Mid-sized company stock is typically more volatile than that of larger company stock.  It may take a substantial period of time to realize a gain on an investment in a mid-sized company, if any gain is realized at all. Investing significantly in a particular region, industry, sector or issuer may increase volatility and risk.



4. 
Special Risks: Investing in MLPs involves additional risks as compared to the risks of investing in common stock, including risks related to cash flow, dilution and voting rights. The Fund’s investments are concentrated in the energy infrastructure industry with an emphasis on securities issued by MLPs, which may increase volatility. Energy infrastructure companies are subject to risks specific to the industry such as fluctuations in commodity prices, reduced volumes of natural gas or other energy commodities, environmental hazards, changes in the macroeconomic or the regulatory environment or extreme weather. MLPs may trade less frequently than larger companies due to their smaller capitalizations which may result in erratic price movement or difficulty in buying or selling. Additional management fees and other expenses are associated with investing in MLP funds.

The Fund is subject to certain MLP tax risks. An investment in the Fund does not offer the same tax benefits of a direct investment in an MLP. The Fund is organized as a Subchapter “C” Corporation and is subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income at the corporate tax rate (currently as high as 35%) as well as state and local income taxes. The potential tax benefit of investing in MLPs depend on them being treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. If the MLP is deemed to be a corporation, its income would be subject to federal taxation at the entity level, reducing the amount of cash available for distribution which could result in a reduction of the fund’s value. MLP funds accrue deferred income taxes for future tax liabilities associated with the portion of MLP distributions considered to be a tax-deferred return of capital and for any net operating gains as well as capital appreciation of its investments. This deferred tax liability is reflected in the daily NAV and as a result a MLP fund's after-tax performance could differ significantly from the underlying assets even if the pre-tax performance is closely tracked.

The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer.

The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer.

To the extent that a Fund obtains leverage through borrowings, there will be the potential for greater gains and the risk of magnified losses.


6. 
Special Risks: Senior loans are typically lower-rated and may be illiquid investments (which may not have a ready market).  The Fund may invest without limit in below-investment-grade securities.  The Fund may invest a variable amount in debt rated below "B." May invest 25% or more of its assets in securities issued by companies in the financial services sector which may be susceptible to economic and regulatory events, and increased volatility.   Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks.  Fixed income investing entails credit and interest rate risks. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall, and the Fund’s share prices can fall. Derivative instruments entail higher volatility and risk of loss compared to traditional stock or bond investments. Leverage (borrowing) involves transaction and interest costs on amounts borrowed, which may reduce performance.


7. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund. The alternate weighting approach employed by the Fund (i.e., using revenues as a weighting measure), while designed to enhance potential returns, may not produce the desired results. Because the Fund is rebalanced quarterly, portfolio turnover may exceed 100%. The greater the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which could have an adverse effect on Fund performance.


8. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. There is no guarantee that the issuers of stocks will declare dividends in the future, or that dividends will remain at their current levels or increase over time. The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer. Investing significantly in a particular region, industry, sector or issuer may increase volatility and risk. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund.

Because the Fund is rebalanced quarterly, portfolio turnover may exceed 100%. The greater the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which could have an adverse effect on Fund performance.

This is a new fund with a limited history and an inception date of 10/28/16.


10. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. The stocks of companies with favorable ESG practices may underperform the stock market as a whole. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund. The alternate weighting approach employed by the Fund (i.e., using revenues as a weighting measure), while designed to enhance potential returns, may not produce the desired results. Because the Fund is rebalanced quarterly, portfolio turnover may exceed 100%. The greater the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which could have an adverse effect on Fund performance.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the Commission's Public Reference Branch, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549-0102 (tel. (202) 942-8090). 
Applicants' Representations 
1. The Companies are organized as Massachusetts business trusts, Maryland corporations, or, in the case of Centennial America Fund, L.P., a limited partnership under the laws of the state of Delaware, and are registered under the Act as open-end management investment companies.[1] 
           The business and affairs of each Company are managed under the directions of the board of trustees or directors or, in the case of Centennial America Fund, L.P., the managing general partners of the relevant Company (“Board”).
2. Each of OFI and CAMC, a wholly owned subsidiary of OFI, is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Each Oppenheimer Fund has entered into an investment advisory agreement with OFI, and each Centennial Fund has entered into an investment advisory agreement with CAMC. OFI also provides the Funds with certain administrative services. 
3. Each Fund may deposit uninvested daily cash balances into a joint account administered by OFI (“Joint Account”). Each Fund may lend money to banks or other entities by entering into repurchase agreements either directly or through the Joint Account. Other Funds may need to borrow money from the same or similar banks for temporary purposes to satisfy redemption requests, to cover unanticipated cash shortfalls such as a trade “fail” in which cash Start Printed Page 62505payment for a security sold by a Fund has been delayed, or for other temporary purposes. Currently, the Funds have credit arrangements with their custodians (i.e., overdraft protection) under which the custodians may, but are not obligated to, lend money to the Funds to meet the Funds' temporary cash needs. Many of the Funds also have entered into loan agreements with banks to provide a line of credit for temporary funding.
4. If the Funds were to borrow money from their custodians under their current arrangements or under other credit facility arrangements with a bank, the Funds would pay interest on the borrowed cash at a rate which would be higher than the rate that would be earned by other non-borrowing Funds on investments in repurchase agreements and other short-term instruments of the same maturity as the bank loan. Applicants believe this differential represents the bank's profit. Other bank loan arrangements, such as committed lines of credit, would require the Funds to pay commitment fees, attorney fees and related costs in addition to the interest rate to be paid by the borrowing Fund. 
5. Applicants request an order that would permit the Funds to enter into master interfund lending agreements (“Interfund Lending Agreements”) under which the Funds would lend money and borrow money for temporary purposes directly to and from each other (an “Interfund Loan”). Applicants believe that the proposed credit facility would substantially reduce the Funds' potential borrowing costs and enhance their ability to earn higher rates of interest on short-term lendings. Although the proposed credit facility would substantially reduce the Funds' need to borrow from banks, the Funds would be free to continue committed lines of credit or other borrowing arrangements with banks. The Funds also would continue to maintain overdraft protection currently provided by their custodians. 
6. Applicants anticipate that the credit facility would provide a borrowing Fund with significant savings when the cash position of the Fund is insufficient to meet temporary cash requirements. This situation could arise when redemptions exceed anticipated volumes and the Funds have insufficient cash on hand to satisfy such redemptions. When a Fund liquidates portfolio securities to meet redemption requests, which normally are effected immediately, it often does not receive payment in settlement for up to three days (or longer for certain foreign transactions). The credit facility would provide a source of immediate, short-term liquidity pending settlement of the sale of portfolio securities. 
7. Applicants also propose using the credit facility when a sale of securities fails due to circumstances beyond the seller's control, such as a delay in the delivery of cash to the Fund's custodian or improper delivery instructions by the broker effecting the transaction. Sales fails may present a cash shortfall if the Fund has undertaken to purchase a security with the proceeds from securities sold. When the Fund experiences a cash shortfall due to a sales fail, the custodian typically extends temporary credit to cover the shortfall and the Fund incurs overdraft charges. Alternatively, the Fund could fail on its intended purchase due to lack of funds from the previous sale, resulting in additional cost to the Fund, or sell a security on a same day settlement basis, earning a lower return on the investment. Use of the credit facility under these circumstances would enable the Fund to have access to immediate short-term liquidity without incurring custodian overdraft or other charges. 
8. While bank borrowings could generally supply needed cash to cover unanticipated redemptions and sales fails, under the proposed credit facility, a borrowing Fund would pay lower interest rates than those offered by banks on short-term loans. In addition, Funds making short-term cash loans directly to other Funds would earn interest at a rate higher than they otherwise could obtain from investing their cash in repurchase agreements. Thus, applicants believe that the proposed credit facility would benefit both borrowing and lending Funds. 
9. The interest rate charged to the Funds on any loan under the credit facility (the “Interfund Loan Rate”) would be the average of the Joint Account Repo Rate and the Bank Loan Rate, both as defined below. The Joint Account Repo Rate would be the current overnight repurchase agreement rate available through the Joint Account. The Bank Loan Rate would be calculated by OFI each day that a Fund borrows or lends, according to a formula established by each Fund's Board to approximate the lowest interest rate at which bank loans would be available to the Funds. The formula would be based upon a publicly available rate (e.g., federal funds plus 25 basis points) and would vary with this rate so as to reflect changing bank loan rates. Each Fund's Board periodically would review the continuing appropriateness of using the formula to determine the Bank Loan Rate, as well as the relationship between the Bank Loan Rate and current bank loan rates that would be available to the Funds. The initial formula and any subsequent modifications to the formula would be subject to the approval of each Fund's Board. 
10. The credit facility would be administered by OFI's fund accounting department (collectively, the “Cash Management Team”). Under the proposed credit facility, the portfolio managers for each participating Fund could provide standing instructions to participate daily as a borrower or lender. OFI on each business day would collect data on the uninvested cash and borrowing requirements of all participating Funds from the Funds' custodian. Once it had determined the aggregate amount of cash available for loans and borrowing demand, the Cash Management Team would allocate loans among borrowing Funds without any further communication from portfolio managers. There typically will be far more available uninvested cash each day than borrowing demand. Therefore, after allocating cash for Interfund Loans, OFI will invest any remaining cash in accordance with the standing instructions from portfolio managers or return remaining amounts for investment directly by the relevant Funds. The money market Funds typically would not participate as borrowers because they rarely need to borrow cash to meet redemptions. 
11. The Cash Management Team would allocate borrowing demand and cash available for lending among the Funds on what the Cash Management Team believed to be an equitable basis, subject to certain administrative procedures applicable to all Funds, such as the time of filing requests to participate, minimum loan lot sizes, and the need to minimize the number of transactions and associated administrative costs. To reduce transaction costs, each loan normally would be allocated in a manner intended to minimize the number of participants necessary to complete the loan transaction. The method of allocation and related administrative procedures would be approved by each Fund's Board, including a majority of trustees/directors who are not “interested persons” of the Fund, as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Act (“Independent Trustees/Directors”), to ensure that both borrowing and lending Funds participate on an equitable basis. 
12. OFI would (a) monitor the interest rates charged and the other terms and conditions of the loans, (b) limit the borrowings and loans entered into by each Fund to ensure that they comply with the Fund's investment policies and Start Printed Page 62506limitations, (c) ensure equitable treatment of each Fund, and (d) make quarterly reports to the Board concerning any transactions by the Funds under the credit facility and the interest rates charged.
13. OFI will administer the program under its (or CAMC's) existing investment advisory agreement with each Fund, and OFI would receive no additional compensation from its administration of the proposed credit facility. OFI or companies affiliated with it may collect standard pricing, record keeping, accounting and bookkeeping fees applicable to repurchase and lending transactions generally, including transactions effected through the credit facility. Fees would be no higher than those applicable for comparable loan transactions. 
14. Each Fund's participation in the proposed credit facility is either currently consistent with its organizational documents and its investment policies and limitations, or such documents, policies and limitations will be amended or modified to be made consistent with the Fund's participation. The prospectus of each Fund discloses the extent to which the Fund may borrow money for temporary purposes and lend securities and other assets and the extent to which the Fund is able to mortgage or pledge securities to secure permitted borrowings. If the requested relief is granted, the statement of additional information (“SAI”) of each Fund participating in the interfund lending arrangements will disclose the existence of such arrangements. Each Fund that desires to engage in interfund lending arrangements, and that has existing fundamental policies that would restrict participation in such arrangements, will obtain shareholder approval to amend such policies to the extent necessary to permit it to participate in such arrangements on the conditions set forth in the application. 
15. In connection with the credit facility, applicants request an order under (a) section 6(c) of the Act granting relief from sections 18(f) and 21(b) of the Act; (b) section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act granting relief from section 12(d)(1) of the Act; (c) sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act granting relief from sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(3) of the Act; and (d) section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act to permit certain joint arrangements. 
Applicants' Legal Analysis 
1. Section 17(a)(3) generally prohibits any affiliated person, or affiliated person of an affiliated person, from borrowing money or other property from a registered investment company. Section 21(b) generally prohibits any registered management investment company from lending money or other property to any person if that person controls or is under common control with the company. Section 2(a)(3)(C) of the Act defines “affiliated person” of another person, in part, to be any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, such other person. Applicants state that the Funds may be under common control by virtue of having OFI or CAMC, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of OFI, as their common investment adviser. 
2. Section 6(c) provides that an exemptive order may be granted where an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Section 17(b) authorizes the Commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) of the Act provided that the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, and the transaction is consistent with the policy of the investment company as recited in its registration statement and with the general purposes of the Act. Applicants believe that the proposed arrangements satisfy these standards for the reasons discussed below. 
3. Applicants submit that sections 17(a)(3) and 21(b) were intended to prevent a person with strong potential adverse interests to, and some influence over the investment decisions of, a registered investment company from causing or inducing the investment company to engage in lending transactions that unfairly inure to the benefit of that person and that are detrimental to the best interests of the investment company and its shareholders. Applicants assert that the proposed credit facility transactions do not raise these concerns because (a) OFI would administer the program as a disinterested fiduciary; (b) all Interfund Loans would consist only of uninvested cash reserves that the Fund otherwise would invest in short-term repurchase agreements or other short-term instruments; (c) the Interfund Loans would not involve a greater risk than such other investments; (d) the lending Fund would receive interest at a rate higher than it could obtain through such other investments; and (e) the borrowing Fund would pay interest at a rate lower than otherwise available to it under its bank loan agreements and avoid the up-front commitment fees associated with committed lines of credit. Moreover, applicants believe that the other conditions in the application would effectively preclude the possibility of any Fund obtaining an undue advantage over any other Fund. 
4. Section 17(a)(1) generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or an affiliated person of an affiliated person, from selling any securities or other property to the company. Section 12(d)(1) generally makes it unlawful for a registered investment company to purchase or otherwise acquire any security issued by any other investment company except in accordance with the limitations set forth in that section. Applicants state that the obligation of a borrowing Fund to repay an Interfund Loan may constitute a security under sections 17(a)(1) and 12(d)(1). Section 12(d)(1)(J) provides that the Commission may exempt persons or transactions from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if and to the extent such exception is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. Applicants contend that the standards under sections 6(c), 17(b) and 12(d)(1)(J) are satisfied for all the reasons set forth above in support of their request for relief from sections 17(a)(3) and 21(b) and for the reasons discussed below. 
5. Applicants state that section 12(d)(1) was intended to prevent the pyramiding of investment companies in order to avoid duplicative costs and fees attendant upon multiple layers of investment companies. Applicants submit that the proposed credit facility does not involve these abuses. Applicants note that there would be no duplicative costs or fees to the Funds or shareholders, and that OFI would receive no additional compensation for its services in administering the credit facility. Applicants also note that the purpose of proposed credit facility is to provide economic benefits for all the participating Funds. 
6. Section 18(f)(1) of the Act prohibits open-end investment companies from issuing any senior security except that a company is permitted to borrow from any bank; provided that, immediately after the borrowing, there is an asset coverage of at least 300 per centum for all borrowings of the company. Under section 18(g) of the Act, the term “senior security” includes any bond, debenture, note, or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness. Applicants request exemptive relief from section 18(f)(1) to the limited extent necessary to Start Printed Page 62507implement the credit facility (because the lending Funds are not banks). 
7. Applicants believe that granting the relief under section 6(c) is appropriate because the Funds would remain subject to the requirement of section 18(f)(1) that all borrowings of the Fund, including combined interfund and bank borrowings, have at least 300% asset coverage. Based on the conditions and safeguards described in the application, applicants also submit that to allow the Funds to borrow from other Funds pursuant to the proposed credit facility is consistent with the purposes and policies of section 18(f)(1). 
8. Section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 generally prohibit any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or affiliated persons of an affiliated person, when acting as principal, from effecting any transaction in which the company is a joint or a joint and several participants unless permitted by Commission order upon application. Rule 17d-1(b) of the Act provides that in passing upon applications for exemptive relief, the Commission will consider whether the participation of a registered investment company in a joint enterprise on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act and the extent to which the company's participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants. 
9. Applicants submit that the purpose of section 17(d) is to avoid overreaching by and unfair advantage to investment company insiders. Applicants believe that the credit facility is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act in that it offers both reduced borrowing costs and enhanced returns on loaned funds to all participating Funds and their shareholders. Applicants note that each Fund would have an equal opportunity to borrow and lend on equal terms consistent with its investment policies and fundamental investment limitations. Applicants therefore believe that each Fund's participation in the credit facility will be on terms which are no different from or less advantageous than that of other participating Funds. 
Applicants' Conditions 
Applicants agree that any order of the Commission granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions: 
1. The interest rates to be charged to the Funds under the credit facility will be the average of the Joint Account Repo Rate and the Bank Loan Rate. 
2. On each business day, OFI will compare the Bank Loan Rate with the Joint Account Repo Rate and will make cash available for Interfund Loans only if the Interfund Loan Rate is (a) more favorable to the lending Fund than the Joint Account Repo Rate and (b) more favorable to the borrowing Fund than the Bank Loan Rate. 
3. If a Fund has outstanding borrowings, any Interfund Loans to the Fund (a) will be at an interest rate equal to or lower than any outstanding bank loan; (b) will be secured at least on an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding bank loan that requires collateral; (c) will have a maturity no longer than any outstanding bank loan (and in any event not over seven days); and (d) will provide that, if an event of default occurs under any agreement evidencing an outstanding bank loan to the Fund, the event of default will automatically (without need for action or notice by the lending Fund) constitute an immediate event of default under the Interfund Lending Agreement entitling the lending Fund to call the Interfund Loan (and exercise all rights with respect to any collateral) and that such call will be made if the lending bank exercises its right to call its loan under its agreement with the borrowing Fund. 
4. A Fund may make an unsecured borrowing through the credit facility if its outstanding borrowings from all sources immediately after the interfund borrowing total less than 10% of its total assets, provided that if the Fund has a secured loan outstanding from any other lender, including but not limited to another Fund, the Fund's interfund borrowing will be secured on at least an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding loan that requires collateral. If a Fund's total outstanding borrowings immediately after an interfund borrowing would be 10% or greater of its total assets, the Fund may borrow through the credit facility on a secured basis only. A Fund may not borrow through the credit facility or from any other source if its total outstanding borrowings immediately after such borrowing would be more than 331/3% of its total assets. 
5. Before any Fund that has outstanding interfund borrowings may, through additional borrowings, cause its outstanding borrowings from all sources to equal or exceed 10% of its total assets, the Fund must first secure each outstanding Interfund Loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a market value at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the loan. If the total outstanding borrowings of a Fund with outstanding Interfund Loans equal or exceed 10% of its total assets for any other reason (such as a decline in net asset value or because of shareholder redemptions), the Fund will within one business day thereafter (a) repay all of its outstanding Interfund Loans, (b) reduce its outstanding indebtedness to less than 10% of its total assets, or (c) secure each outstanding Interfund Loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a market value at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the loan until the Fund's total outstanding borrowings cease to equal or exceed 10% of its total assets, at which time the collateral called for by this condition 5 shall no longer be required. Until each Interfund Loan that is outstanding at any time that a Fund's total outstanding borrowings equals or exceeds 10% is repaid or the Fund's total outstanding borrowings cease to equal or exceed 10% of its total assets, the Fund will mark the value of collateral to market each day and will pledge such additional collateral as is necessary to maintain the market value of the collateral that secures each outstanding Interfund Loan at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the loan. 
6. No Fund may lend to another Fund through the Interfund Lending Agreements if the loan would cause its aggregate outstanding loans through the Interfund Lending Agreements to exceed 15% of its net assets at the time of the loan. 
7. A Fund's Interfund Loans to any one Fund will not exceed 5% of the lending Fund's net assets. 
8. The duration of Interfund Loans will be limited to the time required to receive payment for securities sold, but in no event more than seven days. Loans effected within seven days of each other will be treated as separate loan transactions for purposes of this condition. 
9. Except as set forth in this condition, no Fund may borrow through the credit facility unless the Fund has a policy that prevents the Fund from borrowing for other than temporary or emergency purposes. In the case of a Fund that does not have such a policy, the Fund's borrowings through the credit facility, as measured on the day when the most recent loan was made, will not exceed the greater of 125% of the Fund's total net cash redemptions or 102% of sales fails for the preceding seven calendar days.
10. Each Interfund Loan may be called on one business day's notice by a lending Fund and may be repaid on any day by a borrowing Fund. Start Printed Page 62508

11. A Fund's participation in the credit facility must be consistent with its investment policies and limitations and organizational documents. 
12. The Cash Management Team will calculate total Fund borrowing and lending demands through the credit facility, and allocate loans on an equitable basis among the Funds, without the intervention of any portfolio manager of the Funds. The Cash Management Team will not solicit cash for the credit facility from any Fund or prospectively publish or disseminate loan demand data to portfolio managers. OFI will invest any amounts remaining after satisfaction of borrowing demand in accordance with the standing instructions from portfolio managers or return remaining amounts for investment directly by the relevant Funds. 
13. OFI will monitor the interest rates charged and the other terms and conditions of the Interfund Loans and will make a quarterly report to the respective Board concerning the participation of the Funds in the credit facility and the terms and other conditions of any extensions of credit thereunder. 
14. The Board of each Fund, including a majority of the Independent Trustees/Directors, will (a) review no less frequently than quarterly the Fund's participation in the credit facility during the preceding quarter for compliance with the conditions of any order permitting such transactions; (b) establish the Bank Loan Rate formula used to determine the interest rate on Interfund Loans, approve any modifications thereto, and review no less frequently than annually the continuing appropriateness of the Bank Loan Rate formula; and (c) review no less frequently than annually the continuing appropriateness of the Fund's participation in the credit facility. 
15. In the event an Interfund Loan is not paid according to its terms and such default is not cured within two business days from its maturity or from the time the lending Fund makes a demand for payment under the provisions of the Interfund Lending Agreement, OFI will promptly refer such loan for arbitration to an independent arbitrator selected by the Board of any Fund involved in the loan who will serve as arbitrator of disputes concerning Interfund Loans.[2] 
           The arbitrator will resolve any problem promptly, and the arbitrator's decision will be binding on both Funds. The arbitrator will submit at least annually a written report to the Board setting forth a description of the nature of any dispute and the actions taken by the Funds to resolve the dispute. 
16. Each Fund will maintain and preserve for a period of not less than six years from the end of the fiscal year in which any transaction under the credit facility occurred, the first two years in an easily accessible place, written records of all such transactions, setting forth a description of the terms of the transactions, including the amount, the maturity and the rate of interest on the loan, the rate of interest available at the time on short-term repurchase agreements and bank borrowings, and such other information presented to the Fund's Board in connection with the review required by conditions 13 and 14. 
17. OFI will prepare and submit to the Boards for review an initial report describing the operations of the credit facility and the procedures to be implemented to ensure that all the Funds are treated fairly. After the commencement of the operations of the credit facility, OFI will report on the operations of the credit facility at the respective Board's quarterly meetings. 
In addition, for two years following the commencement of the credit facility, the independent public accountant for each Fund shall prepare an annual report that evaluates OFI's assertion that it has established procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the conditions of the order. The report will be prepared in accordance with the Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 3 and it shall be filed pursuant to item 77Q3 of Form N-SAR. In particular, the report shall address procedures designed to achieve the following objectives: (a) That the Interfund Loan Rate will be higher than the Joint Account Repo Rate but lower than the Bank Loan Rate; (b) compliance with the collateral requirements as set forth in the application; (c) compliance with the percentage limitations on interfund borrowing and lending; (d) allocation of interfund borrowing and lending demand in an equitable manner and in accordance with the procedures established by the Boards; and (e) that the interest rate on any Interfund Loan does not exceed the interest rate on any third party borrowings of a borrowing Fund at the time of the Interfund Loan. 
After the final report is filed, the Fund's external auditors, in connection with their Fund audit examinations, will continue to review the operation of the credit facility for compliance with the conditions of the application and their review will form the basis, in part, of the auditor's report on internal accounting controls in Form N-SAR. 
18. No Fund will participate in the credit facility unless it has fully disclosed in its SAI all material facts about its intended participation.

     Applicants also request for any other open-end investment company registered under the Act for which OFI or any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with OFI acts or may act in the future as investment adviser (included in the term “Companies”). All Companies that presently intend to rely on the requested relief are named as applicants. Any other Companies that subsequently rely on the requested order will comply with the terms and conditions in the application. A Company, if it has no series, and each series of a Company, are referred to as a “Fund.”

  � 
Item 30. � Indemnification

Reference is made to the provisions of Article VII of Registrant's Agreement and Declaration of Trust filed as Exhibit 28(a) to this Registration Statement, and incorporated herein by reference.
  �
Insofar as indemnification for certain liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to trustees, officers and controlling persons of Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a
  claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a trustee, officer or controlling person of Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such trustee, officer or controlling person, Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
  indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

1. 
Special Risks: Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks. Emerging and developing market investments may be especially volatile. Eurozone investments may be subject to volatility and liquidity issues.  Investments in securities of growth companies may be volatile.  Mid-sized company stock is typically more volatile than that of larger company stock.  It may take a substantial period of time to realize a gain on an investment in a mid-sized company, if any gain is realized at all. Diversification does not guarantee profit or protect against loss.

As of 4/12/13, the purchase and exchange of Fund shares is restricted, subject to certain exceptions.  Please see the prospectus for further information.

Investments in securities of growth companies may be volatile.  Mid-sized company stock is typically more volatile than that of larger company stock.  It may take a substantial period of time to realize a gain on an investment in a mid-sized company, if any gain is realized at all. Investing significantly in a particular region, industry, sector or issuer may increase volatility and risk.



4. 
Special Risks: Investing in MLPs involves additional risks as compared to the risks of investing in common stock, including risks related to cash flow, dilution and voting rights. The Fund’s investments are concentrated in the energy infrastructure industry with an emphasis on securities issued by MLPs, which may increase volatility. Energy infrastructure companies are subject to risks specific to the industry such as fluctuations in commodity prices, reduced volumes of natural gas or other energy commodities, environmental hazards, changes in the macroeconomic or the regulatory environment or extreme weather. MLPs may trade less frequently than larger companies due to their smaller capitalizations which may result in erratic price movement or difficulty in buying or selling. Additional management fees and other expenses are associated with investing in MLP funds.

The Fund is subject to certain MLP tax risks. An investment in the Fund does not offer the same tax benefits of a direct investment in an MLP. The Fund is organized as a Subchapter “C” Corporation and is subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income at the corporate tax rate (currently as high as 35%) as well as state and local income taxes. The potential tax benefit of investing in MLPs depend on them being treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. If the MLP is deemed to be a corporation, its income would be subject to federal taxation at the entity level, reducing the amount of cash available for distribution which could result in a reduction of the fund’s value. MLP funds accrue deferred income taxes for future tax liabilities associated with the portion of MLP distributions considered to be a tax-deferred return of capital and for any net operating gains as well as capital appreciation of its investments. This deferred tax liability is reflected in the daily NAV and as a result a MLP fund's after-tax performance could differ significantly from the underlying assets even if the pre-tax performance is closely tracked.

The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer.

Special Risks: Senior loans are typically lower-rated and may be illiquid investments (which may not have a ready market).  The Fund may invest without limit in below-investment-grade securities.
