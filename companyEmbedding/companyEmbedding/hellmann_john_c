John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Tom, and welcome to G&W's earnings call for the first quarter of 2016. As always, we will start our call this morning with safety.
On slide number three, you will see that G&W's same railroad safety index was 0.61 injuries for 200,000 man-hours in the first quarter of 2016. Meanwhile, our Freightliner operations improved to a safety index of 1.17 in the first quarter, a significant improvement over 2015, and we are clearly headed in a positive direction.

Now, let's turn to financial results for the first quarter of 2016 in slide number four. Our adjusted diluted EPS were $0.77, which was roughly 6% better than the midpoint of our guidance. On the top half of slide number four, you will see that our total revenue was roughly 2% better than expected, our adjusted operating income was around 5% better than expected, and our adjusted operating ratio of 83.5% was about 50 basis points better than outlook.
As previously disclosed, we recorded a significant charge related to our Australian operations in the first quarter of 2016 as our last remaining iron ore customer entered voluntary administration, and we wrote off USD 21.1 million related to accounts receivable and a now idle maintenance facility.
The bottom half of slide number four highlights our first quarter performance versus guidance by geographic segment. The big picture is that North America performed well, thanks to improvements in our steel, ports and railcar storage business, as well as good pricing that T.J. will detail in a moment.
In addition, Australia continued to manage its costs well in a difficult economic environment. Meanwhile, the U.K./Europe segment was below our expectations, primarily due to further weakness in U.K. coal and softer performance in our Continental European intermodal business.
With respect to U.K. coal, our workforce restructuring is proceeding as planned and should be complete in the second quarter. With respect to intermodal and Continental Europe, we continue to re-price traffic and redeploy assets to more profitable lanes.
Now, let's turn to slide number five, which is the high-level comparison of Q1 2016 versus Q1 2015 for our North American operations. Overall, our revenue was down $17.8 million or 5.6%, primarily due to a 36% decline in coal revenue and a 14% decline in agricultural products revenue.
Our steam coal traffic continued to suffer from low natural gas prices and high utility inventories due to the warm winter, while agricultural products were affected by low global prices and the strong U.S. dollar.
Despite the revenue decline, our North American adjusted operating income increased modestly in the first quarter, and our adjusted operating ratio improved 180 basis points to 76.4%. The chart on the bottom half of the slide presents the numbers in a slightly different way. First, isolating the impact of fuel, then showing the margin loss on our lower carloads, and finally, highlighting the $5.8 million uplift from cost savings and the overall management of the North American business.
Now let's turn to slide number six, which is a comparison of Q1 2016 versus Q1 2015 for our Australian operations. At a high level, including Freightliner Australia, our revenue was down 14% and our adjusted operating income was down 36% due to weakness in the mining sector.
Since there are few moving parts in Australia, I will try to make it clear. First, the adjusted numbers on the slide do not include our write-off from the bankruptcy of Arrium. Second, if you look at the chart on the bottom of the slide, you will see the largest impact on our first quarter with the roughly $6 million loss of operating income from lower manganese and iron ore shipments. Net of currency and the impact of Freightliner Australia, we reported USD 10.2 million of adjusted operating income and an 80% operating ratio.
Looking ahead, Australia's operating income will be negatively impacted by the loss of the fixed payment for Southern Iron, which is an Arrium-owned iron ore mine that is under care and maintenance. Southern Iron generated roughly $5 million of revenue per quarter and fixed payments, a loss which we expect to partially offset with further cost reductions, as well as redeploying excess equipment to new business. As previously disclosed, we currently expect to continue serving Arrium's remaining iron ore business in the Middleback Range.

Now, let's turn to slide number seven, which is a review of our U.K./European operations. Recall that we owned Freightliner for five business days in the first quarter of last year, making the comparison not particularly meaningful.
A couple of comments. First, the first quarter has deep seasonality in the U.K./Europe segment due to weak aggregate shipments in the U.K. and Poland, and seasonally lower intermodal volumes. In the first quarter of 2016, our results were further affected by extremely low coal shipments in the U.K. for which many of the related costs are being taken out by the end of the second quarter.
Finally, our results in Continental Europe intermodal were lower than we expected primarily due to pricing discipline being imposed upon the business as we focus on more profitable lanes. Before we turn to slide number eight, let me step back from the details of the quarter and comment on how the business environment feels overall by geographic segment.
North America seems steady overall, but for every commodity that feels a bit better, such as steel and aggregates, others remain weak, such as agriculture and steam coal. In light of this unevenness, we remain intensely focused on costs. In Australia, it's too early to call a bottom, but commodity prices have certainly strengthened, and our management team continues to effectively control their expenses. In the U.K./Europe, the restructuring of our U.K. coal business is on target and our outlook for the year is broadly unchanged.
Now, let's turn to slide number eight and our key priorities for the remainder of 2016. Our first priority remains the safety of our people and our railroads, and we expect to make further progress at Freightliner over the course of the year. Our second priority is to achieve our updated financial targets for 2016, which now include the impact of the customer bankruptcy in Australia. We now expect an annual decline in adjusted diluted EPS of 12% in 2016, which is roughly $0.10 per share lower than our previous outlook.
Meanwhile, our outlook for 2016 free cash flow is an increase of around 8% to $280 million prior to capital for new business investments. Please note that our earnings and free cash flow outlook do not include any one-time charges from the U.K. or Australia. Finally, in 2016, we still expect to deleverage from 3.7 times net debt to EBITDA to 3.4 times net debt to EBITDA, assuming no share purchase or acquisitions and investments.
Our third priority is pursuing additional cost reductions across all three of our geographic segments. While the significant volume contraction that we felt last year seems to have leveled out, we are seeking further efficiencies. Our fourth priority is commercial growth where we continue to pursue significant new business in all of the countries in which we operate. Our fifth priority is an extension of the U.S. short line tax credit that expires in 2016.
We currently have 68 cosponsors in the House and 19 in the Senate, so we are already one-third of the way to our majority target. Our sixth priority is acquisitions and investments as we use our global rail platform to identify the best opportunities for investment. We are currently seeing interesting opportunities in several countries within G&W's footprint.
And I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, T.J. Gallagher.
Timothy J. Gallagher - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. I will walk through the results in the quarter in a little greater detail, followed by an updated outlook. Let's start with diluted EPS on slide nine.
First quarter reported earnings in both 2015 and 2016 contain significant items that we highlight in the slide. Last year in the first quarter, we closed the Freightliner acquisition and incurred roughly $0.39 of acquisition related costs. This year, as a result of the Australian customer bankruptcy, we wrote off $21 million of assets and receivables or $0.29 per diluted share.

Normalizing for these items, as well as other minor restructuring costs, adjusted diluted EPS were $0.77 or 7% lower than 2015. Keep in mind that the short line tax credit was passed in the fourth quarter of 2015 and was not included in first quarter results. Normalized for the short line tax credit, Q1 2016 adjusted diluted EPS declined $0.17 or roughly 20%.
The simplest way to think about this decline is that one half is related to the deep seasonality of our U.K./Europe segment and one half was the impact of Australian mine closures. Meanwhile, North American income was flat year-over-year as cost savings offset lower volumes, primarily utility coal.
Now moving to North America on slide 10. First quarter revenues in North America decreased $17.8 million or 5.6% with roughly 1/2 of the decline due to lower fuel surcharges. The two most significant freight declines were steam coal and agricultural products.
Coal traffic continues to be weak given low natural gas prices, and first quarter volumes were further impacted by the mild winter weather. Ag traffic was lower and continues to be impacted by the strong dollar and low commodity prices. Our storage revenue, however, was higher as it typically increases when freight volumes decline as car owners use short lines to store surplus railcars.
Let's go to slide 11. Here, we show a comparison of North American carloads by commodity. The largest variance was coal which declined 31,000 carloads or 39%, and represented 75% of the total Q1 decline.
Other commodities to highlight. Agricultural products, which I mentioned earlier, were down 2,300 carloads or 4%. Lumber and forest products traffic was up 2,200 carloads or 7%, primarily due to stronger lumber traffic in the Northeastern Canada, as well as strong wood ship traffic in the Southeast U.S.
Metals traffic increased 1,300 carloads or 4%, primarily due to strong finished steel shipments. While this increase is relatively small, it is an inflection point for a commodity group that declined 30% last year. Our minerals and stone traffic was down approximately 3,700 carloads or 8%. Weaker salt traffic in the Northeast due to the mild winter weather and lower frac sand shipments in the Midwest was partially offset by stronger aggregates traffic in our costal and central regions.
Moving to slide 12 and pricing. North American average revenues per carload increased 0.7%. Excluding the impact of changes in the mix of commodities, changes in fuel surcharges, as well as currency, average revenues per carload increased 2.3%. Note that we had changes in customer mix in the agricultural products, auto and minerals and stone commodity categories that impacted average revenues. Excluding these customer mix changes, the core pricing increase in the first quarter was approximately 4%.
Moving to slide 13 and Australia. Australia revenues declined $8.1 million or 13.6%, primarily due to the weaker Australian dollar and the Australian mine closures in 2015. Partially offsetting was $10.9 million of revenues from Freightliner Australia.
Now, let's move to the U.K./Europe segment on slide 14. We show U.K./Europe results sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2015 given the timing of the acquisition last year. As Jack noted, Q1 is the seasonally weakest quarter for our U.K./Europe segment, and revenues sequentially declined across all major commodity groups. In total, revenues decreased sequentially $30 million or 18.6%.
Now, turning to slide 15. Let me refer you to our earlier Safe Harbor statement that noted that these statements are subject to a variety of factors that could cause actual results to differ from our current expectations. These statements represent management's expectations regarding future results as of today, April 28, 2016, and we do not undertake any obligation to update this information.

Now before we get into the specifics of our updated outlook and guidance for Q2, let's start with the big picture for each of our segments.
In North America, after a 4% core pricing increase in the first quarter, we now expect core pricing increases in the 2.5% to 3% range for the remainder of the year, which will yield a full year average core pricing increase of around 3%, consistent with our original guidance.
With respect to areas of strength and weakness, coal is expected to be weaker than our original guidance, and we now expect our coal revenues to decline year-over-year by $25 million, compared with our original guidance of down approximately $15 million.
We also expect our agricultural product shipments to be lower, but the timing of ag shipments remains our biggest wildcard. Areas of strength include steel, as well as higher freight-related revenues such as storage and port switching. We expect full year revenues and adjusted operating income to be consistent with our original guidance for North America, noting that second half income is typically stronger than the first half given the seasonality of the business and the timing of winter.
In Australia, our remaining iron ore customer filed for the Australian equivalent of bankruptcy in early April, and as a result of this filing, we will no longer receive the fixed revenue payments under the Southern Iron contract, which amounts to about $15 million for the remaining three quarters of 2016.
However, we â as Jack noted, we expect to continue to serve the customer and its other locations. Our full year expectation for Australia adjusted operating income is approximately $10 million lower than our original guidance as new business and additional cost reductions are expected to partially offset the loss of Southern Iron revenue.
Note that both iron ore and manganese prices are approximately 50% higher than at the beginning of the year. These increases can only improve the outlook for certain of our customers.
Now slide 16 and the U.K./Europe segment. The restructuring of the coal business is on track, and we expect the workforce restructuring to be complete by the end of the second quarter at an estimated cost of $5 million.
With respect to our intermodal business, U.K. operations continue to perform broadly in line with expectations, while the rationalization of our Continental Europe operations continues. The Continental intermodal business operated at a loss in the first quarter, but we expect the business to move to profitability later in the year as unprofitable lanes are exited and the rolling stock surpluses are eliminated.
Full-year financial expectations for our U.K./Europe segment are consistent with our prior guidance as initial expense reductions are expected to offset the first quarter shortfall. Note that the intermodal business peaks fairly in the fourth quarter and the second half of the year will benefit from a completed coal restructuring.
Now moving to guidance on slide 17. We provide here, both our original guidance, as well as our updated guidance, to show a comparison. We expect revenues of approximately $2 billion and an adjusted operating ratio around 82%. We now expect our adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.50 to $3.70 with diluted shares outstanding at $58.2 million.
Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $5 million lower at $245 million or $280 million excluding new business investments. The big picture is that our earnings expectations are about $0.10 lower than our prior guidance primarily due to the impact of the loss of the Southern Iron revenues and lower coal volumes, which was partially offset by growth and additional cost reductions. Note that the updated guidance excludes the impact of severance and restructuring costs, as well as the write-down in Australia in the first quarter.

Moving to the second quarter guidance on slide 18. We expect revenues of approximately $490 million and operating income of approximately $84 million. Net interest expense in the second quarter should be approximately $18 million, and we expect D&A of approximately $57 million.
Our effective tax rate should be around 29% and diluted shares should be $58.2 million. The bottom line is we are expecting second quarter diluted EPS in the range of $0.75 to $0.80. The simplest way to look at the second quarter guidance is segment-by-segment. In North America, we expect weaker coal and higher fuel price to offset the normal seasonal uplift in Q2. In Australia, we expect operating income in Q2 roughly equal to Q1 due to a short term freight move that will offset the most of the Southern Iron revenue loss. And in the U.K./Europe segment, we expect a sequential improvement in all lines due to normal seasonality. I will close with our balance sheet on slide 19. Our net debt was $2.2 billion and our debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.7 times.
And with that, I will open up the call for questions.

. Our first question today comes from the line of Allison Landry representing Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Good morning, thanks.
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning.
Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
I wanted to ask about the core pricing in North America. The 4% in the first quarter was a slight step-up from Q4, but, T.J., I know you mentioned it, it should slow to around 2.5% to 3%. So, just curious, what should we read from that? Are you expecting the overall rail pricing environment to slow or is this more related to the timing of certain contracts?
Timothy J. Gallagher - Chief Financial Officer
I'll let Michael Miller, our Chief Commercial Officer, provide some more color, but the short answer to your question is there can be variation in any one quarter. It doesn't make for the whole year. Our expectation is at 3% for the full year and are consistent. That said, fuel prices are low and there are certainly some commodities, such as paper or lumber, where rate increases will be more challenging, while in other ones, we may get more than 3%. Michael, any other color?
Michael O. Miller - Chief Commercial Officer-North America
No. I believe that's right, Allison. Yeah. We're just seeing a little more competition. And obviously, with low commodity prices in certain sectors, we can help work with our customers on rates to try to move volume. So I think those two things, we feel like it may take a little bit of a small step back in pricing. But if fuel changes or truck competition gets tighter, then there's upside as well.
Timothy J. Gallagher - Chief Financial Officer
So, the bottom line, at 3% for the full year, that's consistent with our prior expectations.
Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay. That makes sense. And then in terms of the more positive outlook for metals, do you think this is a broader signal that the industry itself is starting to recover? Or is it more reflective of your specific customer base? I know in the past, you've talked about serving some of the very efficient mini mills in the U.S. So just wondering how we should be thinking about that.
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hey, Mike, why not â Michael, do you want to talk to little bit about what we are seeing at the mini mills? It's really plant specific in terms of what we're seeing. And I wouldn't say that there's â while there's improvements, the conviction isn't huge. But, Michael, you want to talk a little bit about what you're seeing by some segments within the metals and in the steel?

Michael O. Miller - Chief Commercial Officer-North America
Sure. Allison, I think it is, to Jack's point, it is very mill specific and commodity specific inside the metal sector. Obviously, there's a lot of automotive traffic, so finished coil steel is going to be relatively strong. There were some tariffs imposed on some certain commodities coming into the States, so those commodities as well have done pretty good.
But there's other sectors that we serve like rebar, for example, is really struggling just due to global competition. So, to Jack's point, I don't think we're seeing a â we're looking for the sky to continue to be bright and blue and the sun out, but the mills we serve are very competitive and the commodities that we traditionally handle in those mills, with one or two small exceptions, are commodities that are in high demand.
Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay, great. Thank you.

Our next question today comes from the line of Alex Vecchio with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi, good morning, thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to maybe touch on the North America carloads guidance. It looks like you're expecting 6% to 8% declines in 2Q and down 5% for the full year, which implies kind of those declines moderate to low single-digits in the back half. Is that just really, largely a function of the comparisons getting easier or are you kind of seeing signs of actual improving underlying fundamentals, if you will? And if the volumes don't end up kind of maybe panning out as you expect in the back half, what else can you do on the cost side to kind of mitigate potential downside to margins?
Timothy J. Gallagher - Chief Financial Officer
Sure. The quick answer about the carloads. The changes in percentages are really, it's a function of the 2015 comp where volumes fell throughout the year, but really dipped off in the fourth quarter. So just maintaining relative stable volumes in 2016 will yield a better outlook by comparison for the second half.
Now with respect to volumes being down 7%, that's primarily â if you look year-over-year, that's three things. That's coal, that's ag, and that's minerals and stone, primarily salt. On a full-year basis, we said, it implies about down 5%. The biggest difference between the 5% there and the 3% we had at the beginning of the year is the lower coal traffic. That's really the difference.
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
With respect to your other, the second part of your question, so in costs, as I said on our priorities, well, we've got initiatives in place in all three of our geographies. We've done â you can see it from the results, particularly North America, less obviously so elsewhere, we have some major cost savings initiatives of which you felt some of the benefit in Q1 in North America, and which we're executing upon elsewhere. In addition to those, we're doing internal benchmarking now that the volumes had stabilized somewhat, and are taking another look at where else we can be even more efficient.
And so we're not stopping with what we've done. And we think there's always things you can do to be smarter and more efficient. And so we've got three discrete initiatives underway in each geography to see what else we can get out. That's not in the outlook. That's just what we're doing.
Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. That makes sense. That's helpful. Okay, and then I just wanted to follow up on M&A. Can you maybe talk a little bit about where you're seeing maybe the most interesting opportunities geographically speaking? There are some headlines out there about some assets in Australia, specifically in the coal area. I don't know, any comments on the extent to which that might be something you'd be interested in pursuing one way or another or maybe not? Just some more color on the M&A kind of a pipeline at this point.

John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, I know â certain transactions make it into the newspaper and certain transactions don't. So I'll just speak broadly to the population set of opportunity, whether it's in the paper or not. And there is a pretty substantial number of opportunities in every geography that we serve right now, North America, Australia in particular, but time will tell.
Alexander Vecchio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it.
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
Hey, good morning, guys.
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning.
Timothy J. Gallagher - Chief Financial Officer
Hey, Scott, how are you?
Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
Good, good. Jack, just a follow-up on that. So how does the experience with Freightliner and their coal issues impact your willingness to buy future coal assets, though? And I realize coal assets can be different from place to place.
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, yeah. I mean â yeah, the first thing you think about is the geography of coal and which geography is there going to be no coal, which looks like the U.K. is at the top of that list, which we had assumed as well, except we thought it would come a little late. We would have said 2022, not 2017. But it's looking more like 2017 rather than 2022. But that was factored into our thinking. And Australia â it depends on the geography of the coal and its heat content and its sulfur content, and its cost coming out of the ground in terms of where it sits on the global competitiveness curve.
With respect to coal that we currently handle under contract in Australia, it's pretty much to the extent you believe any coal is going to be burned in the world, that some of the coal that we handle. And so that part, so you have to differentiate between the types of coal that exist in the world. Whatever your â the long-term view is, there's coal consumption and coal as an energy source within the broader global economy. So we factor all that into how we think about potential transactions and how we â at what level we might invest in them and what exposure we think is comfortable for â if any, for a company with our size of balance sheet and we'll take that into account.
Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. That makes sense. So, I think last quarter when we talked about M&A and you were saying, given where leverage is, we may need to do it with a partner and we don't want to be issuing equity kind of where the stock is. Has anything changed on those lines of thinking just given the increase in the stock price or your views on deleveraging and how you think about M&A?
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I would just say what's probably what's changed is the number of opportunities is greater now than it was the last time we talked on a global basis. And so that's one variable that's changed. With respect to us maintaining active dialogues with third-party capital as a potential source of financing, depending on the specific transaction, those dialogues are alive and well. And so how we finance any given transactions can depend on a lot of things, including valuation, the deal structure, and of course, our leverage profile at that moment in time. But we've got all our â I'd say the biggest change is that there's more stuff out there.
Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. And just last thing, if I can. Last time you talked about several major contracts you were bidding on, any updates you can give us?

John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
We'll update on when we get them. I think that's â I'll leave it at that. But there are active things that we are bidding on in every geography. The â it's â I mean, there's interesting things happening in all parts of the world right now, and I think we'll comment on them as we â as they unfold. I mean the one thing T.J. alluded to, I wouldn't read too much into it. Our outlook for the coming quarters probably â in Australia is probably better than one would have expected.
And what's going on there is we're moving a stockpile of product that had already been mined that â which is currently in administration. Now â and so that's what we're benefiting from there. That's not because the price of that commodity is up 50%. It's just because that was the right thing for the administrator to do. With prices of some of those commodities now up 50%, it will be interesting to see what does mines do going forward. So it's too early to make the call on that, but we're watching that with interest in Australia.
Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
Okay. That makes sense. I just wanted to make sure we hadn't bid on the contracts and lost, and now, there â it's not an opportunity anymore. Okay. Thank you for the time.
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
No. No, no. There's still â it's still an interesting population set.

All right. Our next question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please go ahead.
Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hey, great. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning.
Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Want to just pick up on the comment that you just made. And I know you said it's early, but given what we've seen in the move in the commodity prices, just any sort of indications you're getting from customers that are a little bit more upbeat and maybe they were a few months ago? I'm guessing maybe just, at least from a mood perspective, it's better. But anything sort of concrete you can think about?
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I wouldn't say much beyond â we're moving a stockpile for a company that's in administration right now. We also actually are starting up moves â I guess I can, I'll call it, we're starting up movements later this quarter of an iron ore deposit that's laced with copper. And I think it's got some gold in there, too. And that wouldn't have â that was probably going to move before the price of the ore was up 50% because of what it's laced with rather than the absolute iron ore itself. But there are â we're quoting prices and signing contracts for things like this.
So those are two contracts that we've signed that are up and running, and we're still quoting stuff elsewhere. So, we'll see how it unfolds. I mean, it's definitely â it's less grim than it's been for the last â my goodness, where are we now? We're in April? So now almost two years that we've been dealing with the house of cards collapsing. And so we're now actually seeing, with this major bankruptcy having transpired, you could sort of start seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.
Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. That's helpful. And then just switching gears to U.K./Europe. Now that we have sort of a first quarter under our belts, which we didn't before. In terms of the typical seasonality or profitability, I guess, I'm just trying to get a better sense of how to think about that. We, obviously, had an operating loss. I think there's a lot of different factors going in there, but absent coal and some of the pressures that are coming a lot sooner, as you've articulated, how should we think about sort of the typical seasonality of the U.K./Europe business, particularly for the first quarter going forward?

John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Absolutely. T.J., hit it.
Timothy J. Gallagher - Chief Financial Officer
So without the coal, which would have been a counter-seasonal help in Q1, really, think about the years lowest in Q1, peaking in Q3 for typical intermodal driven business, so that's going to peak early in the fourth quarter. So as you march through the year, Q1 the lowest, then Q2 improving, Q3 the peak, and then Q4 falling back a little bit. If you look back at our Q3 and Q4 last year, you'll see sort of the relative difference between those two quarters. But that's the way to think about the seasonality.
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
And in Q1, you're certainly not going to be losing money in Q1 looking ahead. And there's two reasons why. Number one is that the coal business is being restructured, and so all those costs are going to be out. And that in its own right would throw the business straight into the black. In addition to that, we absorbed some losses in Europe, in the European intermodal business, that we didn't anticipate absorbing in the first quarter because there were some traffic moves that we thought would take place at a profit.
We decided not to close the traffic because it didn't make economic sense, and we'd rather exit leased equipment and not serve those customers and do so at a loss. But if we're â if you're not making money on that business, you're not operating that business. So it's a very simple fix. So you can â those two variables that we focused on will mean while the seasonality pattern is exactly what T.J. described, you're certainly not going to see a first quarter like that. We won't allow it to happen.
Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. That's helpful. And one just quick follow-up on that point. That intermodal piece is a little â lags into the second quarter from a loss of profitability. I guess, I just wanted to make sure, I thought that was what I heard earlier in the call, I just want to make sure that's right.
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
You're moving to â you'll probably be flat â you're probably going to be breakeven-ish in the second quarter and modestly profitable in the back half of the year.
Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. That's helpful.
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Because you've got â we've got to shake some â I mean, we've got leased â short-term leased equipment that â where if it can't find a proper home, you just get out of it. And then you pick up â¬0.5 million, â¬1 million or something like that, and that goes straight to the bottom line.
Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Great. Thanks for that. I appreciate it.

Our next question comes from the line of Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hey, good morning, guys.
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning.
Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
With â piggybacking on Scott's question a little bit earlier about the opportunity set that you're seeing from a bid activity, given the declines you're seeing in your broader commodities, I'm assuming a lot of those potential business wins, you can service with existing trains. But can you give us a sense of the potential capital investments of those opportunities you guys are seeking to win?
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, there's not a single answer to that. They're â embedded in your question was a few areas of new business development. One of those areas is in the case of Australia, it's redeploying excess equipment. So that new business that you're putting online is simply using equipment that otherwise would be idle because of the collapse of the iron ore markets in Australia. So that's requiring zero incremental capital, and that's why you're seeing the profits, the sustained profits that are probably a little better than one would have expected. With respect to â so that's kind of on the commodities side.

Then with respect to new investments and new opportunities, we didn't quantify that. Each of those would be discrete investments for acquisitions, and we're not going to quantify what those dollar amounts are. But I can â what I can say is that there are both big and small opportunities in that pipeline in multiple geographies.
Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Can we think about just kind of the return on invested capital as being comparable to what we've seen in the past as we kind of try and back into a dollar invested standpoint?
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
You should assume that if we deploy capital, on a cash on cash basis, we expect it to earn our cost to capital long-term.
Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
It makes sense. Okay, so no change in philosophy there. T.J., when I was looking at the Q2 guidance, the North American margin degradation sequentially from the first quarter to the second quarter seemed a little bit kind of contra seasonal to me. Can you kind of break out how much of that's coming from the uptick we've seen in terms of the fuel prices and the lag effect there versus kind of the mix headwinds you had noted on the call?
Timothy J. Gallagher - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. It's really â it's both of those things. It's the further decline in coal, but it's also fuel. We expect fuel to be â I mean, our fuel prices today are higher than they were 3 months ago. And with respect to our fuel surcharge programs, which, as you saw Q1 over Q1 last year, we were perfectly hedged. We had no real operating income â impact to that $8.9 million loss of fuel surcharge. But right now, we're in that zone of any movement down in fuel prices, we benefit, drops to bottom line. But since we're below the thresholds at which the fuel surcharge programs kick back in, we're going to be eating that fuel for a little bit. And so that's really â that's what's going on, Q2.
Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And is there a rule of thumb we should be using in terms of that threshold in the fuel surcharge?
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. So, right now, the â we participate in a number of fuel surcharge programs with all the Class 1s. If you look at their strike prices â but all of the G&W fuel surcharge programs are struck around the $2.60 on highway diesel. And I think right now, we're about $2.25.
Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks so much for the time.

Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
Thank you, and good morning.
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
good morning.
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
So to follow up on the North American pricing discussion, I wanted to ask about truck competition. Have you seen any of your business move to truck year-to-date? And is the risk of conversion something that you're factoring into guidance for North American rail volumes to be down 5% this year?
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So the answer to the second part of your question is, yes, we factored in that competition into the volume outlook. But to give you some anecdotal texture, Michael, do you want to talk about just more broadly, probably paper is the best place to talk about it and different geographies of the country?
Michael O. Miller - Chief Commercial Officer-North America
Yeah. Both paper and lumber, when you look at it from a truck competition standpoint, if you're following truck rates, actually, truck rates have actually slightly declined over the last 30 days to 60 days, plus coupling that with low fuel prices, there's a surplus supply out there. So what we tried to do is be smart about our pricing and make sure we're pricing to the market. We're actually working directly with our customers. They realize that both fuel and driver capacity could change relatively fast, so they're not going to make large conversions to truck.

But there will be certain moves that they can converge short-term that fit, but we're working both with our Class 1s and our customers to make sure what we're pricing to actually protects the volume we handle. But there will be some leakage and in some cases, we'll be able to participate in the upside when they're looking to move traffic to other lanes.
The other factor we've got specifically with G&W is one of our larger paper customers has made several acquisitions and they're redoing their distribution patterns. And some of those circles will get a little shorter, so it makes rail really more competitive â less competitive, but we're working with them as well to find places to move more rail traffic.
Timothy J. Gallagher - Chief Financial Officer
Hey. And, Justin, just you made a comment about a 5% decline in carloads. Keep in mind that about 70%, 75% of that decline is coal. And so, really, the rest of the traffic in North America is relatively flat.
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And maybe as a follow-up to that, North American rail volumes have been all over the place the last two years or three years. We've recently been in an industrial recession, and I think it's really tough to gauge what a normal environment looks like. As you think about the North American rail business or your business, what do you feel is a reasonable, long-term growth rate for volumes? And what do you view as the key drivers to that growth?
Timothy J. Gallagher - Chief Financial Officer
That's a great question.
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
That's a great question. The answer will be â I'll tell you what, we'll â why don't we â we'll take that aside and we'll give you â I mean, the answer's you got to look at each discrete commodity group and make a judgment by commodity group with discrete underlying assumptions related to that commodity group in terms of what your conclusion is going to be, because it's going to be a range.
I mean, for example, if you're looking at coal, you probably need the forward curve on natural gas sitting in tandem with it in order to draw any meaningful conclusions. But if you're going to draw a long-term trajectory on agricultural products, you're going to have a multi-variable regression that includes exchange rates and prices of various commodities that are embedded in it and juxtapose with the proportions that we handle ourselves.
So our pricing is inflation plus pricing, and you can see that we've been achieving slightly better than that. Our volumes are truly a commodity specific story, and it clearly feels like we're down in a trough right now. I mean, we've been on a trajectory downwards, so it actually feels okay when you're sitting where we are right now and all we're doing is focusing on costs. But in terms of projecting the line forward from here, I think maybe we'll have to do that separately for you, perhaps on our next call.
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
Okay. That's fine. I can appreciate the complexity of it, but just wondering when you put it all together, how you think about that formula.
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay.
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
All right. I appreciate the time this morning.
Timothy J. Gallagher - Chief Financial Officer

Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
Bascome Majors - Susquehanna International Group
Yeah. Thanks for the time this morning. A couple on Australia. When you think about your remaining business in the Middleback Ranges with Arrium, you said that's about $26 million annualized. What's your expectation for how that fares while they're in administration? It just seems like it's pretty complicated and increasingly politicized situation, I'm trying to get a sense for what we should watch for, what you guys are watching for, to kind of see any risk or opportunity there as this unfolds.

John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, no. I would just say that it's a very politically visible situation. It's visible not just at the state level given that it's transpiring in the second largest city in South Australia, but also at a national or commonwealth level in Australia because it's steel.
And by the way, the history of that plant goes back to building naval vessels in World War II. And the population of the town is utterly dependent on both the steelworks and the iron ore business. So that is why you've seen involvement, including the Prime Minister. That's why you've seen it find its way from the national press to the international press. I think with the company in administration, there's a great deal of political will to preserve the steelworks at some level.
And the Commonwealth Government, for example, has approved purchases of steel for federally owned entities, basically accelerating CapEx plans that use steel as a sort of a government subsidy mechanism to ensure that outcome. And I wouldn't be surprised if you saw more things like that on the steel side.
On the iron or side, it's all a question of money. And whether the mines are in the money or not, and whether in administration, they become as efficient as they can be to have a long-term future supply in the global iron ore market.
In that geography, you're very close to the water. And so that in itself means that the cost of getting the product from the interior and onto the ship should be reasonably competitive.
In this case, because it's draft, they have to have an intermediate barge move that undermines that a little bit, but when you're approximate to the water, that tends to be a plus.
There are, believe it or not, new deposits that have been discovered directly adjacent to the existing ones that are close to the surface. So those have potential, I think, over time to become part of that mining equation. But, yeah, you're right, it's in a fluid process. It's business as usual today.
Our job is we're integral to the supply chain. It's a very, very complex operation, particularly when you start handling molten steel. Remember, we're operating on a couple of gauges, the track and we're handling molten steel inside the steelworks. So what we do is quite complex. And so we're in close cooperation with the customer and we're working â we're going to work with them to see what their path forward â a sustainable path forward might look like, and obviously, there is â that there is â or any range of possibilities of what its future might hold, including a sale of that business to a new owner. And then it will be dependent on what the new owners' expectations are for the operations there.
And whether they're having rights to other mineral deposits in other parts of the geography are also of interest to them. So you're right, I can't tell you to pay attention to any one particular thing, I wouldn't say, but it's â that's clearly, a vital national interest, and all of their highest level state politicians and commonwealth politicians are well aware of the situation. So, I don't think there will be any shortage of information emanating from the Australian press. So I think I'll leave it at that.
Bascome Majors - Susquehanna International Group
Thanks for the comprehensive answer there and we'll continue to watch. Just one more. On the Australian coal haulage business with Glencore, my understanding is that you guys do provide some service to them already. I know you can't talk about any auction process or not that's going on now, but could you tell us a little bit about if you are entrenched there in any way, shape or form, and does that give you some advantage versus some of the, call it, infrastructures funds or the railroads that might be interested?

John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
No, I think you just said, I can't ask you this question, but I'm going to ask you anyway. And by the way, that was extremely well phrased. I kind of like the first clause sets you up for the second clause as a disclaimer.
Yeah, we crew those trains and we've done it for a long time. And this was part of Freightliner Australia's business. We handle a ton of coal there. Between 30 million tons and 40 million tons per year is historically what's been going on there. It's an integral part of the supply chain that comes out of the Hunter Valley. We got a great team there. We've done a terrific job of providing service, and I'll just leave it at that.
Bascome Majors - Susquehanna International Group

And we have a question from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura. Please go ahead.
Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks. I just wanted to ask with respect to Australia, what percentage on a dollar basis of the business remains under fixed revenue contracts where you may not be actually providing any service in light of the iron ore closures? Are we at zero now or is there still some little business left where you're getting paid as part of a contract, but you may not be providing, at least today, haulage or service to that customer?
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I can't say â I have â risk of not â you can't â I can't speak specifically to a contract, but let me speak on a global basis for our â for the kind of mining industry specifically.
Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Sure.
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
There aren't any mining contracts around the world for which we're getting paid to do nothing. That would be a unique situation.
Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Okay. Okay. So that's been purged. I guess my second question would be then, in terms of margins, you've historically talked about Australia somewhere in the 60%s, sub North American, with the European acquisition, you talked about a 10% or so.
In the intermediate term given the restructuring and the headwinds you face, is it time to maybe rethink what those margins can be? Does Australia settle somewhere in the mid-70s%? Say, does U.K./Europe look like something more like 92%? Or do you think that given the actions you're taking longer term, we can kind of revert to those bogeys?
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, the U.K./Europe, I wouldn't touch. Australia is very fluid, because you've got a business that's kind of mid-80s% right now, having been in the high 60s%. But after losing five major commodity customers, it's actually pretty good that you got to mid-80s%. And one could argue that if you have the same commodity base, you'll probably be around 60%.
Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Right.
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
And there are step function changes. Putting a...
Timothy J. Gallagher - Chief Financial Officer
What the OR or what the operating ratio is going to be is going to depend on how much revenue has flown over the track. And if any one of â any single commodity project rebounds with the price of commodities increasing, the operating ratio target is going to be materially different to â from where it's settling right now just by virtue of the economics of our business and the fixed assets that we own. So, I couldn't even, in good conscience, talk about what that target might be for Australia other than we're trying to be as lean as we possibly can be with a dramatically shrunken business. That dramatically shrunken business is a very good business even under, as we talked on the last call, under worst-case scenario, you're going to look at probably $70 million to $75 million of EBITDA, maintenance CapEx of around $50 million, and that's on the downside. So you've got a really strong business. And then from that base, you will â we will seek a trajectory forward.

Matt Troy - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Got it. Okay. Thanks for the time.

Our next question comes from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Hey, Jack, first, in terms of the Australian business, do you have a feel for maybe what percent of your book of business down there is still at risk for having to go into some type of administrative situation? Or do you think you're past all of that?
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think we're past. Based on who â if you look at who we serve down there and their financial positions, I think you're past that now.
John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Are there any of the assets down there that you would potentially take a look at from an M&A perspective? I mean, you bought your big Australian rail line essentially out of a bankruptcy situation. Are there any other rail lines that could potentially go into some either administration conservatorship, something like that, that would make them more approachable?
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?
John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Just are there any of the rail lines that potentially could come up for sale in Australia? Are any of those assets at risk for going into some type of administration or conservatorship there? Essentially, you'd be buying them out of a bankruptcy situation.
John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. No, I can't envision that. No, I can't envision that pattern per se. I mean, I think our exposure to administration is very specific to what we continue to serve in the Middleback Range and how that plays out.
John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. All right, all right. That makes sense. And in terms of your comment about the placing where you took maybe â we've seen a couple of other rails do this where they take in a select customer or commodity type and priced it a little bit different in order to make it more competitive or what have you.
I mean, are there opportunities elsewhere within the commodity base to do the same thing? Or was this just a very one-off situation that you had an opportunity to help or exploit or however you would term it? Or do you see more of those pricing opportunities out there?
Timothy J. Gallagher - Chief Financial Officer
So, are you talking about the first quarter results in North America?
John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah, where you talked about a specific situation where you lowered price on a spot base or something. Are there other opportunities like that to exploit?
Timothy J. Gallagher - Chief Financial Officer
Michael can answer the question more fully, but we negotiate with our customers case-by-case, situation-by-situation, product-by-product, lane-by-lane, in order to maximize profitability, which comes to pricing volume. So it's â those situations are going on daily. Sales and marketing team is out there doing that work.
Michael O. Miller - Chief Commercial Officer-North America
Yeah, T.J., I agree 100%. Our job is be as nimble as we can to the market and stay as close as we can to our customers.
Timothy J. Gallagher - Chief Financial Officer
The thing to always keep in mind is, as a percentage of the through rate, the short line is a very, very small piece of that. And so how the â how rates affect volumes is more dependent on others than ourselves.
John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess I'm asking from the perspective of coal, for example. Reducing the rail rate on coal is not going to make it more competitive with natural gas. So the question becomes, why do it? That's why I'm just trying to get a handle on why would you price to something. But I get your point. I mean, the short line component of it is a very small component.

John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay. It's completely fact specific, as T.J. said. And you can assume we're extremely hyper rational about how we assess the fact pattern of every given commodity and customer to maximize incremental income.

John C. Hellmann - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
What are your April North America volumes, if you know them? And then, what's the fuel price you've assumed for the third quarter and fourth quarter?
Michael O. Miller - Chief Commercial Officer-North America
I thought you're going to ask me about the fuel prices for the second quarter.
Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
I'll take that too.
Michael O. Miller - Chief Commercial Officer-North America
Yeah. So, we were around â our actual fuel price paid, again, which is around $1.50 Q1, we're assuming $1.70. This is overall for Q â quarters two through four.
Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
So $1.70 you're assuming, two through four. So if we see four â and you have risk up to $2.60, you said?
Michael O. Miller - Chief Commercial Officer-North America
No. See, there's two different basis here, what we pay and then what â so to translate that, on the highway diesel, averaged about $2.10, I think, in the first quarter-ish. It's right now closer to $2.20, $2.25. So, yeah, there's probably another $0.25, $0.35 on the on-highway diesel before a lot of the surcharges kicked in.
Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC
Got it. Okay. And then, do you have April North America volumes?
Michael O. Miller - Chief Commercial Officer-North America

Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Q1 2017 Earnings Teleconference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session with instructions being given at that time. And as a reminder, today's call will be recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to our co-host and our facilitator as well as our Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and our Treasurer, Mr. Tom Savage. Please go ahead, sir.
Thomas D. Savage - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Good morning, and thank you for joining us today on Genesee & Wyoming's Q1 2017 Earnings Call. Please note that we will be referring to a slide presentation during today's call. These slides are posted on the Investors page of our website, www.gwrr.com.

We will start with a safe harbor statement, and then proceed with the call. Some of the statements we will make during this call, which represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which provides a safe harbor for such statements.
Our use of words such as estimate, anticipate, plan, believe, could, expect, targeting, budgeting, or similar expressions are intended to identify these statements and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations, including but not limited to, factors we will discuss later and the factors set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of forward-looking statements and the risks and uncertainties of such statements. We cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements we make will be realized. We do not undertake and expressly disclaim any duty to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law, and you should recognize that this information is only accurate as of today's date.
On the call today, we have four speakers: our President and CEO, Jack Hellmann; our Chief Financial Officer, T.J. Gallagher; our Chief Operating Officer, David Brown; and our Chief Commercial Officer, Michael Miller.
I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jack Hellmann.
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Thank you, Tom, and welcome to G&W's earnings call for the first quarter of 2017. As always, we'll start our call this morning with safety. On slide number 3, you'll see that G&W completed the first quarter of 2017 with an industry-leading safety index of 0.7 injuries per 200,000 man-hours. We've made significant progress in enhancing the safety culture of Freightliner and look forward to another strong year in safety in 2017.

Now turning to slide number 4. Overall, I would say, the first quarter of 2017 was not a perfect start to the year, but the trajectory of our business is positive. On this slide, you'll see that we had multiple items impacting our quarterly results. The first item was $3.2 million of corporate development expense, much of which related to our unsuccessful bid for Florida East Coast Railways. FEC is a great railroad serving an attractive market that we first bid on in 2007 and was recently sold again in a competitive process.
FEC's corporate headquarters is located a few miles from G&W's Jacksonville operation center, which would have enabled us to unlock considerable cost savings. Even with those synergies, however, our valuation was not competitive at FEC's railroad operations, excluding its regional trucking business effectively sold for around 14.5 times trailing EBITDA based on publicly available information. As a result, we maintained our acquisition discipline and shifted our focus to other investment opportunities that we think will generate greater returns for our shareholders.
The second item impacting the first quarter 2017 was $3.5 million of restructuring costs, primarily related to ERS in Continental Europe. Having reached agreement with the Dutch and German Works Councils, we have now closed two offices and expect to complete the business restructuring in the second quarter.
The third item that impacted the first quarter was a non-cash mark-to-market of an inter-company loan to Australia and related cross-currency swap, which cost us $0.05 per share. As T.J. will discuss in a moment, this expense will eventually unwind to a cumulative $0 impact over the two-year life of the swap.
Now, let's turn to the core business. (4:55) was at the low end of our (4:59) same railroad carload growth of 3%, while our adjusted operating ratio of 77.2% was 1.2 percentage points higher than expected. The majority of that extra expense in North America was in the causalities and expense line item, and was due to higher-than-normal track washouts and derailments in the winter months.
We see these results as unusual with several small incidents across multiple geographies, and not reflective of any trend since our track has never been in better condition. In fact, our FRA reportable derailments have improved 44% over the past three years. But the bottom line is that higher North American expense cost us around $0.04 per share in the first quarter.
In Australia, the first quarter results of the Glencore Rail acquisition were right on target. Our new partnership with Macquarie is operating smoothly and our Australian business overall is on a nice growth trajectory. Not only did a manganese mine in the Northern Territory restart shipments in March, but we are also working on several other new business projects.
Turning to the UK/Europe operations. Our first quarter results were $0.04 per share below our expectations for two reasons; first, a customer bankruptcy in Germany resulted in a $1.5 million receivables write-off; and our UK intermodal business had a higher operating expense on current intermodal routes.
Stepping back from the details of the quarter for a moment, I'd make three big picture observations. First, in North America, our overall view of the economy is broadly unchanged in 2017. We continued to see modest carload growth and we still see several new customer projects starting up later in the year. Although we are hopeful that we will see the U.S. economy turn the corner this year, we have not yet seen that in our shipments.
Second, in Australia, after nearly three years of navigating the collapse in global commodity prices and a resulting sharp decline in our shipments, our financial outlook has been getting progressively more positive.

Third, in the UK/Europe, where we have consistently disappointed for two years now, we think the second half of 2017 will mark the inflection point for business that endured three consecutive shocks over the past two years.
The first shock was the collapse of the UK coal market, which led to our complete restructuring of the UK heavy-haul business. The second shock was the deterioration of the ERS business in Continental Europe, where we are discontinuing unprofitable train services and restructuring to its modestly profitable core. The third shock has been the unprecedented changes in the global container shipping industry, which has caused congestion across the UK ports and container supply chain as a result of mega-ships unloading significantly more containers, as well as from new UK port calling schedules that have been established by the new shipping alliances.
As I'll discuss on the next slides, we're well underway with operational and commercial responses to these market shifts, which are being implemented now and we expect to take hold in the second half of 2017.
Turning to slide number 5. We have summarized our progress in the ERS restructuring in Continental Europe. First, you can see the measures that we completed in the first quarter and then you will see the final restructuring steps in the second quarter.
In essence, we are in the process of completing our exit of the equipment leases associated with the business that we stopped operating, which run at approximately $1 million per quarter. Once that is complete, in the second half of 2017 we will be left with a smaller, sustainable core business on the Continent that is focused on the deep-sea intermodal sector.
Turning now to slide number 6. We'd like to provide a more detailed update on our UK intermodal business. As many of you know, the global container shipping industry has been going through unprecedented change and consolidation. Following a series of mergers and acquisitions, the global shipping lines have been reconfigured into major new alliances. For reference, we've shown a snapshot of the new alliances on slide number 7.
The important point is that new routes and UK ports of car being established, and we expect this to stabilize during the month of May, allowing us to adjust our operations to better align with the new container flows. This means that certain port calls are being rotated among the major UK ports that we serve, including Felixstowe, Southampton and London Gateway.
In addition, new mega-ships continue to create port congestion since higher numbers of containers are being unloaded from each ship, which is making our rail service less efficient. For example, scheduled intermodal services more frequently depart with excess capacity, and missed containers may either go by road or by an extra train service.
In response to these market changes, we've been implementing a series of commercial and operational measures that are also taking effect in May. Four of the changes include; one, new service plans to match new port calling patterns; two, lengthening trains and optimizing wagon configurations; three, conversion of spot traffic to guaranteed contract volumes; and four, increased pricing on the spot traffic moves. The bottom line is that we have an outstanding UK intermodal franchise that is adapting to meet major market shifts, while continuing to provide world-class customer service.
Having said that, when a supply chain is reconfigured and is coupled with volume surges, our traffic flows are unlikely to be smooth right away. The acquisition of the Pentalver container logistics business, which has now been approved by the British competition authorities and then scheduled to close in early May, provides a partial release valve.

Pentalver's complementary services of container storage in the ports as well as its trucking capability should allow us to capture a portion of any lost container volumes. As a result, we expect Pentalver to perform strongly for the remainder of 2017 and ahead of our acquisition plan.
Turning to slide number 8, our priorities are unchanged for 2017. First, we are focused on maintaining our world-class safety performance.
Second, we have an intense focus on the turnaround in the UK/Europe segment, and are making good progress.
Third, we are working on significant new commercial development projects in each of our three geographic segments.
Fourth, we are focused on acquisition integration and I should note that our Northeast region made excellent progress in the first quarter with the Providence & Worcester integration.
Fifth, we remain focused on U.S. public policy under the new administration, including tax reform, the short line tax credit, and infrastructure policy. With respect to the short line tax credit, we now have 38 co-sponsors in the Senate and 161 co-sponsors in the House.
And finally, we are actively evaluating acquisition and investment opportunities across our global footprint.
And now, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, T.J. Gallagher, who will review the details of the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2017. T.J.?
Timothy J. Gallagher - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Thanks, Jack, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 9 and results. Our adjusted diluted EPS were down $0.14. To put these results into context, I've listed a series of key items in each of our operating segments that impacted earnings when comparing Q1 2017 with Q1 2016. In North America, net fuel prices were up $5 million or about $0.05 per share year-over-year, and fuel prices continue to be under the threshold at which G&W's core fuel surcharge program kicks in.
Also, as Jack mentioned earlier, we had higher-than-normal washout and derailment expense in the quarter. For example, we had roughly $1 million in expense from the flooding in California earlier this year. In Australia, Arrium filed bankruptcy in April 2016 and therefore Q1 2016 was the last quarter that included the Southern Iron fixed payment. In our UK/Europe segment, the largest year-over-year variance was UK intermodal, which Jack has already discussed. And we also had the $0.02 from the receivable write-off in Germany.
Last, there is a non-cash mark-to-market expense on the cross-currency swap we put in place to hedge the Australian dollar inter-company loan that partially funded the Glencore Rail acquisition. As a hedge on a floating rate inter-company loan, the swap doesn't quality for hedge accounting and therefore non-cash gains and losses flow through the P&L.
Keep in mind that since the exchange rate on the swap and the inter-company loan and maturity is set, the non-cash gains and losses over the life of the swap will net out to $0. All these items masked the profit contribution from stronger same railroad revenues, which grew $22.5 million or 4.8%, excluding currency.
Now let's move to our operating segments, starting with North America on slide 10. First quarter revenues increased $19.7 million or 6.6%. Excluding the Providence & Worcester, same railroad revenues increased $12.3 million or 4.1%, primarily due to stronger coal and agricultural products revenues.
Now moving to the North American carloads on slide 11. Same railroad traffic increased approximately 11,900 carloads or 3%. The significant variances were in coal, which was up over 14,000 carloads, or 30%, primarily due to higher steam coal shipments in our Midwest region. Lumber and forest products was down 1,500 carloads, or 4%, primarily due to greater truck competition as well as lower export log traffic to Asia. Our metallic's ores traffic was down 1,300 carloads, or 21%, primarily due to a plant shutdown in July of last year.

Minerals and stone traffic increased approximately 2,400 carloads, or 5%, primarily due to higher rock salt and clay traffic, partially offset by lower aggregates traffic. The rock salt traffic is higher due to a more typical 2017 winter, compared with the milder 2016 winter.
Our petroleum products traffic decreased roughly 1,400 carloads, or 5%, primarily due to lower NGL production and higher truck competition in our Northeast region. Pulp and paper volumes decreased approximately 2,600 carloads, or 6%, primarily due to strong truck competition as well as a plant outage resulting from an explosion at a customer paper mill. And last, waste volumes increased approximately 2,200 carloads, or 26%, primarily due to a new customer contract.
Now moving to slide 12. Same railroad North American average revenues per carload increased 1.2%. Excluding the impact of changes in the mix of commodities, changes in the fuel surcharges as well as currency, average revenues per carload increased 2.9%. In this quarter, we had changes in customer mix within coal, metals, agricultural products, and minerals and stone traffic that impacted average revenues per carload. Excluding these customer mix changes, the core pricing increase in the first quarter was around 3%.
Turning to Australian operations on slide 13. Recall that our results include 100% of the revenue and operating income of our Australia business as we consolidate its results, but our net income attributable to G&W reflects only our 51% ownership interest.
In Q1, Australia revenues increased $22.1 million or 42.7%, primarily due to Glencore Rail-related revenues. Also in the quarter, we had $4.6 million of revenues from two reopened mines that partially offset a $5.9 million decrease due to the loss of the Southern Iron fixed payment.
Now, slide 14. UK/Europe revenues declined $5.3 million or 4.1%, primarily due to the weaker British pound, partially offsetting were revenue increases in UK intermodal, UK heavy-haul and in Poland. UK intermodal revenues were up $3.9 million, as container volumes continued to be strong post Brexit. Poland revenues increased $3.1 million with higher construction aggregates in agricultural products traffic. In our UK heavy-haul business, revenues increased $1.4 million primarily due to a new customer.
Now let's turn to slide 15 and second quarter guidance. Let me refer you to our earlier safe harbor statement that noted that these statements are subject to a variety of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. These statements represent management's expectations regarding future results as of today, May 2, 2017, and we do not undertake any obligation to update this information. Also please note that the guidance includes roughly two months of revenue and income from the Pentalver acquisition.
In the second quarter, we expect revenues of approximately $540 million and operating income between $100 million and $105 million. Net interest expense should be approximately $27 million, and we expect D&A of approximately $67 million. Our effective tax rate should be around 38% and diluted shares should be 62.5 million. The bottom line is that we are expecting second quarter diluted EPS of approximately $0.70 to $0.75.
Same railroad North American volumes are expected to be roughly flat in Q2 compared with last year, as we expect stronger agricultural products and minerals and stone traffic to offset weaker petroleum products metallic ores and pulp and paper traffic. In Australia, the increase in same railroad carloads is primarily higher metallic ores traffic from the two reopened mines.
Last, UK/Europe volumes are expected to decline between 2% and 6%. The decline reflects lower UK intermodal traffic due to the later 2017 Easter holiday and fewer working days in the quarter than in Q2 last year. Also contributing is the elimination of certain Continental intermodal routes with the restructure of ERS as well as lower UK coal volumes. These declines are expected be partially offset by higher UK and Poland aggregates traffic.

Slide 16 provides a comparison of our original guidance from February to our updated Q2 guidance, as well as an update on the second half of 2017. Our updated guidance for Q2 is about $0.07 lower at the midpoint than the $0.80 we provided in February. Relative to our original guidance, we expect a slight decrease in North America, a slight increase in Australia, and UK/Europe to be approximately $0.06 lower primarily due to lower infrastructure services planned by Network Rail in the UK and the UK intermodal transition that Jack discussed earlier.
For the second half of 2017, that is both Q3 and Q4, our outlook is unchanged, with again North America slightly weaker and Australia slightly stronger. In the UK/Europe, our outlook is unchanged and reflects the final restructure of ERS, the implementation of the UK intermodal initiative that Jack described and the contribution from Pentalver.
Let me close with our balance sheet on slide 17. We ended the quarter with net debt's total capitalization of 42%, net adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA of 3.1 times, and $500 million of capacity under our revolver.
As a reminder, again, our Australia joint venture operations are now financed on a standalone basis, non-recourse to G&W, and the leverage metric we discussed is as calculated under the G&W parent credit facility, which funds and is secured by our North American and UK/Europe operations.
And with that, I'll open up the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session

We will now begin the question-and-answer session of today's conference. Our first question will come from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.
Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Hey. Great. Thanks. And good morning, guys.
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Good morning, Chris.
Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
I wanted to talk a little bit about the UK intermodal business. You guys highlighted some of the changes that are going on in that business. And just wanted to get a sense of maybe how we can think about the progress towards adjusting your network and then leveraging Pentalver to ultimately drive profitability here?
It seems almost like a high-class problem where you're going to have a lot of volume from some of these new mega-ships coming in, but it's going to be different than what we've seen before. So how does that kind of play out over the course of the next couple of quarters? And how is that captured in the guidance?
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Sure. Well, why don't we â we actually have two speakers on the line from London as well; Matt Walsh, who all of you know; as well as Adam Cunliffe, who runs the intermodal business for us. And why don't I kick the call over to Matt, and he can give you a flavor for what's happening on the ground in the UK right now. And Adam can provide some chip shots as we go.
So, Matt, do you want to talk about it a little bit?
Matthew O. Walsh - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. Thanks, Jack. And just to remind everyone sort of what we do over here, I mean, as Jack said, I mean we sort of have this great service product of multiple trains everyday running from each major port to inland terminal, and doing this successfully means that we need to run fully-utilized trains in the most efficient way every day.
So, as we face those congestion issues, which we've been talking about here, which are compounded by sort of this new shift in demand patterns and as well as much bigger container ships, obviously there is, as I think we called, an unprecedented change in the market which we are adapting to and working hard to continue to offer the product that we do.
And what this really means is, we're working hard with the ports to reduce the congestion. So, that means that on days of very, very high demand, we're making sure that they are loading the trains that they need to load and we don't have trains going out that aren't fully utilized, and it means that we're running longer trains wherever we can and working with the ports and make sure that that's happening.

And of course, keeping in mind that as these alliances shift ports, then obviously we have to shift along with them. And that's something that's finally coming to sort of stabilization or fruition starting in May, as all those port hauls have finally been announced. And it also means that we have to make sure that we have the right wagon size and the right place to match the shift in customer demand, which is something else that we're successfully working through here.
And then finally, as Jack said, working with our customers to make sure that we're converting. In places where there is high demand and people need the service that we offer, we're converting people who have sort of been on more of a spot tariff basis to more contracted basis in places where people aren't willing to commit to that, then we're looking to increase our tariff rate. And the object of all of that is to really smooth up volatility that we've been experiencing to running sort of that optimized train and making sure we're getting paid to do that.
And then when we look at Pentalver, Pentalver offers sort of the longer-term storage at the port, which really as we see is a nice counterbalance to some of that volatility, offering customers who include both sort of the freight-forwarders, the shipping companies, but also the end users, within all this congestion, a place to sort of â and I think we call it sort of an escape out as a place to store their containers while their ultimate destination is decided upon.
And that's both for the imports and for the exports, and being able to offer them both is actually quite important. And so it's actually a very nice complimentary investment to what we have today.
I don't know, Adam, would you add anything to that?
Adam Cunliffe - Freightliner Group Ltd.
I don't there's much I can add to that, but what I can say from the first quarter is that the current daily range we have can spread between something where we have a 700-box swing on a daily basis because of the kind of assets utilization problems we've got whereby the mega-ships come in, where we don't have enough capacity to serve them, but the customer base is looking for the capacity at a higher level.
So, for the very reason, as Jack and Matt have now outlined, having a service plan that allows us to offer something where they are longer trains on services where there's higher demand and converging spot contract, which is something we are having a huge effort at the moment to actually address those inconsistencies in delivery is something we're working on very hard.
Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
And just following up on â that's certainly helpful. And following up on the question about the guidance. It looks like you have I think one more quarter of headwind in there before this starts to normalize, and I guess that's sort of driven by the fact that we have a scheduling changing in May and then sort of you're adjusting your operations. Is that the way we should think about that?
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Yeah. What you're seeing is a mixture of operational changes as well as rate changes, starting to bite in May. You flow into the third quarter, a good chunk of them will be fully implemented, as the volumes are increasing and because from a seasonal standpoint, Q3, Q4 is when we pick up.
And so you're starting to feel the normalized business in the back half of the year. I think, I mean to â you asked a question about guidance. We left some cushion in there on things not going perfectly by not adjusting our outlook for Pentalver, because we think Pentalver is going to do better. And so this is our best estimate of the outlook as of today, which gives us some cushion on the Pentalver side. Because if things are flowing smoothing, our parking lot is going to be full.

Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then just one follow-up on sort of acquisition in terms of time on the FECR at the beginning of the call, just wanted to get a sense. Post that transaction, how do you see the landscape, particularly for deals of a degree of size like FECR was? I mean, are there other sort of interesting opportunities out there of size or maybe are we thinking about sort of smaller opportunities as you go forward? Just trying to get a sense of how the landscape looks now.
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, there's both. We have an active pipeline of both acquisitions and investments across the global footprint that we think can generate good returns, and some are bigger than others, and that was obviously a big one. And so, when I said on our last call â I think the question was, are you skewed towards any one geography? I said North America, but I'd also caveat it that I will be wrong in terms of whatever I say, and I guess that was right in that regard. But that skewing towards North America was derivative of our attention to FEC. But we still have stuff â we have an active pipeline that's going on in multiple geographies right now.
Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Sure.

Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
...look at the three major acquisitions at the same time, given how quickly I guess coal and some of the UK business melted down, how do you step back and look at that? Do you want to kind of step back and maybe focus on a region? Did business really just change that quickly?
And I guess, if you bring it back to the U.S., do you see underlying growth at the core assets? I think, Jack, you mentioned at the start, you're not really seeing it in North America. A bit of a contrast to some of the large rails. Maybe dig into that a little bit as well.
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Sure. Ken, I think the first part of your question, you might have been on mute for. I think you started talking and we didn't pick up the first part of it...
Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yeah.
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
...but I think it's related to the perspective on the UK acquisition.
Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
I think just doing three major â sorry, it wasn't from my side. But maybe doing the three major global ones at the same time, how quickly coal and other business melted down in the UK, do you kind of step back and say, maybe we need to slow down that doing multiple at the same time and kind of focus and integrate? Or do you feel like it was just something that, hey, the business really changed that quickly?
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Oh. No. I mean, definitely not. Each acquisition is reviewed in gruesome detail and isolation. And we'd never be biting off things we didn't think we could handle. So it's the latter. The business changed quickly.
But I'm pretty philosophical about it because it's been painful for two years. You've had shock-after-shock in the UK. Two out of the three shocks we had anticipated in some shape or form in that the coal we expected to go away. It just went away a lot more quickly. So we hadn't ascribed that much value to the coal as part of the long-term franchise. But we've had to navigate restructuring sooner than we expected as well as the overhang of some leases. But that was expected.
With respect to the ERS in Continental Europe, we ascribed a little bit of value to it in the acquisition model thinking that there could be some upside option value of that franchise. As we got into it, we decided that that was incorrect, cut your losses and move on and focus on the part of the business which is solid, which is what we're doing now.

And so really the only one of the bunch that's sort of â in terms of if you look out and say year three or year four of a long-term cash flow contribution of the business, the only surprise one has been the â or the true surprise â I mean, each of those events is obviously painful in its own right, but it's been the intermodal, the changes in the intermodal markets that we're working through right now.
I mean, and the issue isn't one of volume, the issue is one of getting new operating plans based on new container flows in conjunction with a restructuring of an industry, which truly is unprecedented if you look at the container shipping industry. But the fact of the matter is we're well-positioned, as that market stabilizes, to capture a significant share based on an outstanding service product. And with Pentalver, we think that only enhances the franchise.
So I think you'll look back on Freightliner and I do expect it to be on or ahead of what we expected when we originally purchased it. But obviously, our timing was terrible. But we're getting it there. And there's a lot of people working on chipping away at it.
Now, with respect to North America, I'd say there's modest growth. It's truly a commodity-by-commodity, customer-by-customer outlook. There's some modest growth in the business right now. It's flat to slightly increasing. We've got some plants that are coming online later in the year, whether it's rebar in Oklahoma, or cement in Dallas, or DDGs and cement in South Dakota, or whatever â there's a bunch of other stuff coming online. You can see these projects coming through the industrial development pipeline and kicking in in the back half of the year.
Coal has been a little better than we expected thus far in the year, and that's going to be â it's now the peaking facility. So the heat of the summer is going to dictate how that plays out over the course of the year. I think we've been pretty cautious in our outlook for coal, but maybe it'll heat up in the Midwest and we'll do a little better.
Let's see, what other things. I mean, paper, we've been off a little bit in paper, but for us, in the paper commodity group, half of the shortfall is an explosion at the plant, which was out of service I don't know, Michael, for what? Two, three months, something like that?
Michael O. Miller - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Two months.
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Yeah. Two months. We did have a chemicals plant close, which is sort of a one-off thing, up in our Northeast region, which is affecting carloads as well. But, overall, the economy feels okay, but we haven't seen any signs of sort of accelerating around the corner or anything like that.
There's lots of interesting dynamics afoot. There's lumber tariffs being contemplated between the U.S. and Canada. Calculating its impact on us is pretty tricky. For lack of a better answer, I'd say it's probably pretty neutral for us, because we'll get a positive lift on the West Coast of the United States from competing British Columbian lumber. But where we're the receiving end of lumber, for example in New England, that may curtail shipments dropping down from Canada. But I can caveat that by saying, that lumber has to come from somewhere and we may end up originating it in the Southeastern United States. So there's a lot of patterns that remain to play out in lumber.
Any other commodities to talk about? I think that's a good flavor for it. But the economy feels okay.
Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yeah.
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
It feels okay.
Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
That's a good rundown. Thank you. Just one other follow-up I guess on Australia. Do you have other mines coming back? I guess, do you get a heads up as they're coming back to stage assets and prepare? You talked about the mines coming out. I just want to understand maybe the magnitude of what we could see as business returns.

John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Yeah. Well, some of it's new mines coming up and some of it is â we're bidding on projects in various geographies right now. And so there's a lot of stuff in the hopper.
I'll tell you, I've never gone through a commodity cycle like this one. So I'm not speaking with multiple decades of experience here. I have been surprised at how quickly some of these mines have come back on. You watch that â I mean, it's fairly obvious, with benefit of hindsight, you watch a commodity price jump up 45% and it puts the mine back in the money. People suddenly start hustling and figuring out how to make it work, even if they've got it in care and maintenance.
And so I've been surprised at how quickly a couple of these mines have come back on. But the ones that we're looking at now, I would say, are less about new mines coming back on and more about new projects that we're bidding on at existing mines that are actually operational today. So it's a slightly different dynamic than what you've seen so far.
Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
That's great insight.
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Yeah. Dave Brown is on the line from Australia. I don't know â Dave, would you add anything to that?
David A. Brown - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
No. I think you've covered it well, Jack. I mean, the particular manganese mine that you mentioned in your slide deck was really, within a 30-day window, was mobilized with the assets we had available to restart that. So we do have some excess capacity in our resources in Australia, and the Australian team is very focused on being nimble as new opportunities present themselves to get them online quickly.
Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great. Jack, thank you. Thanks, Dave.
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
You're welcome.

Our next question will come from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Good morning. Thanks. With the management change at CSX and the rapid network rationalization that's in motion, have you had discussions with the company or do you see any opportunities to short-line any of CSX's business? And if opportunities do exist, do you think you have a competitive advantage given the success you had with improving the operations of the west DM&E, following the deal that you made with CP when Hunter was at the helm?
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Well, I mean the short answer is â yeah, I mean the Rapid City, Pierre & Eastern is a wonderful precedent in terms of the value of the short-line model, because that was a transaction where it was a great deal for the CP. It turned out to be a terrific deal for us. It's been good for the customers and it's been good for the state. And so, that was one of the larger short-line deals that had happened in a long, long time. And by all accounts, that's been a very, very successful transaction for all parties concerned. So it's certainly good to have a precedent like that.
In terms of how one answers the other question, it's really a question for CSX themselves. I mean, the way I think about it is their market capitalization has increased about, I don't know, $15 billion over a very short interval of time. And the idea that you're going to unlock $15 billion of value from doing short lines is probably unlikely. There's a lot of other things that are going to happen first with respect to the precision railroading and all the things that will make the network more fluid and generate more profits and free cash flow.
And then, I think a natural out â as time progresses and they look at how the network is performing and where there's lower density lines, then I think a logical secondary step might be in the world of short lines. But I'm guessing it's certainly not number one out of the shoot and ultimately it's a question for the team at CFX.

Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Okay. That was a helpful explanation. And then my second question relates to the petrochemical opportunity in the Southeast. That basically should be coming online over the next few years and we're starting to hear the Class 1s talk a little bit more about it. And it seems like from the producer angle that what we're hearing is that, looking at this, much of it's going to be exported, but they sort of want to utilize any ports that they can to get the product to market. So I was wondering how you think about your opportunity to be involved in that.
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Michael, do you want to answer that? Did you hear the question in its entirety, Michael?
Michael O. Miller - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
I did. I did. Allison, I think our view of this is we're working very closely with the plastics producers. And clearly, the key driver here is going to be empty boxes and ports that have balance. We are looking at all the ports that we serve. We're working with the ports that we serve and we're actually working with producers to come up with the supply chain solution that helps.
I don't think anybody has put flags in the ground yet. Clearly, there are some solutions been developed around Dallas for export boxes. They are going back to the West Coast. There's certainly east of the East Coast ports are looking at solutions and the Gulf Coast ports are going to be the closest to proximity.
All I can say is this, we are out there working with the customers and the ports, and as opportunity presents itself, we'll be in a good position to develop a solution. We know what levers that producers are looking for, and we're trying to make sure we have those available to them if they pick a port that we serve.
Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Okay. And do you...
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Michael, do you want to talk a little bit about some of the plastics that we currently serve today or is coming online, whether it's in Corpus, or in the P&W, storage, or just give some color on the plastics.
Michael O. Miller - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, Allison, we do serve several of plastics facilities in the Southwestern market and the Gulf Coast. So we are close with those customers. There is a new facility coming online at Corpus where we serve. Some of that will be exports. Some of that will display some domestic production. I mean, we see it as a large growth opportunity. How much we plan, it will ultimately be as to where the products ultimately flow for export.
Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Right. Okay. Great. Overall, the takeaway is that you see it as a pretty significant volume and revenue opportunity...
Michael O. Miller - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Yeah. Clearly, for the industry, it could be a positive. The ultimate question is going to be where does it flow to put into containers, because the vast majority of what's being coming online is for export.
Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Right. Okay.
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Yeah. It's certainly a staggering size of opportunity in that industry. And so, as a business development target, it's certainly way up there on the priority list because of the magnitude of the â you know what the magnitude of the investment is, not just this year, but the coming year is that which is planned right now, and we're trying to figure out how to best position ourselves.
Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC

Our next question will come from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Ivan Yi - Wolfe Research LLC
Good morning. This is Ivan Yi on for Scott Group.

John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Morning, Ivan. How are you?
Ivan Yi - Wolfe Research LLC
Great. First on M&A. Given the 14.5 times EBITDA multiple paid for Florida East Coast, is the M&A market simply becoming more competitive? Also, does the valuation on this deal in any way change how you value your own asset in the market?
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
So the first part of the question was does it impact how we think about valuation. I'm sorry, can you repeat...
Timothy J. Gallagher - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Competition.
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Competition? Yeah, I mean the competition â for standalone competitive auctions, there's typically â we won't always be successful. What was unusual about this one was that we had tremendous synergies. And from holding all other variables constant standpoint, we should be a successful acquirer because of the magnitude of those synergies. So, yes, and that evaluation on a standalone basis was surprising.
Having said that, we've been doing this for a long time and have seen cycles like this. And our footprint is much wider now than it ever was historically. And so we see across our global footprint opportunities where we think we're uniquely positioned to be making investments that yield our typical return profile and in ways that wouldn't be open to a broader competitive auction process.
Whether we're providing operating acumen or whether you're in a geography where other peoples just aren't, there's ample places to deploy capital where you don't have to â we're never going to compromise our investment criteria.
Let's see, what was the rest of the question? Did I cover most of it?
Ivan Yi - Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah. Just wanted to specifically hone in on how does this deal impact the way you value your own assets?
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
It's not in terms of how we value the assets. It'll be how the market values our assets. I mean it's obviously â it's pretty high valuation. And so, yeah, in relative terms, that's quite an arbitrage.
Ivan Yi - Wolfe Research LLC
Great. Secondly, on the regulatory side, can we still get the short-line tax credit if we get broader tax reform, meaning would any tax reform eliminate the tax credit?
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Not necessarily. I mean I think, in a perfect world, the broader tax reform would be tremendously beneficial to us. And we would â so we're eager to see some variation of some plans be implemented, because we're an asset-intensive business. Most variations of those plans are highly favorable to companies that invest as we do domestically.
And then whether the â the short line tax credit, it falls in the infrastructure bucket. And so its guise may no longer be a tax credit, it could be some other infrastructure-related plan. There are several scenarios where you have your cake and eat it too, where you're beneficiary of the broader corporate tax reform, and find some version of the short-line tax credit, which is the public-private partnership, which is in line with the current administration's thinking or some variance thereof that becomes a stimulus for infrastructure spending, and lets us continue to do what we've always done in upgrading our railroads. So I don't think they're mutually exclusive...
Ivan Yi - Wolfe Research LLC
Okay.
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
...from a policy standpoint. We'll will certainly be â I can assure, we're looking at both. Most importantly, it's just to get something to happen.
Ivan Yi - Wolfe Research LLC

And our next question will come from the line of Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP

Yeah. Good morning. Just following up on the earlier question about how the Class I outlooks maybe on the balance for North America sounded a little more constructive than what you've laid out. I realize your commodity mix isn't terribly truck competitive, with very little intermodal in it in the region. But your length of haul is also considerably shorter than your Class I partners.
Is truck competition playing into this in any way? I mean, have you felt that in ways that you haven't in previous years? Can you just kind of give us an update on where you sit versus truck and if that balance is changing at all?
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, I'll kick it to Michael in a second here. The place we've been feeling truck recently has been, and we have been for some time, has been paper. And it's been derivative of low fuel prices. And in certain geographies, we felt it. You've seen it flowing through our numbers for some time. And so we are working extremely hard with our major paper customers to alter their perspective on the economics of rail.
And I wouldn't say â I mean, I don't think of it in terms of length of haul per se relative to the Class I. We're part of a continuous haul overall. And so it's a question of getting good through efficient routes at appropriate rates to stimulate some more modal shift back to rail, because we think we can be doing better in paper than we have been doing and are focused on it.
So I don't know, Michael, do you want to talk a little bit about paper, or anywhere else you want to talk about truck competition?
Michael O. Miller - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Yeah. Bascome, I would say â I mean, we do face truck competition in paper and lumber, also in metals. And I would say, just because we don't have an intermodal portfolio, doesn't mean we don't face truck competition.
And clearly, that has been a little bit of a headwind for us. I mean, to put in perspective, base truck rates in general haven't changed in 10 years. It's all been fuel-related. So, with low fuel prices, it does create a significant competitor out there, and we are working really closely with our customers to really understand what's being converted, what we can convert back. And actually probably the single biggest growth opportunity for us in North America is going to be modal shift back to the industrial products carload business.
So we are really focused on it. Clearly, we think there's going to be opportunities as truck capacity gets a little tighter, fuel prices go up. We just have to stay very close, work very closely with our customers and know what opportunities are there to convert from highway to rail.
Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Well, I appreciate the comprehensive answer there. And from a high level, can you give us a perspective on where free cash flow outlook sits with a year relative to what you laid out in February?
Timothy J. Gallagher - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Yeah. Sure, Bascome. This is T.J. I believe our original free cash flow forecast was around $278 million. With all the puts and takes we've talked about, my best guess right now would be maybe a little lower, $270 million. So it's still on the same ZIP code, not materially different.

Our next question will come from the line of Justin Long of Stephens. Please go ahead.
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
Thanks, and good morning.
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Morning. How are you, Justin?
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
I'm doing well. Thanks.
Timothy J. Gallagher - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Hey, Justin.
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
So, wanted to ask first about the longer-term picture for the European segment, given all the changes over the past couple of years that you walked through. I guess, first, once the planned restructuring is complete, what do you view as the annual run rate operating income for that business? And then, second, how should we think about the long-term growth profile of this business off of that new base?

John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Matt, do you want to sketch out just a broad picture in pounds? And we haven't really given that information, so we'll speak to it very broadly. But do you want to just give a schematic on that? Just speak to it in EBITDA instead of EBIT.
Matthew O. Walsh - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Sure. I mean, I want to be â I'd probably look to chuck what we discussed, what we have in our guidance here, and maybe think about that on â with the second half of the year, thinking that as a run rate business. We talked about the UK and some of the projects that are undergoing. There are some pretty significant infrastructure projects that we're quite optimistic about.
One is HS2, which is a significant â it's probably one of the largest infrastructure projects in the world, where it's constructing new high-speed rail line moving north from London up towards Birmingham and then points north from there, the expansion of the third runway at Heathrow.
There's also some large power/energy facilities being constructed, which all point to sort of increased demand for aggregate, which we would expect to play a significant part in. So I think from the bulk side, which you've heard us talk less about, we're actually quite optimistic about the growth of that over the next couple of years. I mean, it is difficult to put specific numbers around that, but those are all quite positive.
On the intermodal side, I think we should grow and I think the way we think about the business is that it grows sort of along with port growth and maritime container growth. It typically has been GDP-plus and that's how we think about that business. So I would start with, and I'm trying to be as helpful as possible here, thinking about a more run rate for the second quarter here, start for the second half of the year, in terms of our guidance and thinking about that on a run rate basis, and then with some good growth opportunity from that.
And then, I think the addition of Pentalver is a big benefit in terms of increasing our footprint and really falls into how we communicate our acquisition plan to the market, which is we make an investment in an existing footprint and then grow through complementary acquisitions from there, which I think is another good example of that, and then should lead to opportunity for further investments.
So I think, Jack, I'm probably most comfortable in answering it that away, if that's okay.
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
No, no, it's good. That's perfect.
Matthew O. Walsh - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
I'm just looking at it on EBITDA basis for the second half of the year. I think what we're guiding people to in the UK and Europe is anywhere between $40 million to $45 million of EBITDA on a run rate basis. So I think that's probably how we see the business and then with sort of that upside coming from there, so.
Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Great, Matt. That's really helpful. Thanks for all that color. And then, maybe secondly on the second half guidance, I was wondering what you're assuming for the change in same railroad volumes within North America? And maybe within that number, if you could talk about your outlook for coal and grains, and so they're two areas where the comps get quite a bit tougher in the back half.
Timothy J. Gallagher - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
So our updated outlook for the full year North America, the carloads are modestly positive. So, with respect to coal, I mean that's the wild card. Right now it's basically flat for the full year, stronger first quarter. In our guidance, it's flat for the full year. But, again, depending on the summer and the weather, we'll see how it goes. Agricultural products, we've got tougher comps, but again, right now our outlook is up.

Justin Long - Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Great. I'll leave it at that. I appreciate the time today.
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Great. Thank you.

Due to time constraints, our last question will come from the line of Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hey. Thanks a lot for taking the questions. I appreciate it.
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Sure.
Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
The first one is just a quick one. It's related to the cyclone in Australia â or I guess the typhoon in Australia.
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Yeah.
Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Just wondering if that has had an impact in the second quarter. Just trying to understand what the disruption is there, so maybe that's maybe depressing second quarter.
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
No. Dave, do you want to talk about the typhoon that hung on left before it got to us? I assume that's the one you're talking...
David A. Brown - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Yeah. Sure it is. Yeah. Exactly. Cyclone Debbie, that actually affected Queensland coal production and transport, but most of it really came inland, sort of 500 kilometers, 600 kilometers north of Brisbane. It came inland and took a little bit of a left and then just dissipated. So our biggest concern was downstream impacts in the interior, which didn't materialize. So it did not affect our coal business at all.
Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's great. Let me just ask one more kind of related to an earlier question about free cash flow, just more sort of philosophical question. I'd imagine that, given the acquisitive nature of the company, that's kind of the number I would imagine that the management team would be focused on.
So, just beyond this year, I mean just high level, I'm not asking for guidance, but I'm just trying to understand given the outlook for the earnings profile, the pipeline of new deals, what type of free cash flow per share growth over short of the mid-term would you want to target, and look back and say, okay, you know this is what we achieved and it was successful?
And then kind of related to that, you guys have this value-added parameter in your long-term incentive framework. It just seems like it's a proxy for return on invested capital, if I read it correctly, which is obviously great. But it seems like it could also introduce the potential for maybe some under-investment in the business or a potential for under-investment in the business. And maybe I'm reading that wrong, but if you could just talk about that and help us understand?
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Sure. Yeah. I think your second question is a great one in terms of how one structures any kind of compensation framework, because especially in an asset-intensive industry, when you slap EVA-type programs on their management, there ultimately you've got to have complete trust in the quality of the people running the business that they're not starving the assets and that they're being invested in appropriately.
The best way to judge that by the way is what the trajectory is and the trend line is, and current things like FRA reportable derailments and the like, which in our case have come down the last three years 45%. And our assets have never been in better shape. So, that's ultimately a judgment call as to how good the management you have in place running each of those operations and whether they're appropriately investing for the long term; and we are.
And the reason that works within our framework is we sort of have a trust but verify. Ronald Reagan trust but verify operation of the business whereby, in addition to each of the regions having tremendous autonomy in terms of how they run their businesses and invest in their businesses, we have a check of best practices and various metrics that we apply across the capital plans for each of our regions to ensure that we're investing at appropriate levels.

And so, that's a rigorous part of our budgeting process, and it basically puts not just in addition to trusting that you've got great people running your business, it puts another cross-check on it, making sure you're investing at levels that make good sense in the context of the 10 other regions that you operate, because we can benchmark versus ourselves very easily in terms of how we're doing internally for each of our 10 operating regions.
It's a terrific question, because it's the biggest â that's the one you always got to keep your eye on. And we've institutionalized processes, whether they be safety or these budgeting checks, to make sure that we're always investing appropriately.
Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Can you address the free cash flow one?
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Sure. Was that answer not good enough? I thought it felt pretty good.
Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
No, that was a great answer, but I just had a couple of part questions.
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Yeah. No, I mean, my answer on free cash flow â you can see over the last couple of years, if you look at our book earnings, I'm going to talk in rough numbers off the top of my head. But you've been looking at book earnings declines of, right, what 10% to 10%, 15%, but we've been growing our free cash flow at about 10% per year in a tough environment, free cash flow per share, if you do the math on that.
And that's in a pretty down market. And so my target â if we're doing our job, deploying capital well, investing appropriately, we should be growing at that long-term 15% to 20% free cash flow per share rate as our target. I mean, that's what our internal profile is for growth for the company. It's often expressed as a book EPS number.
To your point, you're right, it's a free cash flow number that's relevant and that is in terms of how we measure the management of the business. And as you can see, we managed through some pretty rough years over the last two, three years and you've watched our free cash flow not only remained stable, but actually sequentially increasing through a tough part of the cycle.
So I think the short answer to my question is that you think â I mean, structurally, holding tax policy constant, holding other variable constant, can we grow at that rate inclusive of the incremental free cash flow of acquisitions? Yes. That's kind of where we're at.
Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's super helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.
John C. Hellmann - Genesee & Wyoming, Inc.
Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. It's a great question. I appreciate it.
