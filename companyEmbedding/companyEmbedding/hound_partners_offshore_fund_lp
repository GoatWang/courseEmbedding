Tiger Seed Auerbach’s Hound Partners Launches New Funds

Hound Partners





					The firm has debuted a concentrated fund and its anticipated long-only fund. 
				



Jonathan Auerbach’s Hound Partners has launched
    two new hedge funds in the new year.
The New York–based hedge fund firm has raised about
    $130 million for Hound Partners Concentrated Fund and an
    offshore equivalent. It also raised about $95 million for Hound
    Partners Long Fund and an offshore counterpart. Hound disclosed
    the launches in separate regulatory filings.
Hound is the latest Tiger Management ancestor to create a
    long only fund for investors in the past year alone. Auerbach
    is what is known as a Tiger Seed, because he received start-up
    investment capital from Tiger Management founder Julian
    Robertson, Jr. Auerbach cofounded his firm with Scott McLellan
    in 2004 while working at Tiger Management. (In 2007, McLellan
    left to launch Marble Arch Partners with Tiger alum Timothy
    Jenkins.) Auerbach previously served as a senior analyst at
    Ziff Brothers Investments before joining Tiger Management.
The long-only fund is no surprise to Alpha readers.
    We reported last July that Auerbach was
    considering launching one.
In a letter dated July 18, Auerbach said such a vehicle had
    been "under strong consideration" for a year and a half after
    he was inspired by a "very positive commentary of another Tiger
    Cub who Julian [Robertson] had over for lunch," we reported at
    the time.
Auerbach did not name the Cub. He also said a few investors
    had been asking for a long-only product. "We are actively
    debating the pros and cons of offering such a vehicle and would
    love your feedback," Auerbach urged investors.
Last year Tiger Global Management, founded by Tiger Cub
    Charles (Chase) Coleman, raised about $1.1 billion for its new
    long-only equity fund, called Tiger Global Long Opportunities,
    and its offshore version, according to a regulatory filing. The
    funds were launched on October 1 with a minimum investment of
    $1 million. We had reported earlier in the year that the New
    York-based hedge fund firm was mulling a long-only fund.
    Coleman runs Tiger Global’s hedge funds with
    partner Feroz Dewan, who oversees them on a day-to-day
    basis.
Earlier in the year, Philippe Laffont’s New
    York–based hedge fund firm Coatue Management began
    raising money for the Coatue Long Only Partners fund. Other
    Tiger Cubs who manage successful long-only funds include
    Stephen Mandel Jr. of Lone Pine Capital, O. Andreas Halvorsen
    of Viking Global Investors and Lee Ainslie of Maverick
    Capital.
In 2013 Hound Partners, Auerbauch’s long-short
    fund, finished the year up 16 percent. In a November letter
    obtained by Alpha, the hedge fund, which was up 17.23
    percent through the first 11 months of the year, pointed out
    that its long portfolio had gained 38.75 percent before
    accounting for fees. The short portfolio had lost 14.43 through
    November. At the time, Hound was 96 percent long and 65 percent
    short.
