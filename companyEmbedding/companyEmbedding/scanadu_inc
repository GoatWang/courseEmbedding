The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Scanadu Secures $35 Million in Series B Funding to Advance Go-to-Market Plans | Business Wire
























































Scanadu Secures $35 Million in Series B Funding to Advance 
      Go-to-Market Plans






April 27, 2015 04:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA– Scanadu 
      Inc., the Silicon Valley based medtech company that is building a family 
      of mobile medical products for consumers, today announced that it has 
      received $35 million in Series B funding to help further its vision to 
      put the diagnostic power of a hospital in our smartphones. The funding 
      round was led by Fosun International and Tencent Holdings Limited, with 
      participation from China Broadband Capital and Iglobe Partners of 
      Singapore, as well as A-round investors Relay Ventures, Redmile Group, 
      Ame Cloud Ventures and Three Leaf Ventures, an affiliate of The Broe 
      Group. With this round, Scanadu has raised $49.7 million in total 
      funding to date.
    


      “We continue to build out our family of products and move down the path 
      to regulatory clearance in the U.S. and China,” said Scanadu founder and 
      CEO Walter De Brouwer. “Scanadu’s mission has always been to give eight 
      billion people access to quality healthcare via their smartphones.”
    

      This month Scanadu will complete shipment of their first set of 
      investigational Scanadu Scout™ devices to their more than 8,000 
      Indiegogo supporters. The device measures for heart rate, core body 
      temperature, blood oxygenation, and cuffless and calibration-free 
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure in one scan in seconds, and shares 
      those results to an app on Android and iOS smartphones. Scanadu is 
      currently working toward FDA submission and approval for that device, as 
      well as Scanadu Urine (formerly known as ScanaFlo), an at-home urine 
      test that similarly shares important health data to your smartphone.
    

      "Fosun built Fosun Shanghai pharmaceutical’s business from the ground 
      up, and we have long been committed to innovations in healthcare,” said 
      Guao Guanchang, chairman of Fosun International. “When we looked at 
      Scanadu, we saw a company solving a problem that affects virtually 
      everyone. Our investment in Scanadu aligns with our deep interest in 
      leveraging the magic of the mobile Internet to improve ties across the 
      hospital, pharmaceutical and health insurance industries.”
    

      "Advances in health technology are bringing powerful capabilities to 
      understand our bodies via our smart phones. These trends will 
      revolutionize health care over the long-term,” said David Wallerstein, 
      chief eXploration officer and senior executive vice president of Tencent 
      Holdings Limited. “Scanadu is leading this trend with innovative and 
      consumer-friendly diagnostic products that deeply leverage the power of 
      smart phone and cloud technologies. We're excited to join the Scanadu 
      team on this journey."
    

New investors include:



Fosun International, often called the Berkshire Hathaway of 
        China, is the largest privately-owned conglomerate in Mainland 
        China (US$88 billion). Fosun has concentrated assets in hospitals, 
        pharma companies and health insurance companies in China and is 
        expanding its investment business globally.
      

Tencent Holdings Limited is a leading provider of Internet 
        services in China. Tencent’s diversified services include QQ, 
        Weixin/WeChat for communications; Qzone for social networking; QQ Game 
        Platform for online games; QQ.com and Tencent News app for information 
        and Tencent Video app for video content.
      

China Broadband Capital (CBC) is a China-based venture capital 
        fund focused on TMT (telecommunication, media and technology) 
        innovations both in China and globally. Besides its active investments 
        in China, CBC’s cross-border investment initiative brought Evernote 
        and LinkedIn to China. CBC manages three US dollar funds and a 
        Renminbi fund with total AUM of over $1 billion.
      

iGlobe Partners is a leading Asia Pacific Venture Capital firm 
        headquartered in Singapore, with presence in Silicon Valley and 
        Shanghai. With decades of technology investment experience and deep 
        cross-border expertise, iGlobe is in a unique position to organize 
        international investment syndicates, having guided portfolio companies 
        over multiple business cycles, to scale their business globally to 
        successful exits.
      


      Scanadu also recently expanded its Board of Directors. New appointees 
      include:
    


Dr. Robert Harrington, MD – Arthur L. Bloomfield Professor of 
        Medicine and Chair of the Department of Medicine at Stanford 
        University, Dr. Harrington is board certified in internal medicine and 
        cardiovascular disease and a member of the board of directors of the 
        American Heart Association.
      

Ezra Kucharz – President of Local Digital Media at CBS 
        Corporation, Mr. Kucharz began his career with NASA and has since 
        founded, built and scaled a number of digital media businesses.
      


About Scanadu


      Based at NASA-Ames Research Center, Scanadu is using mobile and sensor 
      technology to develop a portfolio of FDA approved, consumer friendly 
      products that put the experience of an emergency room in the palm of 
      your hand. Unveiled in November 2012, the company is working to ensure 
      this is the last generation to know so little about our health. The 
      product portfolio includes the Scanadu Scout vital sign monitor and 
      Scanadu Urine, a urine analysis test. In July 2013, Scanadu became the 
      most funded campaign on Indiegogo, enlisting supporters to be a part of 
      the first usability study, followed by clinical studies for the 
      company’s road to FDA approval. Scanadu was founded by Walter de Brouwer 
      in 2011 and is a finalist in the Qualcomm 
      Tricorder XPRIZE. For more information visit www.Scanadu.com.

Scanadu is a Silicon Valley-based company developing next generation tests, devices, and services that empower anyone to monitor and better understand their own health - anytime, anywhere. Scanadu is identifying the latest advances in the life sciences and applying its expertise in artificial intelligence, product design and user experience, hardware, software, clinical, and regulatory to bring to market ambitious and ground-breaking medical solutions for consumers.[1] It was founded in February 2011 by Walter De Brouwer and Misha Chellam[2][3] in Silicon Valley.[4] In mid 2011, Scanadu set up a lab at NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., to help grow the company.[2] It relocated to Sunnyvale, CA in September 2016.
A prototype of Scanadu’s first product, the Scanadu Scout, was unveiled on November 29, 2012.[5] The Scanadu Scout is a portable electronic device for consumer use designed to measure different physiological parameters, including temperature, heart rate, blood oxygenation, respiratory rate, ECG, and diastolic/systolic blood pressure.[6][7] Scanadu’s goal was to make the Scanadu Scout available by March 2014 as an investigational device to those who participated in the Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign and agreed to participate in a research study, and afterwards, to general consumers by Q1 of 2015.[8] Scanadu is seeking approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the device before bringing it to market to ensure clinical-grade accuracy.[9] Scanadu missed the initial shipping deadline; the devices finally began shipping in February 2015.[10] In April 2016, Scanadu stated that the clinical trial with over 4,000 participants was ongoing,[11] however in December 2016 they sent a message to the study subjects stating that the initial device has supported extensive data collection; and the Scout investigational device would only be supported until the end of the study, after which it would cease to function.

Products[edit]
On November 29, 2012, the company unveiled a suite of new tools to “revolutionize consumer healthcare.” The Scanadu Scout is a lightweight device that is touched to a patient’s temple and is touted as being able to return key vital sign results in less than 10 seconds. Project ScanaFlo is a urinanalysis test for conditions like preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, kidney failure and urinary tract infections. Project ScanaFlu is used when a patient is exhibiting cold-like symptoms. The saliva test checks for Strep A, Influenza A and B, adenovirus, and RSV.[5] The suite of products, originally conceived of in partnership with IDEO,[12] is being designed by award-winning industrial designer Yves Behar.[13]
Scanadu’s long-term product vision is to combine a broad array of electrical and biochemical sensors with intelligent algorithms to create a real-life Tricorder.[14] Accordingly, the company is often mentioned as a leading contender for the $10m Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize.[15] Another of Scanadu’s goals is to develop a corps of users willing to share their medical readings, such as heart rates and stress, over many years.[16] The idea is to help enable personalized medicine by generating collective information about the relationships between such readings as respiration, temperature and oxygen intake before the onset of a disease.[16]
The need for a product like the Scanadu Scout occurred to CEO Walter De Brouwer in 2003 after his five-year-old son[17] fell about 40 feet and lapsed into a coma for 11 weeks.[16] De Brouwer learned that none of his son’s various health data was being consolidated for collective analysis. “To someone from the tech world, this was like something from the dinosaur age,” he told The New York Times.[16]
Personnel[edit]
Walter De Brouwer, a co-founder, stepped down from CEO in April 2016, and Jaime Tenedorio was promoted to Chief Executive Officer.[11]
The company includes team members specializing in the fields of design, hardware, software, algorithm development, regulatory, clinical testing, manufacturing, and in-vitro diagnostics.
Funding and clinical trials[edit]
During summer 2013, Scanadu raised $1.66 million from 8,800 backers in more than 100 countries through Indiegogo.[16][18] Of those investors, more than 20 percent were U.S.-based medical professionals such as doctors and nurses.[16] Scanadu has since received an additional $10.5 million in Series A funding from Relay Ventures, Tony Hsieh's VegasTechFund, Jerry Yang's Ame Cloud Ventures, The Broe Group, Mindful Investors and Redmile Group.[4][19]
As of November 2013, Scanadu had raised $14.7 million.[9] The funding will support Scanadu’s goals of participating in clinical trials to win FDA approval and then bringing the Scanadu Scout to market.[9] Also in November 2013, Scanadu announced it had formed a Medical Advisory Board and would conduct its first clinical trials at the Scripps Translational Science Institute.[20]
In April 2015, Scanadu announced it had raised $35 million in new funding and $49.7 million in total funding so far.[21][22]
Press and accolades[edit]
Scanadu has received press attention from a number of blogs and media outlets such as The New York Times,[16] The Wall Street Journal,[23] NBC's TODAY show,[24] Popular Science,[25] The Economist,[26] Fast Company,[27] Forbes,[28] Time,[29] TechCrunch,[30] Wired,[31] and the MIT Technology Review.[32] It has also won a number of accolades including:
• CES Innovations 2014 Design and Engineering Award for Health and Fitness (honorable mention).[33]
• 2014 Everyday Health Award for Innovation in the Healthy Consumer category.[34]
• VentureBeat 26 Amazing Startups You Need to Watch in 2014.[35]
• CES Best Innovation of 2013 in Personal Electronics Category.[36]
• Company of the Year by the 14,000+ member Digital Health LinkedIn (NASDAQ: LNKD) group, beating out other notable health tech companies such as Fitbit, Withings, Qardio, AliveCor, and Proteus Digital Health, among others.[37]
• Number Two Health Story of 2012 in Fast Company[38]
• Number Ten Medtech Story of 2012 in VentureBeat.[39]

Scanadu is a Silicon Valley-based company developing next generation tests, devices, and services that empower anyone to monitor and better understand their own health - anytime, anywhere. Scanadu is identifying the latest advances in the life sciences and applying its expertise in artificial intelligence, product design and user experience, hardware, software, clinical, and regulatory to bring to market ambitious and ground-breaking medical solutions for consumers.[1] It was founded in February 2011 by Walter De Brouwer and Misha Chellam[2][3] in Silicon Valley.[4] In mid 2011, Scanadu set up a lab at NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., to help grow the company.[2] It relocated to Sunnyvale, CA in September 2016.
A prototype of Scanadu’s first product, the Scanadu Scout, was unveiled on November 29, 2012.[5] The Scanadu Scout is a portable electronic device for consumer use designed to measure different physiological parameters, including temperature, heart rate, blood oxygenation, respiratory rate, ECG, and diastolic/systolic blood pressure.[6][7] Scanadu’s goal was to make the Scanadu Scout available by March 2014 as an investigational device to those who participated in the Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign and agreed to participate in a research study, and afterwards, to general consumers by Q1 of 2015.[8] Scanadu is seeking approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the device before bringing it to market to ensure clinical-grade accuracy.[9] Scanadu missed the initial shipping deadline; the devices finally began shipping in February 2015.[10] In April 2016, Scanadu stated that the clinical trial with over 4,000 participants was ongoing,[11] however in December 2016 they sent a message to the study subjects stating that the initial device has supported extensive data collection; and the Scout investigational device would only be supported until the end of the study, after which it would cease to function.

Products[edit]
On November 29, 2012, the company unveiled a suite of new tools to “revolutionize consumer healthcare.” The Scanadu Scout is a lightweight device that is touched to a patient’s temple and is touted as being able to return key vital sign results in less than 10 seconds. Project ScanaFlo is a urinanalysis test for conditions like preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, kidney failure and urinary tract infections. Project ScanaFlu is used when a patient is exhibiting cold-like symptoms. The saliva test checks for Strep A, Influenza A and B, adenovirus, and RSV.[5] The suite of products, originally conceived of in partnership with IDEO,[12] is being designed by award-winning industrial designer Yves Behar.[13]
Scanadu’s long-term product vision is to combine a broad array of electrical and biochemical sensors with intelligent algorithms to create a real-life Tricorder.[14] Accordingly, the company is often mentioned as a leading contender for the $10m Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize.[15] Another of Scanadu’s goals is to develop a corps of users willing to share their medical readings, such as heart rates and stress, over many years.[16] The idea is to help enable personalized medicine by generating collective information about the relationships between such readings as respiration, temperature and oxygen intake before the onset of a disease.[16]
The need for a product like the Scanadu Scout occurred to CEO Walter De Brouwer in 2003 after his five-year-old son[17] fell about 40 feet and lapsed into a coma for 11 weeks.[16] De Brouwer learned that none of his son’s various health data was being consolidated for collective analysis. “To someone from the tech world, this was like something from the dinosaur age,” he told The New York Times.[16]
Personnel[edit]
Walter De Brouwer, a co-founder, stepped down from CEO in April 2016, and Jaime Tenedorio was promoted to Chief Executive Officer.[11]
The company includes team members specializing in the fields of design, hardware, software, algorithm development, regulatory, clinical testing, manufacturing, and in-vitro diagnostics.
Funding and clinical trials[edit]
During summer 2013, Scanadu raised $1.66 million from 8,800 backers in more than 100 countries through Indiegogo.[16][18] Of those investors, more than 20 percent were U.S.-based medical professionals such as doctors and nurses.[16] Scanadu has since received an additional $10.5 million in Series A funding from Relay Ventures, Tony Hsieh's VegasTechFund, Jerry Yang's Ame Cloud Ventures, The Broe Group, Mindful Investors and Redmile Group.[4][19]
As of November 2013, Scanadu had raised $14.7 million.[9] The funding will support Scanadu’s goals of participating in clinical trials to win FDA approval and then bringing the Scanadu Scout to market.[9] Also in November 2013, Scanadu announced it had formed a Medical Advisory Board and would conduct its first clinical trials at the Scripps Translational Science Institute.[20]
In April 2015, Scanadu announced it had raised $35 million in new funding and $49.7 million in total funding so far.[21][22]
Press and accolades[edit]
Scanadu has received press attention from a number of blogs and media outlets such as The New York Times,[16] The Wall Street Journal,[23] NBC's TODAY show,[24] Popular Science,[25] The Economist,[26] Fast Company,[27] Forbes,[28] Time,[29] TechCrunch,[30] Wired,[31] and the MIT Technology Review.[32] It has also won a number of accolades including:
• CES Innovations 2014 Design and Engineering Award for Health and Fitness (honorable mention).[33]
• 2014 Everyday Health Award for Innovation in the Healthy Consumer category.[34]
• VentureBeat 26 Amazing Startups You Need to Watch in 2014.[35]
• CES Best Innovation of 2013 in Personal Electronics Category.[36]
• Company of the Year by the 14,000+ member Digital Health LinkedIn (NASDAQ: LNKD) group, beating out other notable health tech companies such as Fitbit, Withings, Qardio, AliveCor, and Proteus Digital Health, among others.[37]
• Number Two Health Story of 2012 in Fast Company[38]
• Number Ten Medtech Story of 2012 in VentureBeat.[39]

Scanadu is a Silicon Valley-based company developing next generation tests, devices, and services that empower anyone to monitor and better understand their own health - anytime, anywhere. Scanadu is identifying the latest advances in the life sciences and applying its expertise in artificial intelligence, product design and user experience, hardware, software, clinical, and regulatory to bring to market ambitious and ground-breaking medical solutions for consumers.[1] It was founded in February 2011 by Walter De Brouwer and Misha Chellam[2][3] in Silicon Valley.[4] In mid 2011, Scanadu set up a lab at NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., to help grow the company.[2] It relocated to Sunnyvale, CA in September 2016.
A prototype of Scanadu’s first product, the Scanadu Scout, was unveiled on November 29, 2012.[5] The Scanadu Scout is a portable electronic device for consumer use designed to measure different physiological parameters, including temperature, heart rate, blood oxygenation, respiratory rate, ECG, and diastolic/systolic blood pressure.[6][7] Scanadu’s goal was to make the Scanadu Scout available by March 2014 as an investigational device to those who participated in the Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign and agreed to participate in a research study, and afterwards, to general consumers by Q1 of 2015.[8] Scanadu is seeking approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the device before bringing it to market to ensure clinical-grade accuracy.[9] Scanadu missed the initial shipping deadline; the devices finally began shipping in February 2015.[10] In April 2016, Scanadu stated that the clinical trial with over 4,000 participants was ongoing,[11] however in December 2016 they sent a message to the study subjects stating that the initial device has supported extensive data collection; and the Scout investigational device would only be supported until the end of the study, after which it would cease to function.

Products[edit]
On November 29, 2012, the company unveiled a suite of new tools to “revolutionize consumer healthcare.” The Scanadu Scout is a lightweight device that is touched to a patient’s temple and is touted as being able to return key vital sign results in less than 10 seconds. Project ScanaFlo is a urinanalysis test for conditions like preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, kidney failure and urinary tract infections. Project ScanaFlu is used when a patient is exhibiting cold-like symptoms. The saliva test checks for Strep A, Influenza A and B, adenovirus, and RSV.[5] The suite of products, originally conceived of in partnership with IDEO,[12] is being designed by award-winning industrial designer Yves Behar.[13]
Scanadu’s long-term product vision is to combine a broad array of electrical and biochemical sensors with intelligent algorithms to create a real-life Tricorder.[14] Accordingly, the company is often mentioned as a leading contender for the $10m Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize.[15] Another of Scanadu’s goals is to develop a corps of users willing to share their medical readings, such as heart rates and stress, over many years.[16] The idea is to help enable personalized medicine by generating collective information about the relationships between such readings as respiration, temperature and oxygen intake before the onset of a disease.[16]
The need for a product like the Scanadu Scout occurred to CEO Walter De Brouwer in 2003 after his five-year-old son[17] fell about 40 feet and lapsed into a coma for 11 weeks.[16] De Brouwer learned that none of his son’s various health data was being consolidated for collective analysis. “To someone from the tech world, this was like something from the dinosaur age,” he told The New York Times.[16]
Personnel[edit]
Walter De Brouwer, a co-founder, stepped down from CEO in April 2016, and Jaime Tenedorio was promoted to Chief Executive Officer.[11]
The company includes team members specializing in the fields of design, hardware, software, algorithm development, regulatory, clinical testing, manufacturing, and in-vitro diagnostics.
Funding and clinical trials[edit]
During summer 2013, Scanadu raised $1.66 million from 8,800 backers in more than 100 countries through Indiegogo.[16][18] Of those investors, more than 20 percent were U.S.-based medical professionals such as doctors and nurses.[16] Scanadu has since received an additional $10.5 million in Series A funding from Relay Ventures, Tony Hsieh's VegasTechFund, Jerry Yang's Ame Cloud Ventures, The Broe Group, Mindful Investors and Redmile Group.[4][19]
As of November 2013, Scanadu had raised $14.7 million.[9] The funding will support Scanadu’s goals of participating in clinical trials to win FDA approval and then bringing the Scanadu Scout to market.[9] Also in November 2013, Scanadu announced it had formed a Medical Advisory Board and would conduct its first clinical trials at the Scripps Translational Science Institute.[20]
In April 2015, Scanadu announced it had raised $35 million in new funding and $49.7 million in total funding so far.[21][22]
Press and accolades[edit]
Scanadu has received press attention from a number of blogs and media outlets such as The New York Times,[16] The Wall Street Journal,[23] NBC's TODAY show,[24] Popular Science,[25] The Economist,[26] Fast Company,[27] Forbes,[28] Time,[29] TechCrunch,[30] Wired,[31] and the MIT Technology Review.[32] It has also won a number of accolades including:
• CES Innovations 2014 Design and Engineering Award for Health and Fitness (honorable mention).[33]
• 2014 Everyday Health Award for Innovation in the Healthy Consumer category.[34]
• VentureBeat 26 Amazing Startups You Need to Watch in 2014.[35]
• CES Best Innovation of 2013 in Personal Electronics Category.[36]
• Company of the Year by the 14,000+ member Digital Health LinkedIn (NASDAQ: LNKD) group, beating out other notable health tech companies such as Fitbit, Withings, Qardio, AliveCor, and Proteus Digital Health, among others.[37]
• Number Two Health Story of 2012 in Fast Company[38]
• Number Ten Medtech Story of 2012 in VentureBeat.[39]

A prototype of Scanadu’s first product, the Scanadu Scout, was unveiled on November 29, 2012.[5] The Scanadu Scout is a portable electronic device for consumer use designed to measure different physiological parameters, including temperature, heart rate, blood oxygenation, respiratory rate, ECG, and diastolic/systolic blood pressure.[6][7] Scanadu’s goal was to make the Scanadu Scout available by March 2014 as an investigational device to those who participated in the Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign and agreed to participate in a research study, and afterwards, to general consumers by Q1 of 2015.[8] Scanadu is seeking approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the device before bringing it to market to ensure clinical-grade accuracy.[9] Scanadu missed the initial shipping deadline; the devices finally began shipping in February 2015.[10] In April 2016, Scanadu stated that the clinical trial with over 4,000 participants was ongoing,[11] however in December 2016 they sent a message to the study subjects stating that the initial device has supported extensive data collection; and the Scout investigational device would only be supported until the end of the study, after which it would cease to function.

Products[edit]
On November 29, 2012, the company unveiled a suite of new tools to “revolutionize consumer healthcare.” The Scanadu Scout is a lightweight device that is touched to a patient’s temple and is touted as being able to return key vital sign results in less than 10 seconds. Project ScanaFlo is a urinanalysis test for conditions like preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, kidney failure and urinary tract infections. Project ScanaFlu is used when a patient is exhibiting cold-like symptoms. The saliva test checks for Strep A, Influenza A and B, adenovirus, and RSV.[5] The suite of products, originally conceived of in partnership with IDEO,[12] is being designed by award-winning industrial designer Yves Behar.[13]
Scanadu’s long-term product vision is to combine a broad array of electrical and biochemical sensors with intelligent algorithms to create a real-life Tricorder.[14] Accordingly, the company is often mentioned as a leading contender for the $10m Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize.[15] Another of Scanadu’s goals is to develop a corps of users willing to share their medical readings, such as heart rates and stress, over many years.[16] The idea is to help enable personalized medicine by generating collective information about the relationships between such readings as respiration, temperature and oxygen intake before the onset of a disease.[16]
The need for a product like the Scanadu Scout occurred to CEO Walter De Brouwer in 2003 after his five-year-old son[17] fell about 40 feet and lapsed into a coma for 11 weeks.[16] De Brouwer learned that none of his son’s various health data was being consolidated for collective analysis. “To someone from the tech world, this was like something from the dinosaur age,” he told The New York Times.[16]
Personnel[edit]
Walter De Brouwer, a co-founder, stepped down from CEO in April 2016, and Jaime Tenedorio was promoted to Chief Executive Officer.[11]
The company includes team members specializing in the fields of design, hardware, software, algorithm development, regulatory, clinical testing, manufacturing, and in-vitro diagnostics.
Funding and clinical trials[edit]
During summer 2013, Scanadu raised $1.66 million from 8,800 backers in more than 100 countries through Indiegogo.[16][18] Of those investors, more than 20 percent were U.S.-based medical professionals such as doctors and nurses.[16] Scanadu has since received an additional $10.5 million in Series A funding from Relay Ventures, Tony Hsieh's VegasTechFund, Jerry Yang's Ame Cloud Ventures, The Broe Group, Mindful Investors and Redmile Group.[4][19]
As of November 2013, Scanadu had raised $14.7 million.[9] The funding will support Scanadu’s goals of participating in clinical trials to win FDA approval and then bringing the Scanadu Scout to market.[9] Also in November 2013, Scanadu announced it had formed a Medical Advisory Board and would conduct its first clinical trials at the Scripps Translational Science Institute.[20]
In April 2015, Scanadu announced it had raised $35 million in new funding and $49.7 million in total funding so far.[21][22]
Press and accolades[edit]
Scanadu has received press attention from a number of blogs and media outlets such as The New York Times,[16] The Wall Street Journal,[23] NBC's TODAY show,[24] Popular Science,[25] The Economist,[26] Fast Company,[27] Forbes,[28] Time,[29] TechCrunch,[30] Wired,[31] and the MIT Technology Review.[32] It has also won a number of accolades including:
• CES Innovations 2014 Design and Engineering Award for Health and Fitness (honorable mention).[33]
• 2014 Everyday Health Award for Innovation in the Healthy Consumer category.[34]
• VentureBeat 26 Amazing Startups You Need to Watch in 2014.[35]
• CES Best Innovation of 2013 in Personal Electronics Category.[36]
• Company of the Year by the 14,000+ member Digital Health LinkedIn (NASDAQ: LNKD) group, beating out other notable health tech companies such as Fitbit, Withings, Qardio, AliveCor, and Proteus Digital Health, among others.[37]
• Number Two Health Story of 2012 in Fast Company[38]
• Number Ten Medtech Story of 2012 in VentureBeat.[39]
