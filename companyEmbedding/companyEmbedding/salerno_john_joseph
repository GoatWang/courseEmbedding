Anti-Aging And Longevity












What you are about to discover here are two very real strategies you can administer that can, literally, slow down the aging process of your body, cells and organs.









It’s backed by rock solid medical research, not ridiculous hearsay, and certainly not from a bunch of quacks trying to sell snake oil concoctions that just drains your savings.
Taking the – RIGHT – doctor prescribed vitamin and mineral supplements, along with eating right, are key.
After all, how can you slow down how fast your body is aging if it isn’t getting enough of the stronger, high-quality vitamins and minerals for the body to even do its job?

What Can Hormones Do For Me?




Hormone replacements
Or, we can call them “hormone enhancers,” since there are ways to help keep the hormones flowing throughout your body like they did when you were younger.
Your hormones aren’t necessarily being replaced – they are being enhanced to do its job, which is to keep you looking and feeling younger longer.
Hormones are a liquid chemical released into your blood stream that helps keep your:

Organs
Skin
Hair
Bones
Joints healthy
Living longer

But, as you may already know, overtime the hormones’ flow begins to slow down.
A very unhappy domino effect!
Now, of course we can’t stop our aging, but we now have the research-backed knowledge to slow it down.
Standing with the Salerno Center and Dr. John Salerno, here are just some of the medical research universities and institutions that have shown some very wide-eyed promising ways to live longer:

Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center
Johns Hopkins
the Mayo Clinic
Stanford University
Mount Sinai

When these health heavyweights speak, it’s time to sit up and take notice.
Let’s start here:
The – “God, I’m Getting Too Old Too Fast!” – Age And Hormones Connection
Your hormones help keep your organs healthy, like, your brain. So, when the flow of your hormones becomes slower and slower as you get older, what just might happen to the health of your brain? Dementia, maybe? Among so many other things that happen to the health of your brain.
This may or may not be a 100% medical fact, but since our hormones do indeed keep our brain, in addition to our bones, joints, organs (liver, kidney…) healthy, this connection between age and hormones is certainly worth considering!

 


Why Hormones Are Critical To Your Health





In a 60-second read, here is what hormones are, and how they can be your friend or your worst nightmare:
Hormones are a liquid chemical that are produced by glands. Much like sweat secreting from our pores, the hormones secrete from these glands.
They drip, if you will, into the bloodstream where they travel to the distant tissues and organs, where they then bind to the tissues’ and organs’ specific cell sites called receptors.
By binding to receptors, hormones send messages (commands, if you will) to your body to do certain functions, to keep itself healthy:

Stimulation or inhibition of growth
Mood swings
Cells in our skin, hair, nails, organs…
Induction or suppression of apoptosis (programmed cell death)
Activation or inhibition of the immune system
Regulation of metabolism
Preparation of the body for mating, fighting, fleeing, and other activity
Preparation of the body for a new phase of life, such as puberty, parenting, and menopause
Control of the reproductive cycle
Hunger cravings
Sexual arousal

Simply put, think of hormones as the “prime movers” of your physical and mental well-being.
Every time you:

Get angry
Become tired
Laugh
Cry
Have sex
Wake up feeling hungry
Fall asleep

your body is responding to hormones.
That’s because hormone levels can impact virtually every major system and organ in your body.
And as we get older, far lower amounts of hormones are released, and this, in turn, creates havoc in our body, along with aging our body even faster and faster.
Your hormones impact virtually every major system and organ in your body, and if that flow slows down to a trickle, well, you know the outcome.
You are seeing it now in the mirror. You are feeling it now throughout the day…
So, there is indeed a very real connection between aging and your hormones.
Studies from research universities have shown that, without a doubt,

The right foods and
Added supplements in general combined with 
Hormone replacement

is one of the greatest ways to turn back the clock.
And speaking of supplements…if you know anything about nutrition and health, you know that you have to eat a lot of food for its nutritional value to do what it is meant to do.
With that said, many of you just can’t eat that much, never mind having the money or the time to prepare such meals.

 


Anti-aging and Longevity Lifestyle Changes





Along with an appropriate diet, make sure you add an exercise program that makes sense. Healthy foods, which include low carb/sugar options, grass-fed meats, eggs, nuts, and local, sustainable organic produce are the main focus. 
If you smoke, please seek the proper assistance to stop.
Avoid stress and maintain a positive attitude outlook on life.
Not only is the quantity of sleep that you get important for longevity, but also the quality.
If you are unable to get enough sunlight during the day, consider taking a vitamin D supplement.
Green proof your household. If your home contains toxic household chemicals, soaps, detergents, hygiene products, lawn pesticides, and air freshners – toss them.
Avoid prescription drugs.


 


Why Choose Anti-Aging Supplements?




Taking a combination of a natural hormone replacement and the right kind of supplements is like a one-two punch right in the mouth of aging.
Start with these key nutrients, that IS part of the Fountain of Youth that many of you are looking for:
Chromium
Health studies have shown that chromium can keep building muscle, decrease body fat and lower cholesterol levels even in our twilight years.
The stronger your muscles (that surround your organs, and being that your heart is a muscle), the lower your body fat, the lower your cholesterol level, the odds go up that you will live longer.
Pantethine (vitamin B5)
Now here is one is a remarkable nutrient that not only helps control cholesterol, like chromium does, it also supports the adrenals and produces “friendly” bacteria in the intestine, making it a valuable tool in preventing yeast overgrowth.
Selenium
Selenium is a powerful antioxidant needed to curb your aging. Although it is essential to eat plenty of vegetables and fruits, in many parts of the world the soil is depleted of nutrients, including selenium, making supplementation of this nutrient essential.
Vanadium (vanadyl sulfate)
According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes takes between 16,000 to 18,000 lives every year. Vanadium is a trace mineral that dramatically aids diabetics by, apparently, helping cells absorb blood sugar more effectively and thereby decreasing the need for insulin.
Biotin
While vanadium does its part in the battle again diabetes, biotin joins in to help lower blood-sugar levels.
Green Tea
Green tea contains four polyphenols, including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which are powerful antioxidants known collectively as catechins, which are vital in extending your lifespan.
Whey Protein
Instead of purchasing expensive glutathione supplements to try and increase telemeres, add whey protein to your diet. Besides being a great superfood, whey is rich in sulfur amino acids. A convenient food for all cells, aminos help detox, build healthy tissue, and boost the immune system – but just make sure it is from a grass-fed cow source.
Trans-Resveratrol (Protykin)
One of the biggest keys to slowing down our aging is this active form of resveratrol polyphenols found in the skins, seeds and stems of red wine grapes. The ultra beneficial form, trans-Resveratrol, has been proven in studies by research universities to activate the SIRT1 longevity gene and enhance cellular productivity. It has been shown that trans-Resveratrol significantly modulates biomarkers of bone metabolism, inhibits pro-inflammatory enzymes such as COX-1 and COX-2, and exhibits chemopreventive agents, anticarcinogenic properties, cardioprotective effects, neuroprotective properties, and caloric restrictive behavior.
Co-Enzyme Q10
This fat-soluble antioxidant is a compound found in the mitochondria, or energy center, of every cell of the body, with the greatest concentration in the heart, which, in part, helps it to pump forcefully. As an antioxidant, Co-Q-10 also scavenges free radicals, and inhibits the formation of clots. More than a third of people with hypertension are deficient in Co-Q-10. Conversely, the antioxidant lowers blood pressure in patients with hypertension.
Omega-3 EPA + DHA
These two are essential fatty acids that enhance the quality of life and lowers the risk of premature death. They are usually lacking in the typical Western diet. There is overwhelming evidence that omega-3 fatty acids, particularly fish oils, have been consistently shown to reduce the risk of strokes and fatal and non-fatal heart attacks in at a number of ways. Fish oils help artery walls flexible, reduce the process of plaque growth, reduce triglyceride levels, prevent blood clotting, reduce blood pressure and stabilize heart rhythm. Well known for their cardiovascular benefits, fish oils are also valuable for reducing the risk of cancer.
Dr. John Salerno’s more productive and gifted common sense methods for anti-aging and longevity has been so successful for his patients, that he has been enthusiastically recommended by Suzanne Somers, the author of the #1 New York Times bestseller, Ageless, and in her 2009 follow-ups, Breakthrough and Knockout.
“I will personally send patients to Dr. Salerno!” exclaims Ms. Somers.

Anxiety Disorder












Worry, overreaction, and nervousness are all classic signs of anxiety disorder, and in order to unravel the causes for each, we must first identify and understand the meaning of each subtype.









Even though anxiety creeps up on most people at some point in their lives and is short lived, a disorder can have a crippling effect on both cognitive and emotional responses. Although unpleasant, anxiety is not the same as fear, and it is not considered a normal reaction to outside stress.

Symptoms of Anxiety





A sense of feeling powerless
Increased heart rate
Rapid breathing
Trembling
Feeling tired and fatigued
Feeling apprehensive
Sleeping problems
Excessive sweating and dizziness
Stomach cramps
Headaches
Irritability and nervousness
Intense feelings of panic



 


Anxiety Root Causes





Childhood anxiety
Life-changing events
Menopause
Illness
Daily stressors
Various medications


 


Type of Anxiety Disorders




Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) – Individuals experiencing OCD live with the constant thought of fear, which leads to repetitive, compulsive, and ritualistic behavior.
Panic disorder – Individuals with panic disorder are struck by intense fear suddenly, immediately, and with little or no warning.  During an attack, individuals experience heart palpitations, dizziness, chest pain, choking sensations, abdominal distress, and the sense that they are going crazy.
Phobias–  When a person encounters a known phobia, which can be social or specific, they experience ultimate fear. With social phobia, the person finds themselves in an overwhelming state embarrassment, humiliation, and scrutiny, which results in the avoidance of people, places, and situations. Even though the situation, object, and involvement pose very little risk, the reaction is always extreme.
Generalized anxiety disorder – People who have generalized anxiety disorder experience worrisome thoughts and unrealistic tension. Almost always considering the worst possible outcome, the disorder can manifest into physical setbacks, including trembling, fatigue, headache, and muscle tension.
Post-traumatic stress disorder- This condition, which occurs from a traumatic personal experience, such as rape, unexpected death, war, natural disaster, assault, or abuse, may all result in constant nightmares, depression, flashbacks, bouts of anger, and emotional numbness.


 


Anxiety Diet and Lifestyle Changes





Eliminate sugars, starchy foods, and carbs. Insulin imbalances cause abnormal amounts of hormone levels to be released.
Don’t skip meals.
Focus on regular, balanced sleep.
Deep breathing, guided meditation, and yoga are all helpful ways of relaxing.
If to much caffeine consumption is an issue, try switching to green tea – which contains powerful, natural antioxidants.
Exercise is an excellent anxiety remedy

Supplement Therapy












Supplement therapy uses vitamins, minerals, amino acids, fibers, herbs, antioxidants, fatty acids, and enzymes, to maintain, and restore various deficiencies.

 







 


Along with establishing a measure of quality, most supplements are generally offered in capsule, tablet, powder, liquid, chewable, and pastille formats for quick, easy, and effective dosing.
Each day your body draws upon nutrient reserves to heal itself, transmit brain signals, produce hormones, and rebuild important tissue systems. Besides the foods that you consume on a daily basis, supplement therapy can provide your body with the crucial elements it needs to help it stay strong, healthy, and optimally fit.

Environmental toxins (pollution, irritants, cleaning products)
Laxative Use
Use of antibiotics, oral contraceptives, and various medications
Empty calorie diets
Stress
Eating a restricted diet (allergies, vegetarian, religion)


 


Supplemental Therapy Testing Techniques




In addition to taking supplements, there are various blood tests that can provide accurate, detailed, and organized information indicating the presence of a deficiency.  And because each nutrient level is individually highlighted, supplemental therapy leaves no stone uncovered. Despite the fact that vitamins play a backseat to popular medications, the formulas carry few side-effects, are affordable, and most importantly – offer lasting results.

 


Supplemental Therapy Diet & Lifestyle Changes





Eat organic, unrefined, low sugar foods as much as possible.
Avoid all foods that are processed, and try to eliminate or reduce consumption of grains products.
Drink at least 64 oz. of clean water a day. To maintain good health, make sure it is fresh from all impurities. In addition, try squeezing a lemon for digestion, flavor, and alkalizing purposes.
If you are trying to absorb more from your supplement formulations, try increasing your consumption of high quality organic sources of saturated fats such as butter, coconut oil, eggs, and animal proteins. In addition to vitamins being water soluble, their is a whole class of nutrients that are only absorbed in the presence of fat.
Even though it is best to get all your vitamins from whole foods, a good multi-vitamin can prevent deficiencies, boost immune system, and lend energy.
Before you go out purchasing various supplements, make sure you avoid synthetic nutrients, binders, glazings, and unnecessary flowing agents (magnesium stearate, titanium dioxide, flavorings).
Besides quality, try to consider the potential for allergies, proper nutrient balance, vegetarian ingredients, absorbability, and long-term safety.
Check to see if the vitamin meets GMP approval (good manufacturing process standards) and ISO 9001 certification.
If the vitamin in conversation contains minerals, make sure they are chelated.

About Us












Because of the nature of your body’s related systems, illness is a dysfunction of the whole-person. Dr. Salerno’s primary goal is to help you balance the physical, mental, emotional, and lifestyle factors that define healthy living.











Our Philosophy




Dr. Salerno’s approach to healing does more than improve how you’ll generally look and feel, it will help you regain the confidence and desire to achieve your health goals. The personalized health programs work by correcting imbalances. Each visit incorporates new and exciting foods, therapies, and natural supplements.

 


Why The Salerno Center?




Our goal is to provide you and your family with the highest level of care possible. Through the unique combination of science and preventative techniques, The Salerno Center for Complementary Medicine has forged a “new” way of healing. Our therapies are individualized, because The Salerno Center for Complementary Medicine is for and about you.
Our goal is to help you become a “wellness ambassador,” a walking, talking testament to better health. As opposed to other so-called experts in the field, Dr. Salerno will actually give you the tools and conventional wisdom to achieve optimum health.
Every patient’s case is unique. Dr. Salerno’s approach is to treat the patient, not the disease.
