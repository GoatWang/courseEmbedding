Strong Company With A 9.48% Dividend Yield But Still Overvalued - MFA Financial, Inc. (NYSE:MFA) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Strong Company With A 9.48% Dividend Yield But Still OvervaluedJul.14.17 | About: MFA Financial, (MFA) Colorado Wealth Management Fund REITs, micro-cap, small-cap, debtMarketplaceThe Mortgage REIT ForumSummaryMFA Financial has less exposure to prepayments rates compared to the vast majority of mortgage REITs.MFA has a solid dividend history compared to others in the sector.Investors in MFA Financial tend to sell at a large discount to book if there is any fear of a recession.Fear can lead to a major price drop and create a good buying opportunity. Today prices and confidence are simply too high.This company knows how to sustain a dividend. 

 MFA Financial (MFA) is one of the stronger mortgage REITs. It is also one of the most expensive mortgage REITs. Investors are having to pay a substantial premium for quality. The company has a great management team and operating expenses are very reasonable. Investors trying to understand MFA Financial will need to know more about their portfolio strategy. Portfolio strategy In my last article on MFA, I discussed their very heavy allocation to non-agency RMBS. In this article I want to break down how their asset classes work together to stabilize net interest income. Prepayment rates MFA Financial has materially less exposure to prepayment rates than the vast majority of mortgage REITs. For instance, Annaly Capital Management (NLY) has seen premium amortization adjustments impacting net interest income by over 20 cents per shares in the last two quarters. When their core EPS is running around 30 cents a difference of 20 cents is quite material. Capstead Mortgage Corporation (CMO) runs a portfolio of adjustable rate MBS. CMO trimmed their dividend a few times over the last few years. Despite being a very solid mortgage REIT, CMO is exposed to dramatic pressure on their net interest spread due to the rapid amortization of premiums. When MBS are purchased at a premium to face value, the premium must be amortized over the life of the loan. MFA Financial purchased a substantial amount of their portfolio at a large discount to face value. As the principal payments come in, MFA Financial is able to “accrete” the discount.
 

 What is accretion? Accretion is the opposite of amortization. While the agency RMBS must have their premium amortized and see reduced yields because of the amortization, the accretion of discounts on non-agency RMBS drives the yield on the securities higher. For example if a loan for $100 is purchased for $70, the discount will be accreted over the life of the loan. Loan par value: $100 Loan cost: $70 Length of time: 10 years Accretion amount: $30 Accretion time period: 10 years In this hypothetical example the accretion would add roughly $3 per year to the interest income. However, this relies on the investor being convinced that they will in fact receive every payment that is contractually due. In practice, the mortgage REIT knows that they will not receive every single dollar that is due. Therefore, they will accrete the difference at a slower rate to reflect probably that some of the loans are not repaid in full. Prepayments Let’s take a look at how MFA Financial demonstrates their exposure to prepayments: 

 Over the last several years, MFA Financial has seen the benefit from discount accretion exceed the cost of premium amortization. This is a very useful hedge against prepayments. Because MFA Financial invested so heavily in non-agency RMBS, they have a substantial amount of discounts to accrete over the years. When a home owner refinances their home or sells the property and pays of the existing mortgage, a prepayment is created. If the mortgage REIT had purchased the debt for 104% of the face value, they would lose that premium. However, if the mortgage REIT had bought the loan for $0.60-$0.80 on the dollar, they would be reporting a significant gain.
 Because MFA Financial is accreting the discounts on these loans, they have been able to benefit from high levels of prepayments. This is a real cash benefit to the mortgage REIT. If you buy a debt for $0.70 and the person owing the debt pays you $1, you have a real and immediate cash gain. Dividend stability The last time MFA Financial had to trim their dividend was the 4 th quarter of 2013. This is exceptionally solid history for mortgage REIT investing in residential mortgages over the last several years. One of the largest challenges for the residential mortgage REITs has been the exceptionally high level of prepayments. Conclusion MFA Financial has an excellent strategy for dealing with prepayment risk. By investing heavily in legacy non-agency MBS, the company was able to acquire loans at a substantial discount to face value. When prepayments are elevated the company is naturally hedged because a huge portion of their portfolio was purchased at less than face value. The result has been exceptional dividend stability during a period that hammered away at most residential mortgage REITs. The price to trailing book value ratio of 1.09 to 1.1 is the largest impediment to making investments in the company. Because MFA Financial takes on so much credit risk, investors tend to panic and sell the shares at a huge discount to book value if they believe a recession may be coming in the near future. That problem is compounded by lower values on the portfolio. Therefore, MFA Financial can lose book value and can lose their premium to book value at the same time leading to occasional but rapid declines in share price. Those are the opportunities we are seeking. Paying significantly over book value is not the kind of opportunity we want. I strongly favor choosing defensive investments with strong and stable dividend yields. To find those yields, I often look to mortgage REITs, equity REITs, preferred shares, and baby bonds. In this space I can regularly target stable dividend yields over 7%. Many have the opportunity for capital appreciation as well.

Ex-Dividend Reminder: Deutsche Bank Contingent Capital, Covanta Holding and MFA Financial

Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel  , on 6/27/17, Deutsche Bank Contingent Capital (Symbol: DKT), Covanta Holding Corp (Symbol: CVA), and MFA Financial, Inc. (Symbol: MFA) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. Deutsche Bank Contingent Capital will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.5031 on 6/30/17, Covanta Holding Corp will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.25 on 7/7/17, and MFA Financial, Inc. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.20 on 7/28/17. As a percentage of DKT's recent stock price of $27.10, this dividend works out to approximately 1.86%, so look for shares of Deutsche Bank Contingent Capital to trade 1.86% lower - all else being equal - when DKT shares open for trading on 6/27/17. Similarly, investors should look for CVA to open 1.81% lower in price and for MFA to open 2.35% lower, all else being equal.    Below are dividend history charts for DKT, CVA, and MFA, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared.   Deutsche Bank Contingent Capital (Symbol: DKT)  :       Covanta Holding Corp (Symbol: CVA)  :         MFA Financial, Inc. (Symbol: MFA)  :          In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 7.43% for Deutsche Bank Contingent Capital, 7.22% for Covanta Holding Corp, and 9.38% for MFA Financial, Inc..    In Friday trading, Deutsche Bank Contingent Capital shares are currently up about 0.2%, Covanta Holding Corp shares are trading flat, and MFA Financial, Inc. shares are up about 0.1% on the day.

We are a self-advised real estate investment trust (REIT) primarily engaged in the business of investing, on a leveraged basis, in residential mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders resulting from the difference between the interest and other income we earn on our investments and the interest expense we pay on the borrowings that we use to finance our leveraged investments and our operating costs. We were incorporated in Maryland on July 24, 1997, began operations on April 10, 1998 and have elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. One of the requirements of maintaining our qualification as a REIT is that we must distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders. Our common stock and preferred stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbols "MFA" and "MFA-A," respectively. Our senior notes due 2042 are listed on the NYSE under the symbol "MFO."
Investment Strategy
We invest in residential MBS that are issued or guaranteed as to principal and/or interest by a federally chartered corporation or agency of the U.S. government (e.g., Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae), which we refer to as Agency MBS, and residential MBS that are not guaranteed by any U.S. government agency or any federally-chartered corporation, which we refer to as Non-Agency MBS.  Our MBS are primarily secured by pools of hybrid and adjustable-rate mortgage loans (ARMs) on single family residences.
The mortgages collateralizing our MBS portfolio are predominantly Hybrids, ARMs and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages.  The Hybrids collateralizing our MBS typically have initial fixed-rate periods generally ranging from three to ten years.  Interest rates on the mortgage loans collateralizing our ARM-MBS reset based on specific index rates, generally London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) 
or the one-year constant maturity treasury (CMT) rate.  The mortgages collateralizing our ARM-MBS typically have interim and lifetime caps on interest rate adjustments.  
Because the coupons earned on hybrid and adjustable-rate MBS adjust over time as interest rates change (typically after a fixed-rate period), the market values of these assets are generally less sensitive to changes in interest rates than are fixed-rate MBS.  In order to mitigate our interest rate risks, our strategy is to maintain a majority of our portfolio in ARM-MBS.  
While the majority of our portfolio holdings remain in Agency MBS, as part of our investment strategy a significant portion of our portfolio is invested in Non-Agency MBS.  By blending Non-Agency MBS with Agency MBS, we seek to generate attractive returns with less sensitivity to changes in the yield curve, interest rate cycles and prepayments.  
Our financing strategy is designed to increase the size of 
our MBS portfolio by borrowing against a substantial portion of the market value 
of the MBS in our portfolio. We primarily use repurchase agreements to finance 
the acquisition of our Agency MBS and repurchase agreements and securitized debt 
to finance the acquisition of our Non-Agency MBS. We enter into interest rate 
swap agreements and interest rate swaptions, to hedge the interest rate risk associated with a portion of our repurchase agreement borrowings and securitized debt.  In addition to repurchase agreements and securitized debt, we may also use other sources of funding in the future to finance our MBS portfolio, including, but not limited to, other types of collateralized borrowings, loan agreements, lines of credit, commercial paper or the issuance of debt securities.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
