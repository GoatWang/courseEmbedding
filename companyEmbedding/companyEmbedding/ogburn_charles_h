    Charles Ogburn | Crawford & Company | ZoomInfo.com   Sociology and Scientism: William F. Ogburn        Sociology and Scientism: The case of William F. Ogburn Robert C.Bannister Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American SociologicalSociety, 1988. In his presidential address to the American Sociological Societyin December 1929, William Fielding Ogburn told colleagues thatsociology was "not interested" in improving the world. "Science isinterested directly in one thing only, to wit, discovering newknowledge." This goal required a "wholly colorless literary style"and a rigorous method, preferably statistical. The truly scientificsociologist, a service intellectual rather than a policy maker, wouldnot pretend to "guide the course of evolution," but rather wouldgenerate the "information necessary for such supreme direction tosome sterling executive who will appear to do the actual guiding".Statistical and advisory, a truly scientific sociology would also benominalist in its basic assumptions. Since society was simply a termfor the collective responses of the individuals who comprised it,sociology should confine itself to the measurement and tabulation ofenvironmental change and responses to it. [1] Ogburn by this time was a leading proponent of a movement withinAmerican social science that had been building for more than adecade, alternately termed "neo-positivism," "objectivism," or, morepejoratively, "scientism." At its core, the objectivists held, notonly that science can provide mankind with an all-embracingphilosophy of life and the solution to all problems, but that thetechniques used in the physical sciences can be used to solve anyproblem. Accordingly, those disciplines that do not use the sameresearch techniques as the physical sciences are not reallyscientific. The sociologists' definition of "science" was not, ofcourse, necessarily that which scientists themselves followed intheir work, but rather that which Ogburn and others believed thatthey employed.[2] But in theenthusiasm of the moment, the finer points tended to get lost. A scientific sociology , as thus defined, was to be "objective" inthree quite special senses. First, it must confine itself tothe observable externals of human behavior. This goal meant an end tothe cataloguing of "feelings," "interests," or "wishes," a principalactivity of pre-war sociologists.[3] Secondly, sociologists must apply rigorous methods in theproduction of social scientific knowledge. [4] Finally, sociologists should observe strict neutrality inmatters of ethics and public policy. From these premises certain predilections followed naturally, ifnot inevitably, specifically, a focus on individual behavior ratherthan on the formation and transformation of social structures; anemphasis on an inductive and incremental model of science; and, inthe long run, a bureaucratic vision of team research and socialscience institutes.[5] Inpractice, objectivism translated into programs that ranged fromeducational testing to marriage counselling. Politically, it fueleddemands for increasing "social control." Since objectivity in one form or other had been a professionalnorm since the earliest days of sociology, these maxims and theassumptions behind them were not entirely new. What distinguishedOgburn and his disciples was the extreme to which they took them,and, in particular, the extreme to which they took the premise thathuman volition and the subjective consciousness have no place insocial science. Underlying earlier studies of "interests" (Small),"likemindedness" (Giddings), and even "instincts" lay the assumptionthat a connection existed between human feelings and values and theexisting social order. For the earlier functionalists, socialinstitutions arose to satisfy needs in ways compatible with the wellbeing of individuals and group survival. Scientism, incontrast, repudiated not only the inner self, but all customary waysof doing and feeling. Objectivity lay, not simply in the lack ofbias, but in the elimination of the psychological dimensions ofexperience, and finally of the willing, feeling self.[6] Ogburn's prominence within the profession gave his pronouncementsspecial weight.[7] Born andeducated in the South, he had done his graduate work under FranklinGiddings at Columbia, and in 1911 earned his Ph.D. for a statisticalstudy of child labor legislation. In Social Change (1922), heintroduced the phrase "cultural lag. " During the 1920s, herepresented sociology at the Social Science Research Council. In 1927he joined the faculty at the University of Chicago, later chairingthe sociology department during a period it which it produced morethan a hundred Ph.D.s, including some of the leading quantifiers ofthe next generation. Ogburn's pioneering study of the 1928 electionearned him a minor footnote in histories of quantitative socialscience.[8] From 1920 to 1926 heserved as editor of the Journal of the American StatisticalAssociation, and in 1931 was elected president of theAssociation. As research director of President Herbert Hoover'sCommittee on Social Trends, he played a pivotal role in producing thepathbreaking Recent Social Trends (1931). During thedepression years, he served on several New Deal agencies. After WorldWar II, he became one of the nation's best known analysts of theimpact of technology on society. Although he shunned controversy, Ogburn was and remains acontroversial figure. During the thirties, humanists, pictured him asan uncritical apologist for technology, [9]while fellow sociologists, usually to the left, questioned theanalytic utility and value neutrality of the "cultural lag" concept.[10] During the 1960s, New Leftcritics pictured him him as the archetypal "corporate liberal" and achief architect, in one version, of the stripped-down, companionatefamily that promised, but did not finally provide, a haven from aheartless capitalism . [11] Atbest, Ogburn seemed to one latter-day quantifier to have been a"transitional" figure in the discipline's move from a "biological" toa more genuinely cultural analysis; from general theory toquantitative research; and from "social evolutionism" to anon-teleological positivism.[12] Differences over Ogburn's reputation, in turn, reflect moregeneral questions concerning the rise of sociological objectivism.The objectivists themselves, in the tradition of positivism sinceComte, argued that the "logic" of science led inexorably frommetaphysics to quantification, the image of a "transitional" Ogburnbeing an attenuated version of this position. More recently,historians of sociology have stressed the impersonal processes of theprofessionalization and bureaucratization of knowledge, or the riseof "corporatism" as chief factors. Although not rejecting these laterexplanations, this study of Ogburn's career attempts to place themagainst a broader background of social/psychological, religious , andintellectual factors that shaped the vision of key representatives ofsociology's "second" generation who earned their doctorates on theeve of World War I. 2. Socially, objectivism was nourished by the fluidity and resultingabsence of tradition and custom that characterized late 19th centuryAmerican life, as the rise of a national economy and transportationnetwork shattered what remained of provincial culture, socialdeference, and traditional values. Analysis of this situation interms of "nostalgia" or loss of status (as Richard Hofstadtersuggested a generation ago[13])ignores the more basic lack of institutional density that in stablesocieties defines roles, mediates meanings, and induces thecomfortable feeling that shared values are a natural and enduringaspect of the human condition. For founders like Small and Giddings,as for most of their middleclass contemporaries, socially secure andrelatively comfortable upbringings muted the stark opposition of selfand society, individual and nature. Significantly, the prewarsociologists who anticipated objectivism were also the most rootless:from Sumner, Ross, and Veblen in sociology to J.B. Watson inpsychology. Ogburn nicely fits the bill. Born and raised in a small Georgiatown, he revered a past he never quite understood. His family on bothsides traced its American ancestry to 17th century Virginia, a pointof special pride to his mother. Both his parents remained close tobrothers and sisters throughout their lives. Yet to Ogburn theirsseemed another world. "They lived in a face to face community," hewrote, using the phrase Charles H. Cooley had coined. "I have knownthe point intellectually, but I never quite got the feel of it. It isstill something of a mystery."[14] Ogburn's lineage alternately fascinated and embarrassed him. Whenat the faculty table at the University of Chicago someone casuallyasked him if a Miss Jane Ogburn were his sister, he answered,somewhat to his own surprise: "No, my original ancestor came over in1658 [sic] and her original ancestor did not get here until1684." Repeating the incident to Read Bain, he confided: "There weretwo or three men around the table whose fathers were born in Europe,and it did not take long for someone to crack down upon me with aremark about my blue blood, which increased my confusion." One daytoward the end of his life, he spent an afternoon tracing thegenealogy of one of his forebears, only to recognize the absurdity ofthe enterprise. Had not "modern studies" shown that one's personalitywas the product of the "social environment," he wondered? Had not thesame studies "taken all--or nearly all meaning--from a study ofancestry?" [15] Ogburn's own youth marked a sharp break from this family past.After his father died while he was quite young, his mother took inborders to make ends meet. "As a boy I carried a good deal ofresponsibility [and had] little money which I had to stretchfor the family," he recalled. Under these circumstances, family pridebecame extreme sensitivity to reputation, and a compulsion toconform. On the streets of small-town Georgia, gossip was a deadlyweapon, and a good name "the most valued of possessions."[16] In later years, Ogburn's concern for normality and his distrust ofeccentricity amounted to an obsession. "The truth is I love (I think)to be ordinary, to be like my fellow man, not to be an extremedeviate," he once wrote in his private journal. This view shaped hisattitudes toward matters great and small. Of success in one's career,he commented: ...all 'big shots' do things appropriately. But a sense ofappropriateness is a distinct asset....I have known a few people whomight have been 'big shots' if they had not been awkward, inept, andgiven to saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. After an evening in the company of Edward Ross and his new wife,he commented: "Nothing queer or eccentric about either." And of aChristmas card from a friend: "less eccentric than any they havesent." In a self-critical mood, he speculated that this same attitudeprobably explained his penchant for research that earned prestigerather than money, when more profitable opportunities beckoned. "Thebig idea is that we do the things that are highly socially valued.And research is the goal we must all strive for".[17] Like other objectivists Ogburn translated this concern forreputation into the view that human behavior was a "response tostimulus," rather than the organization of habits around apreexisting or socially-created self. "All members of the humanspecies do not respond exactly to the same material stimulus," henoted. But all actions are nonetheless "responses to stimuli." Sopersuaded, he sometimes spoke of himself and his professionalactivities as objects over which he had little control. Despitesometimes frenetic professional activity, he frequently commented onhis lack of "ambition." Rather, he was "driven on by a sense of duty,or in response to the general idea, inculcated in youth, to do theimmediate job ahead, rather well....But no great ego, no great desireto leave my mark on the world".[18] In later years, Ogburn likewise ascribed his success tocircumstance rather than to effort or ambition, despite the fact thatboth were considerable. Although he owed his appointment at Columbiain 1922 in part to the efforts of Elizabeth B.F. Baker, an economistwho joined the Bernard department the same year, he attributed it tothe impersonal working of "social forces" whose time had come. "Thefact that I was offered a professorship at Yale on the same day thatI received the offer from Columbia should be considered evidence onthis point."[19] Similarly, hecredited his position on the S.S.R.C. and other professional bodiesless to his own efforts than to the good fortune of being in the"right group" at the right time. ("In their passion for democracy,for egalitarianism, and for race equality," sociologists too oftenoverlook the fortuitous, he once commented).[20] As a southerner, when such things mattered even more than today,Ogburn also inherited other traditions that seemed somehow archaic inthe New Era of the 1920s--"regarding women, chivalry, honor, money,courage, etc." Like many of his generation, he absorbed these virtuesfrom reading the Victorians--Thackeray, Dickens, and especially SirWalter Scott. "One ideal I recall was that it was not good for astrong man to talk much," he added. "A brave, courageous man was aman of few words. Too much talk was feminine. To be garrulous was tobe a sissy." Remembering this wisdom, Ogburn years later urgedfellow-sociologists to cultivate a no-frills literary style and toeschew the conventional graces.[21] For the rest of his years, Ogburn's life was a battle betweenillusion and reality, youthful ideals and a world that that seemed torender them meaningless. Nowhere was this more pronounced than in hisview of women. As a southerner, he got a double dose of the Victoriancult of true womanhood. "I started off in my youth with a strongsense of chivalry," he remembered. "I never had any sisters and Ireverenced my mother." Converted to feminism, he supported totalsexual equality, but premised on the belief that women were"unselfish angels." Reality eventually checked this fantasy. Manymodern women were "narcissistic, self-centered--interested only inthemselves," he decided. Although they demanded equality, most womenwanted men "to dominate them, to take responsibility, even to bullythem." The result of this realization was a frank lament: "Here Ihave been treating them as superior beings who want freedom andrights! But so many of them do not." In face of the erosion oftraditional sex roles, "facts" were sternly masculine, and"speculation" a dangerous feminine allurement.[22] During the progressive era, Ogburn, in his way, became somethingof a rebel. Leaving home in 1901, he studied at nearby Mercer College, where he developed a fascination for "wilderness"--whether embodiedin wild animals, primitive men, or even the wanderings of gypsies andhoboes. As with several other leading objectivists, although withless scandalous effect, his rebellion focused on "restrictions onsex." As he later recalled : "Freedom of speech or thought neverbothered me. I think I rebelled against sham, against pretense,against conventional morality." Yet wilderness, and the freedom itpromised, was as frightening as it was fascinating. He finallydecided that it was not the "wilderness of sex" he wanted, but a"better code." A trip to Paris in 1906, Ogburn's first outside Georgia, broughthim face to face with the perils of liberation. "I was young, naive,modest, not self-assertive, well-mannered and reasonably normal," herecalled. I met many queer characters who were egotistical, self-centered orloved power who bullied me with their views, the like of which I hadnever heard, because I was a listener, not self-assertive and hadgood manners...There were Russians, poets, artists, Jews, anarchists,socialists, social workers, English, French, etc. But nearly allqueer. During his stay he was drawn irresistibly to art, and spent thirtysuccessive days in the Louvre. But the beauty there also frightenedhim. "It was an unreal, a dream world, the world of beautifulpictures," he later wrote. "Afterward when I began my long fight forreality, I was always a bit afraid to visit the Louvre again, afraidthat I might become intoxicated, and take a long flight from realityagain."[23] Whether this reference was to a real or metaphoric breakdown,Ogburn gradually began to structure a rigid separation between hispublic and private self. For the sociologist, exact measurement wasan antidote to illusion, statistics the basis of a "better code."Professionalism provided rules for the office, but not for the home."Very definitely, I would like to confine my peculiarities which aredue to my occupation, to my hours of duty on the job," he resolvedupon his retirement. Like many Americans in the twenties, the privateOgburn developed a passion for sports. He loved boxing and baseball,and had a passion for tennis, which he played regularly until hisdeath. However, he never let himself go completely. Although he lovedsporting events, he once commented, "I hardly ever go. I have thetechnique of denial down pretty well."[24] Although coming from different regions and social class, otherleading objectivists experienced a similar disjuncture between pastand present, self and the world. As a group, their backgrounds weresignificantly different from the comfortable middle class ones ofmost eastern and midwestern progressive reformers half a generationor more older: F. Stuart Chapin, the descendent of many generationsof New York patricians whose fortunes were temporarily in decline;Luther L. Bernard, the son of a neer-do-well West Texas farmer; ReadBain, born in backwoods Oregon, raised by a divorced mother and herparamour, then "psychologically adopted (as he later put it) by anolder woman following his own mother's premature death; and GeorgeLundberg, born in rural South Dakota of a Swedish immigrant women whowas herself an orphan. Whereas the celebration of "community" and"social cohesion"--the language of Charles Horton Cooley andlikeminded progressives--incorporated a nostalgic longing for a pastsocial order, the objectivists language of efficiency and socialengineering judged the past to be irredeemably irrelevant. [25] 3. Objectivism was also a chapter in the transformation of AmericanProtestantism, although in ways different than in most account of theclerical connections of many early American sociologists. Viewedsuperficially, objectivism would appear to be resolutely irreligious.Most objectivists were distinguished by their rejection of and/orindifference toward the religion of their youth. From Giddingsonward, battles over scientific sociology pitted individuals who inone fashion or other had rejected their childhood religion againstthose who remained faithful to it. Yet in more important respects, objectivism owed a great deal toreligion, and more specifically, to the Calvinist strain withinAmerican Protestantism. On the most obvious level, its vision of an"efficient" social order contained more than a little missionaryzeal, while its celebration of "hard facts" and the "rigors" ofresearch brought the Protestant Ethic into the era of modernprofessionalism. At a deeper level, the objectivist program, with itsbehaviorist assumptions, marked both a rejection of Christianconception ("soul" being translated to "self, "conscience" toconsciousness")  and a restatement of the Calvinist impulse tocontrol. For provincials raised on the pieties of 19th centuryCalvinism, New York and Chicago about 1910 were scary places,rendering "consciousness" not less than "conscience" a problem. Byexplaining human activity in terms of stimulus and response,objectivism subtly relieved urban newcomers of moral responsibility.At the same time, the reification of behavior (whether one's own orof others) allowed objectivists to control an otherwise threateningsituation. Thus, in a sense, they enjoyed the special pleasure ofplaying God while denying His existence.[26] Finally, and more speculatively, Calvinism (as opposed to othertraditions of natural theology or rational religion) disposed itspractitioners to accept the idea that there was an order in theuniverse despite the fact that its "causes" good not be immediatelyknown.So disposed, Ogburn and other leading objectivists (notablyGiddings and Chapin) were more inclined to take Darwinianselectionism more seriously than, for example, did Small or Sumner.From it they proceed to a nominalist and statistical conception ofnatural and social law, the fundamental premise of theirobjectivism.[27] Since Ogburn was virtually silent concerning his religiousbackground, and spoke of religion less frequently than mostobjectivists, evidence for this interpretation is admittedly indirectin his case: his Georgia background and early training at the BaptistMercer College; the missionary zeal he brought to the cause and hisdogged sense of duty and determined self-denial; his tendency tospeak of his professional self as a product of circumstance ratherthan of volition, while privately he sought emotional outlets inexotic travel, and even fiction writing under a nom de plume.To these things one should add his steady intellectual developmentfrom the social selectionism of his doctoral thesis to his emphasison statistics, a subject too complex to be discussed here.[28]In a general way, Ogburn himself in his later years confessed that hewas not as far removed from religion as he had imagined. "My worshipof statistics has a somewhat religious nature, " he noted in hisjournal at a time when his enthusiasm was fading. Statistics had beenhis God. "But God only meets an emotional need which has little to dowith reason."[29]   4. Objectivism, thirdly, was a by-product of the professionalizationof scholarship, although not the only or the inevitable one. Amongthe many impulses that shaped 19th century professionalism, aprominent one, as Burton Bledstein has argued, was the desire toconsolidate and control. From their fascination with "words" (thejargon of the different specialities) to their claims of autonomy,"professionals embodied the Victorian effort "to set apart, regulate,and contain" the different elements of an increasingly chaoticexperience, and to transcend the partisan strife that threatened todestroy society and to undermine the recently-won power of the WASPmiddle class. Offering more than psychic comfort (although this too),the all-embracing standard of science, in Bledstein's words,"provided the raison d'etre of the middle class...and justified itsstandard of living."[30] Viewed in this light, Ogburn's objectivism appears, in one sense,to have been an extreme of professionalism, indeed almost acaricature of its open-ended demand for work, organized proceduresfor obtaining credentials, and claim of disinterested service. Butthe objectivists sharp distinction between public and private, andthe fact that the objectivists in their private lives were less thanthe model of professional rationality, suggest that this regimenexacted its own price. At its most benign, the professionals'bifurcation of self into public and private, scientist and citizenled to escapes in poetry, painting, sports, or travel. At its worst,the jargon of objectivity and disinterested activity masked chaoticinner lives that led Ogburn at one point to psychoanalysis andanother prominent objectivist to compulsive philandering. For the"profession" as a whole, the pretense of superior rationality, asRead Bain finally observed, did not rule out often vicious squabblingand backbiting. The institutionalization and specialization of scholarship, firstwithin the university and later within foundation-sponsoredinstitutes, also played a part. Within the universities, severalfactors together narrowed the scope of the discipline, including theneed to defend and define the newcomer against the other socialsciences (a circumstance that differed from one university toanother); the need to devise easily reproducible "methods" for thetraining of graduate students, as early evident in the case ofGiddings; and perhaps even the practical realization that grandtheory on the style of Spencer or Ward assumed more knowledge thatthe average undergraduate commanded in the age of free electives. In choosing Columbia for graduate work, Ogburn found himself in anenvironment where these narrowing tendencies were well advanced. Ahighly-professionalized faculty, and an interest in statisticsantedated the establishment of sociology in the early 1890s. Ogburn'smentor Giddings in his Inductive Sociology (1901) produced oneof the earliest research manuals for graduate students. In the decadebefore the war, Giddings imposed rigid research models on hisdoctoral students, first in a series of community studies, and laterin quantitative studies of social issues, of which Ogburn's thesiswas a prime example. Progressivism and then war offered Ogburn and other members oftheir still-fragile discipline both incentive and opportunity toprove their professionalism and public worth, again as illustratedparticularly in Ogburn's case.[31]Teaching at Reed and the University of Washington during the waryears, Ogburn honed his statistical skills in various studies ofpublic affairs. The existence of such new procedures as theinitiative and referendum, whatever the outcome of the elections,provided a chance to gather data on an unprecedented scale. For onestudy, Ogburn generated statistics on voting in more than twentycounties on one hundred and three issues over a four-year period. In1919, he spent a year working for the Cost of Living Section of theNational War Labor Board and the Bureau of Statistics travelling upand down the West Coast surveying industry, labor, and socialconditions. "The usefulness of statistics," he later noted withcharacteristic understatement, "was very apparent during the war."[32] During the 1920s, Ogburn's association with the Social ScienceResearch Council helped refine his nominalist conception of thediscipline. Established in 1923, the S.S.R.C. had two basicobjectives: to foster empirical, inductive "scientific" researchand to break down the barriers that divided the disciplines.In theory, the two might appear contradictory: the first looking tonarrow and more specialized studies, the second premised on the idealof the unity of knowledge. In practice, however, the two converged ina nominalist definition of science: the unity of the social scienceslay in their "methods" rather than their material. There wasintegration, one political scientist explained, but it was an"integration along new scientific and methodological lines."[33] In the S.S.R.C., thismaxim was effectively institutionalized. The emergence of objectivism, however, also underlines the dangerof a too-exclusive emphasis on theprofessionalization-institutionalization model, particularly inunilinear versions that typically overestimate the strength andsuccess of the process.[34]Forthe 1880s, evidence of this weakness may be seen in the dream ofeconomists and others of professional associations modeled on theGerman Verein fur Sozialpolitik, which would oppose strictdefinitions of science on their disciplines. In the case ofeconomics, and in such departments as Small's at John's Hopkins, thedream quickly gave way to decentralized and diverse organization.Future sociologists coexisted with historians, and remained yoked toeconomists, however uneasily, for almost two decades. As a result,sociology remained imperfectly professionalized through the interwarperiod: uncertain of its boundaries, sensitive to attack, and atempting target for any group that wished to promote a newparadigm. Objectivism, rather than being the end product of a unilinearprofessionalization, was a symptom of this volubility. Americansociology began as a discipline with no agreed-upon theory orcoherent research area; it never dropped the appeal to utility; andit altered its initial boundaries in dramatic ways, first in thetriumph of the "group" concept in the 1910s, later with theascendency of structural-functionalism in the 1950s, and finally withthe near-anarchy that has obtained since the 1960s. Ogburn's bid toredefine the discipline in the 1929 presidential address to theA.S.S. was one of many that had wracked the discipline since itsfounding. In the end, the attempt to impose restrictive definitionsof sociology within the A.S.S during the 1930s finally came upagainst the same centripetal forces that earlier kept Americanscholarship from developing along European lines. 5. Political disillusion and alienation completed Ogburn's conversionto the service-intellectual conception of social science. Although inhis youth he resisted the pat formulations of self-proclaimedreformers, he became something of a radical during his West Coastdays--celebrating the "Oregon system" of direct democracy, and evenshowing enthusiasm for the Wobblies. In his classroom he preached theeconomic interpretation of history, then as now a standard item inthe arsenal of the left. [35]. During the war years, however, the several components of thiswould-be radicalism gradually dissolved. The first tests of theinitiative and referendum in Oregon yielded prohibition andanti-immigration laws, both signs of reaction, and hence a blow tohis faith in direct democracy. A study of the opinions of differentsocial classes on public issues convinced him that Wobbly predictionsof imminent class warfare were unfounded. Wartime passions andpropaganda then destroyed what remained of his belief in humanrationality, the premise of his economic interpretation of history.[36] This disillusion, in turn, set the stage for Social Change(1922), his best-known book. Ogburn's starting point was the apparentcontradiction between the model of human rationality implicit in theeconomic interpretation  and mounting evidence ofirrationality. Following Freud, he initially decided that economicmotives, like sexual impulses, were hidden or disguised, an examplebeing the wartime use of the I.W.W. as a scapegoat. But, as hethought about it, he decided that the time factor was more importantthan the disguise factor. That is, the conflict between economicinterests  and announced motives was not the product ofself-deception based on unconscious drives, but of different rate ofchange among the several elements that made up "culture." Hence, thewidespread view that "women's place is in the home" was not anunconscious rationalization of (disguised) male economic privilege,but the result of a gap between traditional cultural values and thetechnological realities that made them outmoded. This gap he termed"cultural lag." For present purposes, this formulation was important because itimplied that sociologists should henceforth devote their energies tomeasuring rates of change in different areas of human activity,rather than to constructing grand theories of evolution or of theideal society. Such was the theory that ultimately led to Ogburn's1929 address to the A.S.S. Politically, Social Change was also ambivalent whenmeasured by prewar standards of reform as revealed by the fact thatsome readers attempted to give it a reformist interpretation whileothers criticized its technological determinism and apparentfatalism.[37] Ogburn'sproposals, although "fragmentary" by his own admission, in factlooked neither to social justice or governmental controls, on the onehand, nor to rugged individualism and laissez faire, on the other,but rather to the good life in a well-adjusted, consumer-oriented,leisured society. More enlightened attitudes toward sex, perhapsearlier sex education, might relieve "psychoses and neuroses," hespeculated. The sublimation of sexual energies into creativeactivities, and an increase in sports and recreation, would alsohelp. Whereas earlier progressives had urged the channeling ofprivate passion into public projects (Lester Ward, for example),Ogburn argued, in effect, that Americans should frankly accept theseparation of public and private sphere. In the modern world,recreation and sexual fulfillment would foster adjustment to asituation one could or would not change. What did this posture mean in practice? An illuminating if limitedanswer can be found in an interesting confession Ogburn later made inhis journal concerning his dealings with Jews, a number of whom werealready prominent within the profession.Seeing discrimination duringhis Columbia years, he spent "great gobs of time" helping Jews obtainjobs and fellowships. But their "aggression, ego, contempt, etc."soon got under his skin. Invited to dinner parties, he would wonder"if Mr. ___, a Jew, would be there, or Prof. ___, a Jew was invited.If so, I braced myself for a bad time." Finally, he asked himself"why I have to be so damned nice to the Jews if I do not enjoy them".At the same time, he realized how unjust it was to endow "theindividual with the traits of the race."[38] Faced with this dilemma, a 19th century liberal ideally might havereread John Locke on "natural rights," or quoted the Declaration ofIndependence. Ogburn instead took a poll. Listing thirty-five Jews hehad known at Columbia and at Chicago, and a random list ofthirty-five non-Jews, he compared the two for ten to fifteenobjectional traits often attributed to Jews. The result showed that85 percent of the Jews had the traits, but only 15 percent of thenon-Jews. "So I declared my independence of my conscience about theJews," he concluded this tortured dairy entry. "And I am not 'nice,'to those I don't like, no matter how much I sympathize, or how well Iunderstand how they got that way."[39] Ogburn's response to Hitler and fascism raised further questionsconcerning the ideological payoff of his "objectivity." Althoughthere exists little direct evidence of Ogburn's position on the issueduring the late 1930s, indirect evidence suggests that somecolleagues felt that he was soft on fascism. "The consensus expressedabout you was that your professional career...has been seriouslymarred and your reputation injured by your non-belief in democracyand your obsession with [and] your fondness and admirationfor totalitarian dictatorships," one former student wrote him afterthe war, shocked to hear him being so criticized during a Princetonconference. "Your friends cited the fact that you seemed to bepro-Nazi in the late thirties, even up to Pearl Harbor. They now sayyou are just as strongly in favor of the Soviets, and that youevidently adhere to a totalitarian form of government." Nor was shecomforted when another friend defended Ogburn, saying he was reportedas pro-Nazi "merely because of the absurd notion you had that youcould view objectively a war in which the world was involved, andremain neutral."[40] Although the letter shocked Ogburn ("jerked me up quick"), hisexplanations in his diary left the cloud hanging. He did admireorganization and efficiency: he did despise hatred even when directedagainst Hitler. At a meeting in June 1942 to hear the impressions ofa former head of the Associated Press in Berlin, for example, hefound himself marvelling at the skill of the Nazi propaganda machine("not admiration of course for the end, but for the means"). Whileothers listened "with contempt, disgust, and horror," he reflected tohimself that the propaganda minister was only doing what everyfamily, fraternity, and college does in indoctrinating itsmembers.[41]Was he"psychotic?" Was he "in any way abnormal?" No, he decided. But hedisliked seeing his colleagues "so emotional and so hating. And thenthere was that lonely feeling."[42] Was Ogburn thus an antisemite or pro-fascist? Certainly not in thesense that he openly supported anti-democratic causes or espousedanti-liberal ideas. During the depression years, he worked tirelesslyfor numerous New Deal agencies and privately (although not publicly)developed great admiration for Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. Buthis journal confessions alone suggest that he himself was aware thathis objectivist principles had eroded his liberalism: in its implicitpreference for order over freedom, its focus on efficiency overhumanity, and its substitution for probability predictions forself-evident natural or moral laws. What finally of "corporatism?"[43]If Ogburn was not pro-fascist noropenly antidemocratic did he notserve, and even help create through he work on the S.S.RC., thefoundations and New Deal agencies the alliance between business,government, and the university intelligensia which the critics ofcorporatism denounce? If one may distinguish "corporatism" asconscious policy from its de facto emergence in the interwar years,the answer in Ogburn's case is not guilty on the first count,although probably guilty by association on the second.Since Ogburninsisted that the sociologist qua scientist should make no policyrecommendations, he scarcely qualifies as a corporatist theorist.After a year with the National Recovery Administration, for example,he reported that government-business cooperation was a prominentfeature of the early New Deal, even speculating that it might be thewave of the future. But he also reported in objective fashion that itraised the perennial question of the balance between freedom andorder, an issue upon which he would venture no opinion. [44] Guilt by association may be another matter, at least to the degreethat a case can be made the the foundations and the academic"experts" they sponsored were an integral part of New Era capitalism.Social Change, as noted above, also provided a blueprint for aconsumerist, leisured society adjusted to the technologicalimperatives of modern industry. The irony, of course, was that thisblueprint in Ogburn case was the work of a displaced southernersuspended between traditions he loved but would not accept, and anorder he accepted but would not love. Carrying this analysis further,one might argue that it was no coincidence that Ogburn and his fellowobjectivists stood ready and willing to serve the functions they didin the world of government and the foundations, or that their work,indirectly at least, hould have shaped the corporatist, consumeristorder since the same forces that produced this order were responsiblefor the social and cultural crisis that gave rise to theirobjectivism in the first place. For present purposes, however, the central point is that the questfor objectivity as represented by Ogburn was not an inevitableunforlding of the "logic" of science, but a product of historicalforces that converged on the generation that came of ageintellectually on the eve of World War I. Objectivity, that is,has a history no less than other chapters in human history,although some sociologists continue to reisist the point. Although Ogburn enjoyed professional success and prestige untilhis death in 1959, and the positivist spirit he represented hasscarcely disappeared from American sociology, the Second World Warcast a pall over the extreme and often naive scientism of theinterwar period, just as the First World War had contributed to itsrise.Since he 1960s, numerous charges were levelled against theentire objectivist program: that it ignored the realities of power,exploitation, and conflict; that it narrowed the focus of sociologyto parochial and often trivial concerns; and that it failed to seethe cultural; class, and, most recently, gender biases of its ownideal of objectivity. Whether or not one accepts this indictment,this essay has attempted to identify the rather special conditions inthe shaping of modern America that produced this chapter in Americanthought. Whether these conditions have changed significantly, andwith them the assumptions they bred, remains an open question.

William F. Ogburn








 

William Fielding Ogburn
 June 29, 1886 — April 27, 1959
William Fielding Ogburn served as President of the American Sociological Society (later changed to Association) in 1929. His Presidential Address, "The Folkways of a Scientific Sociology," was delivered at the organization's Annual Meeting in Washington,DC in December 1929 and was later published int he Proceedings of the 1929 meeting.
Howard W. Odum, in his 1951 book American Sociology: The Story of Sociology in the United States through 1950 provided the following biographical sketch of William F. Ogburn (pages 147-152): 

Going directly to graduate work at Columbia University with Giddings in 1908, three years after his graduation from Georgia's Mercer University in 1905, William F. Ogburn, the nineteenth president of the American Sociological Society, was the first to make sociology his first and last field of professional work. That is, after his excursion into secondary-school teaching, as was customary with most graduates of Georgia colleges who expected to go into professional work, Ogburn began his studies in sociology and was still going strong at the 1950 mark. His only transitional excursion away from sociology was as instructor at Princeton University in economics, politics, and history while he was working for his Ph.D. degree in sociology at Columbia, unless his year of postwar economic studies in France or his presidency of the American Statistical Association could be so designated.
Born in Butler, Georgia, in 1886, and having received the B.S. degree from Mercer University at Macon, Georgia, and the M.A. degree in 1909 from Columbia University and the Ph.D. in 1912, he was professor of sociology at Reed College, Portland, Oregon, for four years where he did what he sometimes estimates his best teaching. Following the Reed College tenure he was for two years, 1918 and 1919, in World War I, examiner and head of the cost of living department for the National War Labor Board and special agent for the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. Following this service he came back to Columbia University as professor of sociology in 1919 where he remained until 1927 when he was called to Chicago to serve in a similar capacity. In 1933 he was appointed to the Sewell L. Avery distinguished service professorship and has remained there continuously except for leaves of absence granted to undertake special work. He received the honorary degree of LL.D. from his Alma Mater and from the University of North Carolina.
Like his predecessors among the presidents of the American Sociological Society, he has been called on to cooperate in many ventures and to undertake much in allied fields. Although Giddings had been the sociological pioneer in insisting that statistics be given a major role in sociology, and although he had been a fellow in the American Statistical Association, Ogburn was a president of the Association and editor of its journal. So, too, although several of the presidents of the American Sociological Society have been fellows in the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Ogburn has been the only vice-president up to 1950. And again, Ogburn has been the only sociologist to be president of the Social Science Research Council and chairman of its Problems and Policy Committee. Other related scientific associations included the International Statistical Institute, the Population Association of America, the Sociological Research Association. His active and advisory services to outside agencies have also been numerous. He was chairman of the United States Census Advisory Committee, director of the Consumers Advisory Board of the National Recovery Administration, special adviser to the Resettlement Administration and research consultant to the National Resources Committee, 1935-43.
His most distinctive cooperative research effort, however, was his directorship of the President's Research Committee on Social Trends established by President Herbert Hoover and running from 1930 to 1933.Ogburn not only was mainly responsible for the outlines and arrangements for this study but the appropriation of more than a half million dollars for the study by the Rockefeller Foundation was facilitated by Ogburn's directing the study. Another president of the Society, Howard W. Odum, who had initiated the request for the appropriation, was assistant director of research, while the other members of the committee were Wesley C. Mitchell of Columbia, chairman, Charles E. Merriam of Chicago, vice-chairman, Shelby Harrison of the Russell Sage Foundation, and Alice Hamilton of Harvard. The results of this cooperative research program were published in two main volumes of thirty-four chapters by almost as many collaborators, in addition to the zoo-page summary and thirteen separate monographs. Ogburn himself contributed two of the main chapters dealing with science, invention, and social change, and with marriage and family relationships.
In this work Ogburn was able to urge upon the committee one of his major indices of Methodology, namely, that research be undertaken in no area unless statistical data were available for objective measurement. And in those cases where the major authors had not had access to or experience in statistical research, it was the policy of the Committee to provide statistical assistants. Thus, Samuel Stouffer, subsequently to go as professor of sociology and director of the research laboratory of social relations at Harvard, collaborated with Jesse F. Steiner in his excellent chapter on the community and recreational activities, and Clarence Heer, professor of finance at North Carolina, collaborated with Howard W. Odum in his chapter on public welfare.
Ogburn's main books and brochures included Progress and Uniformity in Child-Labor Legislation: A Study in Statistical Measurement, published as his Ph.D. thesis, 1912; Social Change with Respect to Culture and Original Nature, 1922; The Social Sciences and Their Inter-relations, edited jointly by Ogburn and Alexander Goldenweiser, 1927; American Marriage and Family Relationships with E. R. Groves, 1928; The Economic Development of Post-War France: A Survey of Production, with William Joffé, 1929; Social Changes, edited for The American journal of Sociology and published each year, 1927 to 1935; Recent Social Trends, 1933; Sociology — a textbook, with Meyer F. Nimkoff, 1940; American Society in Wartime, edited 1944; The Social Effects of Aviation, 1946. A revised edition of Social Change appeared in 1950.
In addition to these books a number of smaller pamphlets have been published. Most important of these are: Living with Machines, 1933; You and Machines, 1934; Social Characteristics of Cities: A Basis for New Interpretations of the Role of the City in American Life, 1937; Technological Trends and National Policy, 1937; Machines and Tomorrow's World, 1938; War, Babies and the Future, 1943; The Politics of Atomic Energy, 1946.
Few men in American sociology have equaled Ogburn in sheer quantity of output of articles for journals. Not including book reviews, approximately a hundred and seventy-five such articles have appeared, in addition to approximately twenty chapters written for and published in books edited by others. According to the chief subject matter and to journals carrying them, these journals have been divided into two groups in an unpublished paper in 1948, (1) learned and technical journals and (2) popular magazines. The number of articles appearing in the learned and technical journals include fifty-three from sociological journals, including The American Journal of Sociology, Social Forces, Publications of the American Sociological Society, Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Sociology and Social Research.
The range of his contributions is indicated by some eighty-five articles in other journals, including Public Management, Journal of the American Statistical Association, Survey Graphic, Monthly Labor Review, Political Science Quarterly, Scientific Monthly, Journal of Political Economy, American Political Science Review, American Economic Review, State Review of Literature, Journal of Adult Education, American Labor Year Book. There have been some fifty articles in popular magazines and newspapers, including the New York Times, the Berliner Tageblatt, Air Affairs, American Magazine, Ladies' Home Journal, Nation's Business.
Although Ogburn may not be as noted as his teacher Giddings was for the creation of a great many sociological terms and concepts, his term "cultural lag," defined sociologically for the first time in his book Social Change, has become a classic. As Ogburn defined it on page 196 of this book, "The thesis is . . . that the source of most modern social changes today is the material culture. The material-culture changes force changes in other parts of culture such as social organization and customs, but these latter parts of culture do not change as quickly. They lag behind the material-culture changes, hence we are living in a period of maladjustment."
Ogburn writes, "I think we have made a good deal of progress in the scientific method in sociology since you and I were in the graduate school together at Columbia University, and I think the United States is far ahead of any other country especially continental Europe, in scientific sociology. But at best the movement will be slow. I think much too much attention is given to systematization and not enough to verification. On the other hand, I am not a perfectionist. If I were, I would advocate a restriction of effort to a narrow field such as statistical surveys, population studies, and vital statistics. I think the degree of accuracy and the extent of verification is contingent upon the need in laying out work, and I am not disposed to be critical particularly of failures to obtain perfection. Rather I would welcome approximations provided the author knows that they are approximations and knows what science is. I would rule out, however, some approximations where the goal for the author is philosophy, persuasion, propaganda, ethics, or the essay. I am not adverse to the sociologist writing essays or propaganda providing he does this merely as a human being and not as a scientist."
When urged to indicate the nature of some of his own contributions Ogburn wrote: "I claim that the problem of social evolution is solved and that I have played a considerable part in solving it. By solving I mean solving in the sense that Darwin solved the problem of biological evolution. Darwin did it by pointing out three factors: variation, natural selection, and heredity. Darwin added the factor of natural selection. The problem of social evolution is solved by four factors: invention, exponential accumulation, diffusion, and adjustment. My contribution has been largely in the factor of exponential accumulation and also in the development of the factor of invention. I also think that my role has been significant in the adjustment of one part of culture to another (cultural lag). There will no doubt be refinements in the analysis and measurements just as there have been in Darwin's three factors which explain biological evolution.
"One other contribution of mine I'm rather fond of is the observation verified by measurement that trend lines seldom change their direction very sharply or quickly although the fluctuations about a trend line often do. The development of the reasons why trend lines do not change their direction sharply is interesting, but this discovery rests upon its significance for planning and for the recognition it gives to social stability."
Although Ogburn's many contributions have been indicated as in the field of statistical method, the influence of technology upon society, the family, and population, he writes that "I suppose I would be classed by most of my colleagues as in the field of social change although I don't like to be fenced in." And with reference to sociology's great opportunities in the future, he wrote, "I think the greatest opportunity in sociology lies in getting away from bias and prejudice and contributing reliable information. You will recall that the idea which you and I had in carrying through together the Social Trends study was to rule out all opinion unsupported and to accept nothing but reliable conclusions. The idea was that as a multiplication table should be reliable both for the Tory and the Communist, so the conclusion of social trends should be valid alike for the radical and the conservative. I think the almost universal acceptance of the social trends study was a tribute to a measure of success in making it reliable. If we succeed in building up a respect for the reliability of social science among statesmen, responsible educators, and capable congressmen, and among business and social leaders, universities and the students will follow. One of the biggest hindrances to the attainment is the distorting effect of bias and emotion. Another practical obstacle to research I have come to think is the prestige which goes to the advisory function in public affairs and the prestige of committee work with agencies such as federal government and the special wartime agencies. It is impossible to do research work and committee work in Washington at the same time, and nowadays sociologists run away from the long, hard, slow tasks of research for the quicker, easier prestige of counseling in public affairs. Such counselors I call committee bums."
Ogburn's presidential address in 1929 was in character when he spoke on "The Folkways of a Scientific Sociology." In substance it was what he wrote later in The Scientific Monthly, for April, 1930. "In the past the great names in sociology have been social theorists and social philosophers. But this will not be the case in the future. For social theory and social philosophy will decline, that is, in the field of scientific sociology. Social theory will have no place in a scientific sociology, for it is not built upon sufficient data. Of course, certain syntheses of broader researches may be called theory, a new meaning for an old term. But such syntheses will be based on evidence. Social theory in good part is the product of wishful thinking, taking form in the Zeitgeist in which it is developed."
