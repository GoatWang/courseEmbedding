					Full Description



Sophiris Bio Inc., incorporated in May, 2003, is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. The Company is focused on developing products for the treatment of urological diseases. The Company is developing topsalysin (PRX302) as a treatment for the lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) commonly referred to as an enlarged prostate and as a treatment for localized low to intermediate risk prostate cancer.Topsalysin, a genetically modified recombinant protein, is delivered through ultrasound-guided injection directly into the prostate. This membrane-disrupting protein is selectively activated by enzymatically active prostate specific antigen (PSA), which is only present in the prostate, leading to localized cell death and tissue disruption without damage to neighboring tissue and nerves. This method of administration limits the circulation of the drug in the body. The Company has completed Phase III clinical trials of topsalysin. The Company has initiated a single-center, open-label Phase IIa proof of concept clinical trial of topsalysin for the treatment of localized low to intermediate risk prostate cancer. The injection of topsalysin is individualized to each patient based on the size of the prostate and the drug is delivered in a procedure that can be performed in an urologist's office.The Company competes with Astellas Pharma, Sanofi, Pfizer, Watson Pharmaceuticals, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Merck & Co., Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, NeoTract, Inc., Light Sciences Oncology Inc., Nymox Pharmaceuticals and Procept BioRobotics.

Sophiris Bio, Inc. Key Developments

Sophiris Bio Inc. Announces Dosing of First Patient in Phase 2b Study to Evaluate Safety and Tolerability of Topsalysin in Focally Treating Men with Clinically Significant Localized Prostate Cancer
Jun 8 17
Sophiris Bio Inc. announced that the first patient has been dosed in its Phase 2b study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of topsalysin in focally treating men with clinically significant localized prostate cancer. Topsalysin (PRX302) is an innovative, first-in-class pore-forming protein engineered to be activated only in the presence of enzymatically-active PSA, which is only found within the prostate. This Phase 2b study will build on the successful Phase 2a proof-of-concept study for the treatment of localized prostate cancer which demonstrated that a targeted intraprostatic administration of topsalysin has the potential to safely ablate prostate tumor cells. The study is a multi-center, open-label, Phase 2b study evaluating the safety and efficacy of targeted intraprostatic administration of topsalysin for the treatment of histologically proven, clinically significant, localized prostate cancer. Approximately 40 patients will be enrolled in the study at multiple sites in the United States and the United Kingdom. The study will utilize previously obtained MRI images of each patient's prostate mapped to real time 3D ultrasound to target the delivery of topsalysin directly into and around a pre-identified clinically significant tumor. Safety and tolerability will be assessed post-treatment over 26 weeks. Efficacy will be assessed by biopsy and imaging (mpMRI) at 24 weeks. The Company expects to receive six month biopsy data for all patients in the first quarter of 2018 assuming enrollment is completed as expected. Importantly, the Phase 2b study includes an option to re-treat patients with a second dose of topsalysin, with a targeted biopsy to occur six months following the second dose. In order to be eligible for a second dose, the patient cannot have experienced a significant adverse event attributable to topsalysin or the dosing procedure from the first dose and the patient will need to have had a clinical response from the first dose but still have the presence of a clinically significant lesion area. The company expects to have final biopsy data on all patients who receive a second dose in the fourth quarter of 2018.


Sophiris Bio Provides Update on Phase 2b Study of Topsalysin in Localized Prostate Cancer
May 23 17
Sophiris Bio Inc. reported that it has received the regulatory clearance for the diluent – the medium in which topsalysin is diluted. Clinical sites can now begin dosing eligible patients in a Phase 2b study in localized prostate cancer.


Sophiris Bio Inc. Announces Unaudited Consolidated Financial Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017
May 15 17
Sophiris Bio Inc. announced unaudited consolidated financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. Net loss was $2,619,000 or $0.09 per basic and diluted share compared to $2,242,000 or $0.13 per basic and diluted share a year ago.

The Exchange Traded Funds prospectus contains its investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other important information you should read and consider carefully prior to making an investment decision.
        Please review the current prospectus, available from the Prospectus link on www.motifinvesting.com, by phone at 1-855-586-6843, or in writing at Motif Investing, Inc., P.O. Box 3548, Rancho Cordova, CA  95741.
ETFs have unique features that you should be aware of, which can include distribution of any gains, risks related to securities within the portfolio, and tax consequences. The data quoted herein represents past performance and is not indicative of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that your investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original value. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data provided.  Please review the prospectus or other research tools provided on this site for more recent information. Contact Motif Investing at 1-855-586-6843 to obtain the most recent month-end performance data.
The 30-Day SEC Yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the past 30 days after the deduction of the ETF’s expenses.  The 30-day SEC Yield is an annual percentage rate based on the ETF's share price and is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30 days ended on the date of calculation by that day’s maximum share price.  The Distribution Yield is the trailing 12-Month End Yield derived by adding the trailing 12-month's income distributions and dividing the total by the last month's ending share price. Income refers to interest payments from fixed-income ETFs and dividend payments from stock-based ETFs.
The ETF prospectus is provided by DFS (http://www.rrdonnelley.com/financial-services/). The use of this prospectus is restricted solely to the website of Motif Investing and may not be redistributed, copied or otherwise made available without the express written consent of DFS.

Fixed income investments are subject to various unique risks, including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption,
    corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates.


The 1-Year Return/Return Since Inception indicates the performance of this particular motif over the last 12 months or, if the motif was created within the past 12 months, since the date the motif was created. See how we calculate returns.


The Motif Index level represents the performance of a benchmark motif (a motif in our catalog) over time. It is set at 
1000 on the date of inception of the motif. For example, a Motif Index of 1100 represents a 10% return since inception. Similarly, the change in the Index over a 
specified period represents the period return on the portfolio holding the same share weights as the benchmark motif.
The Motif Index is a measure created and maintained by the firm, which has the discretion to change the holdings that comprise the index and to make alterations to a particular Motif Index.


Popularity shows you how much interest a motif is attracting, compared to other motifs. We base this score on a proprietary formula that uses factors like how many people are viewing the motif, and how much conversation about it is happening in the community, in a range from Low-to-High.
The Volatility measurement for a Motif represents the annualized standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the Motif, and is measured in a range from Low to High. Since the standard deviation of returns are commonly used as a measure of portfolio risk, a Volatility measurement that is High is indicative of the fact that holding the motif in the past subjected the holder to larger fluctuations or higher risk.
The Valuation metric represents the present valuation of the stocks in the motif relative to the broader equity market. The Valuation metric is calculated as the composite Price-to-Earnings ratio for the stocks in the motif weighted by their respective share weights in a range from Low to High.


Standard pricing: $9.95 total commission per motif transaction. Other fees may apply. For details on fees and commissions, please

        Performance returns, including 1-month Return/Return Since Inception/1-year returns indicates the performance of this particular motif over that stated period of time as of the date provided.

Investing in securities involves risks, you should be aware of prior to making an investment decision, including the possible loss of principal. An investment in individual stocks, or a collection of stocks
    focused on a particular theme or idea, such as a motif, may be subject to increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified holdings due to adverse developments which can affect a particular industry or sector.
    Investments in ETFs can include those with a narrow or targeted investment strategy and can be subject to similar sector risks than more broadly diversified investments.

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

clinical trials






We have completed eight clinical trials of PRX302 – including a Phase 2a trial for the treatment of localized prostate cancer (PRX302-2-7) and a Phase 3 trial l for the treatment of the lower urinary tract symptoms of BPH. In March 2017, we initiated a second Phase 2 clinical trial to confirm the dose and optimize the delivery of topsalysin for the treatment of clinically significant localized prostate cancer. In the PLUS-1 study, PRX302 also demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with no evidence of any treatment related sexual or cardiovascular side effects. The Phase 3 trial, called PLUS-1, achieved its primary endpoint — a single treatment with PRX302 (topsalysin) demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in BPH symptoms over a 12 month period. In our completed PRX302-2-7 PCA trial, the one-time administration of topsalysin was well tolerated with no serious adverse events and no new safety signals being reported. Topsalysin demonstrated an ability to ablate tumor cells in over 50 percent six months after treatment in a patient population with pre-identified, clinically significant prostate cancer. The results support advancing topsalysin for the treatment of localized prostate cancer into another Phase 2 study to confirm dose and optimize delivery.

PRX302-2-8
In March 2017, we initiated a second Phase 2 clinical trial to confirm the dose and optimize the delivery of topsalysin for the treatment of clinically significant localized prostate cancer. This study will also utilize previously obtained MRI images of each patient’s prostate mapped to real time 3D ultrasound to target the delivery of topsalysin directly into and around a pre-identified clinically significant tumor. The primary objective of the study is safety and tolerability of an injection of topsalysin and the key efficacy variable is focal ablation of a clinically significant lesion on biopsy after six months. Approximately 40 patients will be enrolled across clinical sites in the UK and US. Patient screening into the study has begun.
We expect to receive biopsy data for all patients for biopsies conducted six months after the initial dose late 2017 or early 2018. Based upon the results of the 6-month biopsy, the study includes an option to potentially re-treat the targeted lesion area with a second dose of topsalysin, with a targeted biopsy to occur six months following the second dose. In order to be eligible for a second dose, the patient cannot have experienced a significant adverse event attributable to topsalysin or the dosing procedure from the first dose and the patient will need to have had a clinical response from the first dose but still have the presence of a clinically significant lesion area. We expect to have final biopsy data on all patients who receive a second dose by the third quarter of 2018.

Open-label, safety and tolerability, dose escalation trial of PRX302 in patients with biopsy-proven, locally-recurrent prostate cancer





PRX302-2-7 PCa
A total of 18 patients with localized low to intermediate risk prostate cancer were enrolled in the Phase 2a proof of concept clinical trial. On June 9, 2016, we announced the biopsy results from all 18 patients enrolled in the Phase 2a proof of concept study of topsalysin for the treatment of localized prostate cancer. The one-time administration of topsalysin was well tolerated with no serious adverse events and no new safety signals being reported. Topsalysin demonstrated an ability to ablate tumor cells in 50 percent of patients (9/18 patients) six months after treatment in a patient population with pre-identified, clinically significant prostate cancer. In preparation for the presentation of the Phase 2a proof of concept clinical trial data for an upcoming medical conference, we recently determined that 2 patients who were initially reported as having no response to treatment should have been reported as having a partial response to treatment. Taking into account the updated results, topsalysin demonstrated an ability to ablate tumor cells in more than 60 percent of patients (11/18 patients) six months after treatment in a patient population with pre-identified, low to intermediate risk prostate cancer. 
All 18 patients enrolled completed the study. Biopsy data at six months following treatment showed that: 

Two patients experienced complete ablation of their targeted tumor with no evidence of any tumor remaining at six months;
Nine patients experienced a partial response, defined as either a reduction in the maximum cancer core length or a reduction in Gleason pattern; and
Seven patients had no response to treatment.

See additional details of the results of this study here.

Phase 2 Open-Label Clinical Trial in Prostate Cancer
In September 2009, we completed a Phase 2 clinical trial of PRX302 in six patients with biopsy-proven, locally-recurrent prostate cancer that, following radiation therapy, showed signs of disease progression evidenced by rising levels of PSA. Therapeutic activity in the form of overall decreases in PSA levels and in the number of adenocarcinoma-positive biopsy cores following PRX302 treatment was observed in two of six patients.
Phase 1 Open-Label Clinical Trial in Prostate Cancer
In May 2008, we completed a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation Phase 1 clinical trial of PRX302 in 24 patients in the United States with biopsy-proven, locally-recurrent prostate cancer that, following radiation therapy, showed signs of disease progression evidenced by rising levels of PSA. Elevated and rising levels of PSA can be a sign of the presence or progression of prostate cancer. The primary clinical endpoint of this clinical trial was to examine the safety and tolerability of PRX302 with therapeutic activity as the secondary clinical endpoint. Clinical trial results demonstrated that PRX302 was well-tolerated and showed early signs of therapeutic activity following a single intraprostatic treatment.
No PRX302 treatment-related serious adverse events were reported and the treatment-related adverse effects that were reported were mild and were primarily associated with the injection procedure.

Trial Design




PLUS-1 PRX302-3-01 BPH
III Completed (479 patients)
Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, transrectal treatment of PRX302, which will utilize the IPSS outcome measure evaluated at 12 months as the primary endpoint


TRIUMPH PRX302-2-03 BPH
IIb (61 pts)
Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, transperineal treatment of PRX302


PRX302-2-06 BPH
I/II (32 pts)
Randomized dose escalation, multicenter trial of a single transrectal intraprostatic treatment of PRX302


PRX302-2-02 Phase 2a BPH
IIa (18 pts)
Open-label, safety, volume escalation clinical trial of a single transperineal treatment of PRX302


PRX302-2-01 BPH
I (15 pts)
Open-label, safety, dose escalation clinical trial of a signal transperineal intraprostatic treatment of PRX302





PLUS-1 phase III trial
A Phase 3 “PLUS-1” trial evaluating PRX302 as a treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH, enlarged prostate) met its primary endpoint. PRX302 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) total score from baseline over 12 months compared to the vehicle-only control group (7.60 vs. 6.58 point overall improvement; p = 0.043), the primary endpoint of the study. PRX302 continues to demonstrate a favorable safety profile, with no evidence of any treatment related sexual or cardiovascular side effects. Additional details were announced here.
TRIUMPH Phase IIb trial (PRX 302-2-03)
A multi-center, double blinded, placebo controlled Phase IIb study (TRIUMPH) of PRX302 in men with moderate to severe BPH met its primary endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in IPSS from baseline when compared to placebo at 3 months post-treatment. In the study, patients treated with PRX302 showed an improvement of 9.1 points from baseline versus an improvement in IPSS of 5.8 points from baseline in patients receiving placebo (p<0.05) A clinically meaningful improvement was maintained throughout the 12 months (Elihilali, M. et al J Urol. 2013 Apr189 (4) : 1421-6).
PRX302-2-06 Phase I/II trial
A double-blind, multi-center, placebo controlled Phase IIa study in 40 patients with moderate to severe BPH. Patients were randomized to PRX302 or placebo within one of four dose cohorts in this transrectal study. The primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate the 3-month safety and tolerability of escalating doses of PRX302. The side effect profile in this Transrectal clinical trial was consistent with the side effects reported in the previous, transperineal PRX302 clinical trials, indicating that PRX302 injection by the Transrectal route was well tolerated, and was comparable to the transperineal route.
PRX302-2-01 Phase I and PRX302-2-02 Phase II
The transperineal administration of PRX302 was well tolerated in these open label and dose-escalation and volume studies, and, IPSS scores improved significantly for up to 12 months after treatment. The dose escalation of 14-fold was well tolerated and the Maximum Tolerated Dose was not reached. No drug-related adverse events Grade 3 or higher were observed. Results supported further development of PRX302.
