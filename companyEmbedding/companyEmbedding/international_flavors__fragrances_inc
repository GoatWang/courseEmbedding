    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Flavor is what gives food and drinks their magic and makes our sense of taste so precious. It is also the most important driver of food purchases, product loyalty, and demand from consumers.

Elon Musk details Tesla Model 3 pricing, range
              
              Tesla Inc.'s  Model 3 will cost $35,000 for a base version and $44,000 for a model with longer range, Chief Executive Elon Musk announced Friday night at an event outside the company's Fremont, Calif., factory. Tesla has announced hundreds of thousands of reservations for the car, which included $1,000 deposits, but only announced the final pricing schedule at the event, where the first 30 Model 3 units were supposed to be delivered to owners. The two options for range introduced Friday night were a Standard edition expected to travel 220 miles on a full charge, and a Long-Range model that would travel 310 miles. Musk reiterated at the event that he expects to soon build the cars at a rate of 5,000 a week, ramping up to 10,000 a week by the end of next year, and that customers who order the cars now would likely receive them late next year.

Stitch Fix has confidentially filed to go public: report
              
              Stitch Fix, a subscription clothing service, has filed confidentially to go public, according to TechCrunch, citing sources. The company has been rumored to be going public for months, with Reuters reporting in May that the company had hired Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to underwrite the offering. Under the JOBS Act, companies are able to file confidentially before releasing a public prospectus. In late June, the Securities and Exchange Commission moved to allow confidential filing for all companies, rather than the previous standard of companies with annual revenue of less than $1 billion. Stitch Fix would be another test of a subscription service model, after Blue Apron Holdings Inc.'s  offering earlier this month. Shares of Blue Apron have fallen 28% month-to-date, while the S&P 500  has gained 2%.

Redfin's stock debuts 30% above its IPO price
              
              Shares of Redfin Corp.  debuted Friday on the Nasdaq with a bang, opening at $19.56 at 11:05 a.m. ET, which was 30% above the $15 initial public offering price. The stock has since added to gains be up 35% in morning trade. The real-estate company, which mixes online technology with traditional agents, had priced its IPO above the previously expected range of $12 to $14. The company sold 9.23 million shares to raise over $138 million, and granted underwriters the option to buy an additional 1.38 million shares. The stock was listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol "RDFN." The stock debuted on a day that the SPDR Real Estate Select Sector ETF  was up 0.1% and the S&P 500  was down 0.4%.

Atlantic Media selling ownership stake to organization run by Laurene Powell Jobs
              
              Emerson Collective, founded by Laurene Powell Jobs, wife of late Apple founder Steve Jobs, is acquiring a majority ownership stake in The Atlantic. According to a news release on Friday Atlantic Media Chairman David Bradley told staff of the deal, which includes its flagship magazine, digital properties, live events business and consulting services. Bradley, through Atlantic Media, will hold a minority stake and continue to run The Atlantic for the next three to five years. In a letter to The Atlantic staff Bradley said, "Against the odds, The Atlantic is prospering. While I will stay at the helm some years, the most consequential decision of my career now is behind me: Who next will take stewardship of this 160-year-old national treasure? To me, the answer, in the form of Laurene, feels incomparably right." The terms of the deal were not disclosed. In the 18 years since Bradley acquired the magazine from Mortimer Zuckerman, digital readership has grown to a monthly average of 33 million unique visitors from 2 million in 2009, and it generates profits above $10 million per year after recording losses of more than $10 million a year in Bradley's early days. About 20% of the magazine's revenue comes from print advertising with 80% coming in digital advertising.

Goodyear Tire's stock dives after slashed profit outlook offsets in-line earnings
              
              Shares of Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.  plunged 9.3% in premarket trade Friday, after the tire maker slashed its 2017 profit outlook. Net profit for the quarter to June 30 fell to $147 million, or 58 cents a share, from $202 million, or 75 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to 70 cents, matching the FactSet consensus. Revenue slipped to $3.69 billion from $3.88 billion, just shy of the FactSet consensus of $3.73 billion. The company cut its 2017 guidance for segment operating income to a range of $1.60 billion to $1.65 billion from "approximately" $2.0 billion. "In addition to higher raw material costs, we have seen a weakening in OE and consumer replacement demand across many of our key markets during the first half, despite strong underlying industry fundamentals," said Chief Executive Richard Kramer. "The combination of these factors has led to a highly unusual first half environment, particularly given the favorable trends in miles driven, gasoline prices and unemployment that are generally supportive of our industry." The stock has rallied 14.9% year to date through Thursday, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.6%.

Wells Fargo: FDA plan to lower nicotine could be opportunity for Altria, Philip Morris
              
              Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog said Friday that a new Food and Drug Administration plan to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes could be a long-term opportunity for makers of reduced-risk products like Altria Group Inc.  and Philip Morris International Inc. . Shares of cigarette producers plunged after the FDA announcement, with Altria plummeting 9.6%, Philip Morris declining 0.4% and British American Tobacco  plunging 7.2% in extremely heavy midday trade. Altria and Philip Morris, however, have a "unique competitive advantage" with smokeless iQOS devices. Philip Morris said "iQOS heats the tobacco just enough to release the flavorful nicotine-containing vapor but without burning the tobacco." Even so, one medical journal study found that smoke from heat-not-burn cigarettes have 85% of the nicotine in conventional cigarettes. "We see this as an opportune entry point for long-term investors and would recommend building positions on today's broad weakness," Herzog said. "We also note that PM/MO's premarket tobacco product application with the FDA to commercialize iQOS in the U.S. remains under review." Altria shares have dropped 6.9% over the last three months and Philip Morris shares have risen 5.8%, compared with a 3.6% rise in the S&P 500 .

History[edit]
International Flavors & Fragrances was formed in 1958 by the merger between Polak & Schwarz (P&S) and van Ameringen-Haebler. Polak & Schwarz was founded in 1889 by Leopold Schwarz, who had an interest in spices, flavors and fragrances, and his brother-in-law, Joseph Polak in the small Dutch town of Zutphen. P&S quickly grew to 36 sites globally. Arnold Louis (A.L.) van Ameringen was hired by Polak & Schwarz to open P&S's US office in 1917 before losing his job with them. Relieved of his duties, he opened van Ameringen & Co. at 13 Gold Street in Manhattan, took over Morana, Inc. in 1920, and became van Ameringen-Haebler (VAH) in 1929. van Ameringen is credited with suggesting to bar soap and detergent manufacturers that they scent their products to boost sales.
The two companies did well through the bulk of the 20th century, despite difficulties for P&S during World War II. While both companies managed flavors and fragrances, Polak & Schwarz had particular strengths in flavors and van Ameringen-Haebler built a powerful reputation in fragrances. In 1958, the two companies announced their merger to become International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. IFF was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1964.
In 2000, IFF acquired Bush Boake Allen with its complementary products, technologies,and presence in key markets, making IFF the largest flavor and fragrance house in the world for several years. In 2014 IFF acquired Aromor.
IFF has creative, sales, and manufacturing facilities in 29 different countries and is a member of the S&P 500 Index. IFF is a $7 billion market capital company[5] with a global footprint that generated over 75 percent of its 2010 sales outside the United States and 45 percent in the emerging markets.
In 2016, IFF announced that it completed the acquisition of David Michael & Company of Philadelphia.
Controversy[edit]
IFF has been involved in several lawsuits relating to cases of bronchiolitis obliterans allegedly resulting from exposure to diacetyl in butter flavorings by workers at the Gilster-Mary Lee popcorn plant in Jasper, Missouri. The plaintiffs claim the manufacturers knew about the dangers of the butter flavoring used in the popcorn factory but failed to give a warning. The defendants said they were unaware of the risk and suggested there was not enough evidence to prove their product had caused the disease. Several suits have already been settled amounting to almost $53 million in damages.[6]

                                         rose 2.5% Thursday, after UBS upgraded the stock to buy from neutral and reiterated their view that the stock is a high quality laggard for 2017. The maker of fragrances used in foods as well as fabric care and household cleaning products has seen its price-earnings ratio fall to 21 times from 24 times before the November presidential election, when risk-off stocks were in favor, said UBS. That has meant it is now trading at a discount to peers versus a premium pre-election.

History[edit]
International Flavors & Fragrances was formed in 1958 by the merger between Polak & Schwarz (P&S) and van Ameringen-Haebler. Polak & Schwarz was founded in 1889 by Leopold Schwarz, who had an interest in spices, flavors and fragrances, and his brother-in-law, Joseph Polak in the small Dutch town of Zutphen. P&S quickly grew to 36 sites globally. Arnold Louis (A.L.) van Ameringen was hired by Polak & Schwarz to open P&S's US office in 1917 before losing his job with them. Relieved of his duties, he opened van Ameringen & Co. at 13 Gold Street in Manhattan, took over Morana, Inc. in 1920, and became van Ameringen-Haebler (VAH) in 1929. van Ameringen is credited with suggesting to bar soap and detergent manufacturers that they scent their products to boost sales.
The two companies did well through the bulk of the 20th century, despite difficulties for P&S during World War II. While both companies managed flavors and fragrances, Polak & Schwarz had particular strengths in flavors and van Ameringen-Haebler built a powerful reputation in fragrances. In 1958, the two companies announced their merger to become International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. IFF was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1964.
In 2000, IFF acquired Bush Boake Allen with its complementary products, technologies,and presence in key markets, making IFF the largest flavor and fragrance house in the world for several years. In 2014 IFF acquired Aromor.
IFF has creative, sales, and manufacturing facilities in 29 different countries and is a member of the S&P 500 Index. IFF is a $7 billion market capital company[5] with a global footprint that generated over 75 percent of its 2010 sales outside the United States and 45 percent in the emerging markets.
In 2016, IFF announced that it completed the acquisition of David Michael & Company of Philadelphia.
Controversy[edit]
IFF has been involved in several lawsuits relating to cases of bronchiolitis obliterans allegedly resulting from exposure to diacetyl in butter flavorings by workers at the Gilster-Mary Lee popcorn plant in Jasper, Missouri. The plaintiffs claim the manufacturers knew about the dangers of the butter flavoring used in the popcorn factory but failed to give a warning. The defendants said they were unaware of the risk and suggested there was not enough evidence to prove their product had caused the disease. Several suits have already been settled amounting to almost $53 million in damages.[6]

What if we could start a revolution in sensorial science?
In search for molecules in the Muguet family, many ingredients were synthesized. Starfleur™ was chosen to be taken forward based on its performance and odor profile. IFF patented it in 2010. It’s useful for: Fresh green florals, Muguet, Lily and Freesia notes, lemon and mandarin fresh citrus types and watery transparent notes.

What if we let our senses guide us?
The discovery of Amber Xtreme™ in 2001 represents a triumph of structure-odor relationship intuition. It was a serendipitous discovery that manipulating Galbanum molecules into an ether moiety could lead to molecules with an amber odor. Pursuing this idea on diverse backbones, our scientists identified a plethora of new molecules. The insights gained from this unique structure-odor research led to the discovery of Amber Xtreme™, a uniquely powerful amber woody molecule. With expertise and perseverance, our chemists and process engineers developed a commercially viable process for Amber Xtreme™. A new star was born.

History[edit]
International Flavors & Fragrances was formed in 1958 by the merger between Polak & Schwarz (P&S) and van Ameringen-Haebler. Polak & Schwarz was founded in 1889 by Leopold Schwarz, who had an interest in spices, flavors and fragrances, and his brother-in-law, Joseph Polak in the small Dutch town of Zutphen. P&S quickly grew to 36 sites globally. Arnold Louis (A.L.) van Ameringen was hired by Polak & Schwarz to open P&S's US office in 1917 before losing his job with them. Relieved of his duties, he opened van Ameringen & Co. at 13 Gold Street in Manhattan, took over Morana, Inc. in 1920, and became van Ameringen-Haebler (VAH) in 1929. van Ameringen is credited with suggesting to bar soap and detergent manufacturers that they scent their products to boost sales.
The two companies did well through the bulk of the 20th century, despite difficulties for P&S during World War II. While both companies managed flavors and fragrances, Polak & Schwarz had particular strengths in flavors and van Ameringen-Haebler built a powerful reputation in fragrances. In 1958, the two companies announced their merger to become International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. IFF was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1964.
In 2000, IFF acquired Bush Boake Allen with its complementary products, technologies,and presence in key markets, making IFF the largest flavor and fragrance house in the world for several years. In 2014 IFF acquired Aromor.
IFF has creative, sales, and manufacturing facilities in 29 different countries and is a member of the S&P 500 Index. IFF is a $7 billion market capital company[5] with a global footprint that generated over 75 percent of its 2010 sales outside the United States and 45 percent in the emerging markets.
In 2016, IFF announced that it completed the acquisition of David Michael & Company of Philadelphia.
Controversy[edit]
IFF has been involved in several lawsuits relating to cases of bronchiolitis obliterans allegedly resulting from exposure to diacetyl in butter flavorings by workers at the Gilster-Mary Lee popcorn plant in Jasper, Missouri. The plaintiffs claim the manufacturers knew about the dangers of the butter flavoring used in the popcorn factory but failed to give a warning. The defendants said they were unaware of the risk and suggested there was not enough evidence to prove their product had caused the disease. Several suits have already been settled amounting to almost $53 million in damages.[6]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity.
