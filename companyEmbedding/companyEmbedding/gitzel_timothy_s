Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Cameco Corp. first quarter results conference call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Rachelle Girard, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Girard.
Rachelle Girard
Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Cameco's first quarter conference call to discuss the financial results. Thank you for joining us. With us today are 4 of Cameco's senior management team. They are Tim Gitzel, President and CEO; Bob Steane, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Grant Isaac, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Ken Seitz, Senior Vice President, Marketing and Business Development. Tim will begin with comments on Cameco's results for the first quarter and on current industry conditions. Then we'll open it up for your questions. Today's conference call is open to all members of the investment committee, including the media. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference call will include forward-looking information, which is based on a number of assumptions, and actual results could differ materially.
Please refer to our annual information form and MD&A for more information about the factors that could cause these different results and the assumptions we have made. With that, I will turn it over to Tim.
Timothy S. Gitzel
Well, thank you, Rachelle, and welcome to everyone who has joined us on the call today as we discuss Cameco's first quarter results.
I'm pleased to say that we had a good start to the year, continuing our strong financial and operational results from the fourth quarter of 2012. Most importantly, this was achieved safely and responsibly. Safety, of course, is always a top focus for us and is really key to our success as a company.
Revenue, gross profit and net earnings were all up significantly in Q1 of 2012 compared to Q1 of last year, primarily as a result of higher sales volumes and a higher realized uranium price.
We're seeing this increase in realized price occur even as spot and long-term prices have declined. Some of our older contracts that were signed at lower uranium prices are coming to an end and newer contracts are coming on. This has contributed to our strong financial results for the past few quarters, since 70% of our business comes from our Uranium segment. However, as we noted in the MD&A, our deliveries are not evenly distributed throughout the year. We expect deliveries to be the lowest in our second quarter.
Production was also strong this quarter, up 2% from this time last year. Our McArthur River operation is largely to thank for this increase as it was up 21% from Q1 of 2011, while production at Inkai and Smith Ranch-Highland was down. The challenge is that these 2 operations are the same as those that we outlined in our annual MD&A, but we are making progress.
At Inkai, our current wellfields are maturing, which leads to lower grades and therefore, lower production. However, this is expected with in-situ operations, and we're working hard to bring on additional wellfields in order to add new higher-grade wellfields to our production mix.

At Smith Ranch-Highland in Wyoming, our production has been affected by an increase in the timelines for regulatory approval of new wellfields. However, I'm pleased to report that we recently received approval for the new K-North wellfield, and production rates were starting to increase near the end of the first quarter.
We also saw a steady progress at Cigar Lake, which is now about 75% complete. Although the details are in our MD&A, but I'll just touch on a couple of developments. 
In January, we broke through with shaft 2 on the 480-meter level. It's expected to reach its final depth of 500 meters by mid-2012. And there's been enough infrastructure development that we're now at the point where we can start putting the jet boring system in place to begin underground testing. The first components are now on site, and as more arrive, we'll be lowering them into the mine and assembling the unit. So the progress at Cigar Lake has been excellent and we remain on-track for first packaged pounds next year.
In addition to the strong production and the progress at Cigar Lake, we're continuing to advance our projects under evaluation. Millennium project in Northern Saskatchewan is an important part of this strategy. The biggest news on that front is the agreement we announced in March to purchase AREVA's interest in the Millennium project. Our ownership of the project is now expected to increase to between 58% and 70%, depending on whether our Japanese partner, JCU Exploration, decides to exercise its right of first refusal. We expect to finalize these details and the agreement itself by early June. Cameco, as you all know, has operatorship of this important project.
Our Fuel Services facilities continue to operate well, and revenue from that segment was up $7 million over Q1 of 2011. With power, although our share of earnings for Q1 of 2012 was lower than Q1 of last year, our realized price was up and this continues to be a good source of cash flow for Cameco.
So overall, I'd say this was a good first quarter. We've made a lot of progress and are in line with our outlook for the year and are on track with our goal to increase annual uranium production to 40 million pounds. We believe it's important to pursue this goal of increased production now so that we're ready when the market begins to demand further supply.
Our view is that the question isn't if the market will call for more supply; the question is when. And while I don't have all the answers, I can provide some sense of what we see in the market. 
We know quite well what's happening with most nuclear programs around the world. Majority of countries with nuclear programs remain committed to having nuclear in their energy mix because it is a safe, clean, reliable and affordable energy option.  And others are joining the club. There are some exceptions like Germany, but we know that their phaseout will occur slowly over time. Big question mark is Japan. It has only one reactor running, which is expected to shut down for regular maintenance this month. A plan for the future has not yet been announced.
We believe that Japan's reactors will eventually be brought back online, not just because the country needs power and reliance on other energy sources is costly, but because we see the Japanese companies continuing to invest in uranium mining and exploration. For example, we have the Japanese as partners in our Cigar Lake and Kintyre projects, and they've been very clear that they remain committed to those projects. We see our Japanese partner in the Millennium project considering an increase to its equity position. And more recently, we've seen some Japanese utilities out in the market looking for nuclear fuel.
All of the signs seem to point to Japan eventually bringing reactors back online, which could be a major catalyst to helping the industry move out of the near-term uncertainty that we are currently in. As I've said in the past, the real story for nuclear isn't the near term, it's the long-term fundamentals of the industry, which remain very strong.

Our numbers show that 96 net new reactors are expected by 2021. 63 of those are under construction right now. Most significant are countries like South Korea, India, Russia and, of course, China, where we're seeing the most growth.
There's even growth in the United States, where the government recently granted the first licenses in 30 years for the construction and operation of new plants, 2 at the Vogtle side in Georgia and 2 at the VC Summer site in South Carolina. This is very good news for our industry and for Cameco. More reactors mean more demand for uranium. And with the end of the HEU agreement nearing in 2013, and some producers delaying and canceling projects that are no longer feasible, we believe the industry could face supply challenges in the not-too-distant future. That's why we're confident that Double U remains the right strategy for Cameco. We're confident in the future of the industry and in our own ability to successfully grow the company and build value for our shareholders.
So with that, we'd be pleased to answer any questions. Thank you.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Orest Wowkodaw from Canaccord Genuity.
Orest Wowkodaw - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division
Tim, in terms of meeting your goal at Double U, I think by 2018, when do you think you need to make development decisions on Millennium and Kintyre to meet that goal?
Timothy S. Gitzel
So let me just back up, just to touch and say that our Double U, of course, involves several different projects, including Cigar Lake, which is on track. And Cigar Lake is the foundation, really, that'll provide about half of what we are looking for. You've seen the charts that we've put in our annual MD&A with the different projects that we're pushing forward at different rates to accomplish the Double U. You mentioned Inkai. At Inkai we're progressing up the chain now. We're getting it to the 1,500 ton mark this year and looking to move up to 2,000 ton. And once we get approval, hopefully next year and going forward, and then we're still working with them on double-double, which is increasing production even further. So we're advancing that as quickly as we can, but it -- we are making progress with them. On the Kintyre project, we're just finalizing the feasibility study. Right now -- the pre-feasibility study, sorry. Right now, it's just getting the final touches put on it. Over the next, I would say, weeks and months, we have a process inside Cameco to take a close look at the pre-feasibility results and then decide what our next move is and so, we'll have some more information on that, I would say, at our second quarter but that one's moving along as well.
Orest Wowkodaw - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division
So would you hope to make a decision at Kintyre sort of sometime next year as of post-feasibility, I guess?
Timothy S. Gitzel
Yes, well, it's step by step. It has to go stage gate by stage gate for us, and so we'll look at the pre-feas, as I say, over the next weeks and months, and then the next step would be a feasibility study, which would take some time, you look at Bob, probably a year or so for the feasibility study and then we'd be at another stage gate, where we'd decide whether to move the project to development.
Orest Wowkodaw - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division
And how about Millenium? When can we anticipate that study and sort of development decision?
Timothy S. Gitzel
Yes, so Millennium will have the feasibility study this year some time. We've submitted some draft environmental assessment documents in, so we're moving that along. So again, we are partners, who are looking to close up the deal on Millennium with AREVA and the Japanese partners. We'll end up seeing what the different equity interests are, and then, I would say, toward the end of the year, we'll be in a better position to take a decision on going forward with Millennium.

Orest Wowkodaw - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division
Okay, and then just one further question on a different topic. Your comment suggests the Japanese are very much committed to nuclear. I'm just wondering if you could share any more color on the, I guess, the cancellation of the contract that you disclosed in your MD&A today, as sort of how we should reconcile that in our mind?
Timothy S. Gitzel
Well, you'll note that we didn't disclose where that contract was from. So you can make your own judgment on that. I would say, as we said in our MD&A, the Japanese continue to participate in the mining projects. TEPCO, which is our partner in Cigar Lake, continues to pay its share of the cost of construction, JCU and others, Mitsubishi. And so as I say, we believe that over time, they're going to bring the fleet back online. We know they have 2 units ready to go, waiting a final approval from one of the prefectures. So we're looking forward to them restarting that program.
Orest Wowkodaw - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division
Okay. So just to be clear, you're saying we should not necessarily assume that's a Japanese contract?
Timothy S. Gitzel
I'm saying, I just -- I'm sorry, I can tell you where that contract is from.
Operator
Your next question is from Greg Barnes from TD Securities.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities Equity Research
Tim or Ken, I guess. In the discussion around the uranium market, you say you see limited long-term contracting occurring. But in the trade press, Ux and TradeTech over the past several weeks, they've been talking about increasing interest in the long-term contracting market. I'm trying to reconcile the 2 views.
Timothy S. Gitzel
Ken?
Kenneth A. Seitz
Yes. So Greg, the way we would put it is, and we've been saying for time now that if we look to the long term, demand has been somewhat discretionary. And so the way that we're heavily committed for about the next 5 years while utilities have been well covered but we've also said that in the not-too-distant future, customers are going to have to come to start putting volumes under long-term contracts for that sort of period beyond 5 years, and that we expected that to start happening fairly soon. And so I would say that today, we don't see a huge amount of contracting in the long-term but it is, in fact, just starting to happen. And I think that's what makes our view consistent with Ux's. Just over the quarter now, we've had several requests for proposals come in to put volumes under long-term contracts. So we had -- demand had been discretionary. It's becoming less discretionary and we're seeing some customers come forward for long-term contracting.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities Equity Research
Regionally, where are those customers coming from, Ken?
Kenneth A. Seitz
In fact, there's some U.S. customers in there. There's some European. We're even entertaining one request from a Japanese utility. And so, fairly evenly distributed, I would say.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities Equity Research
What about China and India?
Kenneth A. Seitz
We know that the Indians are in the market looking for more material. Right now, Cameco doesn't sell uranium to India, but we're working on -- we have an office there and we're certainly working on putting uranium under longer-term contracts there. We were just -- Tim and I were just there and the goal is to go from 5 gigawatts to 63 gigawatts over the next 20 years. So the Indians will be in the market. And then the Chinese, were seeing some activity there as well.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities Equity Research
In the fair market, though, Ken?
Kenneth A. Seitz
That's right.
Operator
Our next question is from John Hughes from Desjardins Securities.
John Hughes - Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division
Just 2 quick ones. One, the $30 million for the charge in Q2, is that a before- or after-tax number?

Timothy S. Gitzel
Grant, I believe that's a pretax number?
Grant E. Isaac
That's a pretext number, yes.
John Hughes - Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division
Okay. So can we just use a set sort of 35% tax rate on that for after-tax?
Grant E. Isaac
No, this wouldn't fit into the larger conversation about our consolidated tax number. Of course, we do have a Cameco Group of Companies, and we sell our product through Cameco companies that are outside of Canada. So that would've be the right tax number. And the consolidated affect really is minimal. So, you saw a recovery in this period and we expect similar in quarter 2.
John Hughes - Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division
Okay, that helps. And then just looking at your sure share production forecast through to 2014, to the 24.8 million pounds, I'm wondering how variable that number may be in the year as the HEU contract falls away. And are we looking at plus or minus 5% to 10%? In other words, in the absence of that contract and that 24 million pounds, could we see an additional 10% type of thing in terms of your production in that year?
Timothy S. Gitzel
We don't have a whole lot of variability in production because of the -- some of the caps that are put on through the regulatory system. So we -- when we put these numbers out, they're what we believe is our very best estimate of what we can produce in any given year. You've seen us at McArthur Key have some flexibility to catch up on some new balance that were produced in past years. We're running out of those, I would say. So I would say there little's flexibility on those numbers.
John Hughes - Desjardins Securities Inc., Research Division
And last one, have you seen any over the quarter or so far in Q2, any sort of kickback on any inventory coming out of reactors or otherwise out of Japan?
Timothy S. Gitzel
I think we've been pretty clear stating that we went very quickly after March 11, 2011, to our customers and said that if we could be of assistance in managing their inventories, we'd be happy to do that. And so we have last year and this year had some deferrals from some of our customers, which we were happy to work with them on. And so we have not seen any major unloading of inventories into the market by any of the utilities. And as I say, we stand ready to work with any of our customers in that regard.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Anthony Young from Dahlman Rose.
Anthony Young - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division
In the last quarter, you guys indicated that there were about 19 million pounds of inventory that have been built up between Japan and Germany. Do you guys have any further color on where that inventory may stand today?
Timothy S. Gitzel
Not sure I know what you're referring to, Anthony, on those 19 million pounds of inventory. Ken, are you...
Kenneth A. Seitz
No, I don't. We haven't put out estimates of inventory or excess inventory holdings as a result of the event in Japan. I would also say that those numbers are actually changing on a daily basis, as well as the units in Japan come off and then come back on. I think we would just point back to Tim's earlier answer and that is, we haven't seen any of that material splashing around in the spot market, evidenced by the stability in the spot market to price. And so, again, just making prognostications about inventory levels, we haven't done that.
Anthony Young - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division
Okay. And then with respect to the chart that you guys have on Page 18, looking at it, it looks very similar to the chart that was produced in the fourth quarter with the cancellation of that contract. Has that already been factored in to this chart, or will there be some revisions in subsequent quarters?

Timothy S. Gitzel
Yes, I believe it's been factored in. Ken, do you have any further comments?
Kenneth A. Seitz
No. That's right, it's been factored into the latest table.
Operator
The next question is from Tyler Langton from JPMorgan.
Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Just with regard to the production in the first quarter was just a little bit lower than what you need on a -- sort of on a run rate basis to meet your full year guidance. Was that just a timing issue, or can you just give any more details around that?
Timothy S. Gitzel
You might be looking at our share of production. I think we were on track, McArthur, in fact, slightly ahead of budget. So not sure. Bob, any comment on that?
Robert A. Steane
No, I'm not sure where you're interpreting a lower production, but McArthur Key had a very good, very strong first quarter.
Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
I apologize. I could just be looking at the wrong number. And then like further out with the U.S. operations, is there any way to quantify just sort of getting the permits and -- if delays in that in the next couple of years or next year or so? Can you kind of quantify how much that could potentially sort of be at risk to production?
Timothy S. Gitzel
So we're working on a -- and as we said in the quarter and I think my comments earlier that we see some improvements. I think the regulators there are swamped or busy and were seeing it take us a lot longer to get the approvals we need to bring on new wellfields at are existing operations, and then some of our new projects, North Butte, Gas Hills, as well. So we're working very closely with the regulators, there's certainly more than one, and trying to facilitate their work. So we were just talking this morning about our guidance on production in the U.S. Nebraska happens to be doing quite well and are, indeed, on production and even a little bit more. Smith Ranch a little bit behind. We think overall our guidance is strong for the U.S. and we're certainly working hard to bring those new wellfields and new production centers online.
Operator
Your next question is from Borden Putnam from Mione Capital.
Borden Putnam
Tim, if I could direct you back to the reserve statement for a second, for you or Bob. At McArthur River, there were some pretty material upgrades. You had about 41 million pounds that went from inferred to indicated. And then also at probable, you had another 40-some million pounds that moved from probable to proven. Can you tell us how that was achieved? Was it additional drilling or by infrastructure reaching those areas? And where exactly do those increases reside? And then I have a follow-up.
Timothy S. Gitzel
Okay. I'll ask Bob Steane to answer that.
Robert A. Steane
That was a combination of both. There was some additional drilling that turns some of those indicated into inferred and increased the reserves, and also some of the development and some of the success we've had in working in different mining methods in the mine that have opened up some additional material for reserves.
Borden Putnam
Is that in the zone 4 or on zone 2, panel 5, Bob?
Robert A. Steane
A little bit of both. More on the lower zone 4.
Borden Putnam
Okay. And a follow-up on Inkai. The past 3 years, there's been sort of the reverse of fortune from what we just talked about at McArthur. There seems to be a material that's moving out of probable. And a couple of million pounds here and there and 10 million pounds in this last year and moving down to indicated. Does this relate to the wellfield issues you were talking about in your quarterly results, or is there something else going on? Because it's not adding to -- I mean, I know you do produce from probable at Inkai. But anyway, maybe you could explain a little bit more about that?

Timothy S. Gitzel
Yes, Borden, it's Tim. I think that has more to do with the term of the leases that we have there, and we're -- our experts here at Alain Mainville is currently -- are constantly looking at our reserve and resource base there and allocating them based on -- we have a term there, of course. One of the block's term expires, I believe, in 2024 and the other in 2030. And so we have significant reserves and resources, and we have to continually adjust those to the length of the leases we have. So that's why you're seeing some movement in those categories.
Operator
The next question is from Greg Barnes from TD Securities.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities Equity Research
Again, Tim and Ken, looking forward to 2014 when the HEU agreement expires -- well, I guess, the end of 2013, and you're beginning to ramp up Cigar, there's going to be a bit of a gap between those 2 events happening. Do you think you'll be able to maintain the 30-million- to 32-million-pound-a-year sales number? Will that mean more purchases in the spot market or the term market?
Timothy S. Gitzel
Yes, Greg, we do believe we will be able to maintain those numbers from several different sources. And I'll let Ken speak to those different sources.
Kenneth A. Seitz
Yes, sure, Greg. Yes, we do believe that we will continue to maintain guidance in that sort of 31 million to 33 million pounds through that period. We may have a few things at our disposal, of course, Cigar Lake starting in 2013 and ramping up is part of it. In addition to that, we have inventory at various facilities around the world that we utilize depending on where they sit, and then our sales targets and so on. We will continue to make purchases, but I'd like to stress that we'll never put ourselves in a position where we're forced to make a purchase. We make purchases when they make sense for us. But if we looked at all of that and just given our plans today, I know we expect to maintain sales guidance in that kind of range.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities Equity Research
But what do you think your purchase volumes will be over that 2014, 2016 range?
Kenneth A. Seitz
Probably -- we can't disclose that at the moment. I think there's some competitive information there, so rather not touch on exactly what our purchases would be to that period. We do plan to purchase some, again, never forced to go into the market.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Oscar Cabrera from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Oscar Cabrera - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
I'm going more or less in the same direction that Greg was going. But if I may ask the following: For your Kintyre and Millennium projects, I think in the previous conference call we talked about startups around 2015. Do you have a scoping study or an idea of how much production can come out of those 2 deposits?
Timothy S. Gitzel
Well, it'll depend, Oscar, on the results of the pre-feasibility study in one case and the feasibility in the other. And so yes, we have some ideas of what could come out of those projects, but I think it's a little bit early to say what the production levels would be. As I said, the Millennium feasibility study is just being finalized and we'll have that soon. We know it's about 60 million pounds there. And so we'll look at the optimized mining and milling rate for that in the feasibility study. And then Millennium, same thing, we're just waiting to get the pre-feasibility. Kintyre, the same thing, were waiting to get the pre-feasibility study for Kintyre, as I say, over the next 2 weeks and months, we'll look at the different mechanics of that and what would be the optimized production rate there. So we're -- a little bit early for us to comment on that, but we'll come forward with that information in the near term.

Oscar Cabrera - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
But I mean, do you believe or are you saying that you need these projects to come onstream before 2015 or around 2015?
Timothy S. Gitzel
Well, we need them -- they're part of our ramp-up to 40 million pounds by 2018. So I can't tell you exactly when they come on because we don't know, because there's a lot of work to do, environmental work, the feasibility engineering and then the construction and commissioning on all of them. So they're part of the ramp-up, that's why you've seen our colored chart, we call it our heat chart here, but our colored chart that show the different projects and when approximately we see them coming on. But we haven't been specific on that for good reasons because these projects are 5, 6, 7 to 10 years in the ramp-up and so we don't know the specifics exactly of when they'll start up, but they're in the period to 2018.
Operator
Your next question is from Brian MacArthur from UBS Securities.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
I just want to follow up. You made a comment about you've never put yourself at risk of buying -- having to buy pounds. When you go through that period where you're short of a little more material, you talked about getting inventories, when you make the statement that you're never forced to go and buy, is that meaning you have inventory to back everything you think through that period? Or does it mean you have interruption insurance, or whatever you phrase it, so that if you have production problems, you'd just be covered off at the end of the day?
Timothy S. Gitzel
Brian, since Ken made the comment, I'll let him answer it as well.
Kenneth A. Seitz
Yes. It means all of the above, really, Brian, and that is, as you know, we have our supply reduction language in all of our contracts that if we do have a production problem, we won't necessarily be forced to go to the market and buy. And so again, we're writing that in our contracts today. In terms of inventories, we hold about 6 months of forward sales in inventory, which at any given time, might be 15 million pounds of uranium. And so, again, we work very hard to not put ourselves in a position where we would be forced to go to the market, and I can say that when we say that, we mean it. We will -- we won't parse ourselves into that situation. 2014 -- 2015, 2014 bridge and to Greg's earlier question, again, Cigar Lake, we also have the increment from 500 tons from Inkai, Talvivaara, starting production in that period to the tune of 1 million pounds a year. And in fact, some extra HEU quantities at the end of 2013. And so you look at all that and, again, just to give you some comfort that we expect sales to be in the range that they are today.
Brian MacArthur - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
One other question, it's a little bit different. Just your wording on the uranium market, you talk about U.S. Department of Energy material being introduced to the market, I mean, I know there's theoretical LEU and stoppage [ph], should I read anything into that? Has anything changed from before that's not any HEU or pounds or anything new that you're seeing coming out of DOE?
Timothy S. Gitzel
Brian, that's a good question. That's a matter we're following really closely because it's a evolving topic down there with the current situation with USEC and what the DOE is going to do with that. And I know Ken's right up to date on that, too. So Ken, maybe you can just give an update on that matter. It's a good question.
Kenneth A. Seitz
It is a good question. And it's quite timely in that -- so the DOE has excess material. And we know that, and we know that plan to put it in the market. Then in 2008, they worked very hard with industry to drop a plan for that. And so they wouldn't put any more than 10% of U.S. requirements into the market in any given year, which equates to about 5 million pounds a year. So that's on the books and we've anticipated that for some time. There are discussions taking place in Washington today. We know that around USEC and the viability of USEC and their plants and certain parts of the U.S. where jobs are pretty important. And so it looks as though something may be evolving between some U.S. utilities, the U.S. Department of Energy and USEC, whereby Department of Energy would provide some higher assay tails to USEC for re-enrichment and those -- the natural uranium that comes out of that would go into inventories in some large U.S. utilities. So in terms of impact on the spot market or in the market, it's actually -- it's a fairly -- kind of a good news story and that we expect it will go into inventory. But I would say, Brian, to your question, it is material that would be over and above -- we think, over and above that industry consensus, again, at 10%. This could be 15% to 20% of U.S. requirement. So...

Operator
We have a follow-up question from Greg Barnes from TD Securities.
Greg Barnes - TD Securities Equity Research
Ken you said something about extra HEU quantities at the end of 2013. What did you mean by that?
Kenneth A. Seitz
Yes. Under the HEU agreement in 2013 and it's just given the way it's evolved over the last 10 years with respect to first and second options. Were getting a little additional HEU in 2013. This year, I think we've disclosed that it's about 7 million pounds, 6.8 million pounds. Next year, it'll be closer to about 9.7 million pounds. And that's -- that will be the year -- the quantity for the year and the final quantity.
Operator
That will conclude the questions from the telephone lines. I would now like to turn the meeting to Tim Gitzel for closing remarks.
Timothy S. Gitzel
Well, thank you, operator, and thank you to everyone who joined us on the call today. In closing, I would just add that even though we're in a period of uncertainty now, catalysts such as reactor restarts in Japan, China approving new builds again, or our utilities returning to the market could quickly change that. At Cameco, we're working hard to deliver consistent reliable results like we saw this quarter and prepare for the growth we see on the horizon for the industry.
So again, thank you for joining us, and have a great day.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Cameco Corporation Third Quarter Results Conference Call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Rachelle Girard, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Girard.
Rachelle Girard
Thank you, Donna, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Welcome to Cameco's third quarter conference call to discuss the financial results.
With us today on the call are Tim Gitzel, President and CEO; Grant Isaac, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Ken Seitz, our Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Bob Steane, our Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Alice Wong, our Senior Vice President and Chief Corporate Officer; and Sean Quinn, our Senior Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary.
Tim will begin with comments on the industry and the quarter. Then we'll open it up for your questions.
Today's conference call is open to all members of the investment community, including the media. [Operator Instructions]
Please note that this conference call will include forward-looking information, which is based on a number of assumptions, and actual results could differ materially. Please refer to our annual information form and MD&A for more information about the factors that could cause these different results and the assumptions we have made.
With that, I will turn it over to Tim.
Timothy Gitzel
Well thank you, Rachelle and welcome to everyone who has joined us on the call today to discuss Cameco's third quarter results. We appreciate you taking the time to join us.
I will start today by briefly discussing the market and our results and then I will open it up for your questions.
Our overall message remains the same. The market is challenging and our focus is to stay competitive and prepare for the time when more uranium production is needed.
From a market perspective, there was no fundamental change in the market this quarter. Utilities remain well covered. Supply continues to perform reasonably well and Japanese restarts, although progressing, have yet to materialize. We continue to believe that about two-thirds of the Japanese fleet will return to operation and there was good news on that front recently. On Tuesday, it was reported that the host town for the two Sendai reactors gave the go-ahead for restart, so we could see those reactors starting up in the near future.
Other Japanese reactors continue to edge closer to restart as well but it’s clear that this continues to be a challenging process. Of course, Japan isn’t the only factor to influence the market. Other issues can affect price which we saw recently when the spot price increase [ph] rose about 25%. We believe the move was largely due to trading activity and market speculation around unforeseen events like the potential of Russian sanctions, possible disruption in the US Department of Energy’s inventory dispositions and the labor disruption at our own McArthur River and Key Lake operations. We will have to wait and see if the increase is sustainable but it has remained relatively stable thus far.
Within this context, Cameco continued to achieve steady results. Consolidated revenue for the quarter and the year-to-date was comparable for the same period last year. However earnings were impacted by a write-down of our investment in Global Laser Enrichment and the higher cost of sales in our uranium segment.

And some of our market related contracts were affected by the lower uranium price compared to last year which brought our average realized price for the quarter down slightly. However, more importantly our year-to-date realized price results are comparable to the first nine months of last year and continue to outperform the market by a significant margin.
Turning to production, our operations performed well and the volumes are down slightly in McArthur River and Key Lake due to the labor disruption. As you know, in July, we stopped jet boring in Cigar Lake to let certain sections of the ore body to freeze more thoroughly. We resumed mining at Cigar Lake later in the quarter and with more ground now frozen and the available for mining, we have mitigated a possible risk to productivity and compliant for more continuous ramp-up. The timing of the pause was opportune as the McClean Lake mill was not yet ready to process the Cigar Lake order.
It is now, on October 8, we were delighted to take part in the McClean Lake mill restart celebrations where we marked the occasion of the first drums of packaged uranium from Cigar Lake. It was an important milestone and one we are all very happy to see.
There is still work to be done at both the mine and mill to increase annual production capacity to 18 million pounds by 2018, and that ramp-up will continue over the next few years.
For 2014, though, we are revising our annual outlook for production as a result of the experience gained in commissioning at the Cigar Lake mine and the McClean Lake mill, and the labor related shutdown at McArthur River/Key Lake. Previously we expected to produce between 22.8 million and 23.3 million pounds. We now expect to product between 22.6 million and 22.8 million pounds.
And there are a number of changes to our outlook for the remainder of 2014. In general, they are as a result of weak market conditions that have continued to impact the entire nuclear industry.
In our NUKEM segment, we’ve reduced our expected sales volume and revenue as today’s market does not provide a lot of motivation for more sales. That reduction is the main driver behind the expected decrease in our consolidated revenue. The good news is the outlook for sales volume and revenue in our uranium segment remains the same. And this is the core of our business.
So I hope that gives you a little more detail on where we are at this quarter and we’d certainly be happy to answer any questions you might have. And with that, I will turn it back to Donna.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator

(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Ben Isaacson from Scotiabank.
Ben Isaacson – Scotiabank
Hi, it’s Ben Isaacson here. Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions first, can you explain why funding was significantly reduced to GLE? And my second question is on the cash cost of purchased products, it’s been jumping around a little bit 58 to 31 now. Can you explain why that’s been happening and how should we think about it going forward?
Timothy Gitzel
Hi. It’s Tim. You have – just on the first one, the GLE piece. I think it’s a question of priorities for partner GE-Hitachi they have been in this business for sometime, we’re 24% in this joint venture and they have been funding along and we’ve had made progress, but I think in their bigger world this wasn’t a priority at this time. Certainly, the market is not brilliant either for uranium or for enrichment and they just decided to do a tone-down their funding and we obviously had to do the same. So that’s the GLE piece. I’ll let Grant Isaac to talk about our cash cost.
Grant Isaac
Sure, happy to do that, Ben. With respect to cash cost, I think you’re probably referring to a much higher unit cost number that you saw last quarter. That was the result largely on the sales agreement that we had agreed to at a much earlier time period. So we sourced the material and sold that when the uranium price was much higher, of course reflected in those cash costs. For this quarter, we didn’t have any of those kinds of legacy opportunities on the purchase side, but it will jump around especially as our purchasing has come down relative to stored volumes under the ATU program.

Ben Isaacson – Scotiabank
So when I look over the past couple of years you have averaged about $28-$29. Is that so going forward?
Grant Isaac
Well. We don’t have a forecast for that going forward. It will eventually get buried into our average unit cost of sales which is always going to be the marker we put out there to provide guidance and probably we would leave at that.
Ben Isaacson – Scotiabank
Okay. That’s great. I’ll jump back in the Q.
Timothy Gitzel
Thanks, Ben.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Gregg Barnes from TD Securities. Please go ahead.
Gregg Barnes – TD Securities
Yeah. Ken and Tim, just comment around the market when you say supply is readily available and it sounds like it’s adjusting market to surplus. Can you give us a sense how you big the surplus is by your estimate in the moment and what it looks like going forward over the next couple of years?
Timothy Gitzel
Well. Gregg, we think that the demand today and when we said it’s often in 100 million to 170 million upon range, we think increasing 3% to 4% over the next 10 years to somewhere 230-240 range. That’s good growth for us. We like that. That’s the 70 units that are under construction today and more to come 90 or 91 net new units in the next 10 years. That’s on the demand side.
Supply side, a little bit less than that, probably 150 to 160. We were just looking at the list this morning of some of the project deferrals now, cancellations, some of the production that has gone down, maybe not as much as we would have expected but the list is becoming quite significant. So we’ll see where things go, not easy decisions. We know to flex your production down. I think the market is coming back. In the near future you might hang in there. I think it’s longer term you might not. So it’s really a tricky period of time right now, but we think the gap today is perhaps 10 million pounds or 15 million pounds and growing over time as the demand line grows. I’m not sure you see the same with the supply side. In fact, it’s probably tripling off the other way. So that’s what we’re looking at going forward. How much inventory is out there, that’s the magic number. But everyone has their own views on. I’m not sure we have the exact number there either, but I think it’s diminishing over time.
Gregg Barnes – TD Securities
Tim, do you look at flexing your production in response to that curve market and what you think are going to happen over the next couple of years anyway?
Timothy Gitzel
Yeah, Gregg. We look at all of our operations all of the time and as you know we’ve got some producers that are in the lower core zone [ph], some that aren’t. So that’s a consideration we take. You’ve got the entire management team sitting around this table, we talk about that all the time. Right now, we have sales guidance, committed sales 31 million to 33 million pounds production, something less than that. And so we need the production, but I could tell you we look very seriously at our production all of the time and when we say we want to be able to flex our production, it’s both ways.
Gregg Barnes – TD Securities
Okay. Thank you.
Timothy Gitzel
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Brian MacArthur from UBS. Please go ahead.
Brian MacArthur – UBS
Hi, good morning. Probably it’s for Grant. Can you just clarify this for the tax regarding recovery of 40% to 45% of that? I mean I kind of get loss for all the ins and outs here. Is that including all of the adjustments you’ve had, i.e. the right demand [ph] GLE this year, so it’s like a boxing or is it actually what you call a 40% to 45% recovery on a true adjusted number if I want to look at that way?
Timothy Gitzel
Yeah. Look at it the later way. It’s the recovery based upon the adjusted. So you’ll see that we have – as a normal course to our adjustments we adjusted, for example, the benefit of derivatives and then we also adjusted on an income tax basis and so the same thing for our guidance with respect to our effective tax rate.

Brian MacArthur – UBS
So that’s increased quarter over quarter. Right? You’re going to recover more than you were before?
Timothy Gitzel
Yeah.
Brian MacArthur – UBS
And that is just – Can you go through exactly why that is given your mix stuff going before probably not as profitable for your purchase stuff as it used to be? So how that’s actually worked?
Grant Isaac
Well. We’ve spent some time in the past obviously on it, but let me just take a brief second. I’m happy to discuss it more offline. Our consolidated effective tax rate which is being reflected in that outlook number reflects the basis we do in multiple jurisdictions. One of the jurisdictions where we do a lot of business and spend a lot of money in is Canada and so you see a jurisdiction on the fact of lot of production in Canada, lots spending in Canada which carries with a balance of deductions if you will over the deductions available to any great payer in those jurisdictions and so as that balance changes over time and obviously we have less reliant on some foreign supplies notably the ATU material than you’ve seen in the past, that balance sheet of jurisdictions where we can probably take better advantages some of those deductions and you’re seeing that reflected in that forecast recovery.
Operator

Thank you. Our next question is from Edward Sterck from BMO. Please go ahead.
Edward Sterck – BMO
Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So I think I really got one such today which is just with regards to the future purchase commitments. In the MD&A, they are listed as being $1.6 billion over 2014 through 2019 and beyond, I think, out through 2028 in fact. I was just wondering that was the mix of uranium conversion services and also enrichment services and I was wondering what the split is between Cameco sort of in uranium division internal uranium purchase program and then NUKEM.
Timothy Gitzel
I’ll let the person responsible for those purchases. Ken Seitz, to answer that one.
Kenneth Seitz
Yeah. Well. With respect to our own mix of purchases between enrichment conversion and uranium, I think I would just say that you can assume that the absolute bulk of that is uranium and if you do a little bit math, you can probably see very quickly that the absolute tip in making some assumptions about prices and so on that you can see very quickly that the absolute bulk of it is purchases of uranium. Sometimes we will identify what we believe is really attractively quite uranium but it’s only available at UF6 and so we’ll sometimes take that as converted uranium as well.
With respect to the split between Cameco purchasing and NUKEM purchasing becomes a question of origination for one and both groups are going out and finding their own pockets to purchase. So we’ll make conscious decisions about who is doing how much of what and so we have training company to trade, buy ourselves uranium and we have Cameco that’s doing purchasing as you see in our disclosure overtime for one of other reasons.
Edward Sterck – BMO
Okay. Thank you. Just a sort of mend this down a bit that the 30 million pounds equivalent not really riding from 2014 through 2028, how much of that would be sort of within Cameco and Cameco’s uranium division and how much would be attributable to NUKEM?
Kenneth Seitz

That is all Cameco.
Edward Sterck – BMO

So NUKEM afford purchase agreement or commitment sales effort to that?
Kenneth Seitz
Um hmm.
Edward Sterck – BMO
Okay. Kenneth. Thank you very much indeed.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from [indiscernible] from [indiscernible]. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi. It’s [indiscernible] here. I’m just wondering if you look back on GLE and the right down this quarter in your investments, I’m just wondering if you reflect on this. Does it make you more cautious about investing outside your core businesses of mining uranium going forward or how do you think about this?

Timothy Gitzel
You know not, Rohr. I think that was an investment made probably back in 2008 or ’09, I think ‘08 when moving across with Sean Quinn. That still has some lacks in my view. We took the financial provision and accounting provision and needed to do that, but from a strategic point-of-view that technology I think the work we’ve done on that over the last few years we’ve made a lot of progress, progress to the extent that the DOE is even today talking to GE about perhaps going that sometime in the future and [reach tails] with the DOE. So that’s life.
In this market, today in 2008 we didn’t have to say foresee the Fukushima piece and the effect that would have. We’re living through that now. We’re 3 and half plus years into that, but I can tell you what we’re optimistic about the future especially on the uranium front and so investments in pieces like GLE, I think that these may come around again and we’ll get back to that again. So I don’t think -- we’re cautious obviously. You’re talking about the acquisitions of other sorts. We’ve made some ones that we’re very happy with. Right now, we’re not aggressive on that front, but we’re always keeping an eye on the market. So, no, I don’t think it changed our view.
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. And our next question is from Ben Isaacson from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Ben Isaacson – Scotiabank
Thank you. Just a couple of follow-up questions. First, can you explain the $150 million increase in provisions? You may please provide information.
Timothy Gitzel
Yeah. So we had a project underway to look at the clean-up of one of our ongoing facilities and that’s our Port Hope conversion facility and it’s part of our larger Port Hope area initiative of that clean-up that needs stability. And as we had done the work understand with those clean-up cost will be, we then reflect that in our asset retirement’s obligation. So largely what’s being reflected in that increase is enhance thinking on what the ARO is for Port Hope conversion facility.
Ben Isaacson – Scotiabank
Okay, that’s great. And then my last question is on cash outflow over the next couple of years. You have about $800 million in purchase commitments in ‘15-‘16 combined and then potentially another $400 million of outflow to the CRA. Can you first give a better split on what you think could happen in ‘15 versus ‘16 and then part B if that is other deductions and tax loss carried forward that you anticipate would be available to help offset the potential outflow to the CRA?
Timothy Gitzel
With respect to the CRA component, of course we’re in a process with them right now with dispute resolution and certainly something we would like to see move quicker, but it isn’t moving that quick and that actually prevents us from being able to be more clear on whether it’s a ‘15 or a ‘16 thing. Our view continues to be that our case is strong and we don’t view an adverse outcome, but we eventually have to get to core and it’s the delays that we’re seeing there to prevent us from giving little more clarity on like that outflow between ’15 and ’16 both way.
Ben Isaacson – Scotiabank
Okay. On the deductions of potential carry-forwards that could have offset some off that cash outflow?
Timothy Gitzel
Well, we applied those. It’s the reassessment comment and of course those are available after we’ve made in, for example, in capital deductions after we spend the money, we can access those deductions. So again it is dependent upon our economic activity and this jurisdiction in terms of what we can apply at that.
Ben Isaacson – Scotiabank
Okay, great. And then just on the split on the purchase commitment, if you have that available between ‘15 and ‘16?
Timothy Gitzel
Well. I don’t have that split before me. When you think about those purchase commitments, those will be commitments for where there probably is actually a contract to delivery into as well. So we’ll perhaps outline and get a little more color on what that split looks like for the purchase commitment portion.

Ben Isaacson – Scotiabank
That’s great. Thank you very much.
Timothy Gitzel
Thanks, Ben.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Oscar Cabrera from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Oscar Cabrera – Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you, operator. Good afternoon everyone. First of all, congratulations on getting the Cigar Lake project going. It’s been work of lot if you want to put in certain way. So a question with regards to realized prices and you’ve been as it’s hitting from your long-term contracts and there was a question with regards to – I think it was Greg that asked with regards to the marketing, how much inventory there are. You give us an idea just an approximation of how many of your competitors or what percentage of the market has long-term prices is benefiting from this? Because it just seems like one of the things that we notice that this spot market is not quite representative of the pain that some of these smaller producers might be feeling?
Timothy Gitzel
Oscar, thanks. It’s Tim. First he just said thanks for your comments on Cigar, lots of love in this room for Cigar. It’s been, I think, 30 some years, 33 years that ore body was discovered in ’81 and it hasn’t been worked on all the time, but certainly the last few years look over Bob Steane. Under Bob’s leadership, we’ve made great progress. And so this is an important month, the 8th of October for any of us who have been involved with the project for many years. It was a good day and so we really look forward to the future of that project. That is a good project and it will be a great piece in the chemical portfolio for many years. So, thanks for that comment and of that Kenneth may do the comment on second part.
Kenneth Seitz
Yes, absolutely, Oscar. Yeah, with respect to who among our competitors who would have a similar contract portfolio, I’m afraid probably I have to talk to them, but I think what I can say is of course we have seen some supply curtailment and I would offer that among our competitors who have shut in some supplies because of course they are exposed to having to sell in this bond market. So in another word without that contractual protection and it is the case that those competitors would also have a difficult time marrying on new long-term contracts that would get them the covers that they would need in the sort of near term and so are near to medium term I should say. So without knowing exactly what that mix looks like – of course we have a few other competitors who have some coverage but you certainly see some in the market at that moment that don’t.
Oscar Cabrera – Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Right. So if I may just add to that, in terms of your supply demand, when do you think requirements would be back to pre-Fukushima levels based on what you are seeing in the market right now in the activity?
Timothy Gitzel
Yeah. Of course the demand line is up and sloping to the right. I think it really becomes a question, Oscar, of inventory levels and how well covered utilities are today. So utilities that are consuming 170 million pounds would see that growing 4% a year. It becomes the question then of at what pace the utilities depleting inventories if they are, what is their coverage level looks like. And that’s where we come back to over the near to medium term with Japanese restarts and long-term contractings picking up again that we should see a price recovery, but today utilities are reasonably well covered with respect to inventories and so demand remains somewhat discretionary.
Oscar Cabrera – Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. And then if I may just add one more thing, in your comments on underfeeding and this has been over the last couple of quarters and it was one the industry research providers had given out estimates for the next couple of years where on looking it had come from like 3 million to 4 million pounds to over 50 million pounds. Just wondering if you can comment on that.

Timothy Gitzel
Yeah. It’s difficult to say. We have our own estimates and if you’re talking about western enrichers, it had a little more low in sight to that, but the total level of underfeeding – let’s talk about what the Russian enrichment fleet is doing and for a fleet that has historically operated at very low took-offs tells that it’s already – it’s difficult to say what you can classify is underfeeding in that part of the world. And so yeah today we would just say that there is quite bit of enricher underfeeding going on yet, probably somewhere between 5 million and 10 million pounds a year across of all the enrichment fleets and we expect in time if Japanese reactors restart, we expect that to trail-off.
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. And our next question is from Greg Barnes from TD Securities. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
This is Mark. Clarification for Greg. Could you say on your dispute resolution discussion with the CRA or is that still -
Timothy Gitzel
Sorry, just that word in a dispute with the map. They have issued us reassessments over the years of 309 [ph] and we’re going through the process which is in place with that. Process we are through is the tax course.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. So there is no discussion underway right now just to let it out of core?
Timothy Gitzel
I did not mean to suggest right and certain way of conversion with them as how you interpreted it.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Good. That’s been how I interpreted with. You cleared it up. Thanks. Great.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Edward Sterck from BMO. Please go ahead.
Edward Sterck – BMO
Thanks very much. Just a follow-up on the GLE history. Has they given any indication of when they might review the 2010 accounts?
Timothy Gitzel
Well. You recall that. Earlier in the year, we had talked about accelerated reassessment. In the past, we would have expected the 2009 reassessment to show off at the end of this year, but it showed up quite early with an indication that we would expect to receive 2010. That is still our thinking and it’s still our guidance and our disclosure, but as of yet we haven’t received it and have no information to say whether the likelihood has gone up or down. It’s just that our current disclosure is we think they’re on this accelerated path, but we just haven’t seen and it’s up again.
Edward Sterck – BMO
That’s great. Thank you very much indeed.
Timothy S. Gitzel
Thanks, Ed.
Operator
This concludes the questions from the telephone lines. I would like to turn the meeting back over to Mr. Tim Gitzel for his closing remarks. Please go ahead.
Timothy Gitzel
Well, thank you, operator. I think there is no question. I think the industry continues to endure some tough times and we at Cameco are not immune, but we are weathering the storm and we’re trying to do that by being as flexible, adaptive and efficient as possible and we remain confident in the future. There is a clear progression of growth from the 70 reactors under construction to date even more clamped by 2013 and even more outside that window. Today, we know there are billions of dollars being invested in nuclear around the world or countries like Japan. It’s vital to their economy and industries that one who remains cost competitive. China and other rapidly expanding economies is critical for meeting ever-increasing energy needs and tackling air quality issues. For the U.S. it’s important for energy security and for energy diversity. And for everyone it’s one of the most important tools we have to provide safe, clean, reliable and affordable base load energy and to combat climate change. So we at Cameco remain excited about the future and we are prepared as a company to meditate on. So, let me say to all of you, thank you for joining us and have a great day. Thank you.
