Dennis Howard Marks (13 August 1945 – 10 April 2016) was a Welsh drug smuggler and author who achieved notoriety as an international cannabis smuggler through high-profile court cases. At his peak he claimed to have been smuggling consignments of the drug as large as 30 tons,[1] and was connected with groups as diverse as the CIA, the IRA, MI6, and the Mafia. He was eventually convicted by the American Drug Enforcement Administration and handed a 25-year sentence to be served at Terre Haute; he was released in April 1995 after serving seven years. Though he had up to 43 different aliases, he became known as "Mr Nice" after he bought a passport from convicted murderer Donald Nice.[2] After his release from prison, he published a best-selling autobiography, Mr Nice, and campaigned publicly for changes in drugs legislation.

Early life and education[edit]
Marks was born in Kenfig Hill, near Bridgend, Wales, the son of Dennis Marks, a captain in the Merchant Navy, and Edna, a teacher.[3] Brought up as a Baptist, he later turned to Buddhism, though he did not become a devout follower.[4] He attended the Garw Grammar school in Pontycymer. He was a fluent Welsh speaker.[5]
He gained a place at Balliol College, Oxford, after he impressed Russell Meiggs in his interview,[6] and read physics there from 1964 to 1967. At the university he was first introduced to cannabis by Denys Irving.[7] After his friend Joshua Macmillan (son of Maurice Macmillan) died, Marks swore off ever getting involved with hard drugs.[8] Among his other friends at Balliol were the epidemiologist Julian Peto and the journalist Lynn Barber.[8] Through a mixture of cheating and last minute cramming, he passed his finals; this was despite months of taking drugs rather than attending classes and a serious infection he developed a few weeks before the exams.[9]
In 1967 he began teacher training, and married Ilze Kadegis, a Latvian student at St. Anne's College, Oxford, who was also training to become a teacher.[10] He gave up teacher training to continue his education at the University of London (1967–68; Grad. Inst P.), then back to Balliol, Oxford (1968–69; Dip HPh Sc), and then on to the University of Sussex (1969–70) to study philosophy of science.[11]
Drug empire[edit]
Though involved with drugs at university, he sold cannabis only to his friends or acquaintances until 1970, when he was persuaded to assist Graham Plinston, who had been arrested in Germany on drug trafficking charges.[12] Through Plinston he met Mohammed Durrani, a Pakistani hashish exporter who was a descendant of the Durranis who had run Afghanistan in the 19th century.[13] With Plinston behind bars, Durrani offered Marks the opportunity to sell the drug on a large scale in London, and he agreed to the proposition.[14] He formed a four-way partnership with Charlie Radcliffe, Charlie Weatherly and a dealer named Jarvis. Durrani never contacted them, and so the group acquired smaller quantities of hashish from various sources and began selling the drug on in Oxford, Brighton and London.[15] After six months he returned to Germany to help bail Plinston out of jail. Marks was a useful means of transferring money as he did not have a criminal record.[16]
Now a free man, Plinston gave Marks a job transporting hashish in Frankfurt; Marks in turn hired a New Zealand smuggler named Lang as his driver.[17] After paying Marks £5,000 for his work in Frankfurt, Plinston then sold hashish on to Marks and his three friends (Radcliffe, Weatherly and Jarvis) in London; in selling on 650 kilos within a week, the four men made a profit of £20,000.[18] Durrani then arranged for hashish to be smuggled in the furniture of Pakistani diplomats who were moving to London; Marks would then intercept the furniture to find the drugs – this arrangement netted him a profit of £7,500.[19] Marks expanded his enterprise, employing two friends from Wales, Mike Bell and David Thomas, to stash the drugs and help with transportation.[20] The gang became unsatisfied with the way the profits were being split (80% of the money they made went to Durrani) and contacted James McCann, a gunrunner for the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA).[21] Marks and Plinston persuaded McCann to smuggle hashish into Ireland from Kabul, which the pair would then ferry over to Wales and into England;[22] McCann would get the drugs into Ireland through the freeport at Shannon Airport using his IRA connections.[23] Marks avoided the attention of HM Revenue and Customs by creating a paper trail that indicated he made his money from selling stamps and dresses.[24]
By 1972, he was making £50,000 with each shipment.[25] By the end of the year he was approached by Hamilton McMillan of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), a friend from Oxford University, who recruited Marks to work for MI6 because of his connections in the hashish-producing countries of Lebanon, Pakistan and Afghanistan, for his ability to seduce women, and for his contacts with the IRA.[26] The next year, Marks began exporting cannabis to the United States to The Brotherhood of Eternal Love, hiding the drugs in the music equipment of fictional British pop groups that were supposed to be touring the country; he further expanded his operations with other smugglers and other methods of trafficking, often using his Oxford connections.[27] As McCann was in danger of being executed by the IRA should MI6 tip them off about his involvement in drugs, Marks then gave up the smuggling operation at Shannon airport.[28] Following the Littlejohn affair, MI6 ceased their relationship with Marks, while his American operation came to an end after police opened a speaker full of cannabis and arrested gang member James Gater, leading to other arrests in Europe.[29] Marks was arrested by Dutch police in 1973, but skipped bail in April 1974; the British press then made him a nationally known figure, reporting that he was feared abducted by the IRA for his connections with MI6.[30] With most of his fortune confiscated by the authorities, he made his way to Italy, where he lived in a Winnebago for three months before returning to England in secret in October 1974.[31] At this point he began a relationship with Judy Lane;[32] the couple married in 1980 and had three children together. He had previously been in a five-year relationship with Rosie Lewis, with whom he had a daughter.
Marks then connected Ernie Combs, member of The Brotherhood of Eternal Love, with John Denbigh, a man with connections in the hashish-producing nation of Nepal.[33] With the help of the Yakuza, large quantities of the drug would be exported to John F. Kennedy International Airport in the guise of air conditioning equipment, where Don Brown's mob (headed by Carmine Galante) would then take possession of the drugs.[34] A 500-kilo deal was set up and executed on 4 July 1975, leaving Marks a wealthy man.[35] Other deals up to 750 kilos followed, and Marks continued to live under assumed names in the United Kingdom.[35] In 1976 he travelled to America, and set up a 1,000-kilo deal between Combs and 'Lebanese Sam' – making himself £300,000 in the process;[36] he continued to regularly set up deals between his various American and Far East connections. In need of a new identity after his alias of Anthony Tunnicliffe was compromised in a police sting, in 1978 he bought Donald Nice's passport.[37]

"Between 1975 and 1978, twenty-four loads totalling 55,000 pounds of marijuana and hashish had been successfully imported through John F. Kennedy Airport, New York. They had involved the Mafia, the Yakuza, the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, the Thai army, the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Pakistani Armed Forces, Nepalese monks, and other individuals from all walks of life. The total profit made by all concerned was $48,000,000. They'd had a good run."
— Marks concluding the JFK episode of drug trafficking in his Mr Nice autobiography; the run had ended after the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) began intercepting the drugs and arresting Mafia associates in New York.[38]

In the late 1970s, the Trafficante crime family, under the leadership of Santo Trafficante, Jr., were importing Colombian cannabis into the US on freighter ships, thus driving down the price of the drug on the streets in America.[39] In December 1979, Trafficante exported 50 tons of cannabis direct from Colombia to Marks and his contacts in the UK, enough to supply the entire British market for the drug for almost a year.[40] In 1980, Marks was arrested by customs officers for his part in importing £15 million of cannabis; police had followed associates of the Trafficante family to a large stash of cannabis.[41] When arrested, he was in possession of numerous pieces of incriminating evidence, as well as £30,000 in cash.[42] Defended by Lord Hutchinson, Marks pleaded 'Not Guilty', concocting a story that he was an agent for MI6 (concealing the fact that his relation with MI6 ended in 1973) and the Mexican Secret Service that had set up an identity as a drug smuggler in order to close the net on James McCann (wanted in Britain for his IRA activities).[43] The jury found him innocent of drug smuggling, but guilty of using false passports and Marks was sentenced to two years imprisonment, but was released after five days having already served most of this time before sentencing was passed.[44] HM Customs then arrested him for his part of a 1973 smuggling operation but following a plea bargain and time off for remission he served just three months of a three-year sentence.[45]
Released in May 1982, though with most of his employees still in prison for the crime Marks was found innocent of, he spent the next year running a legitimate wine importing business but he continued to spend more money than he was making and the savings he made from drug smuggling in the 1970s began to dwindle.[46] In 1983, McCann was still at large and his smuggling enterprise was flourishing; he offered Marks the chance to sell 250 kilos of cannabis and Marks accepted.[47] Dutch police confiscated the full shipment and arrested Mickey Williams, a member of the London underworld who had agreed to help Marks on the deal.[48] Marks then travelled to the Far East to set up cannabis deals with Salim Malik, a Pakistani hashish exporter who he had met through Durrani (Durrani had since suffered a fatal heart attack) and Phil Sparrowhawk, an exporter from Bangkok; they would smuggle their product over to Ernie Combs in America.[49] He also arranged a 500-kilo deal with Mickey Williams, who had travelled to Bangkok after his release from prison in Amsterdam.[50] Marks laundered his money through various fronts: a travel agency, a paper mill, a wine importers, a bulk water transportation company and a secretarial service.[51]
In 1984, he was approached to sell $300,000 worth of cannabis to a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent looking to fund and arm the Mujahideen in their war against the Soviet occupation (Operation Cyclone).[52] The agent's contact on the APL ship suffered a heart attack and died on the journey to the US, leaving the drugs in the hands of US officials; the agent subsequently fled to Brazil to avoid prosecution.[53] Though under surveillance, Marks continued to expand his underworld operations and set up a massage parlour in a Bangkok hotel with the help of Phil Sparrowhawk and Lord Moynihan.[54] In 1986, he settled in Majorca,[55] and continued to make vast sums smuggling Salim Malik's hashish into America.[56] The DEA were meanwhile tapping Marks's phones and keeping him under surveillance and having arrested Ernie Combs they came close to busting a large shipment of cannabis, when Marks was tipped off; the ship was redirected to Mauritius and the operation aborted.[57] As he continued to avoid DEA stings he continued to make millions and continued to add to his underworld contacts, finding that he could use Chinese triads to launder his drug money more effectively.[58]

"A Philippine-brothel-owning member of the House of Lords [Moynihan] was staying at the house of a Spanish Chief Inspector of Police [Rafael Llofriu]. The Lord was being watched by an American CIA operative who was staying at the house of an English convicted sex offender [Jim Hobbs]. The CIA operative was sharing accommodation with an IRA terrorist [McCann]. The IRA terrorist was discussing a Moroccan hashish deal with a Georgian pilot of Colombia's Medellín Cartel. Organising these scenarios was an ex-MI6 agent [Marks], currently supervising the sale of thirty tons of Thai weed in Canada and at whose house could be found Pakistan's major supplier of hashish [Malik]. Attempting to understand the scenarios was a solitary DEA agent. The stage was set for something."
— The DEA's efforts to apprehend Marks were made extremely difficult thanks to the many wide-ranging contacts Marks had; in September 1987 many of these contacts were with Marks in Palma.[59]

When friends of his were busted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Marks decided to retire from drug smuggling to concentrate on his legitimate businesses; citing the fate of his friends and contacts, who were either in jail, informing the DEA or smuggling heavier drugs.[60] In 1988, DEA agent Craig Lovato arrested both Howard and Judy Marks and extradited the couple to the United States.[61] Arrests of those involved in Marks's various criminal activities were made in Britain, Spain, the Philippines, Thailand, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Switzerland, the United States and Canada.[62] This was the work of 'Operation Eclectic', set up in 1986 by both the DEA and Scotland Yard and aided by numerous law enforcement organisations from around the world.[63]
Trial and imprisonment[edit]
Marks was taken from Palma to Modelo prison in Barcelona,[64] and then to Alcala-Meco in Madrid.[65] There he was handed a 40-page document which detailed the allegations of his drug smuggling activities between 1970 and 1987, charging him with operating a racket as described in the RICO act.[66] In his autobiography, Marks stated that "although the charge against Judy and some others were absurd, the formal accusations against me, in general terms, were true."[67] The recently passed Sentencing Reform Act meant that he was facing a minimum of ten years to a maximum life sentence without the possibility for parole.[68] The Audiencia Nacional ordered his extradition to Florida.[69] After being shown the prosecution evidence against him, Marks attempted to construct the defence that his smuggling operations were directed to Australia and that he never exported to the United States, and therefore never broke US law.[70] He again cultivated the myth that he was a spy for MI6, and claimed that he was set up by the CIA because he had discovered that CIA agents were smuggling drugs into Australia.[71] He and his lawyers spent hours reviewing the phone tapping evidence to make the coded conversations about smuggling into America seem to suggest that the drugs were actually being smuggled into Australia; research was done into weather patterns to prove tentative links between what was said by Marks and his associates and what was happening at the time in Australia.[72] Marks and his wife were extradited in 1989, and he was given the Miranda rights on the flight from Spain to the US.[73]
In Florida, Judy pleaded guilty to her small part in the racket and was released, having already served some months in prison in Spain.[74] The money Marks made from his smuggling operations was spent on legal fees.[75] He refused to plea-bargain or to inform on his associates, gambling that he could again convince a jury that the authorities had got the wrong man.[76] As the trial began in July 1990, Peter Lane, his brother-in-law and fellow smuggler, wrote to Marks to inform him that he was going to testify against Marks in court to get a more lenient sentence himself.[77] Marks still was confident of beating the DEA in court, but Ernie Combs also agreed to testify for the prosecution so as to secure the release of his wife, and Marks had little choice but to change his plea to guilty to racketeering charges.[78] He was sentenced to 25 years in jail and given a $50,000 fine; though he had originally been sentenced to 15 years he was taken back into court after the judge realised he had misspoken and said that his 10 and 15-year sentences were to run consecutively and not, as he had originally stated, concurrently.[79]
He spent seven years imprisoned in the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute, Indiana, a rough prison. He had originally been sentenced to Butner, but agent Lovato insisted that he instead serve time at Terre Haute.[80] One of the six most secure prisons in the country, Terre Haute had the worst reputation of the six for gang rape and violence.[81] Despite this, Marks remained on good terms with the many violent inmates housed there as he was "British and a famous non-rat" and avoided conflict "by being nice, charming, and eccentric".[82] During his time there he befriended many notorious criminals and members of four of the reputed Five Families, including: Gennaro "Gerry Lang" Langella (Colombo crime family); James "Jimmy C" Coonan, John "Johnny Carnegs" Carneglia, Vittorio "Little Vic" Amuso, and Frank "Frankie Loc" LoCascio (Gambino crime family); Anthony "Bruno" Indelicato (Bonanno crime family); and Joey Testa (Lucchese crime family).[82] He also made friends with Veronza Bowers, Jr. (Black Panther Party) and 'Big Jim' of the Outlaw motorcycle club.[82]
Owing to his status as an Oxford University graduate with alleged connections to the British Secret Intelligence Service he was treated as a potential escapee and spent many weeks in solitary confinement, though he never attempted to escape or threatened other prisoners or prison staff.[83] During his time in prison he found success as a jailhouse lawyer for the other inmates, securing one overturned conviction.[84] He gave up cigarettes for the last three years of his sentence.[85] In January 1995, Marks was granted parole after a prison officer testified that he was a model prisoner who spent much of his time helping his fellow prisoners pass their GED exams.[86] He was released in April 1995.[87]
Life after release[edit]
Acting[edit]
He acted in gangster movie Killer Bitch (2010),[88] starred in the film I Know You Know (2009),[89] appeared as Satan in the 2006 movie adaptation of the Dirty Sanchez television series,[90] and had a cameo appearance in the film Human Traffic (1999).[91] He appeared as himself in AmStarDam (aka "Stoner Express") (2016).
Advocacy and politics[edit]
Marks stood for election to the UK Parliament in 1997, on the single issue of the legalisation of cannabis.[92] He contested four seats at once - Norwich South (against future Home Secretary Charles Clarke), Norwich North, Neath and Southampton Test - and picked up around 1% of the vote.[92] This led to the formation of the Legalise Cannabis Alliance (LCA) by Alun Buffry in 1999; the party reformed as Cannabis Law Reform in 2011.[93]
He also argued for the legalisation of cannabis in numerous television programmes in the United Kingdom. On 1 October 2010, he was interviewed on Ireland's The Late Late Show.[94]
Books[edit]
Following his release from prison, Marks published an autobiography, Mr Nice (1996), which has been translated into several languages.[95][96] He also compiled an anthology called The Howard Marks Book of Dope Stories (2001)[97] and more recently a follow-on from his autobiography: Señor Nice: Straight Life From Wales to South America.[98] Señor Nice differs from his previous book as drugs are not central to the story and, while autobiographical, the book is more Marks's own exploration of his ancestor, the pirate Sir Henry Morgan.[99] In 2011, he penned the thriller Sympathy for the Devil.
Marks held a series of book-readings into 2014. In these live events he regaled his audiences with tales of his smuggling days and his time in prison, as well as offered insight into drug production and the arguments for legalisation of cannabis.
Comics and videogame[edit]
Marks and comic writer Pat Mills collaborated on comic strips which tied in with Sony's inFamous 2 video game.[100]
Music[edit]

Dennis Howard Marks (13 August 1945 – 10 April 2016) was a Welsh drug smuggler and author who achieved notoriety as an international cannabis smuggler through high-profile court cases. At his peak he claimed to have been smuggling consignments of the drug as large as 30 tons,[1] and was connected with groups as diverse as the CIA, the IRA, MI6, and the Mafia. He was eventually convicted by the American Drug Enforcement Administration and handed a 25-year sentence to be served at Terre Haute; he was released in April 1995 after serving seven years. Though he had up to 43 different aliases, he became known as "Mr Nice" after he bought a passport from convicted murderer Donald Nice.[2] After his release from prison, he published a best-selling autobiography, Mr Nice, and campaigned publicly for changes in drugs legislation.

Early life and education[edit]
Marks was born in Kenfig Hill, near Bridgend, Wales, the son of Dennis Marks, a captain in the Merchant Navy, and Edna, a teacher.[3] Brought up as a Baptist, he later turned to Buddhism, though he did not become a devout follower.[4] He attended the Garw Grammar school in Pontycymer. He was a fluent Welsh speaker.[5]
He gained a place at Balliol College, Oxford, after he impressed Russell Meiggs in his interview,[6] and read physics there from 1964 to 1967. At the university he was first introduced to cannabis by Denys Irving.[7] After his friend Joshua Macmillan (son of Maurice Macmillan) died, Marks swore off ever getting involved with hard drugs.[8] Among his other friends at Balliol were the epidemiologist Julian Peto and the journalist Lynn Barber.[8] Through a mixture of cheating and last minute cramming, he passed his finals; this was despite months of taking drugs rather than attending classes and a serious infection he developed a few weeks before the exams.[9]
In 1967 he began teacher training, and married Ilze Kadegis, a Latvian student at St. Anne's College, Oxford, who was also training to become a teacher.[10] He gave up teacher training to continue his education at the University of London (1967–68; Grad. Inst P.), then back to Balliol, Oxford (1968–69; Dip HPh Sc), and then on to the University of Sussex (1969–70) to study philosophy of science.[11]
Drug empire[edit]
Though involved with drugs at university, he sold cannabis only to his friends or acquaintances until 1970, when he was persuaded to assist Graham Plinston, who had been arrested in Germany on drug trafficking charges.[12] Through Plinston he met Mohammed Durrani, a Pakistani hashish exporter who was a descendant of the Durranis who had run Afghanistan in the 19th century.[13] With Plinston behind bars, Durrani offered Marks the opportunity to sell the drug on a large scale in London, and he agreed to the proposition.[14] He formed a four-way partnership with Charlie Radcliffe, Charlie Weatherly and a dealer named Jarvis. Durrani never contacted them, and so the group acquired smaller quantities of hashish from various sources and began selling the drug on in Oxford, Brighton and London.[15] After six months he returned to Germany to help bail Plinston out of jail. Marks was a useful means of transferring money as he did not have a criminal record.[16]
Now a free man, Plinston gave Marks a job transporting hashish in Frankfurt; Marks in turn hired a New Zealand smuggler named Lang as his driver.[17] After paying Marks £5,000 for his work in Frankfurt, Plinston then sold hashish on to Marks and his three friends (Radcliffe, Weatherly and Jarvis) in London; in selling on 650 kilos within a week, the four men made a profit of £20,000.[18] Durrani then arranged for hashish to be smuggled in the furniture of Pakistani diplomats who were moving to London; Marks would then intercept the furniture to find the drugs – this arrangement netted him a profit of £7,500.[19] Marks expanded his enterprise, employing two friends from Wales, Mike Bell and David Thomas, to stash the drugs and help with transportation.[20] The gang became unsatisfied with the way the profits were being split (80% of the money they made went to Durrani) and contacted James McCann, a gunrunner for the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA).[21] Marks and Plinston persuaded McCann to smuggle hashish into Ireland from Kabul, which the pair would then ferry over to Wales and into England;[22] McCann would get the drugs into Ireland through the freeport at Shannon Airport using his IRA connections.[23] Marks avoided the attention of HM Revenue and Customs by creating a paper trail that indicated he made his money from selling stamps and dresses.[24]
By 1972, he was making £50,000 with each shipment.[25] By the end of the year he was approached by Hamilton McMillan of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), a friend from Oxford University, who recruited Marks to work for MI6 because of his connections in the hashish-producing countries of Lebanon, Pakistan and Afghanistan, for his ability to seduce women, and for his contacts with the IRA.[26] The next year, Marks began exporting cannabis to the United States to The Brotherhood of Eternal Love, hiding the drugs in the music equipment of fictional British pop groups that were supposed to be touring the country; he further expanded his operations with other smugglers and other methods of trafficking, often using his Oxford connections.[27] As McCann was in danger of being executed by the IRA should MI6 tip them off about his involvement in drugs, Marks then gave up the smuggling operation at Shannon airport.[28] Following the Littlejohn affair, MI6 ceased their relationship with Marks, while his American operation came to an end after police opened a speaker full of cannabis and arrested gang member James Gater, leading to other arrests in Europe.[29] Marks was arrested by Dutch police in 1973, but skipped bail in April 1974; the British press then made him a nationally known figure, reporting that he was feared abducted by the IRA for his connections with MI6.[30] With most of his fortune confiscated by the authorities, he made his way to Italy, where he lived in a Winnebago for three months before returning to England in secret in October 1974.[31] At this point he began a relationship with Judy Lane;[32] the couple married in 1980 and had three children together. He had previously been in a five-year relationship with Rosie Lewis, with whom he had a daughter.
Marks then connected Ernie Combs, member of The Brotherhood of Eternal Love, with John Denbigh, a man with connections in the hashish-producing nation of Nepal.[33] With the help of the Yakuza, large quantities of the drug would be exported to John F. Kennedy International Airport in the guise of air conditioning equipment, where Don Brown's mob (headed by Carmine Galante) would then take possession of the drugs.[34] A 500-kilo deal was set up and executed on 4 July 1975, leaving Marks a wealthy man.[35] Other deals up to 750 kilos followed, and Marks continued to live under assumed names in the United Kingdom.[35] In 1976 he travelled to America, and set up a 1,000-kilo deal between Combs and 'Lebanese Sam' – making himself £300,000 in the process;[36] he continued to regularly set up deals between his various American and Far East connections. In need of a new identity after his alias of Anthony Tunnicliffe was compromised in a police sting, in 1978 he bought Donald Nice's passport.[37]

"Between 1975 and 1978, twenty-four loads totalling 55,000 pounds of marijuana and hashish had been successfully imported through John F. Kennedy Airport, New York. They had involved the Mafia, the Yakuza, the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, the Thai army, the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Pakistani Armed Forces, Nepalese monks, and other individuals from all walks of life. The total profit made by all concerned was $48,000,000. They'd had a good run."
— Marks concluding the JFK episode of drug trafficking in his Mr Nice autobiography; the run had ended after the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) began intercepting the drugs and arresting Mafia associates in New York.[38]

In the late 1970s, the Trafficante crime family, under the leadership of Santo Trafficante, Jr., were importing Colombian cannabis into the US on freighter ships, thus driving down the price of the drug on the streets in America.[39] In December 1979, Trafficante exported 50 tons of cannabis direct from Colombia to Marks and his contacts in the UK, enough to supply the entire British market for the drug for almost a year.[40] In 1980, Marks was arrested by customs officers for his part in importing £15 million of cannabis; police had followed associates of the Trafficante family to a large stash of cannabis.[41] When arrested, he was in possession of numerous pieces of incriminating evidence, as well as £30,000 in cash.[42] Defended by Lord Hutchinson, Marks pleaded 'Not Guilty', concocting a story that he was an agent for MI6 (concealing the fact that his relation with MI6 ended in 1973) and the Mexican Secret Service that had set up an identity as a drug smuggler in order to close the net on James McCann (wanted in Britain for his IRA activities).[43] The jury found him innocent of drug smuggling, but guilty of using false passports and Marks was sentenced to two years imprisonment, but was released after five days having already served most of this time before sentencing was passed.[44] HM Customs then arrested him for his part of a 1973 smuggling operation but following a plea bargain and time off for remission he served just three months of a three-year sentence.[45]
Released in May 1982, though with most of his employees still in prison for the crime Marks was found innocent of, he spent the next year running a legitimate wine importing business but he continued to spend more money than he was making and the savings he made from drug smuggling in the 1970s began to dwindle.[46] In 1983, McCann was still at large and his smuggling enterprise was flourishing; he offered Marks the chance to sell 250 kilos of cannabis and Marks accepted.[47] Dutch police confiscated the full shipment and arrested Mickey Williams, a member of the London underworld who had agreed to help Marks on the deal.[48] Marks then travelled to the Far East to set up cannabis deals with Salim Malik, a Pakistani hashish exporter who he had met through Durrani (Durrani had since suffered a fatal heart attack) and Phil Sparrowhawk, an exporter from Bangkok; they would smuggle their product over to Ernie Combs in America.[49] He also arranged a 500-kilo deal with Mickey Williams, who had travelled to Bangkok after his release from prison in Amsterdam.[50] Marks laundered his money through various fronts: a travel agency, a paper mill, a wine importers, a bulk water transportation company and a secretarial service.[51]
In 1984, he was approached to sell $300,000 worth of cannabis to a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent looking to fund and arm the Mujahideen in their war against the Soviet occupation (Operation Cyclone).[52] The agent's contact on the APL ship suffered a heart attack and died on the journey to the US, leaving the drugs in the hands of US officials; the agent subsequently fled to Brazil to avoid prosecution.[53] Though under surveillance, Marks continued to expand his underworld operations and set up a massage parlour in a Bangkok hotel with the help of Phil Sparrowhawk and Lord Moynihan.[54] In 1986, he settled in Majorca,[55] and continued to make vast sums smuggling Salim Malik's hashish into America.[56] The DEA were meanwhile tapping Marks's phones and keeping him under surveillance and having arrested Ernie Combs they came close to busting a large shipment of cannabis, when Marks was tipped off; the ship was redirected to Mauritius and the operation aborted.[57] As he continued to avoid DEA stings he continued to make millions and continued to add to his underworld contacts, finding that he could use Chinese triads to launder his drug money more effectively.[58]

"A Philippine-brothel-owning member of the House of Lords [Moynihan] was staying at the house of a Spanish Chief Inspector of Police [Rafael Llofriu]. The Lord was being watched by an American CIA operative who was staying at the house of an English convicted sex offender [Jim Hobbs]. The CIA operative was sharing accommodation with an IRA terrorist [McCann]. The IRA terrorist was discussing a Moroccan hashish deal with a Georgian pilot of Colombia's Medellín Cartel. Organising these scenarios was an ex-MI6 agent [Marks], currently supervising the sale of thirty tons of Thai weed in Canada and at whose house could be found Pakistan's major supplier of hashish [Malik]. Attempting to understand the scenarios was a solitary DEA agent. The stage was set for something."
— The DEA's efforts to apprehend Marks were made extremely difficult thanks to the many wide-ranging contacts Marks had; in September 1987 many of these contacts were with Marks in Palma.[59]

When friends of his were busted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Marks decided to retire from drug smuggling to concentrate on his legitimate businesses; citing the fate of his friends and contacts, who were either in jail, informing the DEA or smuggling heavier drugs.[60] In 1988, DEA agent Craig Lovato arrested both Howard and Judy Marks and extradited the couple to the United States.[61] Arrests of those involved in Marks's various criminal activities were made in Britain, Spain, the Philippines, Thailand, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Switzerland, the United States and Canada.[62] This was the work of 'Operation Eclectic', set up in 1986 by both the DEA and Scotland Yard and aided by numerous law enforcement organisations from around the world.[63]
Trial and imprisonment[edit]
Marks was taken from Palma to Modelo prison in Barcelona,[64] and then to Alcala-Meco in Madrid.[65] There he was handed a 40-page document which detailed the allegations of his drug smuggling activities between 1970 and 1987, charging him with operating a racket as described in the RICO act.[66] In his autobiography, Marks stated that "although the charge against Judy and some others were absurd, the formal accusations against me, in general terms, were true."[67] The recently passed Sentencing Reform Act meant that he was facing a minimum of ten years to a maximum life sentence without the possibility for parole.[68] The Audiencia Nacional ordered his extradition to Florida.[69] After being shown the prosecution evidence against him, Marks attempted to construct the defence that his smuggling operations were directed to Australia and that he never exported to the United States, and therefore never broke US law.[70] He again cultivated the myth that he was a spy for MI6, and claimed that he was set up by the CIA because he had discovered that CIA agents were smuggling drugs into Australia.[71] He and his lawyers spent hours reviewing the phone tapping evidence to make the coded conversations about smuggling into America seem to suggest that the drugs were actually being smuggled into Australia; research was done into weather patterns to prove tentative links between what was said by Marks and his associates and what was happening at the time in Australia.[72] Marks and his wife were extradited in 1989, and he was given the Miranda rights on the flight from Spain to the US.[73]
In Florida, Judy pleaded guilty to her small part in the racket and was released, having already served some months in prison in Spain.[74] The money Marks made from his smuggling operations was spent on legal fees.[75] He refused to plea-bargain or to inform on his associates, gambling that he could again convince a jury that the authorities had got the wrong man.[76] As the trial began in July 1990, Peter Lane, his brother-in-law and fellow smuggler, wrote to Marks to inform him that he was going to testify against Marks in court to get a more lenient sentence himself.[77] Marks still was confident of beating the DEA in court, but Ernie Combs also agreed to testify for the prosecution so as to secure the release of his wife, and Marks had little choice but to change his plea to guilty to racketeering charges.[78] He was sentenced to 25 years in jail and given a $50,000 fine; though he had originally been sentenced to 15 years he was taken back into court after the judge realised he had misspoken and said that his 10 and 15-year sentences were to run consecutively and not, as he had originally stated, concurrently.[79]
He spent seven years imprisoned in the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute, Indiana, a rough prison. He had originally been sentenced to Butner, but agent Lovato insisted that he instead serve time at Terre Haute.[80] One of the six most secure prisons in the country, Terre Haute had the worst reputation of the six for gang rape and violence.[81] Despite this, Marks remained on good terms with the many violent inmates housed there as he was "British and a famous non-rat" and avoided conflict "by being nice, charming, and eccentric".[82] During his time there he befriended many notorious criminals and members of four of the reputed Five Families, including: Gennaro "Gerry Lang" Langella (Colombo crime family); James "Jimmy C" Coonan, John "Johnny Carnegs" Carneglia, Vittorio "Little Vic" Amuso, and Frank "Frankie Loc" LoCascio (Gambino crime family); Anthony "Bruno" Indelicato (Bonanno crime family); and Joey Testa (Lucchese crime family).[82] He also made friends with Veronza Bowers, Jr. (Black Panther Party) and 'Big Jim' of the Outlaw motorcycle club.[82]
Owing to his status as an Oxford University graduate with alleged connections to the British Secret Intelligence Service he was treated as a potential escapee and spent many weeks in solitary confinement, though he never attempted to escape or threatened other prisoners or prison staff.[83] During his time in prison he found success as a jailhouse lawyer for the other inmates, securing one overturned conviction.[84] He gave up cigarettes for the last three years of his sentence.[85] In January 1995, Marks was granted parole after a prison officer testified that he was a model prisoner who spent much of his time helping his fellow prisoners pass their GED exams.[86] He was released in April 1995.[87]
Life after release[edit]
Acting[edit]
He acted in gangster movie Killer Bitch (2010),[88] starred in the film I Know You Know (2009),[89] appeared as Satan in the 2006 movie adaptation of the Dirty Sanchez television series,[90] and had a cameo appearance in the film Human Traffic (1999).[91] He appeared as himself in AmStarDam (aka "Stoner Express") (2016).
Advocacy and politics[edit]
Marks stood for election to the UK Parliament in 1997, on the single issue of the legalisation of cannabis.[92] He contested four seats at once - Norwich South (against future Home Secretary Charles Clarke), Norwich North, Neath and Southampton Test - and picked up around 1% of the vote.[92] This led to the formation of the Legalise Cannabis Alliance (LCA) by Alun Buffry in 1999; the party reformed as Cannabis Law Reform in 2011.[93]
He also argued for the legalisation of cannabis in numerous television programmes in the United Kingdom. On 1 October 2010, he was interviewed on Ireland's The Late Late Show.[94]
Books[edit]
Following his release from prison, Marks published an autobiography, Mr Nice (1996), which has been translated into several languages.[95][96] He also compiled an anthology called The Howard Marks Book of Dope Stories (2001)[97] and more recently a follow-on from his autobiography: Señor Nice: Straight Life From Wales to South America.[98] Señor Nice differs from his previous book as drugs are not central to the story and, while autobiographical, the book is more Marks's own exploration of his ancestor, the pirate Sir Henry Morgan.[99] In 2011, he penned the thriller Sympathy for the Devil.
Marks held a series of book-readings into 2014. In these live events he regaled his audiences with tales of his smuggling days and his time in prison, as well as offered insight into drug production and the arguments for legalisation of cannabis.
Comics and videogame[edit]
Marks and comic writer Pat Mills collaborated on comic strips which tied in with Sony's inFamous 2 video game.[100]
Music[edit]
In the music world, he appeared as a guest on the BBC music quiz show Never Mind the Buzzcocks.[101] He also collaborated with Welsh group Super Furry Animals on their album Fuzzy Logic (released May 1996) and on their singles "The Man Don't Give a Fuck" and "Ice Hockey Hair".[102] He featured on the album Angel Headed Hip Hop (2009) with Lee Harris and River Styx.[103] He also worked with former Happy Mondays guitarist Kav Sandhu,[104] and appeared at numerous British music festivals, including: (Glastonbury 2009 and 2011),[105] Beautiful Days,[106] RockNess,[107] Camp Bestival,[108] Kendal Calling,[109] and the Sonisphere Festival.[110] He was featured on the Reverend & The Makers track "MDMAzing" on their third album @Reverend Makers (2012).
Works about Marks[edit]
Marks was the subject of the biography High Time (1984) written by David Leigh.
Marks was also the subject of the film Mr. Nice (2010), named after his eponymous 1997 autobiography.[111] The film featured Rhys Ifans as Marks and Chloë Sevigny as his wife Judy.[112]
In 2013, Marks recounted his story in an episode of the television series Banged Up Abroad.
Death[edit]
On 25 January 2015, it was announced that Marks had inoperable colorectal cancer.[113] He died of the disease on 10 April 2016, at the age of 70.[114]

Dennis Howard Marks (13 August 1945 – 10 April 2016) was a Welsh drug smuggler and author who achieved notoriety as an international cannabis smuggler through high-profile court cases. At his peak he claimed to have been smuggling consignments of the drug as large as 30 tons,[1] and was connected with groups as diverse as the CIA, the IRA, MI6, and the Mafia. He was eventually convicted by the American Drug Enforcement Administration and handed a 25-year sentence to be served at Terre Haute; he was released in April 1995 after serving seven years. Though he had up to 43 different aliases, he became known as "Mr Nice" after he bought a passport from convicted murderer Donald Nice.[2] After his release from prison, he published a best-selling autobiography, Mr Nice, and campaigned publicly for changes in drugs legislation.

Early life and education[edit]
Marks was born in Kenfig Hill, near Bridgend, Wales, the son of Dennis Marks, a captain in the Merchant Navy, and Edna, a teacher.[3] Brought up as a Baptist, he later turned to Buddhism, though he did not become a devout follower.[4] He attended the Garw Grammar school in Pontycymer. He was a fluent Welsh speaker.[5]
He gained a place at Balliol College, Oxford, after he impressed Russell Meiggs in his interview,[6] and read physics there from 1964 to 1967. At the university he was first introduced to cannabis by Denys Irving.[7] After his friend Joshua Macmillan (son of Maurice Macmillan) died, Marks swore off ever getting involved with hard drugs.[8] Among his other friends at Balliol were the epidemiologist Julian Peto and the journalist Lynn Barber.[8] Through a mixture of cheating and last minute cramming, he passed his finals; this was despite months of taking drugs rather than attending classes and a serious infection he developed a few weeks before the exams.[9]
In 1967 he began teacher training, and married Ilze Kadegis, a Latvian student at St. Anne's College, Oxford, who was also training to become a teacher.[10] He gave up teacher training to continue his education at the University of London (1967–68; Grad. Inst P.), then back to Balliol, Oxford (1968–69; Dip HPh Sc), and then on to the University of Sussex (1969–70) to study philosophy of science.[11]
Drug empire[edit]
Though involved with drugs at university, he sold cannabis only to his friends or acquaintances until 1970, when he was persuaded to assist Graham Plinston, who had been arrested in Germany on drug trafficking charges.[12] Through Plinston he met Mohammed Durrani, a Pakistani hashish exporter who was a descendant of the Durranis who had run Afghanistan in the 19th century.[13] With Plinston behind bars, Durrani offered Marks the opportunity to sell the drug on a large scale in London, and he agreed to the proposition.[14] He formed a four-way partnership with Charlie Radcliffe, Charlie Weatherly and a dealer named Jarvis. Durrani never contacted them, and so the group acquired smaller quantities of hashish from various sources and began selling the drug on in Oxford, Brighton and London.[15] After six months he returned to Germany to help bail Plinston out of jail. Marks was a useful means of transferring money as he did not have a criminal record.[16]
Now a free man, Plinston gave Marks a job transporting hashish in Frankfurt; Marks in turn hired a New Zealand smuggler named Lang as his driver.[17] After paying Marks £5,000 for his work in Frankfurt, Plinston then sold hashish on to Marks and his three friends (Radcliffe, Weatherly and Jarvis) in London; in selling on 650 kilos within a week, the four men made a profit of £20,000.[18] Durrani then arranged for hashish to be smuggled in the furniture of Pakistani diplomats who were moving to London; Marks would then intercept the furniture to find the drugs – this arrangement netted him a profit of £7,500.[19] Marks expanded his enterprise, employing two friends from Wales, Mike Bell and David Thomas, to stash the drugs and help with transportation.[20] The gang became unsatisfied with the way the profits were being split (80% of the money they made went to Durrani) and contacted James McCann, a gunrunner for the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA).[21] Marks and Plinston persuaded McCann to smuggle hashish into Ireland from Kabul, which the pair would then ferry over to Wales and into England;[22] McCann would get the drugs into Ireland through the freeport at Shannon Airport using his IRA connections.[23] Marks avoided the attention of HM Revenue and Customs by creating a paper trail that indicated he made his money from selling stamps and dresses.[24]
By 1972, he was making £50,000 with each shipment.[25] By the end of the year he was approached by Hamilton McMillan of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), a friend from Oxford University, who recruited Marks to work for MI6 because of his connections in the hashish-producing countries of Lebanon, Pakistan and Afghanistan, for his ability to seduce women, and for his contacts with the IRA.[26] The next year, Marks began exporting cannabis to the United States to The Brotherhood of Eternal Love, hiding the drugs in the music equipment of fictional British pop groups that were supposed to be touring the country; he further expanded his operations with other smugglers and other methods of trafficking, often using his Oxford connections.[27] As McCann was in danger of being executed by the IRA should MI6 tip them off about his involvement in drugs, Marks then gave up the smuggling operation at Shannon airport.[28] Following the Littlejohn affair, MI6 ceased their relationship with Marks, while his American operation came to an end after police opened a speaker full of cannabis and arrested gang member James Gater, leading to other arrests in Europe.[29] Marks was arrested by Dutch police in 1973, but skipped bail in April 1974; the British press then made him a nationally known figure, reporting that he was feared abducted by the IRA for his connections with MI6.[30] With most of his fortune confiscated by the authorities, he made his way to Italy, where he lived in a Winnebago for three months before returning to England in secret in October 1974.[31] At this point he began a relationship with Judy Lane;[32] the couple married in 1980 and had three children together. He had previously been in a five-year relationship with Rosie Lewis, with whom he had a daughter.
Marks then connected Ernie Combs, member of The Brotherhood of Eternal Love, with John Denbigh, a man with connections in the hashish-producing nation of Nepal.[33] With the help of the Yakuza, large quantities of the drug would be exported to John F. Kennedy International Airport in the guise of air conditioning equipment, where Don Brown's mob (headed by Carmine Galante) would then take possession of the drugs.[34] A 500-kilo deal was set up and executed on 4 July 1975, leaving Marks a wealthy man.[35] Other deals up to 750 kilos followed, and Marks continued to live under assumed names in the United Kingdom.[35] In 1976 he travelled to America, and set up a 1,000-kilo deal between Combs and 'Lebanese Sam' – making himself £300,000 in the process;[36] he continued to regularly set up deals between his various American and Far East connections. In need of a new identity after his alias of Anthony Tunnicliffe was compromised in a police sting, in 1978 he bought Donald Nice's passport.[37]

"Between 1975 and 1978, twenty-four loads totalling 55,000 pounds of marijuana and hashish had been successfully imported through John F. Kennedy Airport, New York. They had involved the Mafia, the Yakuza, the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, the Thai army, the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Pakistani Armed Forces, Nepalese monks, and other individuals from all walks of life. The total profit made by all concerned was $48,000,000. They'd had a good run."
— Marks concluding the JFK episode of drug trafficking in his Mr Nice autobiography; the run had ended after the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) began intercepting the drugs and arresting Mafia associates in New York.[38]

In the late 1970s, the Trafficante crime family, under the leadership of Santo Trafficante, Jr., were importing Colombian cannabis into the US on freighter ships, thus driving down the price of the drug on the streets in America.[39] In December 1979, Trafficante exported 50 tons of cannabis direct from Colombia to Marks and his contacts in the UK, enough to supply the entire British market for the drug for almost a year.[40] In 1980, Marks was arrested by customs officers for his part in importing £15 million of cannabis; police had followed associates of the Trafficante family to a large stash of cannabis.[41] When arrested, he was in possession of numerous pieces of incriminating evidence, as well as £30,000 in cash.[42] Defended by Lord Hutchinson, Marks pleaded 'Not Guilty', concocting a story that he was an agent for MI6 (concealing the fact that his relation with MI6 ended in 1973) and the Mexican Secret Service that had set up an identity as a drug smuggler in order to close the net on James McCann (wanted in Britain for his IRA activities).[43] The jury found him innocent of drug smuggling, but guilty of using false passports and Marks was sentenced to two years imprisonment, but was released after five days having already served most of this time before sentencing was passed.[44] HM Customs then arrested him for his part of a 1973 smuggling operation but following a plea bargain and time off for remission he served just three months of a three-year sentence.[45]
Released in May 1982, though with most of his employees still in prison for the crime Marks was found innocent of, he spent the next year running a legitimate wine importing business but he continued to spend more money than he was making and the savings he made from drug smuggling in the 1970s began to dwindle.[46] In 1983, McCann was still at large and his smuggling enterprise was flourishing; he offered Marks the chance to sell 250 kilos of cannabis and Marks accepted.[47] Dutch police confiscated the full shipment and arrested Mickey Williams, a member of the London underworld who had agreed to help Marks on the deal.[48] Marks then travelled to the Far East to set up cannabis deals with Salim Malik, a Pakistani hashish exporter who he had met through Durrani (Durrani had since suffered a fatal heart attack) and Phil Sparrowhawk, an exporter from Bangkok; they would smuggle their product over to Ernie Combs in America.[49] He also arranged a 500-kilo deal with Mickey Williams, who had travelled to Bangkok after his release from prison in Amsterdam.[50] Marks laundered his money through various fronts: a travel agency, a paper mill, a wine importers, a bulk water transportation company and a secretarial service.[51]
In 1984, he was approached to sell $300,000 worth of cannabis to a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent looking to fund and arm the Mujahideen in their war against the Soviet occupation (Operation Cyclone).[52] The agent's contact on the APL ship suffered a heart attack and died on the journey to the US, leaving the drugs in the hands of US officials; the agent subsequently fled to Brazil to avoid prosecution.[53] Though under surveillance, Marks continued to expand his underworld operations and set up a massage parlour in a Bangkok hotel with the help of Phil Sparrowhawk and Lord Moynihan.[54] In 1986, he settled in Majorca,[55] and continued to make vast sums smuggling Salim Malik's hashish into America.[56] The DEA were meanwhile tapping Marks's phones and keeping him under surveillance and having arrested Ernie Combs they came close to busting a large shipment of cannabis, when Marks was tipped off; the ship was redirected to Mauritius and the operation aborted.[57] As he continued to avoid DEA stings he continued to make millions and continued to add to his underworld contacts, finding that he could use Chinese triads to launder his drug money more effectively.[58]

"A Philippine-brothel-owning member of the House of Lords [Moynihan] was staying at the house of a Spanish Chief Inspector of Police [Rafael Llofriu]. The Lord was being watched by an American CIA operative who was staying at the house of an English convicted sex offender [Jim Hobbs]. The CIA operative was sharing accommodation with an IRA terrorist [McCann]. The IRA terrorist was discussing a Moroccan hashish deal with a Georgian pilot of Colombia's Medellín Cartel. Organising these scenarios was an ex-MI6 agent [Marks], currently supervising the sale of thirty tons of Thai weed in Canada and at whose house could be found Pakistan's major supplier of hashish [Malik]. Attempting to understand the scenarios was a solitary DEA agent. The stage was set for something."
— The DEA's efforts to apprehend Marks were made extremely difficult thanks to the many wide-ranging contacts Marks had; in September 1987 many of these contacts were with Marks in Palma.[59]

When friends of his were busted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Marks decided to retire from drug smuggling to concentrate on his legitimate businesses; citing the fate of his friends and contacts, who were either in jail, informing the DEA or smuggling heavier drugs.[60] In 1988, DEA agent Craig Lovato arrested both Howard and Judy Marks and extradited the couple to the United States.[61] Arrests of those involved in Marks's various criminal activities were made in Britain, Spain, the Philippines, Thailand, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Switzerland, the United States and Canada.[62] This was the work of 'Operation Eclectic', set up in 1986 by both the DEA and Scotland Yard and aided by numerous law enforcement organisations from around the world.[63]
Trial and imprisonment[edit]
Marks was taken from Palma to Modelo prison in Barcelona,[64] and then to Alcala-Meco in Madrid.[65] There he was handed a 40-page document which detailed the allegations of his drug smuggling activities between 1970 and 1987, charging him with operating a racket as described in the RICO act.[66] In his autobiography, Marks stated that "although the charge against Judy and some others were absurd, the formal accusations against me, in general terms, were true."[67] The recently passed Sentencing Reform Act meant that he was facing a minimum of ten years to a maximum life sentence without the possibility for parole.[68] The Audiencia Nacional ordered his extradition to Florida.[69] After being shown the prosecution evidence against him, Marks attempted to construct the defence that his smuggling operations were directed to Australia and that he never exported to the United States, and therefore never broke US law.[70] He again cultivated the myth that he was a spy for MI6, and claimed that he was set up by the CIA because he had discovered that CIA agents were smuggling drugs into Australia.[71] He and his lawyers spent hours reviewing the phone tapping evidence to make the coded conversations about smuggling into America seem to suggest that the drugs were actually being smuggled into Australia; research was done into weather patterns to prove tentative links between what was said by Marks and his associates and what was happening at the time in Australia.[72] Marks and his wife were extradited in 1989, and he was given the Miranda rights on the flight from Spain to the US.[73]
In Florida, Judy pleaded guilty to her small part in the racket and was released, having already served some months in prison in Spain.[74] The money Marks made from his smuggling operations was spent on legal fees.[75] He refused to plea-bargain or to inform on his associates, gambling that he could again convince a jury that the authorities had got the wrong man.[76] As the trial began in July 1990, Peter Lane, his brother-in-law and fellow smuggler, wrote to Marks to inform him that he was going to testify against Marks in court to get a more lenient sentence himself.[77] Marks still was confident of beating the DEA in court, but Ernie Combs also agreed to testify for the prosecution so as to secure the release of his wife, and Marks had little choice but to change his plea to guilty to racketeering charges.[78] He was sentenced to 25 years in jail and given a $50,000 fine; though he had originally been sentenced to 15 years he was taken back into court after the judge realised he had misspoken and said that his 10 and 15-year sentences were to run consecutively and not, as he had originally stated, concurrently.[79]
He spent seven years imprisoned in the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute, Indiana, a rough prison. He had originally been sentenced to Butner, but agent Lovato insisted that he instead serve time at Terre Haute.[80] One of the six most secure prisons in the country, Terre Haute had the worst reputation of the six for gang rape and violence.[81] Despite this, Marks remained on good terms with the many violent inmates housed there as he was "British and a famous non-rat" and avoided conflict "by being nice, charming, and eccentric".[82] During his time there he befriended many notorious criminals and members of four of the reputed Five Families, including: Gennaro "Gerry Lang" Langella (Colombo crime family); James "Jimmy C" Coonan, John "Johnny Carnegs" Carneglia, Vittorio "Little Vic" Amuso, and Frank "Frankie Loc" LoCascio (Gambino crime family); Anthony "Bruno" Indelicato (Bonanno crime family); and Joey Testa (Lucchese crime family).[82] He also made friends with Veronza Bowers, Jr. (Black Panther Party) and 'Big Jim' of the Outlaw motorcycle club.[82]
Owing to his status as an Oxford University graduate with alleged connections to the British Secret Intelligence Service he was treated as a potential escapee and spent many weeks in solitary confinement, though he never attempted to escape or threatened other prisoners or prison staff.[83] During his time in prison he found success as a jailhouse lawyer for the other inmates, securing one overturned conviction.[84] He gave up cigarettes for the last three years of his sentence.[85] In January 1995, Marks was granted parole after a prison officer testified that he was a model prisoner who spent much of his time helping his fellow prisoners pass their GED exams.[86] He was released in April 1995.[87]
Life after release[edit]
Acting[edit]
He acted in gangster movie Killer Bitch (2010),[88] starred in the film I Know You Know (2009),[89] appeared as Satan in the 2006 movie adaptation of the Dirty Sanchez television series,[90] and had a cameo appearance in the film Human Traffic (1999).[91] He appeared as himself in AmStarDam (aka "Stoner Express") (2016).
Advocacy and politics[edit]
Marks stood for election to the UK Parliament in 1997, on the single issue of the legalisation of cannabis.[92] He contested four seats at once - Norwich South (against future Home Secretary Charles Clarke), Norwich North, Neath and Southampton Test - and picked up around 1% of the vote.[92] This led to the formation of the Legalise Cannabis Alliance (LCA) by Alun Buffry in 1999; the party reformed as Cannabis Law Reform in 2011.[93]
He also argued for the legalisation of cannabis in numerous television programmes in the United Kingdom. On 1 October 2010, he was interviewed on Ireland's The Late Late Show.[94]
Books[edit]
Following his release from prison, Marks published an autobiography, Mr Nice (1996), which has been translated into several languages.[95][96] He also compiled an anthology called The Howard Marks Book of Dope Stories (2001)[97] and more recently a follow-on from his autobiography: Señor Nice: Straight Life From Wales to South America.[98] Señor Nice differs from his previous book as drugs are not central to the story and, while autobiographical, the book is more Marks's own exploration of his ancestor, the pirate Sir Henry Morgan.[99] In 2011, he penned the thriller Sympathy for the Devil.
Marks held a series of book-readings into 2014. In these live events he regaled his audiences with tales of his smuggling days and his time in prison, as well as offered insight into drug production and the arguments for legalisation of cannabis.
Comics and videogame[edit]
Marks and comic writer Pat Mills collaborated on comic strips which tied in with Sony's inFamous 2 video game.[100]
Music[edit]
In the music world, he appeared as a guest on the BBC music quiz show Never Mind the Buzzcocks.[101] He also collaborated with Welsh group Super Furry Animals on their album Fuzzy Logic (released May 1996) and on their singles "The Man Don't Give a Fuck" and "Ice Hockey Hair".[102] He featured on the album Angel Headed Hip Hop (2009) with Lee Harris and River Styx.[103] He also worked with former Happy Mondays guitarist Kav Sandhu,[104] and appeared at numerous British music festivals, including: (Glastonbury 2009 and 2011),[105] Beautiful Days,[106] RockNess,[107] Camp Bestival,[108] Kendal Calling,[109] and the Sonisphere Festival.[110] He was featured on the Reverend & The Makers track "MDMAzing" on their third album @Reverend Makers (2012).
Works about Marks[edit]
Marks was the subject of the biography High Time (1984) written by David Leigh.
Marks was also the subject of the film Mr. Nice (2010), named after his eponymous 1997 autobiography.[111] The film featured Rhys Ifans as Marks and Chloë Sevigny as his wife Judy.[112]
In 2013, Marks recounted his story in an episode of the television series Banged Up Abroad.
Death[edit]
On 25 January 2015, it was announced that Marks had inoperable colorectal cancer.[113] He died of the disease on 10 April 2016, at the age of 70.[114]

Dennis Howard Marks (13 August 1945 – 10 April 2016) was a Welsh drug smuggler and author who achieved notoriety as an international cannabis smuggler through high-profile court cases. At his peak he claimed to have been smuggling consignments of the drug as large as 30 tons,[1] and was connected with groups as diverse as the CIA, the IRA, MI6, and the Mafia. He was eventually convicted by the American Drug Enforcement Administration and handed a 25-year sentence to be served at Terre Haute; he was released in April 1995 after serving seven years. Though he had up to 43 different aliases, he became known as "Mr Nice" after he bought a passport from convicted murderer Donald Nice.[2] After his release from prison, he published a best-selling autobiography, Mr Nice, and campaigned publicly for changes in drugs legislation.

Early life and education[edit]
Marks was born in Kenfig Hill, near Bridgend, Wales, the son of Dennis Marks, a captain in the Merchant Navy, and Edna, a teacher.[3] Brought up as a Baptist, he later turned to Buddhism, though he did not become a devout follower.[4] He attended the Garw Grammar school in Pontycymer. He was a fluent Welsh speaker.[5]
He gained a place at Balliol College, Oxford, after he impressed Russell Meiggs in his interview,[6] and read physics there from 1964 to 1967. At the university he was first introduced to cannabis by Denys Irving.[7] After his friend Joshua Macmillan (son of Maurice Macmillan) died, Marks swore off ever getting involved with hard drugs.[8] Among his other friends at Balliol were the epidemiologist Julian Peto and the journalist Lynn Barber.[8] Through a mixture of cheating and last minute cramming, he passed his finals; this was despite months of taking drugs rather than attending classes and a serious infection he developed a few weeks before the exams.[9]
In 1967 he began teacher training, and married Ilze Kadegis, a Latvian student at St. Anne's College, Oxford, who was also training to become a teacher.[10] He gave up teacher training to continue his education at the University of London (1967–68; Grad. Inst P.), then back to Balliol, Oxford (1968–69; Dip HPh Sc), and then on to the University of Sussex (1969–70) to study philosophy of science.[11]
Drug empire[edit]
Though involved with drugs at university, he sold cannabis only to his friends or acquaintances until 1970, when he was persuaded to assist Graham Plinston, who had been arrested in Germany on drug trafficking charges.[12] Through Plinston he met Mohammed Durrani, a Pakistani hashish exporter who was a descendant of the Durranis who had run Afghanistan in the 19th century.[13] With Plinston behind bars, Durrani offered Marks the opportunity to sell the drug on a large scale in London, and he agreed to the proposition.[14] He formed a four-way partnership with Charlie Radcliffe, Charlie Weatherly and a dealer named Jarvis. Durrani never contacted them, and so the group acquired smaller quantities of hashish from various sources and began selling the drug on in Oxford, Brighton and London.[15] After six months he returned to Germany to help bail Plinston out of jail. Marks was a useful means of transferring money as he did not have a criminal record.[16]
Now a free man, Plinston gave Marks a job transporting hashish in Frankfurt; Marks in turn hired a New Zealand smuggler named Lang as his driver.[17] After paying Marks £5,000 for his work in Frankfurt, Plinston then sold hashish on to Marks and his three friends (Radcliffe, Weatherly and Jarvis) in London; in selling on 650 kilos within a week, the four men made a profit of £20,000.[18] Durrani then arranged for hashish to be smuggled in the furniture of Pakistani diplomats who were moving to London; Marks would then intercept the furniture to find the drugs – this arrangement netted him a profit of £7,500.[19] Marks expanded his enterprise, employing two friends from Wales, Mike Bell and David Thomas, to stash the drugs and help with transportation.[20] The gang became unsatisfied with the way the profits were being split (80% of the money they made went to Durrani) and contacted James McCann, a gunrunner for the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA).[21] Marks and Plinston persuaded McCann to smuggle hashish into Ireland from Kabul, which the pair would then ferry over to Wales and into England;[22] McCann would get the drugs into Ireland through the freeport at Shannon Airport using his IRA connections.[23] Marks avoided the attention of HM Revenue and Customs by creating a paper trail that indicated he made his money from selling stamps and dresses.[24]
By 1972, he was making £50,000 with each shipment.[25] By the end of the year he was approached by Hamilton McMillan of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), a friend from Oxford University, who recruited Marks to work for MI6 because of his connections in the hashish-producing countries of Lebanon, Pakistan and Afghanistan, for his ability to seduce women, and for his contacts with the IRA.[26] The next year, Marks began exporting cannabis to the United States to The Brotherhood of Eternal Love, hiding the drugs in the music equipment of fictional British pop groups that were supposed to be touring the country; he further expanded his operations with other smugglers and other methods of trafficking, often using his Oxford connections.[27] As McCann was in danger of being executed by the IRA should MI6 tip them off about his involvement in drugs, Marks then gave up the smuggling operation at Shannon airport.[28] Following the Littlejohn affair, MI6 ceased their relationship with Marks, while his American operation came to an end after police opened a speaker full of cannabis and arrested gang member James Gater, leading to other arrests in Europe.[29] Marks was arrested by Dutch police in 1973, but skipped bail in April 1974; the British press then made him a nationally known figure, reporting that he was feared abducted by the IRA for his connections with MI6.[30] With most of his fortune confiscated by the authorities, he made his way to Italy, where he lived in a Winnebago for three months before returning to England in secret in October 1974.[31] At this point he began a relationship with Judy Lane;[32] the couple married in 1980 and had three children together. He had previously been in a five-year relationship with Rosie Lewis, with whom he had a daughter.
Marks then connected Ernie Combs, member of The Brotherhood of Eternal Love, with John Denbigh, a man with connections in the hashish-producing nation of Nepal.[33] With the help of the Yakuza, large quantities of the drug would be exported to John F. Kennedy International Airport in the guise of air conditioning equipment, where Don Brown's mob (headed by Carmine Galante) would then take possession of the drugs.[34] A 500-kilo deal was set up and executed on 4 July 1975, leaving Marks a wealthy man.[35] Other deals up to 750 kilos followed, and Marks continued to live under assumed names in the United Kingdom.[35] In 1976 he travelled to America, and set up a 1,000-kilo deal between Combs and 'Lebanese Sam' – making himself £300,000 in the process;[36] he continued to regularly set up deals between his various American and Far East connections. In need of a new identity after his alias of Anthony Tunnicliffe was compromised in a police sting, in 1978 he bought Donald Nice's passport.[37]

"Between 1975 and 1978, twenty-four loads totalling 55,000 pounds of marijuana and hashish had been successfully imported through John F. Kennedy Airport, New York. They had involved the Mafia, the Yakuza, the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, the Thai army, the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Pakistani Armed Forces, Nepalese monks, and other individuals from all walks of life. The total profit made by all concerned was $48,000,000. They'd had a good run."
— Marks concluding the JFK episode of drug trafficking in his Mr Nice autobiography; the run had ended after the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) began intercepting the drugs and arresting Mafia associates in New York.[38]

In the late 1970s, the Trafficante crime family, under the leadership of Santo Trafficante, Jr., were importing Colombian cannabis into the US on freighter ships, thus driving down the price of the drug on the streets in America.[39] In December 1979, Trafficante exported 50 tons of cannabis direct from Colombia to Marks and his contacts in the UK, enough to supply the entire British market for the drug for almost a year.[40] In 1980, Marks was arrested by customs officers for his part in importing £15 million of cannabis; police had followed associates of the Trafficante family to a large stash of cannabis.[41] When arrested, he was in possession of numerous pieces of incriminating evidence, as well as £30,000 in cash.[42] Defended by Lord Hutchinson, Marks pleaded 'Not Guilty', concocting a story that he was an agent for MI6 (concealing the fact that his relation with MI6 ended in 1973) and the Mexican Secret Service that had set up an identity as a drug smuggler in order to close the net on James McCann (wanted in Britain for his IRA activities).[43] The jury found him innocent of drug smuggling, but guilty of using false passports and Marks was sentenced to two years imprisonment, but was released after five days having already served most of this time before sentencing was passed.[44] HM Customs then arrested him for his part of a 1973 smuggling operation but following a plea bargain and time off for remission he served just three months of a three-year sentence.[45]
Released in May 1982, though with most of his employees still in prison for the crime Marks was found innocent of, he spent the next year running a legitimate wine importing business but he continued to spend more money than he was making and the savings he made from drug smuggling in the 1970s began to dwindle.[46] In 1983, McCann was still at large and his smuggling enterprise was flourishing; he offered Marks the chance to sell 250 kilos of cannabis and Marks accepted.[47] Dutch police confiscated the full shipment and arrested Mickey Williams, a member of the London underworld who had agreed to help Marks on the deal.[48] Marks then travelled to the Far East to set up cannabis deals with Salim Malik, a Pakistani hashish exporter who he had met through Durrani (Durrani had since suffered a fatal heart attack) and Phil Sparrowhawk, an exporter from Bangkok; they would smuggle their product over to Ernie Combs in America.[49] He also arranged a 500-kilo deal with Mickey Williams, who had travelled to Bangkok after his release from prison in Amsterdam.[50] Marks laundered his money through various fronts: a travel agency, a paper mill, a wine importers, a bulk water transportation company and a secretarial service.[51]
In 1984, he was approached to sell $300,000 worth of cannabis to a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent looking to fund and arm the Mujahideen in their war against the Soviet occupation (Operation Cyclone).[52] The agent's contact on the APL ship suffered a heart attack and died on the journey to the US, leaving the drugs in the hands of US officials; the agent subsequently fled to Brazil to avoid prosecution.[53] Though under surveillance, Marks continued to expand his underworld operations and set up a massage parlour in a Bangkok hotel with the help of Phil Sparrowhawk and Lord Moynihan.[54] In 1986, he settled in Majorca,[55] and continued to make vast sums smuggling Salim Malik's hashish into America.[56] The DEA were meanwhile tapping Marks's phones and keeping him under surveillance and having arrested Ernie Combs they came close to busting a large shipment of cannabis, when Marks was tipped off; the ship was redirected to Mauritius and the operation aborted.[57] As he continued to avoid DEA stings he continued to make millions and continued to add to his underworld contacts, finding that he could use Chinese triads to launder his drug money more effectively.[58]

"A Philippine-brothel-owning member of the House of Lords [Moynihan] was staying at the house of a Spanish Chief Inspector of Police [Rafael Llofriu]. The Lord was being watched by an American CIA operative who was staying at the house of an English convicted sex offender [Jim Hobbs]. The CIA operative was sharing accommodation with an IRA terrorist [McCann]. The IRA terrorist was discussing a Moroccan hashish deal with a Georgian pilot of Colombia's Medellín Cartel. Organising these scenarios was an ex-MI6 agent [Marks], currently supervising the sale of thirty tons of Thai weed in Canada and at whose house could be found Pakistan's major supplier of hashish [Malik]. Attempting to understand the scenarios was a solitary DEA agent. The stage was set for something."
— The DEA's efforts to apprehend Marks were made extremely difficult thanks to the many wide-ranging contacts Marks had; in September 1987 many of these contacts were with Marks in Palma.[59]

When friends of his were busted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Marks decided to retire from drug smuggling to concentrate on his legitimate businesses; citing the fate of his friends and contacts, who were either in jail, informing the DEA or smuggling heavier drugs.[60] In 1988, DEA agent Craig Lovato arrested both Howard and Judy Marks and extradited the couple to the United States.[61] Arrests of those involved in Marks's various criminal activities were made in Britain, Spain, the Philippines, Thailand, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Switzerland, the United States and Canada.[62] This was the work of 'Operation Eclectic', set up in 1986 by both the DEA and Scotland Yard and aided by numerous law enforcement organisations from around the world.[63]
Trial and imprisonment[edit]
Marks was taken from Palma to Modelo prison in Barcelona,[64] and then to Alcala-Meco in Madrid.[65] There he was handed a 40-page document which detailed the allegations of his drug smuggling activities between 1970 and 1987, charging him with operating a racket as described in the RICO act.[66] In his autobiography, Marks stated that "although the charge against Judy and some others were absurd, the formal accusations against me, in general terms, were true."[67] The recently passed Sentencing Reform Act meant that he was facing a minimum of ten years to a maximum life sentence without the possibility for parole.[68] The Audiencia Nacional ordered his extradition to Florida.[69] After being shown the prosecution evidence against him, Marks attempted to construct the defence that his smuggling operations were directed to Australia and that he never exported to the United States, and therefore never broke US law.[70] He again cultivated the myth that he was a spy for MI6, and claimed that he was set up by the CIA because he had discovered that CIA agents were smuggling drugs into Australia.[71] He and his lawyers spent hours reviewing the phone tapping evidence to make the coded conversations about smuggling into America seem to suggest that the drugs were actually being smuggled into Australia; research was done into weather patterns to prove tentative links between what was said by Marks and his associates and what was happening at the time in Australia.[72] Marks and his wife were extradited in 1989, and he was given the Miranda rights on the flight from Spain to the US.[73]
In Florida, Judy pleaded guilty to her small part in the racket and was released, having already served some months in prison in Spain.[74] The money Marks made from his smuggling operations was spent on legal fees.[75] He refused to plea-bargain or to inform on his associates, gambling that he could again convince a jury that the authorities had got the wrong man.[76] As the trial began in July 1990, Peter Lane, his brother-in-law and fellow smuggler, wrote to Marks to inform him that he was going to testify against Marks in court to get a more lenient sentence himself.[77] Marks still was confident of beating the DEA in court, but Ernie Combs also agreed to testify for the prosecution so as to secure the release of his wife, and Marks had little choice but to change his plea to guilty to racketeering charges.[78] He was sentenced to 25 years in jail and given a $50,000 fine; though he had originally been sentenced to 15 years he was taken back into court after the judge realised he had misspoken and said that his 10 and 15-year sentences were to run consecutively and not, as he had originally stated, concurrently.[79]
He spent seven years imprisoned in the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute, Indiana, a rough prison. He had originally been sentenced to Butner, but agent Lovato insisted that he instead serve time at Terre Haute.[80] One of the six most secure prisons in the country, Terre Haute had the worst reputation of the six for gang rape and violence.[81] Despite this, Marks remained on good terms with the many violent inmates housed there as he was "British and a famous non-rat" and avoided conflict "by being nice, charming, and eccentric".[82] During his time there he befriended many notorious criminals and members of four of the reputed Five Families, including: Gennaro "Gerry Lang" Langella (Colombo crime family); James "Jimmy C" Coonan, John "Johnny Carnegs" Carneglia, Vittorio "Little Vic" Amuso, and Frank "Frankie Loc" LoCascio (Gambino crime family); Anthony "Bruno" Indelicato (Bonanno crime family); and Joey Testa (Lucchese crime family).[82] He also made friends with Veronza Bowers, Jr. (Black Panther Party) and 'Big Jim' of the Outlaw motorcycle club.[82]
Owing to his status as an Oxford University graduate with alleged connections to the British Secret Intelligence Service he was treated as a potential escapee and spent many weeks in solitary confinement, though he never attempted to escape or threatened other prisoners or prison staff.[83] During his time in prison he found success as a jailhouse lawyer for the other inmates, securing one overturned conviction.[84] He gave up cigarettes for the last three years of his sentence.[85] In January 1995, Marks was granted parole after a prison officer testified that he was a model prisoner who spent much of his time helping his fellow prisoners pass their GED exams.[86] He was released in April 1995.[87]
Life after release[edit]
Acting[edit]
He acted in gangster movie Killer Bitch (2010),[88] starred in the film I Know You Know (2009),[89] appeared as Satan in the 2006 movie adaptation of the Dirty Sanchez television series,[90] and had a cameo appearance in the film Human Traffic (1999).[91] He appeared as himself in AmStarDam (aka "Stoner Express") (2016).
Advocacy and politics[edit]
Marks stood for election to the UK Parliament in 1997, on the single issue of the legalisation of cannabis.[92] He contested four seats at once - Norwich South (against future Home Secretary Charles Clarke), Norwich North, Neath and Southampton Test - and picked up around 1% of the vote.[92] This led to the formation of the Legalise Cannabis Alliance (LCA) by Alun Buffry in 1999; the party reformed as Cannabis Law Reform in 2011.[93]
He also argued for the legalisation of cannabis in numerous television programmes in the United Kingdom. On 1 October 2010, he was interviewed on Ireland's The Late Late Show.[94]
Books[edit]
Following his release from prison, Marks published an autobiography, Mr Nice (1996), which has been translated into several languages.[95][96] He also compiled an anthology called The Howard Marks Book of Dope Stories (2001)[97] and more recently a follow-on from his autobiography: Señor Nice: Straight Life From Wales to South America.[98] Señor Nice differs from his previous book as drugs are not central to the story and, while autobiographical, the book is more Marks's own exploration of his ancestor, the pirate Sir Henry Morgan.[99] In 2011, he penned the thriller Sympathy for the Devil.
Marks held a series of book-readings into 2014. In these live events he regaled his audiences with tales of his smuggling days and his time in prison, as well as offered insight into drug production and the arguments for legalisation of cannabis.
Comics and videogame[edit]
Marks and comic writer Pat Mills collaborated on comic strips which tied in with Sony's inFamous 2 video game.[100]
Music[edit]
In the music world, he appeared as a guest on the BBC music quiz show Never Mind the Buzzcocks.[101] He also collaborated with Welsh group Super Furry Animals on their album Fuzzy Logic (released May 1996) and on their singles "The Man Don't Give a Fuck" and "Ice Hockey Hair".[102] He featured on the album Angel Headed Hip Hop (2009) with Lee Harris and River Styx.[103] He also worked with former Happy Mondays guitarist Kav Sandhu,[104] and appeared at numerous British music festivals, including: (Glastonbury 2009 and 2011),[105] Beautiful Days,[106] RockNess,[107] Camp Bestival,[108] Kendal Calling,[109] and the Sonisphere Festival.[110] He was featured on the Reverend & The Makers track "MDMAzing" on their third album @Reverend Makers (2012).
Works about Marks[edit]
Marks was the subject of the biography High Time (1984) written by David Leigh.
Marks was also the subject of the film Mr. Nice (2010), named after his eponymous 1997 autobiography.[111] The film featured Rhys Ifans as Marks and Chloë Sevigny as his wife Judy.[112]
In 2013, Marks recounted his story in an episode of the television series Banged Up Abroad.
Death[edit]
On 25 January 2015, it was announced that Marks had inoperable colorectal cancer.[113] He died of the disease on 10 April 2016, at the age of 70.[114]

Dennis Howard Marks (13 August 1945 – 10 April 2016) was a Welsh drug smuggler and author who achieved notoriety as an international cannabis smuggler through high-profile court cases. At his peak he claimed to have been smuggling consignments of the drug as large as 30 tons,[1] and was connected with groups as diverse as the CIA, the IRA, MI6, and the Mafia. He was eventually convicted by the American Drug Enforcement Administration and handed a 25-year sentence to be served at Terre Haute; he was released in April 1995 after serving seven years. Though he had up to 43 different aliases, he became known as "Mr Nice" after he bought a passport from convicted murderer Donald Nice.[2] After his release from prison, he published a best-selling autobiography, Mr Nice, and campaigned publicly for changes in drugs legislation.

Early life and education[edit]
Marks was born in Kenfig Hill, near Bridgend, Wales, the son of Dennis Marks, a captain in the Merchant Navy, and Edna, a teacher.[3] Brought up as a Baptist, he later turned to Buddhism, though he did not become a devout follower.[4] He attended the Garw Grammar school in Pontycymer. He was a fluent Welsh speaker.[5]
He gained a place at Balliol College, Oxford, after he impressed Russell Meiggs in his interview,[6] and read physics there from 1964 to 1967. At the university he was first introduced to cannabis by Denys Irving.[7] After his friend Joshua Macmillan (son of Maurice Macmillan) died, Marks swore off ever getting involved with hard drugs.[8] Among his other friends at Balliol were the epidemiologist Julian Peto and the journalist Lynn Barber.[8] Through a mixture of cheating and last minute cramming, he passed his finals; this was despite months of taking drugs rather than attending classes and a serious infection he developed a few weeks before the exams.[9]
In 1967 he began teacher training, and married Ilze Kadegis, a Latvian student at St. Anne's College, Oxford, who was also training to become a teacher.[10] He gave up teacher training to continue his education at the University of London (1967–68; Grad. Inst P.), then back to Balliol, Oxford (1968–69; Dip HPh Sc), and then on to the University of Sussex (1969–70) to study philosophy of science.[11]
Drug empire[edit]
Though involved with drugs at university, he sold cannabis only to his friends or acquaintances until 1970, when he was persuaded to assist Graham Plinston, who had been arrested in Germany on drug trafficking charges.[12] Through Plinston he met Mohammed Durrani, a Pakistani hashish exporter who was a descendant of the Durranis who had run Afghanistan in the 19th century.[13] With Plinston behind bars, Durrani offered Marks the opportunity to sell the drug on a large scale in London, and he agreed to the proposition.[14] He formed a four-way partnership with Charlie Radcliffe, Charlie Weatherly and a dealer named Jarvis. Durrani never contacted them, and so the group acquired smaller quantities of hashish from various sources and began selling the drug on in Oxford, Brighton and London.[15] After six months he returned to Germany to help bail Plinston out of jail. Marks was a useful means of transferring money as he did not have a criminal record.[16]
Now a free man, Plinston gave Marks a job transporting hashish in Frankfurt; Marks in turn hired a New Zealand smuggler named Lang as his driver.[17] After paying Marks £5,000 for his work in Frankfurt, Plinston then sold hashish on to Marks and his three friends (Radcliffe, Weatherly and Jarvis) in London; in selling on 650 kilos within a week, the four men made a profit of £20,000.[18] Durrani then arranged for hashish to be smuggled in the furniture of Pakistani diplomats who were moving to London; Marks would then intercept the furniture to find the drugs – this arrangement netted him a profit of £7,500.[19] Marks expanded his enterprise, employing two friends from Wales, Mike Bell and David Thomas, to stash the drugs and help with transportation.[20] The gang became unsatisfied with the way the profits were being split (80% of the money they made went to Durrani) and contacted James McCann, a gunrunner for the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA).[21] Marks and Plinston persuaded McCann to smuggle hashish into Ireland from Kabul, which the pair would then ferry over to Wales and into England;[22] McCann would get the drugs into Ireland through the freeport at Shannon Airport using his IRA connections.[23] Marks avoided the attention of HM Revenue and Customs by creating a paper trail that indicated he made his money from selling stamps and dresses.[24]
By 1972, he was making £50,000 with each shipment.[25] By the end of the year he was approached by Hamilton McMillan of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), a friend from Oxford University, who recruited Marks to work for MI6 because of his connections in the hashish-producing countries of Lebanon, Pakistan and Afghanistan, for his ability to seduce women, and for his contacts with the IRA.[26] The next year, Marks began exporting cannabis to the United States to The Brotherhood of Eternal Love, hiding the drugs in the music equipment of fictional British pop groups that were supposed to be touring the country; he further expanded his operations with other smugglers and other methods of trafficking, often using his Oxford connections.[27] As McCann was in danger of being executed by the IRA should MI6 tip them off about his involvement in drugs, Marks then gave up the smuggling operation at Shannon airport.[28] Following the Littlejohn affair, MI6 ceased their relationship with Marks, while his American operation came to an end after police opened a speaker full of cannabis and arrested gang member James Gater, leading to other arrests in Europe.[29] Marks was arrested by Dutch police in 1973, but skipped bail in April 1974; the British press then made him a nationally known figure, reporting that he was feared abducted by the IRA for his connections with MI6.[30] With most of his fortune confiscated by the authorities, he made his way to Italy, where he lived in a Winnebago for three months before returning to England in secret in October 1974.[31] At this point he began a relationship with Judy Lane;[32] the couple married in 1980 and had three children together. He had previously been in a five-year relationship with Rosie Lewis, with whom he had a daughter.
Marks then connected Ernie Combs, member of The Brotherhood of Eternal Love, with John Denbigh, a man with connections in the hashish-producing nation of Nepal.[33] With the help of the Yakuza, large quantities of the drug would be exported to John F. Kennedy International Airport in the guise of air conditioning equipment, where Don Brown's mob (headed by Carmine Galante) would then take possession of the drugs.[34] A 500-kilo deal was set up and executed on 4 July 1975, leaving Marks a wealthy man.[35] Other deals up to 750 kilos followed, and Marks continued to live under assumed names in the United Kingdom.[35] In 1976 he travelled to America, and set up a 1,000-kilo deal between Combs and 'Lebanese Sam' – making himself £300,000 in the process;[36] he continued to regularly set up deals between his various American and Far East connections. In need of a new identity after his alias of Anthony Tunnicliffe was compromised in a police sting, in 1978 he bought Donald Nice's passport.[37]

"Between 1975 and 1978, twenty-four loads totalling 55,000 pounds of marijuana and hashish had been successfully imported through John F. Kennedy Airport, New York. They had involved the Mafia, the Yakuza, the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, the Thai army, the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Pakistani Armed Forces, Nepalese monks, and other individuals from all walks of life. The total profit made by all concerned was $48,000,000. They'd had a good run."
— Marks concluding the JFK episode of drug trafficking in his Mr Nice autobiography; the run had ended after the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) began intercepting the drugs and arresting Mafia associates in New York.[38]

In the late 1970s, the Trafficante crime family, under the leadership of Santo Trafficante, Jr., were importing Colombian cannabis into the US on freighter ships, thus driving down the price of the drug on the streets in America.[39] In December 1979, Trafficante exported 50 tons of cannabis direct from Colombia to Marks and his contacts in the UK, enough to supply the entire British market for the drug for almost a year.[40] In 1980, Marks was arrested by customs officers for his part in importing £15 million of cannabis; police had followed associates of the Trafficante family to a large stash of cannabis.[41] When arrested, he was in possession of numerous pieces of incriminating evidence, as well as £30,000 in cash.[42] Defended by Lord Hutchinson, Marks pleaded 'Not Guilty', concocting a story that he was an agent for MI6 (concealing the fact that his relation with MI6 ended in 1973) and the Mexican Secret Service that had set up an identity as a drug smuggler in order to close the net on James McCann (wanted in Britain for his IRA activities).[43] The jury found him innocent of drug smuggling, but guilty of using false passports and Marks was sentenced to two years imprisonment, but was released after five days having already served most of this time before sentencing was passed.[44] HM Customs then arrested him for his part of a 1973 smuggling operation but following a plea bargain and time off for remission he served just three months of a three-year sentence.[45]
Released in May 1982, though with most of his employees still in prison for the crime Marks was found innocent of, he spent the next year running a legitimate wine importing business but he continued to spend more money than he was making and the savings he made from drug smuggling in the 1970s began to dwindle.[46] In 1983, McCann was still at large and his smuggling enterprise was flourishing; he offered Marks the chance to sell 250 kilos of cannabis and Marks accepted.[47] Dutch police confiscated the full shipment and arrested Mickey Williams, a member of the London underworld who had agreed to help Marks on the deal.[48] Marks then travelled to the Far East to set up cannabis deals with Salim Malik, a Pakistani hashish exporter who he had met through Durrani (Durrani had since suffered a fatal heart attack) and Phil Sparrowhawk, an exporter from Bangkok; they would smuggle their product over to Ernie Combs in America.[49] He also arranged a 500-kilo deal with Mickey Williams, who had travelled to Bangkok after his release from prison in Amsterdam.[50] Marks laundered his money through various fronts: a travel agency, a paper mill, a wine importers, a bulk water transportation company and a secretarial service.[51]
In 1984, he was approached to sell $300,000 worth of cannabis to a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent looking to fund and arm the Mujahideen in their war against the Soviet occupation (Operation Cyclone).[52] The agent's contact on the APL ship suffered a heart attack and died on the journey to the US, leaving the drugs in the hands of US officials; the agent subsequently fled to Brazil to avoid prosecution.[53] Though under surveillance, Marks continued to expand his underworld operations and set up a massage parlour in a Bangkok hotel with the help of Phil Sparrowhawk and Lord Moynihan.[54] In 1986, he settled in Majorca,[55] and continued to make vast sums smuggling Salim Malik's hashish into America.[56] The DEA were meanwhile tapping Marks's phones and keeping him under surveillance and having arrested Ernie Combs they came close to busting a large shipment of cannabis, when Marks was tipped off; the ship was redirected to Mauritius and the operation aborted.[57] As he continued to avoid DEA stings he continued to make millions and continued to add to his underworld contacts, finding that he could use Chinese triads to launder his drug money more effectively.[58]

"A Philippine-brothel-owning member of the House of Lords [Moynihan] was staying at the house of a Spanish Chief Inspector of Police [Rafael Llofriu]. The Lord was being watched by an American CIA operative who was staying at the house of an English convicted sex offender [Jim Hobbs]. The CIA operative was sharing accommodation with an IRA terrorist [McCann]. The IRA terrorist was discussing a Moroccan hashish deal with a Georgian pilot of Colombia's Medellín Cartel. Organising these scenarios was an ex-MI6 agent [Marks], currently supervising the sale of thirty tons of Thai weed in Canada and at whose house could be found Pakistan's major supplier of hashish [Malik]. Attempting to understand the scenarios was a solitary DEA agent. The stage was set for something."
— The DEA's efforts to apprehend Marks were made extremely difficult thanks to the many wide-ranging contacts Marks had; in September 1987 many of these contacts were with Marks in Palma.[59]

When friends of his were busted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Marks decided to retire from drug smuggling to concentrate on his legitimate businesses; citing the fate of his friends and contacts, who were either in jail, informing the DEA or smuggling heavier drugs.[60] In 1988, DEA agent Craig Lovato arrested both Howard and Judy Marks and extradited the couple to the United States.[61] Arrests of those involved in Marks's various criminal activities were made in Britain, Spain, the Philippines, Thailand, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Switzerland, the United States and Canada.[62] This was the work of 'Operation Eclectic', set up in 1986 by both the DEA and Scotland Yard and aided by numerous law enforcement organisations from around the world.[63]
Trial and imprisonment[edit]
Marks was taken from Palma to Modelo prison in Barcelona,[64] and then to Alcala-Meco in Madrid.[65] There he was handed a 40-page document which detailed the allegations of his drug smuggling activities between 1970 and 1987, charging him with operating a racket as described in the RICO act.[66] In his autobiography, Marks stated that "although the charge against Judy and some others were absurd, the formal accusations against me, in general terms, were true."[67] The recently passed Sentencing Reform Act meant that he was facing a minimum of ten years to a maximum life sentence without the possibility for parole.[68] The Audiencia Nacional ordered his extradition to Florida.[69] After being shown the prosecution evidence against him, Marks attempted to construct the defence that his smuggling operations were directed to Australia and that he never exported to the United States, and therefore never broke US law.[70] He again cultivated the myth that he was a spy for MI6, and claimed that he was set up by the CIA because he had discovered that CIA agents were smuggling drugs into Australia.[71] He and his lawyers spent hours reviewing the phone tapping evidence to make the coded conversations about smuggling into America seem to suggest that the drugs were actually being smuggled into Australia; research was done into weather patterns to prove tentative links between what was said by Marks and his associates and what was happening at the time in Australia.[72] Marks and his wife were extradited in 1989, and he was given the Miranda rights on the flight from Spain to the US.[73]
In Florida, Judy pleaded guilty to her small part in the racket and was released, having already served some months in prison in Spain.[74] The money Marks made from his smuggling operations was spent on legal fees.[75] He refused to plea-bargain or to inform on his associates, gambling that he could again convince a jury that the authorities had got the wrong man.[76] As the trial began in July 1990, Peter Lane, his brother-in-law and fellow smuggler, wrote to Marks to inform him that he was going to testify against Marks in court to get a more lenient sentence himself.[77] Marks still was confident of beating the DEA in court, but Ernie Combs also agreed to testify for the prosecution so as to secure the release of his wife, and Marks had little choice but to change his plea to guilty to racketeering charges.[78] He was sentenced to 25 years in jail and given a $50,000 fine; though he had originally been sentenced to 15 years he was taken back into court after the judge realised he had misspoken and said that his 10 and 15-year sentences were to run consecutively and not, as he had originally stated, concurrently.[79]
He spent seven years imprisoned in the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute, Indiana, a rough prison. He had originally been sentenced to Butner, but agent Lovato insisted that he instead serve time at Terre Haute.[80] One of the six most secure prisons in the country, Terre Haute had the worst reputation of the six for gang rape and violence.[81] Despite this, Marks remained on good terms with the many violent inmates housed there as he was "British and a famous non-rat" and avoided conflict "by being nice, charming, and eccentric".[82] During his time there he befriended many notorious criminals and members of four of the reputed Five Families, including: Gennaro "Gerry Lang" Langella (Colombo crime family); James "Jimmy C" Coonan, John "Johnny Carnegs" Carneglia, Vittorio "Little Vic" Amuso, and Frank "Frankie Loc" LoCascio (Gambino crime family); Anthony "Bruno" Indelicato (Bonanno crime family); and Joey Testa (Lucchese crime family).[82] He also made friends with Veronza Bowers, Jr. (Black Panther Party) and 'Big Jim' of the Outlaw motorcycle club.[82]
Owing to his status as an Oxford University graduate with alleged connections to the British Secret Intelligence Service he was treated as a potential escapee and spent many weeks in solitary confinement, though he never attempted to escape or threatened other prisoners or prison staff.[83] During his time in prison he found success as a jailhouse lawyer for the other inmates, securing one overturned conviction.[84] He gave up cigarettes for the last three years of his sentence.[85] In January 1995, Marks was granted parole after a prison officer testified that he was a model prisoner who spent much of his time helping his fellow prisoners pass their GED exams.[86] He was released in April 1995.[87]
Life after release[edit]
Acting[edit]
He acted in gangster movie Killer Bitch (2010),[88] starred in the film I Know You Know (2009),[89] appeared as Satan in the 2006 movie adaptation of the Dirty Sanchez television series,[90] and had a cameo appearance in the film Human Traffic (1999).[91] He appeared as himself in AmStarDam (aka "Stoner Express") (2016).
Advocacy and politics[edit]
Marks stood for election to the UK Parliament in 1997, on the single issue of the legalisation of cannabis.[92] He contested four seats at once - Norwich South (against future Home Secretary Charles Clarke), Norwich North, Neath and Southampton Test - and picked up around 1% of the vote.[92] This led to the formation of the Legalise Cannabis Alliance (LCA) by Alun Buffry in 1999; the party reformed as Cannabis Law Reform in 2011.[93]
He also argued for the legalisation of cannabis in numerous television programmes in the United Kingdom. On 1 October 2010, he was interviewed on Ireland's The Late Late Show.[94]
Books[edit]
Following his release from prison, Marks published an autobiography, Mr Nice (1996), which has been translated into several languages.[95][96] He also compiled an anthology called The Howard Marks Book of Dope Stories (2001)[97] and more recently a follow-on from his autobiography: Señor Nice: Straight Life From Wales to South America.[98] Señor Nice differs from his previous book as drugs are not central to the story and, while autobiographical, the book is more Marks's own exploration of his ancestor, the pirate Sir Henry Morgan.[99] In 2011, he penned the thriller Sympathy for the Devil.
Marks held a series of book-readings into 2014. In these live events he regaled his audiences with tales of his smuggling days and his time in prison, as well as offered insight into drug production and the arguments for legalisation of cannabis.
Comics and videogame[edit]
Marks and comic writer Pat Mills collaborated on comic strips which tied in with Sony's inFamous 2 video game.[100]
Music[edit]
In the music world, he appeared as a guest on the BBC music quiz show Never Mind the Buzzcocks.[101] He also collaborated with Welsh group Super Furry Animals on their album Fuzzy Logic (released May 1996) and on their singles "The Man Don't Give a Fuck" and "Ice Hockey Hair".[102] He featured on the album Angel Headed Hip Hop (2009) with Lee Harris and River Styx.[103] He also worked with former Happy Mondays guitarist Kav Sandhu,[104] and appeared at numerous British music festivals, including: (Glastonbury 2009 and 2011),[105] Beautiful Days,[106] RockNess,[107] Camp Bestival,[108] Kendal Calling,[109] and the Sonisphere Festival.[110] He was featured on the Reverend & The Makers track "MDMAzing" on their third album @Reverend Makers (2012).
Works about Marks[edit]
Marks was the subject of the biography High Time (1984) written by David Leigh.
Marks was also the subject of the film Mr. Nice (2010), named after his eponymous 1997 autobiography.[111] The film featured Rhys Ifans as Marks and Chloë Sevigny as his wife Judy.[112]
In 2013, Marks recounted his story in an episode of the television series Banged Up Abroad.
Death[edit]
On 25 January 2015, it was announced that Marks had inoperable colorectal cancer.[113] He died of the disease on 10 April 2016, at the age of 70.[114]

Dennis Howard Marks (13 August 1945 – 10 April 2016) was a Welsh drug smuggler and author who achieved notoriety as an international cannabis smuggler through high-profile court cases. At his peak he claimed to have been smuggling consignments of the drug as large as 30 tons,[1] and was connected with groups as diverse as the CIA, the IRA, MI6, and the Mafia. He was eventually convicted by the American Drug Enforcement Administration and handed a 25-year sentence to be served at Terre Haute; he was released in April 1995 after serving seven years. Though he had up to 43 different aliases, he became known as "Mr Nice" after he bought a passport from convicted murderer Donald Nice.[2] After his release from prison, he published a best-selling autobiography, Mr Nice, and campaigned publicly for changes in drugs legislation.

Early life and education[edit]
Marks was born in Kenfig Hill, near Bridgend, Wales, the son of Dennis Marks, a captain in the Merchant Navy, and Edna, a teacher.[3] Brought up as a Baptist, he later turned to Buddhism, though he did not become a devout follower.[4] He attended the Garw Grammar school in Pontycymer. He was a fluent Welsh speaker.[5]
He gained a place at Balliol College, Oxford, after he impressed Russell Meiggs in his interview,[6] and read physics there from 1964 to 1967. At the university he was first introduced to cannabis by Denys Irving.[7] After his friend Joshua Macmillan (son of Maurice Macmillan) died, Marks swore off ever getting involved with hard drugs.[8] Among his other friends at Balliol were the epidemiologist Julian Peto and the journalist Lynn Barber.[8] Through a mixture of cheating and last minute cramming, he passed his finals; this was despite months of taking drugs rather than attending classes and a serious infection he developed a few weeks before the exams.[9]
In 1967 he began teacher training, and married Ilze Kadegis, a Latvian student at St. Anne's College, Oxford, who was also training to become a teacher.[10] He gave up teacher training to continue his education at the University of London (1967–68; Grad. Inst P.), then back to Balliol, Oxford (1968–69; Dip HPh Sc), and then on to the University of Sussex (1969–70) to study philosophy of science.[11]
Drug empire[edit]
Though involved with drugs at university, he sold cannabis only to his friends or acquaintances until 1970, when he was persuaded to assist Graham Plinston, who had been arrested in Germany on drug trafficking charges.[12] Through Plinston he met Mohammed Durrani, a Pakistani hashish exporter who was a descendant of the Durranis who had run Afghanistan in the 19th century.[13] With Plinston behind bars, Durrani offered Marks the opportunity to sell the drug on a large scale in London, and he agreed to the proposition.[14] He formed a four-way partnership with Charlie Radcliffe, Charlie Weatherly and a dealer named Jarvis. Durrani never contacted them, and so the group acquired smaller quantities of hashish from various sources and began selling the drug on in Oxford, Brighton and London.[15] After six months he returned to Germany to help bail Plinston out of jail. Marks was a useful means of transferring money as he did not have a criminal record.[16]
Now a free man, Plinston gave Marks a job transporting hashish in Frankfurt; Marks in turn hired a New Zealand smuggler named Lang as his driver.[17] After paying Marks £5,000 for his work in Frankfurt, Plinston then sold hashish on to Marks and his three friends (Radcliffe, Weatherly and Jarvis) in London; in selling on 650 kilos within a week, the four men made a profit of £20,000.[18] Durrani then arranged for hashish to be smuggled in the furniture of Pakistani diplomats who were moving to London; Marks would then intercept the furniture to find the drugs – this arrangement netted him a profit of £7,500.[19] Marks expanded his enterprise, employing two friends from Wales, Mike Bell and David Thomas, to stash the drugs and help with transportation.[20] The gang became unsatisfied with the way the profits were being split (80% of the money they made went to Durrani) and contacted James McCann, a gunrunner for the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA).[21] Marks and Plinston persuaded McCann to smuggle hashish into Ireland from Kabul, which the pair would then ferry over to Wales and into England;[22] McCann would get the drugs into Ireland through the freeport at Shannon Airport using his IRA connections.[23] Marks avoided the attention of HM Revenue and Customs by creating a paper trail that indicated he made his money from selling stamps and dresses.[24]
By 1972, he was making £50,000 with each shipment.[25] By the end of the year he was approached by Hamilton McMillan of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), a friend from Oxford University, who recruited Marks to work for MI6 because of his connections in the hashish-producing countries of Lebanon, Pakistan and Afghanistan, for his ability to seduce women, and for his contacts with the IRA.[26] The next year, Marks began exporting cannabis to the United States to The Brotherhood of Eternal Love, hiding the drugs in the music equipment of fictional British pop groups that were supposed to be touring the country; he further expanded his operations with other smugglers and other methods of trafficking, often using his Oxford connections.[27] As McCann was in danger of being executed by the IRA should MI6 tip them off about his involvement in drugs, Marks then gave up the smuggling operation at Shannon airport.[28] Following the Littlejohn affair, MI6 ceased their relationship with Marks, while his American operation came to an end after police opened a speaker full of cannabis and arrested gang member James Gater, leading to other arrests in Europe.[29] Marks was arrested by Dutch police in 1973, but skipped bail in April 1974; the British press then made him a nationally known figure, reporting that he was feared abducted by the IRA for his connections with MI6.[30] With most of his fortune confiscated by the authorities, he made his way to Italy, where he lived in a Winnebago for three months before returning to England in secret in October 1974.[31] At this point he began a relationship with Judy Lane;[32] the couple married in 1980 and had three children together. He had previously been in a five-year relationship with Rosie Lewis, with whom he had a daughter.
Marks then connected Ernie Combs, member of The Brotherhood of Eternal Love, with John Denbigh, a man with connections in the hashish-producing nation of Nepal.[33] With the help of the Yakuza, large quantities of the drug would be exported to John F. Kennedy International Airport in the guise of air conditioning equipment, where Don Brown's mob (headed by Carmine Galante) would then take possession of the drugs.[34] A 500-kilo deal was set up and executed on 4 July 1975, leaving Marks a wealthy man.[35] Other deals up to 750 kilos followed, and Marks continued to live under assumed names in the United Kingdom.[35] In 1976 he travelled to America, and set up a 1,000-kilo deal between Combs and 'Lebanese Sam' – making himself £300,000 in the process;[36] he continued to regularly set up deals between his various American and Far East connections. In need of a new identity after his alias of Anthony Tunnicliffe was compromised in a police sting, in 1978 he bought Donald Nice's passport.[37]

"Between 1975 and 1978, twenty-four loads totalling 55,000 pounds of marijuana and hashish had been successfully imported through John F. Kennedy Airport, New York. They had involved the Mafia, the Yakuza, the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, the Thai army, the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Pakistani Armed Forces, Nepalese monks, and other individuals from all walks of life. The total profit made by all concerned was $48,000,000. They'd had a good run."
— Marks concluding the JFK episode of drug trafficking in his Mr Nice autobiography; the run had ended after the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) began intercepting the drugs and arresting Mafia associates in New York.[38]

In the late 1970s, the Trafficante crime family, under the leadership of Santo Trafficante, Jr., were importing Colombian cannabis into the US on freighter ships, thus driving down the price of the drug on the streets in America.[39] In December 1979, Trafficante exported 50 tons of cannabis direct from Colombia to Marks and his contacts in the UK, enough to supply the entire British market for the drug for almost a year.[40] In 1980, Marks was arrested by customs officers for his part in importing £15 million of cannabis; police had followed associates of the Trafficante family to a large stash of cannabis.[41] When arrested, he was in possession of numerous pieces of incriminating evidence, as well as £30,000 in cash.[42] Defended by Lord Hutchinson, Marks pleaded 'Not Guilty', concocting a story that he was an agent for MI6 (concealing the fact that his relation with MI6 ended in 1973) and the Mexican Secret Service that had set up an identity as a drug smuggler in order to close the net on James McCann (wanted in Britain for his IRA activities).[43] The jury found him innocent of drug smuggling, but guilty of using false passports and Marks was sentenced to two years imprisonment, but was released after five days having already served most of this time before sentencing was passed.[44] HM Customs then arrested him for his part of a 1973 smuggling operation but following a plea bargain and time off for remission he served just three months of a three-year sentence.[45]
Released in May 1982, though with most of his employees still in prison for the crime Marks was found innocent of, he spent the next year running a legitimate wine importing business but he continued to spend more money than he was making and the savings he made from drug smuggling in the 1970s began to dwindle.[46] In 1983, McCann was still at large and his smuggling enterprise was flourishing; he offered Marks the chance to sell 250 kilos of cannabis and Marks accepted.[47] Dutch police confiscated the full shipment and arrested Mickey Williams, a member of the London underworld who had agreed to help Marks on the deal.[48] Marks then travelled to the Far East to set up cannabis deals with Salim Malik, a Pakistani hashish exporter who he had met through Durrani (Durrani had since suffered a fatal heart attack) and Phil Sparrowhawk, an exporter from Bangkok; they would smuggle their product over to Ernie Combs in America.[49] He also arranged a 500-kilo deal with Mickey Williams, who had travelled to Bangkok after his release from prison in Amsterdam.[50] Marks laundered his money through various fronts: a travel agency, a paper mill, a wine importers, a bulk water transportation company and a secretarial service.[51]
In 1984, he was approached to sell $300,000 worth of cannabis to a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent looking to fund and arm the Mujahideen in their war against the Soviet occupation (Operation Cyclone).[52] The agent's contact on the APL ship suffered a heart attack and died on the journey to the US, leaving the drugs in the hands of US officials; the agent subsequently fled to Brazil to avoid prosecution.[53] Though under surveillance, Marks continued to expand his underworld operations and set up a massage parlour in a Bangkok hotel with the help of Phil Sparrowhawk and Lord Moynihan.[54] In 1986, he settled in Majorca,[55] and continued to make vast sums smuggling Salim Malik's hashish into America.[56] The DEA were meanwhile tapping Marks's phones and keeping him under surveillance and having arrested Ernie Combs they came close to busting a large shipment of cannabis, when Marks was tipped off; the ship was redirected to Mauritius and the operation aborted.[57] As he continued to avoid DEA stings he continued to make millions and continued to add to his underworld contacts, finding that he could use Chinese triads to launder his drug money more effectively.[58]

"A Philippine-brothel-owning member of the House of Lords [Moynihan] was staying at the house of a Spanish Chief Inspector of Police [Rafael Llofriu]. The Lord was being watched by an American CIA operative who was staying at the house of an English convicted sex offender [Jim Hobbs]. The CIA operative was sharing accommodation with an IRA terrorist [McCann]. The IRA terrorist was discussing a Moroccan hashish deal with a Georgian pilot of Colombia's Medellín Cartel. Organising these scenarios was an ex-MI6 agent [Marks], currently supervising the sale of thirty tons of Thai weed in Canada and at whose house could be found Pakistan's major supplier of hashish [Malik]. Attempting to understand the scenarios was a solitary DEA agent. The stage was set for something."
— The DEA's efforts to apprehend Marks were made extremely difficult thanks to the many wide-ranging contacts Marks had; in September 1987 many of these contacts were with Marks in Palma.[59]

When friends of his were busted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Marks decided to retire from drug smuggling to concentrate on his legitimate businesses; citing the fate of his friends and contacts, who were either in jail, informing the DEA or smuggling heavier drugs.[60] In 1988, DEA agent Craig Lovato arrested both Howard and Judy Marks and extradited the couple to the United States.[61] Arrests of those involved in Marks's various criminal activities were made in Britain, Spain, the Philippines, Thailand, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Switzerland, the United States and Canada.[62] This was the work of 'Operation Eclectic', set up in 1986 by both the DEA and Scotland Yard and aided by numerous law enforcement organisations from around the world.[63]
Trial and imprisonment[edit]
Marks was taken from Palma to Modelo prison in Barcelona,[64] and then to Alcala-Meco in Madrid.[65] There he was handed a 40-page document which detailed the allegations of his drug smuggling activities between 1970 and 1987, charging him with operating a racket as described in the RICO act.[66] In his autobiography, Marks stated that "although the charge against Judy and some others were absurd, the formal accusations against me, in general terms, were true."[67] The recently passed Sentencing Reform Act meant that he was facing a minimum of ten years to a maximum life sentence without the possibility for parole.[68] The Audiencia Nacional ordered his extradition to Florida.[69] After being shown the prosecution evidence against him, Marks attempted to construct the defence that his smuggling operations were directed to Australia and that he never exported to the United States, and therefore never broke US law.[70] He again cultivated the myth that he was a spy for MI6, and claimed that he was set up by the CIA because he had discovered that CIA agents were smuggling drugs into Australia.[71] He and his lawyers spent hours reviewing the phone tapping evidence to make the coded conversations about smuggling into America seem to suggest that the drugs were actually being smuggled into Australia; research was done into weather patterns to prove tentative links between what was said by Marks and his associates and what was happening at the time in Australia.[72] Marks and his wife were extradited in 1989, and he was given the Miranda rights on the flight from Spain to the US.[73]
In Florida, Judy pleaded guilty to her small part in the racket and was released, having already served some months in prison in Spain.[74] The money Marks made from his smuggling operations was spent on legal fees.[75] He refused to plea-bargain or to inform on his associates, gambling that he could again convince a jury that the authorities had got the wrong man.[76] As the trial began in July 1990, Peter Lane, his brother-in-law and fellow smuggler, wrote to Marks to inform him that he was going to testify against Marks in court to get a more lenient sentence himself.[77] Marks still was confident of beating the DEA in court, but Ernie Combs also agreed to testify for the prosecution so as to secure the release of his wife, and Marks had little choice but to change his plea to guilty to racketeering charges.[78] He was sentenced to 25 years in jail and given a $50,000 fine; though he had originally been sentenced to 15 years he was taken back into court after the judge realised he had misspoken and said that his 10 and 15-year sentences were to run consecutively and not, as he had originally stated, concurrently.[79]
He spent seven years imprisoned in the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute, Indiana, a rough prison. He had originally been sentenced to Butner, but agent Lovato insisted that he instead serve time at Terre Haute.[80] One of the six most secure prisons in the country, Terre Haute had the worst reputation of the six for gang rape and violence.[81] Despite this, Marks remained on good terms with the many violent inmates housed there as he was "British and a famous non-rat" and avoided conflict "by being nice, charming, and eccentric".[82] During his time there he befriended many notorious criminals and members of four of the reputed Five Families, including: Gennaro "Gerry Lang" Langella (Colombo crime family); James "Jimmy C" Coonan, John "Johnny Carnegs" Carneglia, Vittorio "Little Vic" Amuso, and Frank "Frankie Loc" LoCascio (Gambino crime family); Anthony "Bruno" Indelicato (Bonanno crime family); and Joey Testa (Lucchese crime family).[82] He also made friends with Veronza Bowers, Jr. (Black Panther Party) and 'Big Jim' of the Outlaw motorcycle club.[82]
Owing to his status as an Oxford University graduate with alleged connections to the British Secret Intelligence Service he was treated as a potential escapee and spent many weeks in solitary confinement, though he never attempted to escape or threatened other prisoners or prison staff.[83] During his time in prison he found success as a jailhouse lawyer for the other inmates, securing one overturned conviction.[84] He gave up cigarettes for the last three years of his sentence.[85] In January 1995, Marks was granted parole after a prison officer testified that he was a model prisoner who spent much of his time helping his fellow prisoners pass their GED exams.[86] He was released in April 1995.[87]
Life after release[edit]
Acting[edit]
He acted in gangster movie Killer Bitch (2010),[88] starred in the film I Know You Know (2009),[89] appeared as Satan in the 2006 movie adaptation of the Dirty Sanchez television series,[90] and had a cameo appearance in the film Human Traffic (1999).[91] He appeared as himself in AmStarDam (aka "Stoner Express") (2016).
Advocacy and politics[edit]
Marks stood for election to the UK Parliament in 1997, on the single issue of the legalisation of cannabis.[92] He contested four seats at once - Norwich South (against future Home Secretary Charles Clarke), Norwich North, Neath and Southampton Test - and picked up around 1% of the vote.[92] This led to the formation of the Legalise Cannabis Alliance (LCA) by Alun Buffry in 1999; the party reformed as Cannabis Law Reform in 2011.[93]
He also argued for the legalisation of cannabis in numerous television programmes in the United Kingdom. On 1 October 2010, he was interviewed on Ireland's The Late Late Show.[94]
Books[edit]
Following his release from prison, Marks published an autobiography, Mr Nice (1996), which has been translated into several languages.[95][96] He also compiled an anthology called The Howard Marks Book of Dope Stories (2001)[97] and more recently a follow-on from his autobiography: Señor Nice: Straight Life From Wales to South America.[98] Señor Nice differs from his previous book as drugs are not central to the story and, while autobiographical, the book is more Marks's own exploration of his ancestor, the pirate Sir Henry Morgan.[99] In 2011, he penned the thriller Sympathy for the Devil.
Marks held a series of book-readings into 2014. In these live events he regaled his audiences with tales of his smuggling days and his time in prison, as well as offered insight into drug production and the arguments for legalisation of cannabis.
Comics and videogame[edit]
Marks and comic writer Pat Mills collaborated on comic strips which tied in with Sony's inFamous 2 video game.[100]
Music[edit]
In the music world, he appeared as a guest on the BBC music quiz show Never Mind the Buzzcocks.[101] He also collaborated with Welsh group Super Furry Animals on their album Fuzzy Logic (released May 1996) and on their singles "The Man Don't Give a Fuck" and "Ice Hockey Hair".[102] He featured on the album Angel Headed Hip Hop (2009) with Lee Harris and River Styx.[103] He also worked with former Happy Mondays guitarist Kav Sandhu,[104] and appeared at numerous British music festivals, including: (Glastonbury 2009 and 2011),[105] Beautiful Days,[106] RockNess,[107] Camp Bestival,[108] Kendal Calling,[109] and the Sonisphere Festival.[110] He was featured on the Reverend & The Makers track "MDMAzing" on their third album @Reverend Makers (2012).
Works about Marks[edit]
Marks was the subject of the biography High Time (1984) written by David Leigh.
Marks was also the subject of the film Mr. Nice (2010), named after his eponymous 1997 autobiography.[111] The film featured Rhys Ifans as Marks and Chloë Sevigny as his wife Judy.[112]
In 2013, Marks recounted his story in an episode of the television series Banged Up Abroad.
Death[edit]
On 25 January 2015, it was announced that Marks had inoperable colorectal cancer.[113] He died of the disease on 10 April 2016, at the age of 70.[114]

Customer Questions & Answers








            Could I use this on outside furniture?
        

            I have a wood piece that is often outside and quite dry -- with some light sanding would this help to restore the finish? I would rather try this then endless sanding, refinishing and clear coating...
        
Asked by: Restore

            I would just clean the furniture, scrub with steel wool as per the instructions, and apply a few coats of this product. It is fantastic!

            I recently cleaned and restained a walnut desk and the used Teak oil to preserve the wood. Can I use this product ?
        

            After the real oil finish dried I buffed it out with a clean cloth, but noticed some &quot;dry&quot; spots. Will this product be able to produce a uniform sheen?
        
Asked by: BobbyK

            Yes, but you will have to reapply it after a time to renew the look.

Love this stuff!  Does an amazing job for a minimal amount of effort and money.  Used this on the kitchen and bathroom cabinets in a house we were listing to sell 4 yrs ago and it greatly improved the appearance.  Bought it again last month to restore the color/richness to wood stained cabinets in the bathrooms of a rental property with again...very amazing results!  Fantastic product and available in so many colors.

I think this is one of the best "miracle" finishing products out there. I recently put them on my ash kitchen cabinets and WOW was I happy I did! I first cleaned them well and put a coat of the walnut finish on. It made them a bit darker (wanted that) and after added new knobs from HD, My cabinets now look new....I'm not kidding, even friends that came by said WOW!! Get this and you won't be sorry....

        This product is AMAZING!!!
I used this product on my wood floors and got incredible results. I have now done all floors in my house and done the steps. I live in a 200 year old house with original floors! I followed the simple directions and applied two coats of the product. I even touched up all the furniture that was in the rooms too! If you do not want to sand and strip floors and create all that dust and extra work, this is the product for you! I promise you will love the results! I am including pictures so you can see how amazing this product is! Go buy it, you will not be disappointed!

Researched different options...paint, attempting to re-stain, reface or complete replacement ($$$!) of medium walnut raised panel kitchen cabinets that are in good condition otherwise.    There are problems with each option, mentioned in kitchen rehab (often horror) stories on the net.   So I gave this product a try.  Didn't have much to lose, as the finish was deteriorating in various areas, especially around the sink and cutlery drawer.  I used the Restorer in combination with the 0000 steel wool and finished with the Howard polish.   My wife (final judge) said the cabinets look like they did 20-years ago...even in areas where the (poly?) varnish was flaking off.  I think the steel wool helps smooth these flaking areas.   The cabinets have an even color, non-blotchy appearance.   Exceeded my expectations that this was a glorified Old English treatment.     Relatively low odor for a solvent-based product.  Wear gloves and have plenty of rags to wipe off excess product.    Incredibly cheap compared with other restoration choices, presuming you can live with the stain color you have....we can, and we saved a ton of money.

        try it before you strip it!
I can't say enough about this product--it does exactly what it says it will do. I used it in conjunction with the Feed-N-Wax and my furniture was basically revitalized. I was very skeptical, but the first piece I tried it on was in such sorry shape that I figured that I couldn't make it any worse. Surprisingly, it worked like a charm and now I have beautiful furniture that I don't have to strip and refinish, and the original finish looks better than ever, which is even better! I am so happy that I found this product I am planning on buying the other colors to try on other furniture!

        Exceptional buy!
Was skeptical at first but thought I had nothing to lose! So glad I tried it! We're talking bathroom cabinets from a house built in '85. I bought the Walnut coloring. Extremely easy to apply with the 0000 Steel Wool after cleaning first with mineral spirits. Bought the Feed n Wax product also and the cabinets came out beautiful. We don't have the money to replace cabinets so this find is terrific!!!! Any wood furniture, doors and cabinetry in the house will be spruced up within the next few weeks. Couldn't be happier with this product! Don't take my word for it, what do you have to lose?

        Excellent Product
If this rating system had provision for ten stars I would rate as such. Being both a woodworker and a skeptic, I had to see to believe. I had three bad white heat/moisture rings on my dining-table top and was prepared for the worst to restore it but within five minutes of application, they were all but gone. Another application will be necessary to completely remove the very faint spot on the worst one.
-
I also applied a coat to our 50 year old, distressed, fruit-wood finish bedroom set where the finish was actually beginning to turn milky white in many places from dryness and sun damage. My wife wanted to paint it - uh, no. This product restored it to like new almost immediately. Nicest part of all was that a 6-drawer dresser and 5-drawer high-boy took less than 30 minutes and under three ounces to restore and wipe down. This is a ten!!!

Latest memo from Howard Marks: Lines in the Sand




In my 2016 year-end review, which went only to clients, I included a discussion of the use of subscription lines by closed-end funds in areas such as private equity, real estate, distressed debt and private credit.  It’s my impression that their use has become fairly pervasive in recent years, and in response to clients’ requests and market trends, Oaktree has utilized subscription lines in some of its newer funds.  
 
That year-end note prompted some interesting and spirited discussion of lines and their merit and effect.  Thus I decided to write this memo on the topic for general circulation.
 
How Do Subscription Lines Work?
As I wrote in the year-end review, subscription lines are bank loans extended to funds that enable them to use borrowed money, rather than LP capital, to make early investments or pay fees and expenses.  While there is no universal description, I believe it’s safe to say in general that subscription lines:
 


are limited as a percentage of the LPs’ capital commitments.(Commitments from the most creditworthy LPs earn a 90% advance rate, and commitments from lesser credits earn lower advance rates or, in some cases, zero), 
are secured by the LPs’ capital commitments, and 
generally must be repaid in the early or middle part of the fund’s life (unless extended), although terms are beginning to lengthen.


 
The key element is that a subscription line can substitute for LP capital, but it can’t be used to allow the fund to invest more than its committed capital.  That is, a $100 million fund with a subscription line might be able to buy $50 million of assets without calling LP capital, but it still can’t invest more than $100 million in total (other than by recycling proceeds from liquidated investments).  The bottom line is that essentially all subscription line financing does is defer the calling of LP capital.
 
So the starting point for this discussion is the fact that these lines lever LP capital but do not lever funds in the sense of allowing funds to invest more than their committed capital.  Fund-level debt that allows funds to invest more than their committed capital is different from subscription lines and not my subject here.
 


What Are the Effects?

Since a subscription line doesn’t lever a fund, its use doesn’t increase the total dollar profits that the fund will earn from investments over its lifetime (assuming the GP makes the same investments that it would have made if the fund didn’t have a line).
 
Also, the use of a subscription line – obviously – doesn’t alter the fund’s committed or invested capital.  Thus, assuming all LP capital eventually is drawn, the fund’s ratio of distributions to LP capital – either the multiple of committed capital (MOCC) or the multiple of invested capital (MOC) – isn’t improved by the use of a line.
 
So much for what isn’t changed.  The question, then, is “what is?”  First the positives:
 



The original purpose of subscription lines was (a) to enable GPs to make investments and pay fund fees and expenses without frequent capital calls and (b) to prevent opportunistic funds that don’t sit on large amounts of cash from missing out on attractive investments requiring quick funding.More recently, however, their use has grown for the additional reasons discussed below.



 


With calls for LP capital postponed, the reported Internal Rate of Return or IRR in the early years – the dollar-weighted return on LP capital – will increase substantially (assuming the early profits exceed the interest and expenses on the line).
 

The use of borrowed money can reduce or even eliminate the deleterious impact on early returns of the so-called “J-curve.”The J-curve results from (a) the fact that in a fund’s early years, management fees are usually charged on total committed capital, while a relatively small percentage of the capital has been put to work, and (b) the tendency of private investments to take a while to show results. 
 



Over the course of a fund’s life, LP capital will typically be called for investments or to repay the borrowings under the subscription line. This will cause the ratio of subscription line capital employed to LP capital to decline. As a result, the fund’s IRR will retreat from its elevated early level and move down toward what it would have been if the fund hadn’t employed a subscription line. However, all other things being equal, the fund’s lifetime IRR will remain higher than it otherwise would have been, since the impact of using the line will taper off but not reverse. 
 



Finally, any committed capital that hasn’t been called because of borrowing under the line will remain in the hands of the LPs.Thus any return the LPs earn on the uncalled capital in excess of their share of the fund’s subscription line costs will be additive to their results.


 
What about the negatives?
 


If a fund finances investments by borrowing under a subscription line, interest and expenses will be paid that wouldn’t have been paid if LP capital had been called instead.The payment of these costs, even with interest rates below LIBOR+2%, is a permanent net negative for the fund: since the fund isn’t becoming levered, it won’t be offset by an increase in dollar profits (see above).Thus it eats into the fund’s dollar lifetime gains as well as its multiple of capital.


 
Some LPs may actually want to have their capital called and earn their preferred return.  That will jibe with their expectations and preserve the historic hurdle for incentive fees.  The preferred return that must be earned before the GP receives incentive fees is calculated based on how much LP capital has been called and for how long it has remained outstanding.  Thus the use of a subscription line in lieu of LP capital shrinks the dollar preferred return hurdle.  Lowering the hurdle can increase the GP’s probability of collecting incentive fees and cause the payment of incentive fees to the GP to begin sooner, although it will have no effect on the amount of incentive fees ultimately paid by a fund that would easily have cleared the percentage hurdle rate if it hadn’t used a line.  (At the same time, however, the interest and expenses paid on the line will reduce the fund’s lifetime net dollar gains, and thus the eventual amount of incentive fees received by the GP.  The interaction of these effects can be complex.)  
 


Less disciplined or less diligent GPs may be induced to lower the standards to which they subject investments because (a) their effective cost of capital seems so low and/or (b) they perceive an increased likelihood that the reported IRR will exceed the preferred return hurdle and thus a greater potential to earn incentive fees.
 

Some LPs seek to avoid so-called Unrelated Business Taxable Income (“UBTI”).Without getting into further details, suffice it to say the use of subscription lines increases the risk of UBTI to these LPs.
 

Since each LP’s commitment to the fund is an essential part of the bank’s collateral, the existence of a line could conceivably complicate the process of selling an LP interest in a secondary transaction, in particular if the would-be buyer is less creditworthy. 
 

As the use of subscription lines increases, many banks are requiring greater and more intrusive information on the financial wherewithal of fund LPs to ensure the sufficiency of collateral.Some LPs are now starting to push back on providing this information, while others are expressly demanding to be excluded from borrowings, which can create an awkward dynamic among the LPs and between the LPs and GP.


 
Given the existence of so many pros and cons, what factors have caused the use of subscription lines to become widespread?  I believe they’re these:
 
For LPs:


the desire for high reported IRRs,
better cash management, including fewer drawdowns, and
the potential to use their capital more efficiently (i.e., to use undrawn capital to make investments that may add to overall profits)
           


For GPs:



the expectation that higher IRRs will enhance their reputations and enable them to raise more money,
the potential to lower the hurdle that must be cleared before incentive fees are received,
the ability to enhance reported results in a low-return world or mask otherwise-low investment returns, and
defensively, a way to be competitive with other GPs who raise IRRs through the use of lines





Impact on Fund Performance Metrics
The most important question in assessing fund performance is clear:  Did the GP do a good job?  It’s a simple question, but answering it is anything but.  In particular, if a fund that used a subscription line shows a high IRR, does that confirm that the GP did a good job?  
 
Since a fund’s total dollar profits and multiple of capital aren’t improved by the use of a subscription line, the increase in IRR, while pleasant, might be thought of as illusory.  Remember, as I wrote in a 2006 memo with the same title, you can’t eat IRR.
 
My basic point in that memo was that what really matters is how much money an LP makes as a result of having committed to a fund.  It’s that simple.
 
But the deeper message was that, while valuable, neither IRR nor MOCC nor MOC – nor any other single metric – is sufficient to tell us whether the GP did a good job.  There are many elements that must be taken into account, and if you hold all the others equal, one metric might be sufficient to answer the question.  But the others rarely are equal.  For example:
 


A high IRR certainly is desirable. But that’s what a fund can show if the GP makes only one investment, with a small fraction of the fund’s committed capital, and that investment produces a substantial profit.For example, if a $100 million fund invests $1 million in something and sells it a month later for $2 million, that doubling will annualize to an IRR of roughly 400,000%.And if that’s the only investment the GP makes, that’ll be the fund’s IRR, too.But it certainly doesn’t mean the GP did a good job – I doubt the LP who committed $10 million to the fund will be happy with $10.1 million back in the end. 
 
To understand what an IRR really says about fund performance, you have to know what percentage of the capital was called and how long the GP held onto it.  In short, LPs want to see their committed capital become fully invested and remain invested at solid rates of return for a long time.  That’s the formula for a big gain.  A high return earned on a small amount of capital for a brief period doesn’t help in that regard.  High annualized IRRs on investments of less than a year can be especially misleading.
 

A big multiple of invested capital is good, too.But it also may be of limited significance.Let’s say the GP of that $100 million fund invests $10 million, keeps it invested for the fund’s entire ten-year life, and earns an annual return of 15% on that investment.That will result in proceeds of $40 million and thus an MOC of 4x.That’s great for the LPs . . . as far as it goes.But if that’s the only investment the GP makes, the LPs collectively will earn profits of only $30 million, certainly not what they had in mind when they committed $100 million to the fund.So, again, to know if the GP did a good job, you have to know what percentage of the committed capital was invested and how long the investment was outstanding.You have to know what the GP did with the entire commitment, not just the part that was invested.
 

Finally, a big multiple of committed capital sounds almost perfect.But it, too, isn’t sufficient.Let’s say all of the fund’s $100 million of committed capital is invested, and $300 million comes back to LPs, for an MOCC of 3x.That’s good, isn’t it?That depends on how long the GP kept that $100 million.If it took six years to turn $100 million into $300 million, the IRR on the fund is 20%.But if it took ten years to generate the same proceeds and MOCC, the IRR is just 11.6%.So it’s not enough to know how much capital was invested and how much was returned.We have to know how long the process took.


 
The answer is simple.  In order to be able to assess fund performance, we have to know:
 


how much capital was committed, 
how much capital was invested, 
how long it was kept invested, and 
how much was returned to LPs.


 
IRR, MOCC and MOC are all significant indicators, but none of them takes all four of those parameters into consideration.  Thus no single metric is sufficient to tell us how good a job a GP did.  We have to consider multiple metrics, and sometimes they will give conflicting answers.  Fund A may look better on one of them and Fund B on another.  So this is really just one more way in which investing isn’t subject to easy answers.  Performance assessment requires consulting a variety of performance metrics; considering other factors as well, some of which are subjective  (like how risky the portfolio was); and making judgments regarding the results.  
 
One fund with a higher IRR didn’t necessarily outperform another.  And, provocatively, a fund that used a subscription line and came in with a high IRR may not have done as good a job – or made its LPs as much money – as one that didn’t use a line (or used a line less extensively) and reported a lower IRR.    
 
Let’s take that to its logical extreme.  What if the typical race to the bottom happens at the banks, making financing available on ever-easier terms?  What if we reach a point where GPs are able to obtain lines equal in size to the vast majority of their LPs’ commitments and keep the borrowings outstanding for most of the funds’ life?  In that case, there will be little need for a GP to draw LP capital, and even low returns on investments could give rise to ultra-high IRRs at the fund level.  The bottom line on all this is that the use of subscription lines sheds considerable doubt on the significance of IRR.  And when IRR becomes suspect, anyone wanting to evaluate fund results has no choice but to put greater emphasis on the multiple of capital.
 


Bigger Questions
All the above discussion is essentially mechanical, regarding matters of arithmetic.  But there are other questions surrounding subscription lines that involve investment risk, and some that have bigger consequences . . . even potentially systemic.  
 
Investments are invariably viewed as safe when it is assumed that the things that should happen will happen.  But I always hasten to point out that “should” isn’t the same as “will.”
 
Let’s consider the process that’s supposed to apply with subscription line borrowings:
 


The GP organizes a fund and arranges for a subscription line.
LPs commit capital.
The LPs put in an actual or virtual lock-box the funds they’ll need when capital is called.
The GP uses borrowings under the subscription line to pay for investments, in lieu of calling LP capital. 
When the subscription line reaches its end, LP capital is called and the line is repaid.


 
That’s what’s supposed to happen.  But there are ways in which actual events can deviate from that idealized progression.  Most of these would be the result of negative developments in the financial markets or the larger world.
 


Since the use of subscription lines results in there being fewer but larger capital calls, the magnitude of potential defaults by LPs is increased, along with the potential consequences.
 

Suppose the fund makes $5 million of investments against an LP’s $10 million commitment – borrowing $5 million on the line – and there’s a financial crisis (or the investments simply turn out to be big losers) and those investments decline in value to $2 million.And suppose the line comes due, the fund calls $5 million from the LP with which to repay it, and the LP – perhaps receiving simultaneous capital calls from a number of similarly affected managers – concludes it’s in its best interest (or its fiduciary duty) to NOT put up $5 million to secure investments now worth $2 million.Instead, it defaults on the capital call, depriving the fund of capital, potentially limiting the fund’s ability to repay the line and/or make further investments, and thereby possibly harming the remaining LPs.(Please note, however, that strategic defaults are an extreme hypothetical, since they would expose LPs to penalties, lawsuits and the forfeiture of their assets in the fund, in addition to the obvious reputational consequences.)
 

Some funds (although none of Oaktree’s) rely on subscription lines that are due on demand, rather than at the end of a stated term.What would be the effect if a large number of those lines were pulled simultaneously during a financial crisis?Or what if regulators required banks to call in their lines, even those that aren’t callable or whose terms haven’t expired? 
 

There’s no question that the increasing use of subscription lines is altering the pattern of drawdowns and distributions.Going years without seeing much capital called could convince an LP that calls have become less likely.Suppose that, in response, rather than set aside capital equal to its commitments, the LP puts it into other investments.Although subscription lines don’t result in funds becoming levered, this kind of behavior can result in the LP becoming levered (i.e., having total investments plus commitments that exceed its available capital).Now suppose a financial crisis brings large losses to fund investments in general.If the LP has made excess commitments, it could (a) suffer levered losses and (b) be forced to liquidate marketable securities in a crisis to satisfy capital calls in connection with their commitments to closed-end funds.Taken to a hopefully unrealistic extreme, could this cause LPs to become insolvent and banks to experience a wave of defaults on these lines?


 
Market meltdowns and financial crises can increase the probability that banks will recall lines and decrease the probability that all LPs will meet the calls.  If an LP has taken advantage of subscription line financing to become more than 100% committed, it might be more likely to default on the calls. 
 
If a fund has diversified commitment sources and just a couple of LPs default, the fund will probably manage just fine.  But suppose many LPs default?  In that circumstance it’s easy to imagine a fund being forced to sell assets during a market downturn to pay off its line and/or lacking the capital it thought it would have with which to take advantage of market opportunities.  Both outcomes could be very negative for funds and LPs alike.
 
The obligations of the LPs in a fund with a subscription line are interrelated; for example, one LP’s default on its capital commitment requires the other LPs to contribute more (up to the amount of their commitment) to repay the subscription line.  Could this mean that failures by some LPs would increase the likelihood of failures by others?  In the extreme, if defaults on lines are widespread, could lines become a source of significant risk to banks? 
 
In order to figure out the full impact of the use of subscription lines, one would have to know what LPs do with the uncalled capital during the period before it’s drawn by the funds.  It does seem, however, that subscription lines may be adding to risk at a variety of levels.
 
These hypothetical examples imagine financial crises, asset meltdowns and – in some cases – less-than-conservative behavior on the part of LPs.  They’re all unlikely.  But are they impossible?  It’s mostly during crises that weaknesses are exposed, things that are supposed to happen fail to do so, and unanticipated consequences and linkages manifest themselves.
 
As I mentioned at the outset, some Oaktree funds have made use of subscription lines, in recognition of the advantages described above and because many of our LPs – almost all of which are sophisticated institutional investors capable of understanding how lines work and their pros and cons – have indicated that they want us to do so.  However, I can report that the concerns discussed above have caused us to begin an internal process to develop guidelines intended to mitigate the risks of subscription lines while preserving their benefits. 
 
The key to financial security – individual or societal – doesn’t lie in counting on things to work in good times or on average.  Rather, it consists of figuring out what can go wrong in bad times, and of only doing things that will prove survivable even if they materialize.  Has anyone thought through all the implications of closed-end funds’ increasing use of subscription lines?  Are they all tolerable, for the individual parties and for the financial system?  I haven’t read much on this subject, but we should all be thinking about it.  That’s the reason I’m writing today.

            If it matches the color, I believe it could. But a spot repair might stand out depending on how well your floor is. If you use that, use the Howard's beeswax as well, that will help maintain the durability. Myself I've only used it on some Hawaiian Bowls my mother had and a desk, and they came out great.

The results are simply amazing! Much better than I expected. In getting ready to sell our home this spring wanted to find a simple, cheap, and fairly easy way to refresh our kitchen and bathroom cabinets. Thought I'd try this product after looking for something that might do the job. Started in one of the bathrooms and was very pleased. I tend to be a bit skeptical of things that seem too easy so Ive done a bit more prep work than the directions call for, after all, our cabinets show every bit of their 25+ years of age and use.
I used a verssiion of "scotch-brite" abrasive pads though with a finer abrasive level. (these can be found at some hardwarestores or on line) After pulling the doors off the hinges and removed all hardware then carefull cleaned everything very well, then went over the outer surfaces with an "extra fine" (maroon) pad, paying particular attention to the corners and details etc. Wiped them down with a damp cloth and gave them another breif session with "ultra fine" (beige) pads. then after cleaning the dust off again and giving them a good 30 minutes to dry, used the beige pad to apply the Howard product, fairly liberaly and keeping the pad wet. After letting it soak in for 10 minutes or so, wiped them off with a clean rag (old t-shirt) and after another 5-10 minutes repeated another coat of Howards and wiped it off this time almost imeadiatly - I wanted to avoid darkening the cabinets too much. After waiting overnite I put the cabinets back together and gave them a coat of paste wax .... They look very good, even the worst areas of the cabinets under the kitchen sink look good, not quite like new but close to it. 
Great product. I on using it on some interior doors and woodwork as well. Big improvment for not a lot of work, and not a lot of money. Just do the prep and make sure the surfaces are clean, free of grease, and dry.

I used this product on some bowls that my parents had purchased in 1958. After seeing the results of what they looked like when completed, I was very impressed. I let my mother see them and she liked them as well.

        Best product to refinish kitchen cabinets
We have 25 year old oak cabinets in our kitchen and the ones under the sink had water stains causing the clear finish to whiten. We tried other similar products and were about to strip the doors completely when a friend recommended the Howard Restor-a-Finish product.

I can't say enough about the product regarding the restoration of the woodwork on both the doors and the frames of the cabinets. The dull white streaks are gone and after applying their wax product the doors look brand new. It's not back breaking or difficult, you simply wipe on the finish with steel wool and then wipe it with a dry rag. Wait 20 minutes and put the wax finish on, wait 20 minutes and wipe it off with a clean dry rag -- that's it!

If you have water stains on your cabinets or vanities, I highly recommend this product. You won't be disappointed.

        This Stuff Really Works!
I have a 20+ year old oak table that was marred by white heat marks, etc. I thought I had no option but to refinish it. While looking for products to do so, I saw this. Although skeptical, I thought I had nothing to lose since I planned to refinish the table anyway. I applied according to directions, with fine steel wool. Within minutes, the finish was restored. I topped it off with a coat of Howard's Feed-N-Wax, and the table looks almost new. The heat marks are gone. Sure beats a total refinish job.

Early life and education[edit]
Howard Marks was born in 1946 and raised in Queens, New York.[7] Although his family was ethnically Jewish, he was raised as a Christian Scientist.[8] He attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania for undergraduate studies, where he graduated cum laude in 1967 with a major in finance[3][9] and a minor in Japanese Studies.[7] At the age of 23, he earned an MBA in Accounting and Marketing from the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago where he won the George Hay Brown Prize.[3] He moved to New York to start work and in 1980 transitioned to Los Angeles, California.[10] He is a CFA charterholder.[11]
Career[edit]
Early years[edit]
Starting in 1969 and continuing until 1978, Marks worked at Citicorp first as an equity research analyst and then as the company's Director of Research. From 1978 to 1985 he served as a Vice President, as well as a senior portfolio manager overlooking convertible and high yield securities.[3]
In 1985 he joined the TCW Group where he led the groups that were responsible for investments in high yield bonds and convertible securities, and in 1988 he and Bruce Karsh organized one of the first distressed debt funds from a mainstream financial institution. He was also Chief Investment Officer for domestic fixed income, and the President of TCW Asset Management Company. He remained with the company until 1995.[3]
Oaktree[edit]
In 1995 Marks and five other partners left TCW[12] to found Oaktree Capital Management[10] in Los Angeles.[13] The investment firm grew rapidly, focusing on high-yield bonds, distressed debt, private equity, and adding further strategies.[13] He remains Co-chairman of the organization.
During the 2008 financial crisis Oaktree raised $10.9 billion, the largest distressed debt fund in history, to buy distressed assets, which "paid off richly for his investors," according to CNN.[13] According to Bloomberg, ”Oaktree’s 17 distressed-debt funds have averaged annual gains of 19 percent after fees for the past 22 years — about 7 percentage points better than its peers tracked by Boston-based consulting firm Cambridge Associates LLC”.[14]
In early 2012, Oaktree listed shares on the NYSE. The IPO raised $380 million, selling 8.84 million shares for $43 each.[12]
Writing[edit]
Marks consistently writes what he calls "memos to Oaktree clients" which outline his views on investing, the markets, and economies. According to CNN, he is "Admired for the folksy charm and astute commentary of his letters to investors."[13] According to Business Insider, "the letters read like Michael Lewis ghostwriting for Warren Buffett: insightful, direct, homespun, expert and sharply pointed. Their quality and insight have gained them a devoted readership among value investors."[6]
In March 2011 he published the book The Most Important Thing: Uncommon Sense for the Thoughtful Investor through Columbia Business School Press. The book covered his investment strategies and analysis of market opportunity and risk. The book was praised by Warren Buffett, who called it a rarity in its usefulness. According to Buffett, "When I see memos from Howard Marks in my mail, they're the first thing I open and read. I always learn something, and that goes double for his book."[15] In 2013, he published an updated edition entitled "The Most Important Thing Illuminated: Uncommon Sense for the Thoughtful Investor."[16]
In 2012 he contributed the article "Warning Flags" to the compendium The Gathering Storm, a collection of essays by investment managers where all proceeds went to charity.[17]
Organizations[edit]
In 1992, he created the Howard S. Marks Terms Scholarship to provide renewable scholarships to undergraduates at the University of Pennsylvania, and in 2009 he endowed the Marks Family Writing Center at the university. From 2000 to 2010 he chaired the Trustees' Investment Board at The University of Pennsylvania,[9] where as of 2016 he is an Emeritus Trustee.[18] He is a member of the New York Society of Security Analysts and the Investment Committees of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Edmund Safra Foundation, and formerly of the Leona and Harry Helmsley Charitable Trust.[9] He is a Trustee of the Metropolitan Museum and Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Royal Drawing Room.[18] He is also on the board of directors of Jadwa Investment, Saudi Arabia.[19]
Personal life[edit]
Marks' first marriage ended in divorce.[20] He has one biological child with his second wife Nancy (née Freeman): Andrew Marks,[21] who runs Freemark Partners, the investment firm for the Marks family,[22] and one step-child: Jane Hait, from Nancy's prior marriage.[14][20] His wife has a B.A. in Psychology from New York University (1971) and an M.A. from Columbia University Teachers College (1972).[21] She is a member of the Board of Directors for the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art.[23] They live in New York City and London[14] and are members of the Wilshire Boulevard Temple.[24]

Early life and education[edit]
Howard Marks was born in 1946 and raised in Queens, New York.[7] Although his family was ethnically Jewish, he was raised as a Christian Scientist.[8] He attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania for undergraduate studies, where he graduated cum laude in 1967 with a major in finance[3][9] and a minor in Japanese Studies.[7] At the age of 23, he earned an MBA in Accounting and Marketing from the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago where he won the George Hay Brown Prize.[3] He moved to New York to start work and in 1980 transitioned to Los Angeles, California.[10] He is a CFA charterholder.[11]
Career[edit]
Early years[edit]
Starting in 1969 and continuing until 1978, Marks worked at Citicorp first as an equity research analyst and then as the company's Director of Research. From 1978 to 1985 he served as a Vice President, as well as a senior portfolio manager overlooking convertible and high yield securities.[3]
In 1985 he joined the TCW Group where he led the groups that were responsible for investments in high yield bonds and convertible securities, and in 1988 he and Bruce Karsh organized one of the first distressed debt funds from a mainstream financial institution. He was also Chief Investment Officer for domestic fixed income, and the President of TCW Asset Management Company. He remained with the company until 1995.[3]
Oaktree[edit]
In 1995 Marks and five other partners left TCW[12] to found Oaktree Capital Management[10] in Los Angeles.[13] The investment firm grew rapidly, focusing on high-yield bonds, distressed debt, private equity, and adding further strategies.[13] He remains Co-chairman of the organization.
During the 2008 financial crisis Oaktree raised $10.9 billion, the largest distressed debt fund in history, to buy distressed assets, which "paid off richly for his investors," according to CNN.[13] According to Bloomberg, ”Oaktree’s 17 distressed-debt funds have averaged annual gains of 19 percent after fees for the past 22 years — about 7 percentage points better than its peers tracked by Boston-based consulting firm Cambridge Associates LLC”.[14]
In early 2012, Oaktree listed shares on the NYSE. The IPO raised $380 million, selling 8.84 million shares for $43 each.[12]
Writing[edit]
Marks consistently writes what he calls "memos to Oaktree clients" which outline his views on investing, the markets, and economies. According to CNN, he is "Admired for the folksy charm and astute commentary of his letters to investors."[13] According to Business Insider, "the letters read like Michael Lewis ghostwriting for Warren Buffett: insightful, direct, homespun, expert and sharply pointed. Their quality and insight have gained them a devoted readership among value investors."[6]
In March 2011 he published the book The Most Important Thing: Uncommon Sense for the Thoughtful Investor through Columbia Business School Press. The book covered his investment strategies and analysis of market opportunity and risk. The book was praised by Warren Buffett, who called it a rarity in its usefulness. According to Buffett, "When I see memos from Howard Marks in my mail, they're the first thing I open and read. I always learn something, and that goes double for his book."[15] In 2013, he published an updated edition entitled "The Most Important Thing Illuminated: Uncommon Sense for the Thoughtful Investor."[16]
In 2012 he contributed the article "Warning Flags" to the compendium The Gathering Storm, a collection of essays by investment managers where all proceeds went to charity.[17]
Organizations[edit]
In 1992, he created the Howard S. Marks Terms Scholarship to provide renewable scholarships to undergraduates at the University of Pennsylvania, and in 2009 he endowed the Marks Family Writing Center at the university. From 2000 to 2010 he chaired the Trustees' Investment Board at The University of Pennsylvania,[9] where as of 2016 he is an Emeritus Trustee.[18] He is a member of the New York Society of Security Analysts and the Investment Committees of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Edmund Safra Foundation, and formerly of the Leona and Harry Helmsley Charitable Trust.[9] He is a Trustee of the Metropolitan Museum and Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Royal Drawing Room.[18] He is also on the board of directors of Jadwa Investment, Saudi Arabia.[19]
Personal life[edit]
Marks' first marriage ended in divorce.[20] He has one biological child with his second wife Nancy (née Freeman): Andrew Marks,[21] who runs Freemark Partners, the investment firm for the Marks family,[22] and one step-child: Jane Hait, from Nancy's prior marriage.[14][20] His wife has a B.A. in Psychology from New York University (1971) and an M.A. from Columbia University Teachers College (1972).[21] She is a member of the Board of Directors for the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art.[23] They live in New York City and London[14] and are members of the Wilshire Boulevard Temple.[24]

In 1995 Marks and five other partners left TCW[12] to found Oaktree Capital Management[10] in Los Angeles.[13] The investment firm grew rapidly, focusing on high-yield bonds, distressed debt, private equity, and adding further strategies.[13] He remains Co-chairman of the organization.
During the 2008 financial crisis Oaktree raised $10.9 billion, the largest distressed debt fund in history, to buy distressed assets, which "paid off richly for his investors," according to CNN.[13] According to Bloomberg, ”Oaktree’s 17 distressed-debt funds have averaged annual gains of 19 percent after fees for the past 22 years — about 7 percentage points better than its peers tracked by Boston-based consulting firm Cambridge Associates LLC”.[14]
In early 2012, Oaktree listed shares on the NYSE. The IPO raised $380 million, selling 8.84 million shares for $43 each.[12]
Writing[edit]
Marks consistently writes what he calls "memos to Oaktree clients" which outline his views on investing, the markets, and economies. According to CNN, he is "Admired for the folksy charm and astute commentary of his letters to investors."[13] According to Business Insider, "the letters read like Michael Lewis ghostwriting for Warren Buffett: insightful, direct, homespun, expert and sharply pointed. Their quality and insight have gained them a devoted readership among value investors."[6]
In March 2011 he published the book The Most Important Thing: Uncommon Sense for the Thoughtful Investor through Columbia Business School Press. The book covered his investment strategies and analysis of market opportunity and risk. The book was praised by Warren Buffett, who called it a rarity in its usefulness. According to Buffett, "When I see memos from Howard Marks in my mail, they're the first thing I open and read. I always learn something, and that goes double for his book."[15] In 2013, he published an updated edition entitled "The Most Important Thing Illuminated: Uncommon Sense for the Thoughtful Investor."[16]
In 2012 he contributed the article "Warning Flags" to the compendium The Gathering Storm, a collection of essays by investment managers where all proceeds went to charity.[17]
Organizations[edit]
In 1992, he created the Howard S. Marks Terms Scholarship to provide renewable scholarships to undergraduates at the University of Pennsylvania, and in 2009 he endowed the Marks Family Writing Center at the university. From 2000 to 2010 he chaired the Trustees' Investment Board at The University of Pennsylvania,[9] where as of 2016 he is an Emeritus Trustee.[18] He is a member of the New York Society of Security Analysts and the Investment Committees of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Edmund Safra Foundation, and formerly of the Leona and Harry Helmsley Charitable Trust.[9] He is a Trustee of the Metropolitan Museum and Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Royal Drawing Room.[18] He is also on the board of directors of Jadwa Investment, Saudi Arabia.[19]
Personal life[edit]
Marks' first marriage ended in divorce.[20] He has one biological child with his second wife Nancy (née Freeman): Andrew Marks,[21] who runs Freemark Partners, the investment firm for the Marks family,[22] and one step-child: Jane Hait, from Nancy's prior marriage.[14][20] His wife has a B.A. in Psychology from New York University (1971) and an M.A. from Columbia University Teachers College (1972).[21] She is a member of the Board of Directors for the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art.[23] They live in New York City and London[14] and are members of the Wilshire Boulevard Temple.[24]

Early life and education[edit]
Howard Marks was born in 1946 and raised in Queens, New York.[7] Although his family was ethnically Jewish, he was raised as a Christian Scientist.[8] He attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania for undergraduate studies, where he graduated cum laude in 1967 with a major in finance[3][9] and a minor in Japanese Studies.[7] At the age of 23, he earned an MBA in Accounting and Marketing from the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago where he won the George Hay Brown Prize.[3] He moved to New York to start work and in 1980 transitioned to Los Angeles, California.[10] He is a CFA charterholder.[11]
Career[edit]
Early years[edit]
Starting in 1969 and continuing until 1978, Marks worked at Citicorp first as an equity research analyst and then as the company's Director of Research. From 1978 to 1985 he served as a Vice President, as well as a senior portfolio manager overlooking convertible and high yield securities.[3]
In 1985 he joined the TCW Group where he led the groups that were responsible for investments in high yield bonds and convertible securities, and in 1988 he and Bruce Karsh organized one of the first distressed debt funds from a mainstream financial institution. He was also Chief Investment Officer for domestic fixed income, and the President of TCW Asset Management Company. He remained with the company until 1995.[3]
Oaktree[edit]
In 1995 Marks and five other partners left TCW[12] to found Oaktree Capital Management[10] in Los Angeles.[13] The investment firm grew rapidly, focusing on high-yield bonds, distressed debt, private equity, and adding further strategies.[13] He remains Co-chairman of the organization.
During the 2008 financial crisis Oaktree raised $10.9 billion, the largest distressed debt fund in history, to buy distressed assets, which "paid off richly for his investors," according to CNN.[13] According to Bloomberg, ”Oaktree’s 17 distressed-debt funds have averaged annual gains of 19 percent after fees for the past 22 years — about 7 percentage points better than its peers tracked by Boston-based consulting firm Cambridge Associates LLC”.[14]
In early 2012, Oaktree listed shares on the NYSE. The IPO raised $380 million, selling 8.84 million shares for $43 each.[12]
Writing[edit]
Marks consistently writes what he calls "memos to Oaktree clients" which outline his views on investing, the markets, and economies. According to CNN, he is "Admired for the folksy charm and astute commentary of his letters to investors."[13] According to Business Insider, "the letters read like Michael Lewis ghostwriting for Warren Buffett: insightful, direct, homespun, expert and sharply pointed. Their quality and insight have gained them a devoted readership among value investors."[6]
In March 2011 he published the book The Most Important Thing: Uncommon Sense for the Thoughtful Investor through Columbia Business School Press. The book covered his investment strategies and analysis of market opportunity and risk. The book was praised by Warren Buffett, who called it a rarity in its usefulness. According to Buffett, "When I see memos from Howard Marks in my mail, they're the first thing I open and read. I always learn something, and that goes double for his book."[15] In 2013, he published an updated edition entitled "The Most Important Thing Illuminated: Uncommon Sense for the Thoughtful Investor."[16]
In 2012 he contributed the article "Warning Flags" to the compendium The Gathering Storm, a collection of essays by investment managers where all proceeds went to charity.[17]
Organizations[edit]
In 1992, he created the Howard S. Marks Terms Scholarship to provide renewable scholarships to undergraduates at the University of Pennsylvania, and in 2009 he endowed the Marks Family Writing Center at the university. From 2000 to 2010 he chaired the Trustees' Investment Board at The University of Pennsylvania,[9] where as of 2016 he is an Emeritus Trustee.[18] He is a member of the New York Society of Security Analysts and the Investment Committees of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Edmund Safra Foundation, and formerly of the Leona and Harry Helmsley Charitable Trust.[9] He is a Trustee of the Metropolitan Museum and Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Royal Drawing Room.[18] He is also on the board of directors of Jadwa Investment, Saudi Arabia.[19]
Personal life[edit]
Marks' first marriage ended in divorce.[20] He has one biological child with his second wife Nancy (née Freeman): Andrew Marks,[21] who runs Freemark Partners, the investment firm for the Marks family,[22] and one step-child: Jane Hait, from Nancy's prior marriage.[14][20] His wife has a B.A. in Psychology from New York University (1971) and an M.A. from Columbia University Teachers College (1972).[21] She is a member of the Board of Directors for the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art.[23] They live in New York City and London[14] and are members of the Wilshire Boulevard Temple.[24]
