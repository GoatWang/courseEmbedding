Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/25/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Qualcomm Inc (QCOM) fired back in its case against Apple Inc (AAPL) on Monday, accusing its critics of waging a "coordinated effort aimed at misdirecting" trade regulators. Earlier this month, Qualcomm (QCOM) filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission seeking to ban iPhones that use chips "other than those supplied by Qualcomm (QCOM) affiliates."
