RedHawk Holdings establishes innovation center at LSU Innovation Park


Daily Report StaffApril 14, 2016 







Youngsville, Louisiana-based RedHawk Holdings Corp.—an umbrella company that includes a health and energy corporation, a financial services firm, and a land and hospitality company—has established the RedHawk Innovation Center at the LSU Innovation Park, located five miles south of the flagship campus.
RedHawk says the innovation center will use LSU’s resources to design, manufacture and develop the company’s medical products, technologies and inventory of generic pharmaceuticals. 
“We believe our medical devices and security system are game-changing technologies. We also believe our ever-expanding inventory of branded generic drugs may be able to address certain generic drug shortages currently prevalent in the United States,” says G. Darcy Klug, RedHawk’s Chief Financial Officer, in a news release. “This alliance with the LSU Innovation Park and the Pennington Biomedical Research Center will enhance our product development and further improve our testing procedures.” 
RedHawk says it’s also working with officials at Louisiana Economic Development and with the Lafayette Economic Development Authority to establish manufacturing and marketing strategies. Through the innovation center, the company will have access to LSU researchers, faculty, students, interns, equipment and intellectual property.
RedHawk says it expects the innovation center to work closely with the Pennington BioTech Initiative, LSU Health Science Center, Pennington Biomedical Research Center and the LSU Emerging Technology Center.
Charles D’Agostino, LSU Innovation Park executive director, says there will be a strong partnership between the LSU Innovation Park and RedHawk.
“It represents a strong partnership between the University and this leading edge innovative company whereby groundbreaking technologies are being created and commercialized to benefit the State of Louisiana and offer employment opportunities to our graduates,” he says in the news release.

RedHawk Energy Corp


A proven track record for the completion and integration of successful acquisitions.
RedHawk Energy Corporation was formed by veteran energy services executives to execute the consolidation, through acquisition, of domestic oil and gas equipment manufacturing and servicing companies. Currently, the domestic energy services and equipment market is highly fragmented with numerous small and specialized companies competing for business from the same drilling, exploration and production companies.
Many of these service companies experienced rapid growth and considerable profitability in recent years, but that growth and profitability has been capped by overspecialization, excessive leverage and a lack of access to capital. Although run in some cases by seasoned managers, these companies sometimes lack executives who have experience to withstand short-term cyclical downturns, as well as devise and implement long-range plans, and execute upon strategic growth initiatives during temporary cyclical slowdowns.
With the long-term cycle for exploration and drilling domestically continuing unabated, we are confident the services and equipment sector will again experience further growth over the long-term. Through acquisition and consolidation of targeted small companies, Redhawk will be positioned to maximize the profit potential of this growth through:

Cost savings from shared infrastructure;
Access to growth capital;
Ability to leverage client relationships into new sales opportunities;
Expansion capabilities into other prolific oil and gas exploration regions of the North and South America;
Assembling a top-notch executive team;
Industry and administrative synergies.

To Market WoundClot Surgical - Advanced Bleeding ControlAccesswireFebruary 2, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareRedHawk Obtains Exclusive U.K. Distribution RightsYOUNGSVILLE, LA / ACCESSWIRE / February 2, 2016 / RedHawk Holdings Corp. (IDNG) ("RedHawk" or the "Company") announced today that RedHawk Medical Products U.K. Ltd. has entered into a contract for the exclusive distribution rights to WoundClot Surgical - Advanced Bleeding Control ("WoundClot") in the United Kingdom. WoundClot, developed and manufactured in Israel by Core Scientific Creations Ltd., is the first Class III medical device, fully implantable surgical hemostat designed to stop moderate to severe arterial and venous hemorrhage without the need to compress directly onto the wound.WoundClot, made from cellulose, has been uniquely engineered and manufactured with a patented molecular structure, designed to entrap platelets and coagulants in a modified physical molecular matrix. This specific design creates a haemodynamic polymer membrane with high adherence and resilience properties that is able to both withstand extremely high pressure bleeds and immediately reduce blood flow. Simultaneously, the specifically designed functional molecular groups transform to enhance and activate the natural coagulation processes up to five times more efficiently than existing available products. Once the bleeding has stopped and the coagulation cascade has formed, the product can easily be removed, if desired, without disrupting the already-formed clot. Additionally, unlike other available products on the market, WoundClot is fully bio-absorbable and bio-degradable and, if needed, can be left in the wound to degrade safely within seven days.This recently-approved revolutionary technology is currently being used by Israeli first responders and surgeons worldwide. WoundClot is in the final stages of acceptance and approval by the United States military and is currently being field-tested by the Israel Defense Forces and other militaries. WoundClot was first offered for commercial applications in November 2014.RedHawk stated, with the assistance of EcoGen Europe Ltd., its European pharmaceutical partner, that it has agreed to initially market WoundClot to hospitals and emergency rooms in the United Kingdom.This release may contain forward-looking statements.
