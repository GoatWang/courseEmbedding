Hexis Cyber Solutions, Inc. Key Developments

Hexis Cyber Solutions, Inc. Announces Termination of Chris Fedde as President, Effective June 30, 2016
Jun 15 16
The KEYW Holding Corporation on June 10, 2016, notified Chris Fedde, President of Hexis Cyber Solutions, Inc., that his employment with Hexis would be terminated effective June 30, 2016.


Hexis Cyber Solutions, Inc. Enhances HawkEye G Integrated Detection and Automated Response Capabilities
Mar 1 16
Hexis Cyber Solutions Inc. announced that it is committed to the continuous innovation and development of its endpoint security solution, HawkEye G. With a continued focus on enhancing its integrated malware and threat actor detection modules, enterprise platform support, and ecosystem partners, Hexis announced current and forthcoming product enhancements to its HawkEye G solution. HawkEye G Release 4 will include native, network sandboxing capabilities powered by Lastline, the only Full System Emulation (FUSE™) malware analysis platform. Lastline was recognized by NSS Labs as a leader in Breach Detection in its 2015 Breach Detection System Comparative Evaluation. This technology integration will add multi-protocol content extraction and network sandbox malware analysis to the HawkEye G product line without requiring additional appliances. Network content will be extracted, verified, and submitted from the HawkEye G Network Sensor appliances to Lastline’s malware analysis sandbox for detonation, analysis, and scoring for false positive reduction or response actions based on real-time endpoint event data. Organizations can choose to leverage Lastline’s cloud-based or on-premise offerings for the analysis of Windows PE files, Microsoft Office documents, and PDF files extracted from HTTP and SMTP protocols on a single appliance. Hexis’ platform support includes Windows workstation and server, Red Hat Linux, and with Release 4 of HawkEye G, expands coverage to Mac OS X. HawkEye G Release 4 adds support for customer-defined YARA rules via a YARA engine embedded in the HawkEye G Host Sensor. This will enable multiple new capabilities including custom threat scoring in detection mode, automated quarantine file in response mode, and a new endpoint prevention module that performs process pre-execution suspension, inspection, and termination before malware begins to execute. The prevention module runs locally on the endpoint in either online or offline modes without requiring connection to the HawkEye G Manager or cloud services to function.


KEYW Holding Exploring Strategic Alternatives For Hexis Cyber
Feb 24 16
The KEYW Holding Corporation (NasdaqGS:KEYW) is exploring strategic alternatives for its Hexis Cyber Solutions, Inc. subsidiary that could include sales to multiple companies or a transaction that would have it keeping some equity, CEO William J. Weber said in a call with investors. Several parties are interested in Hexis, Weber said. He added "As of this call, we have nothing formal we can announce. Should we decide to sell Hexis, KEYW will go forward as a pure-play government solutions provider with a pure focus on U.S. intelligence customers."

Symtrex Inc. Partners with Hexis Cyber Solutions to Distribute HawkEye Product Family



Share Article

















Symtrex adds next generation cyber security products to assist organizations with their critical need for security, compliance and data retention.







The Solution empowers security teams to quickly and confidently defend their organizations using machine-speed automation


Toronto, Ontario (PRWEB)
June 29, 2015
 Cybersecurity specialist, Symtrex Inc, today announced it has partnered with Hexis Cyber Solutions offering the HawkEye G and HawkEye AP, a family of cybersecurity  products that assist organizations with their critical needs for security, compliance and data retention.  Using a highly scalable, high-performance big data platform, sophisticated analytics, deep forensic scanning, and a continuously updated library of threats and countermeasures, the solutions enable organizations to detect, verify and remove advanced threats automatically at machine speeds – before damage is done.
HawkEye G is an automated threat removal platform that detects, verifies and removes cyber threats at machine speed before they can compromise intellectual property or cause process disruption. The solution empowers security teams to quickly and confidently defend their organizations using machine-speed automation where point solutions and manual remediation fail. HawkEye G’s newest capability, ThreatSync™, is an open framework for threat fusion, analytics and evidence-based detection and validation of unknown and known threats. ThreatSync also includes direct integration with leading third-party security technologies, including next generation firewalls, network-based sandboxes, and SIEMs.
Hawkeye AP is a big data analytics platform that pairs an open, flexible event data collection process with a high performance, clustered, columnar-based event data warehouse, streamlining collection, storage and search functions for audit, forensics and future use. HawkEye AP enables organizations to leverage petabytes of data and apply deep analytics to spot trends and anomalies while the forensics aid in the discovery and reporting on incidences, and enabling swift and thorough responses.
 “We are pleased to welcome Symtrex into our family of partners,” says Katherine Russ-Hotfelter, Director, Channel Marketing, Hexis Cyber Solutions. “Their expertise in security coupled with a deep understanding of the market and client needs will help us to expand our presence in the Canadian region.”
“We are very excited to be able to provide our customers access to these products.  When it comes to cybersecurity, it has to start from the inside and know what you have, who has access and what they are doing on your network, as well as being able to ensure that confidential information is not being leaked or sent out via malware, employees etc.  You can have the best perimeter security available, but if someone knocks on the door and you let them in, all that security is wasted.  Adding this additional layer of security will provide piece of mind to our customers, especially given the state of the threats that are out there right now,” says Lynne Krekeler, Manager of Sales and Marketing.

Hexis Cyber Solutions Announces Distributor Agreement With D&H Distributing
Leading Distributor of IT and Electronics Will Sell Hexis Cyber Solutions' NetBeat Product Line to Offer Simplified Network Visibility and Control

HANOVER, Md., Sept. 18, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hexis Cyber Solutions, Inc. (Hexis), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The KEYW Holding Corporation (Nasdaq:KEYW), and a provider of advanced cybersecurity solutions for commercial companies and government agencies, today announced the signing of a distributor agreement with D&H Distributing, a leading North American computer products distributor. The agreement will allow D&H 
to sell Hexis' new NetBeat product line to organizations in need of continuous network health and monitoring, analysis and network access control capabilities for their networks.

	"As Hexis Cyber Solutions expands its product offerings beyond our HawkEye G and AP enterprise solutions, we need a distributor that understands the small- to mid-sized business markets targeted for our NetBeat solutions," said Chris Fedde, President of Hexis Cyber Solutions. "Due in part to D&H's high touch sales approach to servicing their large base of channel resellers, they will benefit from our solutions that solve a major problem for their resellers' customers who need network analysis and the ability to monitor the BYOD devices accessing their networks".

	Designed to provide unprecedented awareness and control across networks of all sizes, the NetBeat product line offers the cost-effective functionality that small-to mid-sized businesses need, without sacrificing efficiency and security.

In conjunction, NetBeat NAC is an easy-to-use, plug-and-play solution that empowers organizations to 
block any unwanted devices within just minutes after activation. IT professionals leverage NetBeat NAC to tackle potential IT threats before their network has been compromised.

	"Operating in a constantly evolving technology landscape, D&H is always looking for new and better solutions for its channel partners," said Rob Eby, Vice President of Purchasing at D&H Distributing. "By adding NetBeat NAC and NetBeat MON, our resellers will be able to offer up acute, robust tools that combat security risks for the end-customer, while allowing them a high-end level of control over their network infrastructures. This gives our resellers a more competitive offering in the marketplace, while enhancing D&H's portfolio in the area of network monitoring."About Hexis Cyber Solutions

Security Information and Event Management


Product Description
With the increase in sophisticated attacks and the explosion of big data, large enterprises and government organizations are seeking solutions with advanced data analysis capabilities to address new found needs of collecting, storing, searching, and analyzing Big Data.
HawkEye AP, formerly Sensage’s Log Management solution, delivers an unparalleled solution with the industry’s most unique approach to analytics and intelligence – a flexible event data collection process and a clustered, columnar-based event data warehouse. 
HawkEye AP at a Glance:Security Intelligence

Ability to perform sophisticated correlations and contextual investigations against large volumes of data over time
Open access allows users to query event data directly from the Business Intelligence tools they prefer using ODBC/JDBC interfaces
Out-of-the-box reporting and dashboard tools
Flexible querying via a SQL-driven query wizard
Rich reporting capabilities including ad hoc reporting and pre-defined report templates that meet specific regulatory compliance

Agent-less collection of any event with a time stamp
Open architecture that interfaces with a variety of related technologies, including endpoints and network systems, storage, mobile solutions, other SIEMs, call center applications, etc.

Event Data Warehouse

Ability to store all event data in its native form, rather than metadata, an aggregation, or a normalized form – maintaining the integrity of the data for future use

Threat Detection and Response

 













Network and Endpoint Threat Correlation








Cyber criminals are mounting attacks with increasing complexity and sophistication, using coordinated means to gain access to your network from any and every connection. Organizations of all sizes need a solution that leverages a holistic approach to security from the network to the endpoint. WatchGuard Threat Detection and Response (TDR) correlates network and endpoint security events with threat intelligence to detect, prioritize and enable immediate action to stop malware attacks.











 












Key Features





Provides visibility and correlation of network and endpoint activities





Enables confident response through threat scoring and prioritization





Improves security from advanced malware attacks, including ransomware







Works alongside existing antivirus solutions with no impact on endpoint performance





Decreases time to detection and remediation through policy-based automation 





Extends enterprise-grade threat intelligence to small and midsize businesses at no additional cost

Threat Correlation and Prioritization
ThreatSync is WatchGuard’s new cloud-based correlation and threat scoring engine, improving security awareness and response across the network to the endpoint. ThreatSync collects event data from the WatchGuard Firebox, WatchGuard Host Sensor and cloud threat intelligence feeds, and correlates this data to generate a comprehensive threat score and rank based on severity. Learn More >





















Enterprise-grade Threat Intelligence
Threat Intelligence was previously only a benefit available to enterprise organizations with big budgets and even bigger security teams. With Threat Detection and Response, WatchGuard consumes and analyzes threat intelligence feeds -  delivering the security benefits without passing down the associated complexities or cost.





















Visibility into the Endpoint
The lightweight WatchGuard Host Sensor extends visibility and management to the endpoint and continuously sends endpoint events up to ThreatSync for correlation and scoring. The Host Sensor detects events, sends the data to ThreatSync and enables the remediation of threats on the endpoint.  Learn More >





















Additional Security Layer to Existing Antivirus Solutions
Threat Detection and Response doesn’t require users or Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs) to replace existing AV solutions already deployed. TDR works in tandem with existing AV, bringing an additional, powerful layer of threat detection and event correlation to catch anything that AV might miss.





















Prevention against Advanced Malware
The Host Ransomware Prevention feature of Threat Detection and Response, along with the advanced malware protection provided through APT Blocker, enables industry-leading prevention against ransomware attacks. Host Ransomware Prevention blocks the execution of ransomware before any file encryption on the endpoint takes place, mitigating the ransomware attack before any damage is done. Learn More >
















How It Works







Threats detected on the Firebox or via the Host Sensor are sent to ThreatSync, where they are continuously correlated and analyzed, then scored and ranked by severity. Threats can then be quickly remediated through one-click response options, or by leveraging policies to enable an automated response including quarantine the file, kill the process and delete the registry key persistence.
