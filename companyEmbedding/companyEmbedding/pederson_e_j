About Us 
 
History
CitareTx Investment Partners was founded in August of 2008 by Jeffery Sheldon and E.J. “Jere” Pederson, both serving as General Partners and Managing Directors of the fund. The company is strategically located in Houston, Texas equidistant from downtown Houston and Galveston island and close in proximity to the Texas Medical Center, the world’s largest of its kind, and the NASA Johnson Space Center.
Focus
Our investment activities are primarily focused on Class II medical devices for which the United States Food and Drug Administration pre-market notification process (i.e. 510(k)) can be utilized as the means to obtain regulatory clearance and begin commercial sale of product. However, we remain opportunistic and consider other investments if certain criteria are present, such as the presence of a strategic partner with a defined exit milestones.
Although our team has extensive expertise in the cardiovascular, interventional cardiology, interventional radiology, cardiac surgery, vascular surgery, critical care, consumable product, patient care, and orthopedic markets, we are open to any and all target markets. In addition, we do consider investment opportunities with smaller than typically accepted venture capital market size thresholds.
Approach
We are driven by the opportunity to change clinical outcomes and improve patient lives.
Following identification and preliminary evaluation of opportunities we meet with select inventor(s), entrepreneur, and/or management teams, as the case may be, for a formal presentation. In the event that the partners elect to advance discussions further, a detailed due diligence process ensues. During the process, preliminary terms and conditions are discussed to avoid confusion and ascertain strategic fit. Following the due diligence process an investment thesis is prepared, the partnership considers its options, and a term sheet is provided or company is created/direct investment made.
Although we prefer to create a start-up company around a nascent technology, investment into an existing entity is often considered. In any event, we take an active role in the management of our portfolio companies following cash or equity for services investments, including Board representation and participation as Executive Management.



Generally, our companies are collocated with the fund so that shared incubation resources and team members from other portfolio companies can be efficiently and effectively leveraged during product design, development, testing, manufacture, and sale. We believe that the use of shared resources enhances the product development process and reduces time to market. 
Our investment and incubation services include: 


Forming/Incorporating New Entities 


Obtaining Intellectual Property Rights 


Investing Seed Capital ($0.5 million - $2.0 million, usually in tranches) 


Providing Strategic Management & Direction:
- Established Product Development Plans
            - Conduct Pre-Clinical Testing
            - Interact with Regulatory Agencies
            - Complete Verification & Validation Activities 


Creating & Managing Scientific and Business Advisory Boards 


Preparing Business, Financial & Investment Plans 


Building Management Teams 


Infusing Follow-On Capital (< $5.0 million) 


Securing Institutional Growth Capital or Exit
            Our team has strong operating backgrounds and understands the challenges that exists for any start-up company. Partnering is the key to success and we feel that we are a truly value added investment partner.

      Bills sign 2nd-round pick, Temple product Dion Dawkins    


 



      Bills sign 2nd-round pick, Temple product Dion Dawkins    


        By The Associated Press 



May 19, 2017 6:38 PM
















ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- The Bills have signed offensive lineman Dion Dawkins, the second of Buffalo's two second-round draft picks.
The 23-year-old out of Temple is listed at 6-foot-4 and 314 pounds and was selected 63rd overall. Dawkins was a three-year starter mostly at left tackle, but has experience to play various positions.
He started 40 games in college and last season helped the Owls to a 10-4 finish and win the AAC title.
The Bills will give Dawkins a chance to compete for a starting job at right tackle on a line that helped Buffalo lead the NFL in yards rushing in each of the past two seasons.
Buffalo has now signed five of its six draft selections, leaving fifth-round pick, quarterback Nathan Peterman, not yet under contract.

      Alshon Jeffery gives Eagles glimpse of new-look offense's potential in 1st full-squad practice    


 



      Alshon Jeffery gives Eagles glimpse of new-look offense's potential in 1st full-squad practice    


        By Joe Bloss | CSNPhilly.com Contributor 



July 27, 2017 8:44 PM
















Carson Wentz didn’t learn too much about Alshon Jeffery during the skill position players’ trip to Wentz’s home in Fargo, North Dakota that he didn’t already know. He’s “soft-spoken” but a “quiet competitor,” Wentz said.
“What I really like is just getting to know him on the field and getting used to the way he gets in and out of breaks and the way he can go up and get a ball,” Wentz said.
If Wentz didn’t learn that last part in Fargo, he sure did Thursday during the Eagles’ first full-team practice at the NovaCare Complex (see camp notes). Jeffery snagged a tough pass along the sideline that caught plenty of attention. It’s the reason the team signed the 27-year-old wideout to a one-year, $14 million contract on the first day of free agency. It’s what he must do to give the Eagles’ offense the explosion it lacked last year.
The buzz term of the day was “catch radius.” Jeffery stands at 6-3 and his wingspan surpasses 80 inches. He owns some mighty paws. Since 2013, his second season, his 14.9 yards per catch ranks third in the NFL, and only three players have more receptions of 25 yards or more. 
He’s a big target, and the Eagles brought him here to make big plays.
“I just tell [Wentz] throw it somewhere and give me a chance. If it's anywhere close, I think I have a good opportunity,” Jeffery said.
“Having a guy like that really makes you play a lot more comfortably,” Wentz said.
“You don’t have to necessarily be pinpoint accurate down the field when you have a guy that can leap and high-point balls, and Alshon can do that,” head coach Doug Pederson said.
Jeffery’s body gives the offense, and Wentz in particular, some wiggle room. He does not need the perfect pass to make a catch. 
That held true on one play during Thursday’s “10-10-10” practice. The purpose of these practices is to run 10 offensive plays against a soft defense and then 10 defensive plays against a soft offense. 
The full pads weren’t on yet, and even Jeffery said his highlight play could’ve been better. Still, it was a sight to behold as the massive wide receiver went up high to snatch the ball out of the air along the sideline.
However, the day wasn’t all flashy highlights. Jeffery dropped a pass in the flat, and he was one of the last guys to stay on the field for extra reps from the jugs machine. 
There is work to be done, and he knows that.
“Everybody’s got talent in the NFL, so we just gotta keep working,” Jeffery said. “We just let the numbers and the stats take care of themselves.”
Jeffery said his connection with Wentz is getting better every day, but he didn’t want to anoint the new-look offense as this Super Bowl-deprived city’s savior. Yes, there is more talent here, especially at his position, then there was this time last year. And the current roster is capable of doing “something special.” Just not after one full-team practice.
“The sky's the limit for us,” he said. “We just have to keep building.”
That doesn’t mean the team is without a win-now attitude, according to fellow receiver Jordan Matthews (more on him here), who said he’s already seen a lot of hunger out on the field. But with the addition of Jeffery — and Torrey Smith, another deep threat, for that matter — are there enough passes to satisfy everyone’s appetite? Matthews said that’s not the way to look at it.
“If you go out there and see Torrey make a play, you see Alshon make a play, you're like, 'Well shoot, I better go out there and do something,'” Matthews said. “But that's a good thing.”
Jeffery said that Matthews, the team’s longest-tenured player at the position, is still the leader of the unit. He is the vocal one on the field, telling guys what to expect from the system and what to do on certain routes. Plus, he’s even the most active in the group chats, Jeffery said.
That receiving corps’ group chat has quite the different look compared to last season, and Jeffery is the biggest newcomer. What they’ll have to discuss 16 regular-season games from now remains to be seen. For now, the talking must be done through their efforts on the field.
“[We are] working to try to be the best,” Jeffery said. “Whatever it takes for us to win a championship.”

      5 Minutes with Roob: Steven Means, the swimmer?    


 



      5 Minutes with Roob: Steven Means, the swimmer?    


        By Reuben Frank | CSNPhilly.com 



July 27, 2017 7:00 PM
















In today's "Five Minutes with Roob," Reuben Frank chats with Eagles defensive end Steven Means:
Roob: OK now, most of your teammates played football, played basketball, maybe baseball in high school. Your bio says you were actually a swimmer back at Grover Cleveland High School in Buffalo.
Means: I really didn’t swim. I swam one meet and they gave me the trophy. It was pretty bad. Freestyle relay. By the time it was time for me to jump in, everybody else was already done. Pretty bad. I can’t even tread water.
Roob: OK, so much for swimming. Let's talk football. You grew up in Buffalo and then went to the University of Buffalo. What went into that decision to stay home to play college football?
Means: I wanted to leave and my mom wanted me to leave — my dad didn’t really care — but my SAT scores kind of held back a lot of colleges and then once I qualified, other colleges came, but Buffalo stuck with me, and that loyalty meant a lot to me.
Roob: You played at Buffalo with a pass rusher, Khalil Mack, who went on to become a top-five pick of the Raiders in 2013 and made first-team All-Pro in each of the last two years. Are you guys still close and what was it like playing with him?
Means: Yeah, we’re definitely still close. None of what he’s done really surprised me. It’s about time he finally is getting the recognition he deserves. We saw it all the time in practice. We went against each other in practice sometimes, joked around a lot, real cool guy, real down to earth.
Roob: And you guys play Oakland this year, so you’ll see him.
Means: Yeah, Christmas. I told him I was going to tell the coaches to put me at tight end for that game.
Roob: The Buccaneers drafted you back in 2013 in the fifth round. What was that experience like?
Means: It was a learning experience down there, period. It really left … a bad taste in my mouth. 
Roob: Then they released you after opening day in 2014.
Means: That was tough, especially with the circumstances, with what happened behind closed doors. But now I’m happy it happened.
Roob: Then you had stints with the Ravens and Texans before the Eagles claimed you late in the 2015 season, so you actually were here at the tail end of the Bill Davis era as a 3-4 outside linebacker.
Means: Playing linebacker kind of got me real comfortable in space, so any time we’ve got to drop as a defensive end, it’s second nature really. I practiced it in Tampa and then in Baltimore played a lot more and especially when I got here. 
Roob: Then Jim Schwartz comes in and installs his 4-3 front in 2016 and the Eagles keep you around. 
Means: Schwartz does a great job of keeping us real comfortable, keeping it real simple and keeping it fun. 
Roob: So you played a huge role in one of the Eagles’ biggest wins last year. The Vikings came in undefeated, but you guys beat them, and you had a sack on Sam Bradford for your first career sack and forced a fumble and you guys won, 21-10. You also had a blocked punt inside the Dallas 5-yard line in the win over the Cowboys on the last day of the season.
Means: Thank God for putting me in that position. Because clearly, normal circumstances, I wouldn’t have been in the game. Same way with the Cowboys. Just God blessing me with an opportunity and me making the most of it.
Roob: This is your fifth year in the NFL and your third season with the Eagles. What’s your mentality this summer as training camp gets underway here?
Means: Just get better every day. Every day take it one day at a time, don’t jump on anything too fast, don’t ever get complacent, just build on everything, try to perfect the little things, and everything will take care of itself.
Roob: It’s interesting that you’re still here when it was Chip Kelly that brought you in back in 2015. There aren’t a lot of guys left from that team.
Means: The camaraderie is real good. When coaching changes come, you really can’t get too hung up on that. Me, in the spiritual realm, I know that nobody has powers that God didn’t give them. If I’m supposed to be somewhere, I’m going to be there, no matter what.
Roob: Does that include the pool?
Means: That includes the pool, too, but I try to stay away from water.

Item Description: MIT Press Ltd, United States, 1972. Paperback. Book Condition: New. second edition. Language: English . Brand New Book ***** Print on Demand *****. Error-Correcting Codes, by Professor Peterson, was originally published in 1961. Now, with E. J. Weldon, Jr., as his coauthor, Professor Peterson has extensively rewritten his material. The book contains essentially all of the material of the first edition; however, the authors state that because there has been so much new work published in error-correcting codes, the preparation of this second edition proved to be a much greater task than writing the original book. The major additions are the chapters on majority-logic codes, synchronization, and convolutional codes. Much new material has also been added to the chapters on important linear block codes and cyclic codes. The authors cite some highly regarded books on recent work done in Eastern Europe and an extensive bibliography on coding theory in the Soviet Union [sic]. In its much-expanded form, Error-Correcting Codes may be considered another valuable contribution to computer coding.  Bookseller Inventory # APC9780262527316

Our best-selling garden and plant stakes combine beauty and practicality, and
        will add a unique and whimsical touch to any yard or garden. Use them to support

        antique green, and rust.



Rod Iron
We have welded rod iron trellises, arbors, planters, benches, chandeliers,
        border fences, and topiaries. The designs are timeless, and are not only
        functional but attractive.
