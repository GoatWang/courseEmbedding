Member of the Israel  Insurance Association



 
 






The story  of the company begins at the end of the 1930�s when, after the old Ha�Emek railway had set fire to the settlements� grain fields over and over again and the insurance companies had refused to cover this risk, a handful of the kibbutzim of the time decided to adopt the basic idea of mutual insurance and established the mutual agricultural insurance fund.
That mutual fund has come a long way since then. Beginning with field and crops fire insurance, the fund then added coverage for supplies to the farms, tractors and vehicles and, over the course of the years, industrial and liabilities insurance, and in recent years we have also established a subsidiary, the successful Atudot pensions fund.
Over the years the mutual agricultural fund went through several changes of name before finally settling on Bituach Haklai Central Cooperative Society Ltd., which is owned by 279 kibbutzim ,moshavim and associations in the agricultural settlement sector, acts as an insurance company in every sense of the term, authorised to operate in all branches of insurance and, like every other Israeli insurer, subject to state inspection.
Some 65% of all the society's revenues emanate from insurances for kibbutzim and plants and businesses connected with them, and some 35% emanate from insurances for the private sector through selected insurance agents.   Faced with the need to find appropriate solutions to the size and complexity of kibbutz industry (we insure some 310 plants for more than four billion dollars), the company have attained a high level of expertise in this branch of insurance and operate with the backing of leading international reinsurers, who grant a unique and particularly wide-scale reinsurance coverage.
With the beginning of the 70th year of the compamy existence, it now have an annual revenue turnover of some NIS.540,000,000, generated by some 100,000 policies of various types in the general insurance industry. At the beginning of 2002, the new Bituach Haklai management defined it's goals and objectives as follows:-To be a prosperous, innovative insurance company that works throughout the agricultural sector and in all branches of insurance in accordance with business and economic criteria, providing its clients with professional, honest, reliable services, thus ensuring that  insureds will continue to find it worth while to place their trust in the company.

History





Our story begins at the end of the 1930’s when, after the Jezreel Valley Railway (a branch of the Hejaz Railway) had set fire to the settlements’ grain fields several times and insurance companies had refused to cover this risk, a handful of the kibbutzim decided to adopt the basic idea of mutual insurance and established the mutual agricultural insurance fund.
That mutual fund has come a long way since then. Beginning with field and crops fire insurance, the fund then added coverage for supplies to the farms, tractors and vehicles and, over the years, industrial and liabilities insurance, and in recent years we have also established a subsidiary, the successful Atudot pensions fund.
The mutual agricultural fund changed its name several times before the current "Bituach Haklai Central Cooperative Society Ltd."
The Society is owned by 261 kibbutzim, moshavim and associations in the agricultural settlement sector, and acts as an insurance company in every sense of the term. It is authorised to operate in all branches of insurance and, like every other Israeli insurer, subject to state suppervision.
About 60% of all the society's revenues emanate from insurances for kibbutzim and plants and businesses connected with them, and about 40% emanate from insurances for the private sector through selected insurance agents.
Faced with the need to find appropriate solutions to the size and complexity of kibbutz industry (we insure some 310 plants for more than 5 billion dollars), we have attained a high level of expertise in this branch of insurance and operate with the backing of leading international reinsurers, who grant us unique and particularly wide-scale reinsurance coverage.
At the beginning of 2002, the new Bituach Haklai management defined our goals and objectives as follows:
To be a prosperous, innovative insurance company that works throughout the agricultural sector and in all branches of insurance in accordance with business and economic criteria, providing its clients with professional, honest, reliable services, thus ensuring that our insureds will continue to find it worth while to place their trust in us.

Bituah Haklai chairman Doron Sett: We're under no pressure, and we're taking Alumot off the shelf.



Cybele Investment House Ltd. has cancelled its agreement to acquire Alumot Investments House (Sprint) Ltd. (TASE: ALST-L) from after Bituach Haklai Central Cooperative Society Ltd two months after it signed the deal. After conducting due diligence on Alumot Sprint, Cybele asked Bituach Haklai to lower the price of the deal and to amend other terms, but was refused. So far as is known, following the due diligence, Cybele wanted to change the structure of the acquisition, and offered to inject part of the proceeds into Alumot, and to transfer part of the proceeds to Bituah Haklai in the future. The total price tag would be around the original amount of the deal. Bituah Haklai rejected the proposal.   
        




 Bituah Haklai chairman Doron Sett said, "Cybele, which was familiar with the investment house before the deal, tried to change the structure of the deal. This is not a matter of money, and it won't work. We're under no pressure, and we're taking Alumot off the shelf. We'll develop Alumot vis-à-vis the kibbutzim and outside the sector as well, giving the investment house a chance with a stable ownership." Alumot's share price fell 11.4% to NIS 3.10, giving a market cap of NIS 10 million.
