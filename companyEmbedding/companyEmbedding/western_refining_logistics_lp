Our pipeline and gathering assets consist of approximately 705 miles of crude oil pipelines, gathering systems, and approximately 828,000 barrels of active crude oil storage located primarily in the Delaware Basin in the Permian Basin area of West Texas and southern New Mexico and in the Four Corners area in northwestern New Mexico. These assets serve as a key source of high quality, cost-advantaged crude oil for Western Refining’s El Paso and Gallup Refineries.

Terminalling, Transportation, and Storage Assets
Our terminalling, transportation, and storage assets consist of terminals and storage assets located on site at each of Western Refining’s El Paso and Gallup Refineries, and standalone refined products terminals located in Bloomfield and Albuquerque, New Mexico. These assets include approximately 6.9 million barrels of active shell storage capacity. These assets primarily receive, store, and distribute crude oil, feedstock, and refined products for Western Refining’s refineries. We also provide fee-based asphalt terminalling and processing services at an asphalt plant and terminal in El Paso and asphalt terminalling services at three stand-alone asphalt terminals located in Albuquerque, New Mexico and Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona, which have a combined storage capacity of approximately 473,000 barrels.

Business Objectives
Our primary business objectives are to maintain stable cash flows and to increase our quarterly cash distribution per unit over time. We intend to accomplish these objectives by executing the following strategies:
Generate Stable, Fee-Based Revenues
We are focused on generating stable and predictable cash flows by providing fee-based logistics services. Substantially all of our revenue will be derived from two 10-year, fee-based agreements with Western Refining, supported by minimum volume commitments and inflation adjustments. As we grow our business, we will seek to enter into similar contracts with third parties that generate stable and predictable cash flows, as well as increase volumes under our existing contracts with Western.
Increase Utilization and Pursue Attractive Organic Growth Opportunities
We expect to realize increased throughput on our existing systems due to projected crude oil production growth in the Delaware Basin and Four Corners area and the continued ramp-up of our new gathering system in the Delaware Basin. We also intend to evaluate organic growth opportunities to increase utilization of our existing assets by, for example, adding gathering lines to connect new production to our mainline gathering lines. Additionally, we intend to take other steps to accommodate growth in Western Refining’s business as well as increased third-party activity in our existing areas of operations.
Grow Through Strategic Acquisitions
We plan to pursue accretive acquisitions of complementary assets from Western as well as third parties. In order to provide us with initial acquisition opportunities, Western will grant us a right of first offer to acquire certain logistics assets that it will retain following this offering, as well as additional assets that it may acquire or construct in the Permian Basin or the Four Corners area in the future. We believe we complement Western’s acquisition strategy by providing a specialized vehicle for owning, operating and acquiring logistics assets.
Maintain Safe, Reliable, and Efficient Operations
We are committed to maintaining and improving the safety, reliability, environmental compliance, and efficiency of our operations. We believe these objectives are integral to maintaining stable cash flows and are critical to the success of our business.

Pipeline Safety











































Pipeline Safety
A key component of Western Refining Logistics' safety commitment is our ongoing Public Awareness Program, which includes delivering education and public safety information to our neighbors.PETROLEUM PIPELINES IN YOUR COMMUNITY
Americans consume more than 700 million gallons of petroleum products each day. Some of these products like fuel and heating oil play a fundamental role in our everyday lives.
Underground pipelines transport half of all the petroleum products shipped domestically. The use of these pipelines helps keep the cost of gasoline and other petroleum products down and are vital to our nation’s economy.
PIPELINES ARE SAFE
Pipelines are the safest method of transporting petroleum and they can operate safely for an indefinite period of time. Western Refining Logistics is committed to the safe operation of its pipelines for the safety of the public and the environment. We maintain an outstanding safety record that includes 24-hour surveillance, routine inspections, computer monitoring, corrosion protection, maintenance/testing programs, and employee training. You can help us by learning how to prevent pipeline emergencies, how to recognize a pipeline leak, and what to do if a leak occurs. Follow these safety guidelines and keep this information pamphlet as a handy reference.
IS THERE A PIPELINE NEAR YOU?
In fact, there are pipelines currently located across New Mexico, and Texas.
LOOK FOR PIPELINE MARKERS
Western Refining Logistics Pipeline system transports two different products, crude oil and HVL (LPG). The pipeline markers along the line will tell you which product that pipeline carries. Our pipeline markers are used to show the approximate location of pipelines, what is being transported, and how to contact Western Refining Logistics.
Familiarize yourself with the location of any markers that may be in your neighborhood. Markers are located at public roads, rail crossings, and other intervals along the pipeline path. Call before you dig anywhere near a pipeline. It is a state law that any individual or company must call 811 (State of New Mexico and Texas One Call Center) two days prior to any movement of the earth.

RECOGNIZE A PIPELINE LEAK
Your senses of sight, smell, and hearing are the best way to recognize a pipeline leak. And while leaks rarely occur, recognizing these signs is the first step in protecting yourself, your family and our neighborhood.
LOOK FOR:

Discolored plants or trees surrounding the pipeline in an otherwise green area.
Flames originating from the ground or valve along the pipeline route.
A dense white cloud or fog.
Bubbling in standing water.
An oily or multicolored sheen on land or water.

LISTEN FOR:

A hissing or bubbling sound near a pipeline or an area of the pipeline.

SMELL FOR:

A strange or unusual smell – the product will have a petroleum odor like oil or a rotten egg odor.

POSSIBLE HAZARDS ASSOCIATED
a) CRUDE OIL: The vapors of crude oil are generally heavier than air, however, not in all cases. They tend to remain close to the ground and will flow along ground contours and may especially fill depressions such as ditches, valleys and canyons. In the event of a release of crude oil, careful consideration should be given to surface terrain, direction and velocity of wind, and the proximity of ignition sources such as vehicles, buildings, and railroads. Crude oil vapors are flammable. Some transported crude oils may contain Hydrogen Sulfide Gas (H2S). H2S is a colorless gas which is irritating to the eyes, skin and respiratory tract at low concentrations; and, at higher concentrations may cause respiratory paralysis, unconsciousness, and death. H2S has a distinctive rotten egg odor.
b) HVL: High volatile liquids, hydrocarbons are classified as LPG (liquefied petroleum gas). It is a petroleum derived gas which is compressed into a liquid and stored and handled as a liquid under pressure. LPG is colorless and odorless in its natural form. HVL vapors are flammable. LPG gases are not considered toxic. They can, however, dilute the oxygen content of air to levels insufficient for breathing. The vapors of LPG products are heavier than air. They tend to remain close to the ground assisted by the visible fog of condensed water vapor created and will flow along the contour of the surface.

WHAT TO DO IN A PIPELINE EMERGENCY

Immediately leave the area on foot in an upwind direction.
Avoid making contact with escaping liquids or vapors.
Avoid potential ignition sources.
DO NOT light a match, start an engine or automobile, use a telephone, or switch on/off an electric light or appliance.
Abandon all equipment being used in the area.
DO NOT drive into an area in which you encounter a leak or vapor cloud.
Warn others to stay away from the area.
DO NOT try to operate any pipeline valves yourself.
DO NOT use a cell phone while near the suspected emergency area.
From a distant phone, call Western Refining Company Emergency Number 1-888-658-8006 for New Mexico, 915-775-3411 for Texas and 911 or your local fire, police, or sheriff’s office.

•   Net income of $19.9 million; EBITDA of $36.1 million, up 27% versus Q1 2016•   Increased quarterly distribution to $0.4525 per unit; 13th consecutive increase since IPO•   Distributable cash flow of $28.1 million, up 25% compared to Q1 2016 EL PASO, Texas, May  02, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Western Refining Logistics, LP (NYSE:WNRL) today reported first quarter 2017 net income attributable to limited partners of $19.9 million, or $0.22 per common limited partner unit, which compares to $14.0 million and $0.28, respectively, in the first quarter 2016. First quarter 2017 EBITDA was $36.1 million and distributable cash flow was $28.1 million; this compares to $28.5 million and $22.5 million, respectively, for the first quarter 2016. "WNRL delivered an increase in net income, EBITDA, distributable cash flow and its 13th consecutive quarter of distribution growth driven primarily by increases in Delaware Basin mainline movements and the recent acquisition of the St. Paul Park logistics assets," said Jeff Stevens, President and Chief Executive Officer of WNRL's general partner.  "Our Wholesale fuel business had a good quarter due to strong margins. We also saw strong growth in our crude oil and asphalt trucking volumes in the Delaware." On April 28, 2017, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash distribution for the first quarter 2017 of $0.4525 per unit, or $1.81 per unit, on an annualized basis. This distribution represents a 15% compound annual growth rate since WNRL's October 2013 initial public offering. Stevens concluded, “Delaware Basin rig activity and crude oil production growth continues to be positive. We believe we are well-positioned to increase net income, EBITDA and distributions as crude oil production increases and we fully leverage our logistics assets.” Conference Call Information The Company issued a press release on April 5, 2017, announcing an earnings conference call on May 2, 2017, to discuss results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.  On April 17, 2017, Tesoro Logistics LP (“TLLP”), filed a Schedule 13D, indicating that management of TLLP had been authorized to consider, discuss and endeavor to negotiate a merger, consolidation or combination of assets held by and securities issued by WNRL.  Consequently, WNRL will not be hosting a conference call. About Western Refining Logistics, LP Western Refining Logistics, LP is principally a fee-based, growth-oriented master limited partnership formed by Western Refining, Inc. (NYSE:WNR) to own, operate, develop and acquire terminals, storage tanks, pipelines and other logistics assets related to the terminalling, transportation and storage of crude oil and refined products.

More information about Western Refining Logistics, LP is available at www.wnrl.com. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to our financial information presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management utilizes non-GAAP measures to facilitate comparisons of past performance. This press release and supporting schedules include the non-GAAP measures Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) and Distributable Cash Flow. We believe certain investors and financial analysts use EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow to evaluate WNRL’s financial performance between periods and to compare WNRL's performance to certain competitors. We believe certain investors and financial analysts use Distributable Cash Flow to determine the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders. These additional financial measures are reconciled from the most directly comparable measures as reported in accordance with GAAP and should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, financial information that we report in accordance with GAAP. Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements reflect WNRL’s current expectation regarding future events, results or outcomes. The forward-looking statements contained herein include statements related to, among other things: the continued growth of Delaware Basin rig activity and crude oil production; WNRL’s ability to increase net income, EBITDA and distributions; increases in crude oil production; WNRL’s ability to fully leverage its logistics assets; and the consideration and discussion of a merger, consolidation or combination of assets held by and securities issued by WNRL with Tesoro Logistics LP.  These statements are subject to the general risks inherent in WNRL’s business. These expectations may or may not be realized and some of these expectations may be based upon assumptions or judgments that prove to be incorrect. In addition, WNRL’s business and operations involve numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, which could result in WNRL’s expectations not being realized, or otherwise materially affect WNRL’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Additional information relating to the uncertainties affecting WNRL’s business is contained in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission to which you are referred. The forward-looking statements are only as of the date made. Except as required by law, WNRL does not undertake any obligation to (and expressly disclaims any obligation to) update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date such statements were made, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

We define Distributable Cash Flow as EBITDA plus the change in deferred revenues, less interest accruals, income taxes paid, maintenance capital expenditures and distributions declared on our TexNew Mex units. The GAAP performance measure most directly comparable to EBITDA is net income. The GAAP liquidity measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and distributable cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered alternatives to GAAP net income or net cash provided by operating activities. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: •         EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; •         EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; •         EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and •         EBITDA, as we calculate it, may differ from the EBITDA calculations of our affiliates or other companies in our industry, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are used as supplemental financial measures by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess: •         our operating performance and liquidity as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry, without regard to financial methods, historical cost basis or capital structure; •         the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash to make distributions to our unitholders; •         our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and •         the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities. Distributable Cash Flow is a standard used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships because the value of a partnership unit is, in part, measured by its yield. Yield is based on the amount of cash distributions a partnership can pay to a unitholder. Although distributable cash flow is a liquidity measure, it is presented in this reconciliation to net income as supplemental information. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income attributable to limited partners. These non-GAAP measures may vary from those of other companies. As a result, EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The calculation of EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow includes the results of operations for the St. Paul Park Logistics Assets subsequent to the St. Paul Park Logistics Transaction for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The results of operations for the St. Paul Park Logistics Assets are excluded from the EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow calculations for the comparable periods in the prior year because a retrospective adjustment of these performance measures is not a representative measure of performance results. The following tables reconcile net income attributable to limited partners and net cash provided by operating activities to EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 (Unaudited) (In thousands)Net income attributable to limited partners$19,886  $14,007 Interest and debt expense6,608  7,052 Provision (benefit) for income taxes(110) 261 Depreciation and amortization9,732  7,144 EBITDA36,116  28,464     Change in deferred revenues364  2,232 Interest accruals(6,132) (6,709)Income taxes paid(89) (30)Maintenance capital expenditures(2,184) (1,429)Distributable cash flow$28,075  $22,528    Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 (In thousands)Net cash provided by operating activities$43,346  $19,013 Changes in operating assets and liabilities(12,419) (3,150)Interest and debt expense6,608  7,052 Unit-based compensation expense(635) (524)Amortization of loan fees and original issue discount(492) (342)Deferred income taxes(488) — Gain on disposal of assets, net291  99 Provision (benefit) for income taxes(110) 261 Reserve for doubtful accounts15  (1)EBITDA attributable to General Partner (1)—  6,056 EBITDA36,116  28,464     Change in deferred revenues364  2,232 Interest accruals(6,132) (6,709)Income taxes paid(89) (30)Maintenance capital expenditures(2,184) (1,429)Distributable cash flow$28,075  $22,528  (1) The calculation of EBITDA attributable to General Partner is as follows:  Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 (In thousands)Net loss attributable to General Partner$(8,250)Depreciation and amortization2,194 EBITDA attributable to General Partner$(6,056)   Logistics Segment  Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 (Unaudited) (In thousands, except key operating statistics)Statement of Operations Data:   Fee based revenues:   Affiliate$49,637  $40,916 Third-party619  690 Total revenues50,256  41,606 Operating costs and expenses:   Operating and maintenance expenses25,828  26,757 General and administrative expenses807  781 Loss on disposal of assets, net10  — Depreciation and amortization8,581  8,155 Total operating costs and expenses35,226  35,693 Operating income$15,030  $5,913 Key Operating Statistics:   Pipeline and gathering (bpd):   Mainline movements (1):   Permian/Delaware Basin system53,136  49,486 Four Corners system47,480  52,467 TexNew Mex system4,402  12,544 Gathering (truck offloading):   Permian/Delaware Basin system14,605  20,533 Four Corners system6,617  12,761 Pipeline gathering and injection system:   Permian/Delaware Basin system11,972  7,885 Four Corners system24,068  24,437 TexNew Mex system5,336  — Tank storage capacity (bbls) (2)959,087  828,202 Terminalling, transportation and storage:   Shipments into and out of storage (bpd) (includes asphalt)584,476  388,258 Terminal storage capacity (bbls) (2)11,376,734  7,385,543  (1) Some barrels of crude oil in route to Western's Gallup refinery and Permian/Delaware Basin are transported on more than one of our mainlines.
