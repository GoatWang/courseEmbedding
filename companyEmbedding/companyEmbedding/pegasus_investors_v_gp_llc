deemed incorporated by reference in all other items, as applicable. Each capitalized term used but not defined herein has the meaning ascribed to such term in the Schedule 13D, as amended. 
 


Item 2.
Identity and Background  Item 2 of Schedule 13D is supplemented and superseded, as the case may be,
as follows:  (e) As disclosed in the Issuers Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 3, 2014, the Issuer is, together with
several of its affiliates and equity holders and certain other persons, including PCA, a defendant in securities litigation (the Geveran Case) brought by Geveran Investments Limited (Geveran), and
on August 28, 2014, an Order Granting Plaintiffs Motion for Partial Summary Judgment Under its First Cause of Action for Violation of the Florida Securities and Investment Protection Act (the August 28
Order) was granted by the Circuit Court of the Ninth Judicial Circuit in and for Orange County, Florida (the Circuit Court). The August 28 Order was entered on November 30, 2015, awarding
Geveran, jointly and severally against each of the defendants, $25,000,000 as recessionary damages, prejudgment interest in the amount of $6,752,280, reasonable attorneys fees in the amount of $4,456,787.40 and taxable costs in the amount of
$469,061.93, for a total recovery of approximately $36,678,129.33.  The Issuer stated in its Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 3, 2014, that
it believes that the Circuit Courts partial summary judgment ruling in favor of Geveran was erroneous and that it intends to appeal it to the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeals. The Circuit Court has issued a temporary stay of the
execution of the judgment to allow the defendants sufficient time to perfect an appeal seeking review of the August 28 Order. On December 7, 2015, the Issuer posted an appeal bond in support of its appeal of the August 28 Order. 




Item 3.
Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration  Item 3 of Schedule 13D is supplemented as
follows:  The disclosure in Item 4 below is incorporated by reference herein. 
 


Item 4.
Purpose of Transaction  Item 4 of Schedule 13D is supplemented and superseded, as the case may be,
as follows:  Series K Securities Issuance  On
December 7, 2015, as contemplated by the previously disclosed Preferred Stock Subscription and Support Agreement (the Subscription Agreement) among Lighting Science Group Corporation (the
Issuer), LSGC Holdings III and PPIV, and to facilitate support for the Appeal Bond (as defined below), the Issuer issued to PPIV 20,106.03 units of the Issuers securities (the Series K
Securities), with each unit consisting of (a) one share of the Issuers Series K Preferred Stock (the Series K Preferred Stock) and (b) a warrant to purchase 735 shares of common stock of the
Issuer in consideration of PPIV providing assistance to the Issuer with securing an appeal bond in the amount of up to $20,106,028.29 (the Appeal Bond) on the terms set forth in a General Indemnity Agreement and related
side letter entered into by and among the Issuer, PPIV and the issuer of the Appeal Bond (the Appeal Bond Agreements). In total, the Issuer issued 20,106.03 shares of Series K Preferred Stock and a warrant to purchase
14,777,932 shares of the Issuers common stock (the Appeal Bond Warrant) to PPIV.  The Series K Preferred Stock has the
designations, preferences, voting rights and other special rights set forth in the Certificate of Designation of Series K Preferred Stock (the Series K COD), which was filed as Exhibit 4.2 to the Issuers Form 8-K
filed with the SEC on September 17, 2015. The Series K Preferred Stock is senior to the Issuers Series H Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series H Preferred Stock), the Issuers Series I
Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series I Preferred Stock), the Series J Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series J Preferred Stock) and the Issuers common stock with respect to the payment of
dividends and distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Issuer. Depending on whether the Appeal Bond has been drawn or fully released, the Series K COD requires the Issuer to redeem the outstanding shares of Series K
Preferred Stock in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Issuer or an earlier change of control or junior security redemption, which includes events triggering a redemption of the outstanding shares of Series H
Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock or Series J Preferred Stock.  As disclosed in Item 2(e) and in the Issuers Current Report on Form 8-K
filed with the SEC on September 3, 2014, the Issuer is, together with several of its affiliates and equity holders and certain other persons, including PCA, a defendant in the Geveran Case. On November 30, 2015, the August 28 Order
was entered. The Issuer posted the Appeal Bond in support of its appeal of the August 28 Order upon entry thereof and, pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, PPIV assisted the Issuer in securing the Appeal Bond. 
Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, the Issuer also agreed to commence a rights offering of the Series K Securities pursuant to which it will offer all
holders of common stock and securities convertible into common stock (other than derivative securities issued pursuant to the Issuers equity-based compensation plan and employee stock purchase plan) the right to purchase a pro rata share
of a like number of Series K Securities as the number issued to PPIV (the Rights Offering). The Series K Securities offered pursuant to the Rights Offering will be issued in exchange for a commitment from any exercising
holder to fund an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the number of Series K Securities to be acquired by such holder by (ii) $1,000, with such commitment to be payable when, as and if the Appeal Bond is drawn upon. If
an exercising holder fails to fund its obligations in accordance with the terms of the Series K COD, PPIV will remain obligated to fund the applicable amount of the Appeal Bond. The Issuer agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to file and have
declared effective a registration statement relating to the Rights Offering as soon as reasonably practicable after the entry of the August 28 Order. 


Pursuant to the Series K COD, in the event of a claim on the Appeal Bond resulting in a payment by PPIV to the
issuer of the Appeal Bond, such as a loss on appeal and collection of the bond amount from PPIV pursuant to the Appeal Bond Agreements, the outstanding shares of Series K Preferred Stock will be retained by the holders who have satisfied their
obligations to fund their portion of the Appeal Bond in accordance with the terms of the Series K COD (the Funding Series K Holders). The Series K COD provides that, following the release or satisfaction in full of the
commitments under the Appeal Bond, the Issuer will cancel for no additional consideration all of the shares of Series K Preferred Stock issued to PPIV and the Funding Series K Holders except a number of shares equal to the product of (x) the
number of shares of Series K Preferred Stock held by such holder and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate amount of payments made by such holder with respect to funding the Appeal Bond and the denominator of which is the
aggregate liquidation value (calculated by multiplying the number of shares held by such holder by $1,000) of such shares of Series K Preferred Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole share. In the event that the Issuer wins the appeal of the
August 28 Order, upon the expiration or termination of the Appeal Bond, all shares of Series K Preferred Stock will be cancelled for no consideration. 
The Appeal Bond Warrant will be exercisable beginning on the date that the Appeal Bond has been fully drawn or all commitments thereunder have been released
and ending on the earlier of: (i) December 31, 2025, (ii) the date on which the Issuer consummates a Qualified Public Offering (as defined in the Appeal Bond Warrant), or (iii) the date of any Change of Control (as defined in the
Appeal Bond Warrant). The Appeal Bond Warrant will be exercisable at an exercise price of $0.12 per share, subject to adjustments as provided in the Appeal Bond Warrant. PPIV and any Funding Series K Holders will retain the Appeal Bond Warrant(s)
issued to such holders as consideration for their agreement to support the Appeal Bond regardless of whether such holders are required to make payments with respect to funding the Appeal Bond. 
The Appeal Bond Warrant does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Appeal Bond Warrant, which is
filed as Exhibit 99.1, and is incorporated herein by reference.  The Reporting Persons continuously assess the Issuers business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects, general economic conditions, other developments and additional investment opportunities. Depending on such assessments, the Reporting Persons and/or their affiliates may acquire additional securities
of the Issuer, including but not limited to common stock, existing preferred securities or new securities of the Issuer or may determine to purchase, sell or otherwise dispose of all or some of the Issuers securities in the open market, as
applicable, in privately negotiated transactions, in transactions directly with the Issuer or otherwise. Such actions will depend upon a variety of factors, including, without limitation, current and anticipated future trading prices, the financial
condition, results of operations and prospects of the Issuer, alternative investment opportunities, general economic, financial market and industry conditions and other factors that the Reporting Persons and/or their affiliates may deem material to
its investment decision. Also, the Reporting Persons and/or their affiliates have had and will continue to have discussions with management regarding the operations of the Issuer and matters of mutual interest, which could include the items in
subparagraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.  Except as set forth herein and/or in previous amendments to this Schedule
13D, as the case may be, the Reporting Persons do not have present plans or proposals at this time that relate to or would result in any of the transactions described in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D. 
 


Item 5.
Interest in Securities of the Issuer  Item 5 of this Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated in
its entirety as follows:  (a) (b) Items 7 through 11 and 13 of each of the cover pages of this amended Schedule 13D are incorporated herein by
reference. Such information is based on 211,756,727 shares of common stock outstanding as of November 10, 2015, according to the Issuers Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 13, 2015. 
(c) The information in Item 4 is incorporated herein by reference. 
In addition, on November 19, 2015, certain shares of restricted common stock of the Issuer previously granted by the Issuers Board of Directors
(the Board) directly to Pegasus Capital Advisors IV, L.P. (Pegasus Advisors IV) 



as director fees in respect of the service of Craig Cogut and Richard H. Davis, Jr. on the Issuers Board were cancelled in exchange for options to purchase the Issuers common stock
that were granted directly to Pegasus Advisors IV. In exchange for options to purchase 451,238 shares of common stock of the Issuer, 200,000 shares of restricted common stock of the Issuer granted in respect of Mr. Coguts Board service
were cancelled, and in exchange for options to purchase 541,485 shares of common stock of the Issuer, 240,000 shares of restricted common stock of the Issuer granted in respect of Mr. Davis Board service were cancelled. The options to
purchase common stock of the Issuer will be exercisable on January 1, 2016 at an exercise price of $0.13 per share, and expire on November 19, 2025. 
Because Mr. Cogut and Mr. Davis, each employees and/or partners, as the case may be, of Pegasus Advisors IV, serve on the Issuers Board as
representatives of Pegasus Advisors IV and its affiliates, each of Mr. Cogut and Mr. Davis do not have a right to any of the Issuers securities issued as director fees and Pegasus Advisors IV is entitled to receive all director fees
payable by the Issuer in respect of Mr. Coguts and Mr. Davis Board positions. All securities issued as director fees for Mr. Coguts and Mr. Davis Board service were accordingly issued directly to Pegasus
Advisors IV. Pegasus Capital Advisors IV GP, L.L.C. (Pegasus Advisors IV GP) is the general partner of Pegasus Advisors IV and Mr. Cogut is the sole owner and managing member of Pegasus Advisors IV GP. 
Except as set forth herein and/or in our previously filed amendments to Schedule 13D, as the case may be, there have been no other transactions in the class
of securities reported on that were effected within the past 60 days.  (d) The disclosure regarding the relationship between the Reporting Persons in
Item 2(f) of Amendment No. 39 to this Schedule 13D is incorporated by reference herein.  (e) N/A 
 


Item 6.
Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships with Respect to Securities of the Issuer 
Item 6 of Schedule 13D is supplemented and superseded, as the case may be, as follows: 
The disclosure in Item 4 is incorporated by reference herein. 
The Appeal Bond Warrant is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Amendment No. 42 to Schedule 13D and is incorporated by reference herein.

"Funded.com has been great and my project is in the final stages of being funded by an investor I found on here. I was surprized at the quick process and how fast investors funded my project. Website was a big help!"

Entreprenuer





Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again.

I am grateful I had the opportunity to access your network of investors. I am reasonably confident that the current negotiations with one of your investors will go through for our film production. I will be back for my next production.
