			MAREN ProPAK60-2R TWO RAM BALER		


Maren Engineering 


			2016-06-08T15:39:26+00:00		

MAREN ProPAK60-2R TWO RAM BALER:
The Model ProPAK60-2R is a fully automatic 2 RAM baler. The extra large feeder hopper can be adapted to gravity, pneumatic or belt conveyor automatic feed devices. After each bale is made, the chamber completely clears—so go ahead, switch materials on the fly—without making unwanted contaminated bales. A built-in shear eliminates the unnecessary extra step of “pre-conditioning” difficult materials. Using either Accent 470 or L.P. Pinnacle II wire-tie systems, the bale gets tied underneath and the short way: saving wire, increasing bale density and holding bales together better during transportation. This adds up to time and money savings!
FeaturesPerformanceOperator InterfaceBaleweightsPhoto GalleryVideosFeatures
FEATURES

Interlocking construction; stress is barred on steel not welds
Chassis floor, sides, and top are single sheet plate steel
No metal to metal contact in baling chamber platen guides on Nyoil wear bearings
Abrasion resistant 450 hardened wear liners eliminate costly floor replacements
Progressive shear cuts material over a distance allowing difficult materials to pass without jams
Machine can be greased from exterior
140 gallon hydraulic oil reservoir shipped full of oil—no oil to buy
Pressure sensing clogged oil filter sensor eliminates wasteful time based maintenance practices by notifying operator when filter actually warrants replacement
Ram position based on laser distancing (no moveable wear items such as limit switches)
Bale Separation door allows for 8” of over charge
All safety E-Stops monitored by a redundant monitoring system

Performance
PERFORMANCE DATA
Motor: 20hp ; (30hp Optional) TEFC Motor 460 Volt 3 Phase. Efficiency of hydraulic system allows for higher production rates with lower horsepower required
Hydraulic: 48 GPM 4400 psi rated, horsepower limited pressure compensated piston hydraulic pump w/ high pressure unloading valve, mounted below tank level to eliminate start up cavitation and extend pump life
Hydraulic System: Regenerative, 4,100 psi hydraulic pressure, 4500 psi max system pressure
Platen Force: 180,562 lbs.
Platen Pressure: 109 psi.
Cycle Time: SHORT : 24 seconds; FULL : 29 secondsOperator Interface
TOUCH SCREEN OPERATOR INTERFACE

Save a machine configuration for each different commodity being baled. Operator selects the material being baled and the 2R automatically configures for the commodity to be baled
Automatically cycles rams between commodity changes to eliminate bale contamination
Create and save specific material recipes
Shows exactly how much bale is complete inside the chamber for easy material changes
Adjust speed of conveyor(s) independently
Password protected maintenance screens are accessible to onsite maintenance staff allows further customization and simplifies trouble shooting
