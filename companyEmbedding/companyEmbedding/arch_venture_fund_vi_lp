Brief History
ARCH Venture Partners is a spinoff from an innovative technology 
commercialization initiative originated by The University of Chicago. In 1986, 
ARCH Development Corporation was formed as a not-for-profit affiliate 
corporation dedicated to commercializing promising technology developed in 
research laboratories at Argonne National Laboratory and the University.

Steven Lazarus was recruited to lead the new organization, with the broad 
mandate to license promising technology and promote the formation of spinoff 
companies. In 1986, Robert Nelsen and Keith Crandell joined Lazarus to focus on 
new company formation. Together they pioneered a successful commercialization 
strategy that benefited both the university and the scientists behind the 
research.

Very importantly, they recognized the need to create a venture capital fund to 
support the formation of spinoff companies, as the Midwest did not support a 
strong early stage venture capital community at the time. Shortly thereafter, in 
1989 ARCH raised its first venture fund.

In late 1992, Lazarus, Crandell, and Nelsen formed ARCH Venture Partners in a 
friendly separation agreement with The University of Chicago, which became a 
special limited partner and investor in the new venture capital firm. ARCH 
Development Corporation remained within the university as its technology 
transfer arm.

A year later, Clinton Bybee, an experienced seed investor and colleague from 
ARCH Development Corporation dating back to 1988, joined as ARCH's fourth 
partner. As a team ARCH's founding partners are unique, sharing more than 28 years 
of collaborative experiences in early stage new enterprise formation. This 
cohesive structure has been an underpinning of the firm's continuing success.

^top
Locations
ARCH maintains offices in Austin, TX, Chicago, IL, Seattle, WA, San 
Francisco, CA, and Dublin, Ireland. Part of our philosophy is to tap into underserved geographic 
markets that contain great centers of basic research and to actively support the 
region’s venture community and area entrepreneurs. From the beginning, our 
approach has been to access technology in the centers of discovery versus 
centers of finance.

Pioneering Strategies for Technology Commercialization

	ARCH Venture Partners invests in the development of seed and early stage 
	advanced technology companies that have the potential to grow rapidly into 
	successful businesses. We invest primarily in companies we co-found with leading 
	scientists and entrepreneurs, concentrating on bringing to market disruptive 
	innovations in life sciences, physical sciences and information technology, and 
	specialize in the spaces where they converge.

	We enjoy special recognition as a leader in the successful commercialization of 
	technologies developed at academic research institutions, corporate research 
	groups and national laboratories.

Before the Buzzwords

	Our team has deep scientific bench strength to locate and understand nascent 
	technologies long before they grow to become the popular industries of the day. 
	Our first nanotechnology investment was in 1989 (Nanophase Technologies) … our 
	first gene therapy and vaccine investments in 1992 (GenVec and Aviron) … our first 
	digital biology company was founded in 1993 (Illumina) … our first cleantech 
	company in 1994 (Eichrom Technologies) … and our first social networking investment 
	in 1996 (Classmates.com). The buzzwords hadn’t been formed yet, but the science, the 
	technology and the opportunities were all sound.

Partnering Excellence

	ARCH has worked with exceptional entrepreneurs as well as academic and industry 
	partners to build more than 180 companies. Among the ARCH-funded companies that 
	are now public firms or were acquired are VBI Vaccines, Pulmatrix, Chiasma, 
	Bellerophon Therapeutics, Juno Therapeutics, Illumina, Aviron, Alnylam 
	Pharmaceuticals, Kythera Biopharmaceuticals, Receptos, Agios Pharmaceuticals, 
	Sage Therapeutics, BIND Therapeutics, Fate Therapeutics, Bluebird Bio, 
	Achaogen, Ikaria, Crystal IS, Nanophase Technologies, deCODE Genetics, 
	Celebrate Express, Kotura, NeurogesX, Caliper Life Sciences, Classmates.com, XenoPort, New 
	Era of Networks, Trubion Pharmaceuticals, GenVec, Array BioPharma, Ahura Scientific,
	ALIS, MicroOptical Devices, Adolor, Everyday Learning, Innovalight, and R2 Technology.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.
