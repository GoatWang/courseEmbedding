New regulation, emerging competition, and changing customer preferences is a cause for added stress and pressure on retail banks to increase non-interest income. This is a problem for retail banks that aren’t measuring customer activity such as product penetration, activation, debit card usage, and online banking or bill pay. Even worse, some banks that are capturing such data are not...Read More

My week began at The Data Warehouse Institute’s annual World Conference and it ended at The Chicago Chapter of the American Statistical Association’s annual Statistical Advocate of the Year Award luncheon.

Earlier this week, J.C. Penney decided to bring Ron Johnson’s reign as CEO to an end after only 17 months on the job. This certainly wasn’t surprising based on their 2012 results – revenue down $4.3B, loss of nearly $1B, and a 50% drop in stock price.
In all of the coverage of his downfall, one quote caught my attention from Bill Ackman, accomplished hedge fund manager who helped...Read More
