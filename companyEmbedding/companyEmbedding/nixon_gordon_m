Early life[edit]
Born in Montreal, Quebec, he was educated at Lower Canada College. Nixon received an Honours Bachelor of Commerce degree from Queen's University in 1979,[2] and holds Honorary Doctor of Laws from both Queen's University and Dalhousie University.
Career[edit]
Nixon began his career in 1979 at Dominion Securities in Toronto and worked in global markets, investment banking and in 1986 transferred to Tokyo to assume responsibility for the firm's operations in Japan. Dominion Securities was acquired by Royal Bank of Canada in 1987 and Nixon returned to Toronto in 1989 as a managing director of the Investment Banking Division and in 1995 was appointed head of Global Investment Banking. In 1999, Nixon became chief executive officer of RBC Capital Markets and a member of Royal Bank's Executive Committee.
Nixon was appointed president of Royal Bank of Canada on April 1, 2001 and chief executive officer on August 1, 2001, succeeding John Cleghorn in both capacities. At the age of 44 when he was appointed chief executive, Nixon became the youngest person to ever to head a major Canadian bank. In September 2004, Nixon initiated a major restructuring of RBC.[3][4]
Nixon relinquished his title of president at the Annual Meeting on February 26, 2014, and after 13 years as chief executive officer he retired on August 1, 2014, being succeeded in both roles by David McKay who was previously Group Head of Personal & Commercial Banking.[5]
Other[edit]
Nixon is Chairman of Bell Canada Enterprises and is a director of George Weston Limited, BlackRock Inc., and he is also on the advisory board of KingSett Capital. [6]
Nixon is chairman of MaRS, a not-for-profit organization that connects science, business and capital, chairman of the Queen's University Capital Campaign and is a director of the Art Gallery of Ontario. He is past chairman of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, the Premier's Jobs and Prosperity Council and has served as a director of a number of organizations in the arts, health care and education.
Nixon has been awarded the Order of Canada and the Order of Ontario and is an inductee into the Canadian Business Hall of Fame. He is a recipient of Canada's Outstanding CEO of the Year Award, the Canadian Business Leader Award, and has been included on both Barron's list of the World's Best CEO's and Bloomberg's list of the World's Most Influential People. Nixon is an Honouree of the Public Policy Forum and is a recipient of the CIJA/UJA Words and Deeds Leadership Award, the Rotary Foundation's Paul Harris Fellowship, the Queen's Golden Jubilee and Diamond Jubilee Medals, a Learning Partnership Champion of Public Education Tribute and an American Banker Innovator of the Year Award.
Personal life[edit]
He is married to Janet Nixon and has three children.

BlackRock Announces Appointment of Gordon M. Nixon to Board of Directors | Business Wire
























































BlackRock Announces Appointment of Gordon M. Nixon to Board of 
      Directors






July 30, 2015 05:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) elected Gordon M. Nixon, former President, 
      CEO, and Director of the Royal Bank of Canada (“RBC”), to the Company’s 
      Board of Directors. Mr. Nixon, who retired from RBC in August 2014, is 
      scheduled to join the Board on October 6 as an independent director.
    

      Laurence D. Fink, BlackRock Chairman and CEO, said, “With thirteen years 
      at the helm of a leading global financial institution and one of 
      Canada’s largest public companies, Gordon brings invaluable expertise 
      and perspective to BlackRock about the world at large and in-depth 
      knowledge about the North American market. His experience growing a 
      diversified, global financial services organization in today’s 
      regulatory and economic environment makes him an exceptional addition to 
      our Board.”
    

      Mr. Nixon’s leadership has been widely recognized as the driving force 
      behind RBC’s performance during his tenure. As President and Chief 
      Executive Officer, Mr. Nixon transformed the organization by fostering a 
      client-centric culture and drove greater collaboration across functional 
      areas. As a result of these and other initiatives, RBC saw significant 
      earnings and global market share growth under his leadership. In 2010, 
      he was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada, one of Canada’s 
      highest acknowledgements of outstanding merit or distinguished service 
      by a private citizen. He was also twice named to Barron’s list of 
      World’s Best CEOs.
    

      Mr. Nixon began his career in 1979 when he joined Toronto-based Dominion 
      Securities, and by 1986, he had been promoted to run Dominion’s Japanese 
      operations. When Dominion was acquired by RBC, he returned to 
      headquarters operations in Toronto. By 1999 he was promoted to Chief 
      Executive of RBC Capital Markets, a position which he held until his 
      2001 appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer of RBC.
    

      During his professional career, Mr. Nixon has served on a variety of 
      boards. He currently serves as a Director of BCE, Inc., George Weston 
      Limited and Art Gallery of Ontario, as well as on the advisory board of 
      Kingsett Capital. Mr. Nixon has also served on the boards of nonprofits, 
      including MaRS, an organization that connects science, business, and 
      capital, as chair, as well as the Toronto Region Immigrant Employment 
      Council as co-chair. Mr. Nixon is a past chairman of the Canadian 
      Council of Chief Executives, and he currently chairs the Ontario 
      Premier's Jobs and Prosperity Council and the Queen's University Capital 
      Campaign. Mr. Nixon has also served on the boards of organizations in 
      the arts, health care, and education.
    

      With the addition of Mr. Nixon, BlackRock’s Board of Directors consists 
      of 19 members, including 16 independent directors.
