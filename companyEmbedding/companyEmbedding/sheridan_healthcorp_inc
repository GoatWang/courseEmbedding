The Sheridan Leadership Academy
The Sheridan Leadership Academy originally began as a forum to bring our physicians and allied health providers together in a collaborative environment, to establish a bond with their peers, and provide an opportunity to better understand Sheridan's goals and objectives.
Today, it has transformed into a comprehensive program in which we invest in the development, training, and education of our clinical leaders, as a way to empower providers who have natural leadership skills and equip them with the knowledge they require in their daily responsibilities so that they can evolve into even stronger leaders.
All medical directors participate in this collaborative environment, and physicians gain a fresh approach to their personal leadership styles to enhance their ability to lead while refining their decision-making expertise.
The program offers the following leadership resources:
The 360 degree leadership assessment is an evaluation process that provides our clinical leaders with honest, open feedback on their leadership style and performance
Quarterly webinars to educate our providers on current hot topics in the healthcare industry.
The semi-annual original workshop, which allows our team leaders to focus on a specific, topical theme that we try to correlate with Sheridan's key initiatives
The Leadership Intensive is a two-day conference that mixes lectures by esteemed physicians and healthcare executives with collaboration exercises and role play scenarios to assist clinical leaders in looking at issues from the perspective of their facility.

Anesthesiology

				An anesthesiologist is trained to provide pain relief and maintenance, or restoration, of a stable condition during and immediately following an operation or an obstetric or diagnostic procedure. The anesthesiologist assesses the risk of the patient undergoing surgery and optimizes the patient's condition prior to, during and after surgery. In addition to these management responsibilities, the anesthesiologist provides medical management and consultation in pain management and critical care medicine. Anesthesiologists diagnose and treat acute, long-standing and cancer pain problems; diagnose and treat patients with critical illnesses or severe injuries; direct resuscitation in the care of patients with cardiac or respiratory emergencies, including the need for artificial ventilation; and supervise post-anesthesia recovery.

					Some organization health care providers are made up of components that furnish different types of health care or have separate physical locations where health care is furnished. These components and physical locations are not themselves legal entities, but are part of the organization health care provider (which is a legal entity).
					A covered organization provider may decide that its subparts (if it has any) should have their own NPI numbers. If a subpart conducts any HIPAA standard transactions on its own (e.g., separately from its parent), it must obtain its own NPI number.

Sheridan Healthcorp Inc.



Public





We are pleased to introduce Sheridan Healthcare, Inc., one of the most experienced outsourcing provider for anesthesiology, neonatology and emergency medicine services. We are proud of the success our team of physicians, allied health professionals and corporate personnel has achieved in our 50-year history.

Physician-owned and managed, Sheridan Healthcare's philosophy has always been to build upon the group practice model. As the hospital-based solution for physician services, we pride ourselves on our expertise, which enables us to provide solutions to the various and unique needs of medical facilities. Those solutions range from recruiting highly credentialed physicians and managing the teams they work in, to billing and collecting payments for their services. And speaking of recruiting, the retention rate of our physicians and allied healthcare workers (most are employed by Sheridan) is the highest in the industry. This provides stability for your programs, which, of course, strengthens your bottom line.

Sheridan Healthcare includes several wholly owned companies, each with a distinct clinical focus. Sheridan Healthcare's companies include over 1,300 employees, and we're proud of our excellent record of maintaining long-term contracts with health care facilities. In fact, our first client, located in Hollywood, Florida, is still our client. Our expertise also extends to our excellent skills in third-party and managed care contracting.





Heritage
In the early 1950s, three anesthesiologists in South Florida founded the predecessor of Sheridan Healthcare to provide hospital-based anesthesia coverage to a local hospital. As South Florida grew and the health care marketplace became increasingly competitive, other facilities approached us to improve the quality of their anesthesia programs. Our history traces to our first client, Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Florida, which has evolved and expanded to become a major regional tertiary healthcare center. This relationship rapidly expanded to new hospital and ambulatory surgery center clients in South Florida. As our company grew within a dynamic and rapidly changing healthcare environment, we developed an increased sophistication while we simultaneously invested in our business infrastructure to ensure our continued growth and success.

Based on our reputation for quality and our dedication to service, facilities soon began approaching us about expanding our services to include neonatology, hospital-based pediatrics, and adult and pediatric emergency medicine. We responded, incorporating the successful attributes of the original group practice model to meet the changing needs of our clients. Over the last decade, we began exporting our successful operating model to other states and now provide services around the country.

We have grown our list of satisfied clients by remaining true to our core principle of providing quality heath care for each individual patient. Sheridan Healthcare places a high value on its relationships with the facilities it serves, and earns its reputation for quality and service every day. It is through this commitment that we continue to grow, and maintain what we have established. This is exemplified in our continued service to our very first client facility spanning over 50 years!

Thanks to our reputation for meeting and consistently exceeding the needs of our client hospitals, Sheridan Healthcare has achieved an enviable contract retention rate. Not only our first client, but all of our clients receive the same individual attention, professionalism, expertise, concern and quality of care that launched our company a half century ago. Carefully attending to our patients, years of being attentive to hospital medical staffs, responding to administrations’ concerns, and enthusiastically embracing change has helped us to grow and prosper along with our client facilities.

These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.
