Welcome.
Convector Capital Management was founded with a commitment to responsibly manage assets by pursuing superior long-term returns while protecting capital through active risk control.  The team behind our firm has applied this principle and associated strategy for over a decade of managing substantial assets.  Our successful record of dispassionate analysis, combined with disciplined portfolio construction, has generated investment returns well in excess of market and peer averages.
Our opportunistic, value orientated investment philosophy takes advantage of periodic inefficiencies that develop in the valuation of publicly traded securities.  Therefore, our investment positions are differentiated and often contrarian to that of the market's, and are generated by specific fundamental analysis informed by deep industry knowledge.  We then seek to combine security-specific insight with disciplined portfolio construction that seeks to minimize potential downside through active risk management.  Every step of our investment process is augmented by a proprietary technology platform that enhances our ability to identify opportunities and empirically test hypotheses through a comprehensive study of data.
At Convector Capital Management, we invest our own capital alongside that of our clients. We do this not only because it is the right business decision to align our interests with those of our clients, but also because we fundamentally believe it is the most intelligent approach to managing a significant portion of our own capital.

                    Emmanuel Ferreira
                    Founder and Managing Partner

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
