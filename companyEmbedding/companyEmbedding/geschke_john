Dr. Charles M. Geschke & John E. WarnockCo-founders of Adobe Systems Inc.Founded: 1982"Our only real cleverness was in the perception of what was happening, and in being quick enough on our feet to take advantage of if."-Dr. Charles M. Geschke Mention the names Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, and most people immediately know whom you're talking about. But mention the names Dr. Charles M. Geschke and John E. Warnock, and chances are you'll be met with blank stares. Ironically, these two publicity-shy high-tech trailblazers played major roles in the success of both Microsoft and Apple. In fact, without the PostScript language created by the company Geschke and Warnock co-founded, Adobe Systems Inc., desktop publishing as we know it wouldn't exist.Like many Silicon Valley firms, Adobe was a spin-off of a bigger company-in this case, Xerox Corp. Geschke and Warnock first met and began working together at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), where they helped develop Xerox's page-description language, Interpress. The language won accolades within the corporation, but to Geschke and Warnock's dismay, Xerox decided to keep the technology proprietary rather that release it to public domain. Geschke and Warnock were flabbergasted by the decision. As Geschke explains in a 1987 PC Week interview, "We didn't see how you could make an industrywide standard with something that was proprietary."Deciding that they could "get old and gray and frustrated somewhere else and have more fun," Geschke and Warnock left PARC to found Adobe Systems Inc. in late 1982. Originally, they planned to build a copy-service business, but quickly abandoned the idea. Next, they considered offering a complete turnkey system for office printing, but dismissed that idea as well when they realized that the industry would probably head in a different direction.Finally, they decided to concentrate on what they did best-developing specialized printing software. The result of this decision was the Adobe PostScript page-description language. A revolutionary breakthrough in printing technology, PostScript was the first printing software that enabled users to print pages that included text, line art and digitized photos.Realizing that their best chance for success lay in making PostScript an industry standard, Adobe quickly made the PostScript language public domain. But if the product was public domain, and therefore free, how could Adobe make money from its new software? Simple: Without the PostScript program that interprets the PostScript language, the language itself is useless. In a unique twist on the classic "sell them the razor cheap then make your profits on supplying the blades," Adobe would make its money from selling the PostScript interpreter, which executes page descriptions generated by other software packages, such as desktop publishing and word processing programs. In addition, the company would also provide original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) with designs for interpreter boards to be used in their printers.The strategy worked. By the end of their first year in business, Geschke and Warnock had licensed PostScript to Apple Computer Inc., which in turn introduced the first PostScript-based laser printer, the Apple LaserWriter, in January 1985. And thus, the PostScript laser printer industry was born.Thanks to what Geschke has described as a unique combination of forward thinking, marketing savvy, timing and luck, Adobe was a success almost from the very start. By the end of 1984, it was posting revenue of $2.2 million, which grew to $16 million by the beginning of 1986. Based on their rapidly increasing revenue, Geschke and Warnock made an initial public offering in August 1986, and Adobe stock immediately became one of Wall Street's darlings. It rocketed from $11 to a peak of $56 in May 1987 (which in reality was a $112 peak, considering and earlier 2-for-1 stock split).But more important, by 1987, Adobe's PostScript had become the industry-standard printer language. More than 400 third-party software programs supported PostScript, and Adobe boasted licensing agreements with 19 printer companies (including IBM, Digital, AST and Texas Instruments). Even Hewlett-Packard, which had initially refused to endorse the language in any way, was forced to adopt PostScript. To further increase PostScript's popularity, Adobe began building what would eventually become the world's largest typeface library.With PostScript firmly entrenched as the industry standard, Geschke and Warnock branched out into the end-user software market with the release of Adobe Illustrator in March 1987. This high-end graphic package for professional artists and illustrators was an instant hit with both users and critics.By 1993, Illustrator had also become an industry standard; Adobe's second software program, PhotoShop (another professional graphics package that enables users to manipulate both black-and-white and color photographs), was generating impressive reviews and even more impressive sales; and Adobe's typeface library had grown to include 1,800 fonts.Flush with this success, Geschke and Warnock set their sights on a new goal: creating a "paperless office." To this end, they developed Adobe Acrobat, an innovative program that enables users to create documents that others can view regardless of their application software. In a brilliant marketing move, Adobe decided to offer Acrobat Reader, the program needed to view Acrobat documents, free of charge. Instead, they would charge for Acrobat Distiller, the program that creates Acrobat documents. Although it's not the raging success PostScript or Illustrator were, Acrobat is widely used for transferring, sharing and viewing documents electronically.The duo's next big move was to join forces with Aldus Corp., the creator of the popular desktop publishing program PageMaker, in 1994. The merger handed Adobe unquestioned leadership of the publishing-software market, creating one vendor with a broad array of products that covers both Windows and Macintosh users.Adobe's position as "king of the hill" would not go unchallenged, however. By 1996, the once undisputed ruler of desktop publishing was losing market share to Quark Corp.-whose Quark Xpress desktop publishing program had muscled PageMaker out of the top spot in the Macintosh market-and Corel Corp., whose CorelDraw was gaining ground on Illustrator in the Windows market.Rather than go toe-to-toe with these two up-and-coming contenders, Geschke and Warnock decided to change the rules on their competitors. They attempted to reposition Adobe as a high-profile World Wide Web publisher with the release of two Web-page authoring tools: PageMill and SiteMill. They also retooled Illustrator, PageMaker and PhotoShop to include Web-content creation tools. The gambit proved worthwhile, as Adobe once again became the kingpin of the professional graphics market, averaging nearly $900 million in sales in 1998.By 1999, Adobe found itself competing with a new, more powerful challenger-software titan Microsoft. Before Microsoft's emergence in the image-editing market, many industry analysts had noticed a change in Adobe. While it was still producing innovative products, sales were down, mostly because its marketing and PR efforts seemed to stall. PC Magazine columnist John C. Dvorak suggests that was partially due to the continually increasing isolation of both Geschke and Warnock, which Dvorak proposes was caused by Geschke's abduction by terrorists in 1992.Whatever the future may hold for Geschke and Warnock, one thing is certain-Adobe's influence on the computer industry and image editing will be apparent for decades to come. Whether you browse the World Wide Web, flip through a magazine or newspaper, pick up a product box, or look up at a billboard, chances are the images and text were created with one or more Adobe products. Five Days Of TerrorOn May 25, 1992, an event occurred that would rock Silicon Valley. On his way to Adobe's headquarters in Mountain View, California, Charles Geschke was abducted by two kidnappers who demanded $650,000 in ransom for his return. Geschke's family was instructed to put the ransom in a knapsack and drop it off at an isolated beach. FBI agents hiding nearby lost one of the kidnappers in the fog as he was picking up the ransom, but captured him several hours later. During questioning, the kidnapper revealed the location where Geschke was being held, and Geschke was returned to his family after five days in captivity.Book WormIn what very well may be one of the computer industry's greatest ironies, "paperless office" prophet and Adobe Acrobat apostle John Warnock has a passion for old books. His extensive collection of rare first editions includes literary treasures ranging from a 16th century Euclid tome to all of Charles Darwin's books.

History[edit]
The company was started in Warnock's garage.[7] The name of the company, Adobe, comes from Adobe Creek in Los Altos, California, which ran behind Warnock's house.[4] Adobe's corporate logo features a stylized "A" and was designed by the wife of John Warnock, Marva Warnock, who is a graphic designer.[8]
Steve Jobs asked to buy the company for five million dollars[9] in 1982, but Warnock and Geschke refused. Their investors urged them to work something out with Jobs, so they agreed to sell him shares worth 19 percent of the company, for which Jobs paid a five-times multiple of their company's valuation at the time, plus a five-year license fee for PostScript, in advance. The purchase and advance made Adobe the first company in the history of Silicon Valley to become profitable in its first year.[10]
Warnock and Geschke considered various business options including a copy-service business and a turnkey system for office printing. Then they chose to focus on developing specialized printing software, and created the Adobe PostScript page description language.[11]
PostScript was the first truly international standard for computer printing, as it included algorithms describing the letter-forms of many languages. Adobe added kanji printer products in 1988.[12] Warnock and Geschke were also able to bolster the credibility of Postscript by connecting with a typesetting manufacturer. They weren't able to work with Compugraphic, but then worked with Linotype to license the Helvetica and Times Roman fonts (through the Linotron 100).[13] By 1987, PostScript had become the industry-standard printer language with more than 400 third-party software programs and licensing agreements with 19 printer companies.[14]
Warnock described the language as "extensible", in its ability to apply graphic arts standards to office printing.[15]
Adobe's first products after PostScript were digital fonts, which they released in a proprietary format called Type 1. Apple subsequently developed a competing standard, TrueType, which provided full scalability and precise control of the pixel pattern created by the font's outlines, and licensed it to Microsoft.
In the mid-1980s, Adobe entered the consumer software market with Illustrator, a vector-based drawing program for the Apple Macintosh. Illustrator, which grew from the firm's in-house font-development software, helped popularize PostScript-enabled laser printers.
Adobe Systems entered NASDAQ in August 1986. Its revenue has grown from roughly $1 billion in 1999 to roughly $4 billion in 2012.[16] Adobe's fiscal years run from December to November. For example, the 2007 fiscal year ended on November 30, 2007.
In 1989, Adobe introduced what was to become its flagship product, a graphics editing program for the Macintosh called Photoshop. Stable and full-featured, Photoshop 1.0 was ably marketed by Adobe and soon dominated the market.
In 1993, Adobe introduced PDF, the Portable Document Format, and its Adobe Acrobat and Reader software. PDF is now an International Standard: ISO 32000-1:2008.
In December 1991, Adobe released Adobe Premiere, which Adobe rebranded as Adobe Premiere Pro in 2003. In 1992, Adobe acquired OCR Systems, Inc. In 1994, Adobe acquired Aldus and added PageMaker and After Effects to its product line later in the year; it also controls the TIFF file format. In 1995, Adobe added FrameMaker, the long-document DTP application, to its product line after Adobe acquired Frame Technology Corp. In 1996, Adobe Systems Inc added Ares Software Corp.[17] In 2002, Adobe acquired Canadian company Accelio (also known as JetForm).[18]

On December 12, 2005, Adobe acquired its main rival, Macromedia, in a stock swap valued at about $3.4 billion, adding ColdFusion, Contribute, Captivate, Acrobat Connect (formerly Macromedia Breeze), Director, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Flash, FlashPaper, Flex, FreeHand, HomeSite, JRun, Presenter, and Authorware to Adobe's product line.[19]
Adobe released Adobe Media Player in April 2008.[20] On April 27, Adobe discontinued development and sales of its older HTML/web development software, GoLive in favor of Dreamweaver. Adobe offered a discount on Dreamweaver for GoLive users and supports those who still use GoLive with online tutorials and migration assistance. On June 1, Adobe launched Acrobat.com, a series of web applications geared for collaborative work.[21] Creative Suite 4, which includes Design, Web, Production Premium and Master Collection came out in October 2008 in six configurations at prices from about USD $1,700 to $2,500[22] or by individual application.[23] The Windows version of Photoshop includes 64-bit processing.[23] On December 3, 2008, Adobe laid off 600 of its employees (8% of the worldwide staff) citing the weak economic environment.
On November 10, 2009, the company laid off a further 680 employees.[24] Adobe announced it was investigating a "coordinated attack" against corporate network systems in China, managed by the company.[25]
Adobe's 2010 was marked by continuing front-and-back arguments with Apple over the latter's non-support for Adobe Flash on its iPhone, iPad and other products.[26] Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs claimed that Flash was not reliable or secure enough, while Adobe executives have argued that Apple wish to maintain control over the iOS platform. In April 2010, Steve Jobs published a post titled "Thoughts on Flash" where he outlined his thoughts on Flash and the rise of HTML 5.[27] In July 2010, Adobe bought Day Software[28] integrating their line of CQ Products: WCM,[29] DAM,[30] SOCO,[31] and Mobile[32]
In January 2011, Adobe acquired DemDex, Inc. with the intent of adding DemDex's audience-optimization software to its online marketing suite.[33] At Photoshop World 2011, Adobe unveiled a new mobile photo service.[34] Carousel is a new application for iPhone, iPad and Mac that uses Photoshop Lightroom technology for users to adjust and fine-tune images on all platforms.[34] Carousel will also allow users to automatically sync, share and browse photos.[34] The service was later renamed to "Adobe Revel".[35]
In October 2011, Adobe acquired Nitobi Software, the makers of the mobile application development framework PhoneGap. As part of the acquisition, the source code of PhoneGap was submitted to the Apache Foundation, where it became Apache Cordova.[36]
On November 9, 2011, Adobe announced that they would cease development of Flash for mobile devices following version 11.1. Instead it would focus on HTML 5 for mobile devices.[37] On December 1, 2011, Adobe announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately held Efficient Frontier.[38]
In December 2012, Adobe opened a new 280,000 square foot corporate campus in Lehi, Utah.[39]
 In 2013, Adobe Systems endured a major security breach. Vast portions of the source code for the company's software were stolen and posted online[40] and over 150 million records of Adobe's customers have been made readily available for download.[41] In 2012, about 40 million sets of payment card information were compromised by a hack of Adobe.[42]
A class-action lawsuit alleging that the company suppressed employee compensation was filed against Adobe, and three other Silicon Valley-based companies in a California federal district court in 2013.[43] In May 2014, it was revealed the four companies, Adobe, Apple, Google, and Intel had reached agreement with the plaintiffs, 64,000 employees of the four companies, to pay a sum of $324.5 million to settle the suit.

Reception[edit]
Since 1995, Fortune has ranked Adobe as an outstanding place to work. Adobe was rated the 5th best U.S. company to work for in 2003, 6th in 2004, 31st in 2007, 40th in 2008, 11th in 2009, 42nd in 2010, 65th in 2011, 41st in 2012, and 83rd in 2013.[46] In 2015, Adobe Systems India was ranked 21st of great places to work in India.[47] In June 2014, it was ranked 6th of great places to work in India.,[48] In October 2008, Adobe Systems Canada Inc. was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in Maclean's newsmagazine.[49]
Criticisms[edit]
Pricing[edit]
Adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices,[50][51] with retail prices being up to twice as much in non-US countries.[52] As pointed out by many, it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the United States and purchase one particular collection of Adobe's software there than to buy it locally in Australia.[53][54]
After Adobe revealed the pricing for the Creative Suite 3 Master Collection, which was £1,000 higher for European customers,[55] a petition to protest over "unfair pricing" was published and signed by 10,000 users.[56] In June 2009, Adobe further increased its prices in the UK by 10% in spite of weakening of the pound against the dollar,[57] and UK users are not allowed to buy from the US store.[58]
Adobe ranked no. 5 on a list of Internet’s 9 Most Hated Companies, based on a 2013 survey on Reddit.com.[59] Adobe's Reader and Flash were listed on The 10 most hated programs of all time on TechRadar.com.[60]
Security[edit]
Hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in Adobe programs, such as Adobe Reader, to gain unauthorized access to computers.[61] Adobe's Flash Player has also been criticized for, among other things, suffering from performance, memory usage and security problems (see criticism of Flash Player). A report by security researchers from Kaspersky Lab criticized Adobe for producing the products having top 10 security vulnerabilities.[62]
Observers noted that Adobe was spying on its customers by including spyware in the Creative Suite 3 software and quietly sending user data to a firm named Omniture.[63] When users became aware, Adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they: "could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account".[64] When a security flaw was later discovered in Photoshop CS5, Adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched, so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade.[65] Following a fierce backlash Adobe decided to provide the software patch.[66]
Adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including third-party browser toolbars and free virus scanners, usually as part of the Flash update process,[67] and for pushing a third-party scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs.[68]
Customer data breach[edit]
On October 3, 2013, the company initially revealed that 2.9 million customers' sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information.[69][70][71] Adobe later admitted that 38 million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their IDs and encrypted passwords, as well as to many inactive Adobe accounts.[72][73] The company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted, such as email addresses and physical addresses, though data privacy laws in 44 states require this information to be encrypted.[74][75]
A 3.8 GB file stolen from Adobe and containing 152 million usernames, reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on AnonNews.org.[76] LastPass, a password security firm, said that Adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not salted them.[77][78] Another security firm, Sophos, showed that Adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort.[79] According to an IT expert Simon Bain, Adobe has failed its customers and ‘should hang their heads in shame’.[80]
Many of the credit cards were tied to the Creative Cloud software-by-subscription service.[81] Adobe offered its affected US customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service, but no similar arrangements have been made for non-US customers.[82][83] When a data breach occurs in the US, penalties depend on the state where the victim resides, not where the company is based.[84]
After stealing the customers' data, cyber-thieves also accessed Adobe's source code repository, likely in mid-August 2013.[85] Because hackers acquired copies of the source code of Adobe proprietary products,[86] they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security, computer experts warned.[87] Security researcher Alex Holden, chief information security officer of Hold Security, characterized this Adobe breach, which affected Acrobat, ColdFusion and numerous other applications, as "one of the worst in US history".[88] Adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of Photoshop, which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques[89] and would make it easier to pirate Adobe's expensive products.[90]
Published on a server of a Russian-speaking hacker group,[91] the "disclosure of encryption algorithms, other security schemes, and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data" and may have opened the gateway to new generation zero-day attacks. Hackers already used ColdFusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of PR Newswire's customers, which has been tied to the Adobe security breach.[citation needed] They also used a ColdFusion exploit to breach Washington state court and expose up to 160,000 Social Security numbers.[92]

Anti-competitive practices[edit]
Adobe acquired Aldus Corp. in 1994, a software vendor that sold FreeHand, a competing product.[93][94] Freehand was direct competition to Adobe Illustrator, Adobe's flagship vector-graphics editor.[94][93] The Federal Trade Commission intervened and forced Adobe to sell FreeHand back to Altsys, and also banned Adobe from buying back FreeHand or any similar program for the next 10 years (1994-2004).[94][93] Altsys was then bought by Macromedia, which released versions 5 to 11.[94] When Adobe acquired Macromedia in December 2005, it stalled development of Freehand in 2007, effectively rendering it obsolete.[93][95] With FreeHand and Illustrator, Adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for Macintosh operating systems.[93]
In 2011, a group of 5,000 Freehand graphic designers convened under the banner Free Freehand, and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Adobe.[94][93][96][97] The suit alleged that Adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market and that Adobe has engaged in a series of exclusionary and anti-competitive acts and strategies designed to kill FreeHand, the dominant competitor to Adobe’s Illustrator software product, instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism.[93][96][97] Adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled.[93][95] The FreeHand community believes Adobe should release the product to an open-source community if it cannot update it internally.[94]
As of 2010, on its FreeHand product page Adobe stated "While we recognize FreeHand has a loyal customer base, we encourage users to migrate to the new Adobe Illustrator CS4 software which supports both PowerPC and Intel-based Macs and Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Vista." As of 2016, the Freehand page no longer exists and simply redirects to the Illustrator page. Adobe's software FTP server still contains a directory for FreeHand, but it is empty.

Adobe Systems Incorporated (/əˈdoʊbiː/) is an American multinational computer software company. The company is headquartered in San Jose, California, United States. Adobe has historically focused upon the creation of multimedia and creativity software products, with a more recent foray towards rich Internet application software development. It is best known for Photoshop, an image editing software, Acrobat Reader, the Portable Document Format (PDF) and Adobe Creative Suite, as well as its successor Adobe Creative Cloud.
Adobe was founded in December 1982[4] by John Warnock and Charles Geschke, who established the company after leaving Xerox PARC in order to develop and sell the PostScript page description language. In 1985, Apple Computer licensed PostScript for use in its LaserWriter printers, which helped spark the desktop publishing revolution.[5]
As of 2015[update], Adobe Systems has about 15,000 employees worldwide,[4] about 40% of whom work in San Jose. Adobe also has major development operations in Newton, Massachusetts;[6] New York City, New York; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Lehi, Utah; Seattle, Washington; San Francisco and San Luis Obispo, California in the United States.

History[edit]
The company was started in Warnock's garage.[7] The name of the company, Adobe, comes from Adobe Creek in Los Altos, California, which ran behind Warnock's house.[4] Adobe's corporate logo features a stylized "A" and was designed by the wife of John Warnock, Marva Warnock, who is a graphic designer.[8]
Steve Jobs asked to buy the company for five million dollars[9] in 1982, but Warnock and Geschke refused. Their investors urged them to work something out with Jobs, so they agreed to sell him shares worth 19 percent of the company, for which Jobs paid a five-times multiple of their company's valuation at the time, plus a five-year license fee for PostScript, in advance. The purchase and advance made Adobe the first company in the history of Silicon Valley to become profitable in its first year.[10]
Warnock and Geschke considered various business options including a copy-service business and a turnkey system for office printing. Then they chose to focus on developing specialized printing software, and created the Adobe PostScript page description language.[11]
PostScript was the first truly international standard for computer printing, as it included algorithms describing the letter-forms of many languages. Adobe added kanji printer products in 1988.[12] Warnock and Geschke were also able to bolster the credibility of Postscript by connecting with a typesetting manufacturer. They weren't able to work with Compugraphic, but then worked with Linotype to license the Helvetica and Times Roman fonts (through the Linotron 100).[13] By 1987, PostScript had become the industry-standard printer language with more than 400 third-party software programs and licensing agreements with 19 printer companies.[14]
Warnock described the language as "extensible", in its ability to apply graphic arts standards to office printing.[15]
Adobe's first products after PostScript were digital fonts, which they released in a proprietary format called Type 1. Apple subsequently developed a competing standard, TrueType, which provided full scalability and precise control of the pixel pattern created by the font's outlines, and licensed it to Microsoft.
In the mid-1980s, Adobe entered the consumer software market with Illustrator, a vector-based drawing program for the Apple Macintosh. Illustrator, which grew from the firm's in-house font-development software, helped popularize PostScript-enabled laser printers.
Adobe Systems entered NASDAQ in August 1986. Its revenue has grown from roughly $1 billion in 1999 to roughly $4 billion in 2012.[16] Adobe's fiscal years run from December to November. For example, the 2007 fiscal year ended on November 30, 2007.
In 1989, Adobe introduced what was to become its flagship product, a graphics editing program for the Macintosh called Photoshop. Stable and full-featured, Photoshop 1.0 was ably marketed by Adobe and soon dominated the market.
In 1993, Adobe introduced PDF, the Portable Document Format, and its Adobe Acrobat and Reader software. PDF is now an International Standard: ISO 32000-1:2008.
In December 1991, Adobe released Adobe Premiere, which Adobe rebranded as Adobe Premiere Pro in 2003. In 1992, Adobe acquired OCR Systems, Inc. In 1994, Adobe acquired Aldus and added PageMaker and After Effects to its product line later in the year; it also controls the TIFF file format. In 1995, Adobe added FrameMaker, the long-document DTP application, to its product line after Adobe acquired Frame Technology Corp. In 1996, Adobe Systems Inc added Ares Software Corp.[17] In 2002, Adobe acquired Canadian company Accelio (also known as JetForm).[18]

On December 12, 2005, Adobe acquired its main rival, Macromedia, in a stock swap valued at about $3.4 billion, adding ColdFusion, Contribute, Captivate, Acrobat Connect (formerly Macromedia Breeze), Director, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Flash, FlashPaper, Flex, FreeHand, HomeSite, JRun, Presenter, and Authorware to Adobe's product line.[19]
Adobe released Adobe Media Player in April 2008.[20] On April 27, Adobe discontinued development and sales of its older HTML/web development software, GoLive in favor of Dreamweaver. Adobe offered a discount on Dreamweaver for GoLive users and supports those who still use GoLive with online tutorials and migration assistance. On June 1, Adobe launched Acrobat.com, a series of web applications geared for collaborative work.[21] Creative Suite 4, which includes Design, Web, Production Premium and Master Collection came out in October 2008 in six configurations at prices from about USD $1,700 to $2,500[22] or by individual application.[23] The Windows version of Photoshop includes 64-bit processing.[23] On December 3, 2008, Adobe laid off 600 of its employees (8% of the worldwide staff) citing the weak economic environment.
On November 10, 2009, the company laid off a further 680 employees.[24] Adobe announced it was investigating a "coordinated attack" against corporate network systems in China, managed by the company.[25]
Adobe's 2010 was marked by continuing front-and-back arguments with Apple over the latter's non-support for Adobe Flash on its iPhone, iPad and other products.[26] Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs claimed that Flash was not reliable or secure enough, while Adobe executives have argued that Apple wish to maintain control over the iOS platform. In April 2010, Steve Jobs published a post titled "Thoughts on Flash" where he outlined his thoughts on Flash and the rise of HTML 5.[27] In July 2010, Adobe bought Day Software[28] integrating their line of CQ Products: WCM,[29] DAM,[30] SOCO,[31] and Mobile[32]
In January 2011, Adobe acquired DemDex, Inc. with the intent of adding DemDex's audience-optimization software to its online marketing suite.[33] At Photoshop World 2011, Adobe unveiled a new mobile photo service.[34] Carousel is a new application for iPhone, iPad and Mac that uses Photoshop Lightroom technology for users to adjust and fine-tune images on all platforms.[34] Carousel will also allow users to automatically sync, share and browse photos.[34] The service was later renamed to "Adobe Revel".[35]
In October 2011, Adobe acquired Nitobi Software, the makers of the mobile application development framework PhoneGap. As part of the acquisition, the source code of PhoneGap was submitted to the Apache Foundation, where it became Apache Cordova.[36]
On November 9, 2011, Adobe announced that they would cease development of Flash for mobile devices following version 11.1. Instead it would focus on HTML 5 for mobile devices.[37] On December 1, 2011, Adobe announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately held Efficient Frontier.[38]
In December 2012, Adobe opened a new 280,000 square foot corporate campus in Lehi, Utah.[39]
 In 2013, Adobe Systems endured a major security breach. Vast portions of the source code for the company's software were stolen and posted online[40] and over 150 million records of Adobe's customers have been made readily available for download.[41] In 2012, about 40 million sets of payment card information were compromised by a hack of Adobe.[42]
A class-action lawsuit alleging that the company suppressed employee compensation was filed against Adobe, and three other Silicon Valley-based companies in a California federal district court in 2013.[43] In May 2014, it was revealed the four companies, Adobe, Apple, Google, and Intel had reached agreement with the plaintiffs, 64,000 employees of the four companies, to pay a sum of $324.5 million to settle the suit.

Reception[edit]
Since 1995, Fortune has ranked Adobe as an outstanding place to work. Adobe was rated the 5th best U.S. company to work for in 2003, 6th in 2004, 31st in 2007, 40th in 2008, 11th in 2009, 42nd in 2010, 65th in 2011, 41st in 2012, and 83rd in 2013.[46] In 2015, Adobe Systems India was ranked 21st of great places to work in India.[47] In June 2014, it was ranked 6th of great places to work in India.,[48] In October 2008, Adobe Systems Canada Inc. was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in Maclean's newsmagazine.[49]
Criticisms[edit]
Pricing[edit]
Adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices,[50][51] with retail prices being up to twice as much in non-US countries.[52] As pointed out by many, it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the United States and purchase one particular collection of Adobe's software there than to buy it locally in Australia.[53][54]
After Adobe revealed the pricing for the Creative Suite 3 Master Collection, which was £1,000 higher for European customers,[55] a petition to protest over "unfair pricing" was published and signed by 10,000 users.[56] In June 2009, Adobe further increased its prices in the UK by 10% in spite of weakening of the pound against the dollar,[57] and UK users are not allowed to buy from the US store.[58]
Adobe ranked no. 5 on a list of Internet’s 9 Most Hated Companies, based on a 2013 survey on Reddit.com.[59] Adobe's Reader and Flash were listed on The 10 most hated programs of all time on TechRadar.com.[60]
Security[edit]
Hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in Adobe programs, such as Adobe Reader, to gain unauthorized access to computers.[61] Adobe's Flash Player has also been criticized for, among other things, suffering from performance, memory usage and security problems (see criticism of Flash Player). A report by security researchers from Kaspersky Lab criticized Adobe for producing the products having top 10 security vulnerabilities.[62]
Observers noted that Adobe was spying on its customers by including spyware in the Creative Suite 3 software and quietly sending user data to a firm named Omniture.[63] When users became aware, Adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they: "could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account".[64] When a security flaw was later discovered in Photoshop CS5, Adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched, so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade.[65] Following a fierce backlash Adobe decided to provide the software patch.[66]
Adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including third-party browser toolbars and free virus scanners, usually as part of the Flash update process,[67] and for pushing a third-party scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs.[68]
Customer data breach[edit]
On October 3, 2013, the company initially revealed that 2.9 million customers' sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information.[69][70][71] Adobe later admitted that 38 million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their IDs and encrypted passwords, as well as to many inactive Adobe accounts.[72][73] The company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted, such as email addresses and physical addresses, though data privacy laws in 44 states require this information to be encrypted.[74][75]
A 3.8 GB file stolen from Adobe and containing 152 million usernames, reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on AnonNews.org.[76] LastPass, a password security firm, said that Adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not salted them.[77][78] Another security firm, Sophos, showed that Adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort.[79] According to an IT expert Simon Bain, Adobe has failed its customers and ‘should hang their heads in shame’.[80]
Many of the credit cards were tied to the Creative Cloud software-by-subscription service.[81] Adobe offered its affected US customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service, but no similar arrangements have been made for non-US customers.[82][83] When a data breach occurs in the US, penalties depend on the state where the victim resides, not where the company is based.[84]
After stealing the customers' data, cyber-thieves also accessed Adobe's source code repository, likely in mid-August 2013.[85] Because hackers acquired copies of the source code of Adobe proprietary products,[86] they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security, computer experts warned.[87] Security researcher Alex Holden, chief information security officer of Hold Security, characterized this Adobe breach, which affected Acrobat, ColdFusion and numerous other applications, as "one of the worst in US history".[88] Adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of Photoshop, which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques[89] and would make it easier to pirate Adobe's expensive products.[90]
Published on a server of a Russian-speaking hacker group,[91] the "disclosure of encryption algorithms, other security schemes, and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data" and may have opened the gateway to new generation zero-day attacks. Hackers already used ColdFusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of PR Newswire's customers, which has been tied to the Adobe security breach.[citation needed] They also used a ColdFusion exploit to breach Washington state court and expose up to 160,000 Social Security numbers.[92]

Anti-competitive practices[edit]
Adobe acquired Aldus Corp. in 1994, a software vendor that sold FreeHand, a competing product.[93][94] Freehand was direct competition to Adobe Illustrator, Adobe's flagship vector-graphics editor.[94][93] The Federal Trade Commission intervened and forced Adobe to sell FreeHand back to Altsys, and also banned Adobe from buying back FreeHand or any similar program for the next 10 years (1994-2004).[94][93] Altsys was then bought by Macromedia, which released versions 5 to 11.[94] When Adobe acquired Macromedia in December 2005, it stalled development of Freehand in 2007, effectively rendering it obsolete.[93][95] With FreeHand and Illustrator, Adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for Macintosh operating systems.[93]
In 2011, a group of 5,000 Freehand graphic designers convened under the banner Free Freehand, and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Adobe.[94][93][96][97] The suit alleged that Adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market and that Adobe has engaged in a series of exclusionary and anti-competitive acts and strategies designed to kill FreeHand, the dominant competitor to Adobe’s Illustrator software product, instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism.[93][96][97] Adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled.[93][95] The FreeHand community believes Adobe should release the product to an open-source community if it cannot update it internally.[94]
As of 2010, on its FreeHand product page Adobe stated "While we recognize FreeHand has a loyal customer base, we encourage users to migrate to the new Adobe Illustrator CS4 software which supports both PowerPC and Intel-based Macs and Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Vista." As of 2016, the Freehand page no longer exists and simply redirects to the Illustrator page. Adobe's software FTP server still contains a directory for FreeHand, but it is empty.

Adobe Systems Incorporated (/əˈdoʊbiː/) is an American multinational computer software company. The company is headquartered in San Jose, California, United States. Adobe has historically focused upon the creation of multimedia and creativity software products, with a more recent foray towards rich Internet application software development. It is best known for Photoshop, an image editing software, Acrobat Reader, the Portable Document Format (PDF) and Adobe Creative Suite, as well as its successor Adobe Creative Cloud.
Adobe was founded in December 1982[4] by John Warnock and Charles Geschke, who established the company after leaving Xerox PARC in order to develop and sell the PostScript page description language. In 1985, Apple Computer licensed PostScript for use in its LaserWriter printers, which helped spark the desktop publishing revolution.[5]
As of 2015[update], Adobe Systems has about 15,000 employees worldwide,[4] about 40% of whom work in San Jose. Adobe also has major development operations in Newton, Massachusetts;[6] New York City, New York; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Lehi, Utah; Seattle, Washington; San Francisco and San Luis Obispo, California in the United States.

History[edit]
The company was started in Warnock's garage.[7] The name of the company, Adobe, comes from Adobe Creek in Los Altos, California, which ran behind Warnock's house.[4] Adobe's corporate logo features a stylized "A" and was designed by the wife of John Warnock, Marva Warnock, who is a graphic designer.[8]
Steve Jobs asked to buy the company for five million dollars[9] in 1982, but Warnock and Geschke refused. Their investors urged them to work something out with Jobs, so they agreed to sell him shares worth 19 percent of the company, for which Jobs paid a five-times multiple of their company's valuation at the time, plus a five-year license fee for PostScript, in advance. The purchase and advance made Adobe the first company in the history of Silicon Valley to become profitable in its first year.[10]
Warnock and Geschke considered various business options including a copy-service business and a turnkey system for office printing. Then they chose to focus on developing specialized printing software, and created the Adobe PostScript page description language.[11]
PostScript was the first truly international standard for computer printing, as it included algorithms describing the letter-forms of many languages. Adobe added kanji printer products in 1988.[12] Warnock and Geschke were also able to bolster the credibility of Postscript by connecting with a typesetting manufacturer. They weren't able to work with Compugraphic, but then worked with Linotype to license the Helvetica and Times Roman fonts (through the Linotron 100).[13] By 1987, PostScript had become the industry-standard printer language with more than 400 third-party software programs and licensing agreements with 19 printer companies.[14]
Warnock described the language as "extensible", in its ability to apply graphic arts standards to office printing.[15]
Adobe's first products after PostScript were digital fonts, which they released in a proprietary format called Type 1. Apple subsequently developed a competing standard, TrueType, which provided full scalability and precise control of the pixel pattern created by the font's outlines, and licensed it to Microsoft.
In the mid-1980s, Adobe entered the consumer software market with Illustrator, a vector-based drawing program for the Apple Macintosh. Illustrator, which grew from the firm's in-house font-development software, helped popularize PostScript-enabled laser printers.
Adobe Systems entered NASDAQ in August 1986. Its revenue has grown from roughly $1 billion in 1999 to roughly $4 billion in 2012.[16] Adobe's fiscal years run from December to November. For example, the 2007 fiscal year ended on November 30, 2007.
In 1989, Adobe introduced what was to become its flagship product, a graphics editing program for the Macintosh called Photoshop. Stable and full-featured, Photoshop 1.0 was ably marketed by Adobe and soon dominated the market.
In 1993, Adobe introduced PDF, the Portable Document Format, and its Adobe Acrobat and Reader software. PDF is now an International Standard: ISO 32000-1:2008.
In December 1991, Adobe released Adobe Premiere, which Adobe rebranded as Adobe Premiere Pro in 2003. In 1992, Adobe acquired OCR Systems, Inc. In 1994, Adobe acquired Aldus and added PageMaker and After Effects to its product line later in the year; it also controls the TIFF file format. In 1995, Adobe added FrameMaker, the long-document DTP application, to its product line after Adobe acquired Frame Technology Corp. In 1996, Adobe Systems Inc added Ares Software Corp.[17] In 2002, Adobe acquired Canadian company Accelio (also known as JetForm).[18]




Adobe Systems Canada in Ottawa, Ontario (not far from archrival Corel).


On December 12, 2005, Adobe acquired its main rival, Macromedia, in a stock swap valued at about $3.4 billion, adding ColdFusion, Contribute, Captivate, Acrobat Connect (formerly Macromedia Breeze), Director, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Flash, FlashPaper, Flex, FreeHand, HomeSite, JRun, Presenter, and Authorware to Adobe's product line.[19]
Adobe released Adobe Media Player in April 2008.[20] On April 27, Adobe discontinued development and sales of its older HTML/web development software, GoLive in favor of Dreamweaver. Adobe offered a discount on Dreamweaver for GoLive users and supports those who still use GoLive with online tutorials and migration assistance. On June 1, Adobe launched Acrobat.com, a series of web applications geared for collaborative work.[21] Creative Suite 4, which includes Design, Web, Production Premium and Master Collection came out in October 2008 in six configurations at prices from about USD $1,700 to $2,500[22] or by individual application.[23] The Windows version of Photoshop includes 64-bit processing.[23] On December 3, 2008, Adobe laid off 600 of its employees (8% of the worldwide staff) citing the weak economic environment.
On November 10, 2009, the company laid off a further 680 employees.[24] Adobe announced it was investigating a "coordinated attack" against corporate network systems in China, managed by the company.[25]
Adobe's 2010 was marked by continuing front-and-back arguments with Apple over the latter's non-support for Adobe Flash on its iPhone, iPad and other products.[26] Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs claimed that Flash was not reliable or secure enough, while Adobe executives have argued that Apple wish to maintain control over the iOS platform. In April 2010, Steve Jobs published a post titled "Thoughts on Flash" where he outlined his thoughts on Flash and the rise of HTML 5.[27] In July 2010, Adobe bought Day Software[28] integrating their line of CQ Products: WCM,[29] DAM,[30] SOCO,[31] and Mobile[32]
In January 2011, Adobe acquired DemDex, Inc. with the intent of adding DemDex's audience-optimization software to its online marketing suite.[33] At Photoshop World 2011, Adobe unveiled a new mobile photo service.[34] Carousel is a new application for iPhone, iPad and Mac that uses Photoshop Lightroom technology for users to adjust and fine-tune images on all platforms.[34] Carousel will also allow users to automatically sync, share and browse photos.[34] The service was later renamed to "Adobe Revel".[35]
In October 2011, Adobe acquired Nitobi Software, the makers of the mobile application development framework PhoneGap. As part of the acquisition, the source code of PhoneGap was submitted to the Apache Foundation, where it became Apache Cordova.[36]
On November 9, 2011, Adobe announced that they would cease development of Flash for mobile devices following version 11.1. Instead it would focus on HTML 5 for mobile devices.[37] On December 1, 2011, Adobe announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately held Efficient Frontier.[38]
In December 2012, Adobe opened a new 280,000 square foot corporate campus in Lehi, Utah.[39]
 In 2013, Adobe Systems endured a major security breach. Vast portions of the source code for the company's software were stolen and posted online[40] and over 150 million records of Adobe's customers have been made readily available for download.[41] In 2012, about 40 million sets of payment card information were compromised by a hack of Adobe.[42]
A class-action lawsuit alleging that the company suppressed employee compensation was filed against Adobe, and three other Silicon Valley-based companies in a California federal district court in 2013.[43] In May 2014, it was revealed the four companies, Adobe, Apple, Google, and Intel had reached agreement with the plaintiffs, 64,000 employees of the four companies, to pay a sum of $324.5 million to settle the suit.

Reception[edit]
Since 1995, Fortune has ranked Adobe as an outstanding place to work. Adobe was rated the 5th best U.S. company to work for in 2003, 6th in 2004, 31st in 2007, 40th in 2008, 11th in 2009, 42nd in 2010, 65th in 2011, 41st in 2012, and 83rd in 2013.[46] In 2015, Adobe Systems India was ranked 21st of great places to work in India.[47] In June 2014, it was ranked 6th of great places to work in India.,[48] In October 2008, Adobe Systems Canada Inc. was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in Maclean's newsmagazine.[49]
Criticisms[edit]
Pricing[edit]
Adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices,[50][51] with retail prices being up to twice as much in non-US countries.[52] As pointed out by many, it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the United States and purchase one particular collection of Adobe's software there than to buy it locally in Australia.[53][54]
After Adobe revealed the pricing for the Creative Suite 3 Master Collection, which was £1,000 higher for European customers,[55] a petition to protest over "unfair pricing" was published and signed by 10,000 users.[56] In June 2009, Adobe further increased its prices in the UK by 10% in spite of weakening of the pound against the dollar,[57] and UK users are not allowed to buy from the US store.[58]
Adobe ranked no. 5 on a list of Internet’s 9 Most Hated Companies, based on a 2013 survey on Reddit.com.[59] Adobe's Reader and Flash were listed on The 10 most hated programs of all time on TechRadar.com.[60]
Security[edit]
Hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in Adobe programs, such as Adobe Reader, to gain unauthorized access to computers.[61] Adobe's Flash Player has also been criticized for, among other things, suffering from performance, memory usage and security problems (see criticism of Flash Player). A report by security researchers from Kaspersky Lab criticized Adobe for producing the products having top 10 security vulnerabilities.[62]
Observers noted that Adobe was spying on its customers by including spyware in the Creative Suite 3 software and quietly sending user data to a firm named Omniture.[63] When users became aware, Adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they: "could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account".[64] When a security flaw was later discovered in Photoshop CS5, Adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched, so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade.[65] Following a fierce backlash Adobe decided to provide the software patch.[66]
Adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including third-party browser toolbars and free virus scanners, usually as part of the Flash update process,[67] and for pushing a third-party scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs.[68]
Customer data breach[edit]
On October 3, 2013, the company initially revealed that 2.9 million customers' sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information.[69][70][71] Adobe later admitted that 38 million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their IDs and encrypted passwords, as well as to many inactive Adobe accounts.[72][73] The company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted, such as email addresses and physical addresses, though data privacy laws in 44 states require this information to be encrypted.[74][75]
A 3.8 GB file stolen from Adobe and containing 152 million usernames, reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on AnonNews.org.[76] LastPass, a password security firm, said that Adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not salted them.[77][78] Another security firm, Sophos, showed that Adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort.[79] According to an IT expert Simon Bain, Adobe has failed its customers and ‘should hang their heads in shame’.[80]
Many of the credit cards were tied to the Creative Cloud software-by-subscription service.[81] Adobe offered its affected US customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service, but no similar arrangements have been made for non-US customers.[82][83] When a data breach occurs in the US, penalties depend on the state where the victim resides, not where the company is based.[84]
After stealing the customers' data, cyber-thieves also accessed Adobe's source code repository, likely in mid-August 2013.[85] Because hackers acquired copies of the source code of Adobe proprietary products,[86] they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security, computer experts warned.[87] Security researcher Alex Holden, chief information security officer of Hold Security, characterized this Adobe breach, which affected Acrobat, ColdFusion and numerous other applications, as "one of the worst in US history".[88] Adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of Photoshop, which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques[89] and would make it easier to pirate Adobe's expensive products.[90]
Published on a server of a Russian-speaking hacker group,[91] the "disclosure of encryption algorithms, other security schemes, and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data" and may have opened the gateway to new generation zero-day attacks. Hackers already used ColdFusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of PR Newswire's customers, which has been tied to the Adobe security breach.[citation needed] They also used a ColdFusion exploit to breach Washington state court and expose up to 160,000 Social Security numbers.[92]

Anti-competitive practices[edit]
Adobe acquired Aldus Corp. in 1994, a software vendor that sold FreeHand, a competing product.[93][94] Freehand was direct competition to Adobe Illustrator, Adobe's flagship vector-graphics editor.[94][93] The Federal Trade Commission intervened and forced Adobe to sell FreeHand back to Altsys, and also banned Adobe from buying back FreeHand or any similar program for the next 10 years (1994-2004).[94][93] Altsys was then bought by Macromedia, which released versions 5 to 11.[94] When Adobe acquired Macromedia in December 2005, it stalled development of Freehand in 2007, effectively rendering it obsolete.[93][95] With FreeHand and Illustrator, Adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for Macintosh operating systems.[93]
In 2011, a group of 5,000 Freehand graphic designers convened under the banner Free Freehand, and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Adobe.[94][93][96][97] The suit alleged that Adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market and that Adobe has engaged in a series of exclusionary and anti-competitive acts and strategies designed to kill FreeHand, the dominant competitor to Adobe’s Illustrator software product, instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism.[93][96][97] Adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled.[93][95] The FreeHand community believes Adobe should release the product to an open-source community if it cannot update it internally.[94]
As of 2010, on its FreeHand product page Adobe stated "While we recognize FreeHand has a loyal customer base, we encourage users to migrate to the new Adobe Illustrator CS4 software which supports both PowerPC and Intel-based Macs and Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Vista." As of 2016, the Freehand page no longer exists and simply redirects to the Illustrator page. Adobe's software FTP server still contains a directory for FreeHand, but it is empty.

Adobe Systems Incorporated (/əˈdoʊbiː/) is an American multinational computer software company. The company is headquartered in San Jose, California, United States. Adobe has historically focused upon the creation of multimedia and creativity software products, with a more recent foray towards rich Internet application software development. It is best known for Photoshop, an image editing software, Acrobat Reader, the Portable Document Format (PDF) and Adobe Creative Suite, as well as its successor Adobe Creative Cloud.
Adobe was founded in December 1982[4] by John Warnock and Charles Geschke, who established the company after leaving Xerox PARC in order to develop and sell the PostScript page description language. In 1985, Apple Computer licensed PostScript for use in its LaserWriter printers, which helped spark the desktop publishing revolution.[5]
As of 2015[update], Adobe Systems has about 15,000 employees worldwide,[4] about 40% of whom work in San Jose. Adobe also has major development operations in Newton, Massachusetts;[6] New York City, New York; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Lehi, Utah; Seattle, Washington; San Francisco and San Luis Obispo, California in the United States.

History[edit]
The company was started in Warnock's garage.[7] The name of the company, Adobe, comes from Adobe Creek in Los Altos, California, which ran behind Warnock's house.[4] Adobe's corporate logo features a stylized "A" and was designed by the wife of John Warnock, Marva Warnock, who is a graphic designer.[8]
Steve Jobs asked to buy the company for five million dollars[9] in 1982, but Warnock and Geschke refused. Their investors urged them to work something out with Jobs, so they agreed to sell him shares worth 19 percent of the company, for which Jobs paid a five-times multiple of their company's valuation at the time, plus a five-year license fee for PostScript, in advance. The purchase and advance made Adobe the first company in the history of Silicon Valley to become profitable in its first year.[10]
Warnock and Geschke considered various business options including a copy-service business and a turnkey system for office printing. Then they chose to focus on developing specialized printing software, and created the Adobe PostScript page description language.[11]
PostScript was the first truly international standard for computer printing, as it included algorithms describing the letter-forms of many languages. Adobe added kanji printer products in 1988.[12] Warnock and Geschke were also able to bolster the credibility of Postscript by connecting with a typesetting manufacturer. They weren't able to work with Compugraphic, but then worked with Linotype to license the Helvetica and Times Roman fonts (through the Linotron 100).[13] By 1987, PostScript had become the industry-standard printer language with more than 400 third-party software programs and licensing agreements with 19 printer companies.[14]
Warnock described the language as "extensible", in its ability to apply graphic arts standards to office printing.[15]
Adobe's first products after PostScript were digital fonts, which they released in a proprietary format called Type 1. Apple subsequently developed a competing standard, TrueType, which provided full scalability and precise control of the pixel pattern created by the font's outlines, and licensed it to Microsoft.
In the mid-1980s, Adobe entered the consumer software market with Illustrator, a vector-based drawing program for the Apple Macintosh. Illustrator, which grew from the firm's in-house font-development software, helped popularize PostScript-enabled laser printers.
Adobe Systems entered NASDAQ in August 1986. Its revenue has grown from roughly $1 billion in 1999 to roughly $4 billion in 2012.[16] Adobe's fiscal years run from December to November. For example, the 2007 fiscal year ended on November 30, 2007.
In 1989, Adobe introduced what was to become its flagship product, a graphics editing program for the Macintosh called Photoshop. Stable and full-featured, Photoshop 1.0 was ably marketed by Adobe and soon dominated the market.
In 1993, Adobe introduced PDF, the Portable Document Format, and its Adobe Acrobat and Reader software. PDF is now an International Standard: ISO 32000-1:2008.
In December 1991, Adobe released Adobe Premiere, which Adobe rebranded as Adobe Premiere Pro in 2003. In 1992, Adobe acquired OCR Systems, Inc. In 1994, Adobe acquired Aldus and added PageMaker and After Effects to its product line later in the year; it also controls the TIFF file format. In 1995, Adobe added FrameMaker, the long-document DTP application, to its product line after Adobe acquired Frame Technology Corp. In 1996, Adobe Systems Inc added Ares Software Corp.[17] In 2002, Adobe acquired Canadian company Accelio (also known as JetForm).[18]




Adobe Systems Canada in Ottawa, Ontario (not far from archrival Corel).


On December 12, 2005, Adobe acquired its main rival, Macromedia, in a stock swap valued at about $3.4 billion, adding ColdFusion, Contribute, Captivate, Acrobat Connect (formerly Macromedia Breeze), Director, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Flash, FlashPaper, Flex, FreeHand, HomeSite, JRun, Presenter, and Authorware to Adobe's product line.[19]
Adobe released Adobe Media Player in April 2008.[20] On April 27, Adobe discontinued development and sales of its older HTML/web development software, GoLive in favor of Dreamweaver. Adobe offered a discount on Dreamweaver for GoLive users and supports those who still use GoLive with online tutorials and migration assistance. On June 1, Adobe launched Acrobat.com, a series of web applications geared for collaborative work.[21] Creative Suite 4, which includes Design, Web, Production Premium and Master Collection came out in October 2008 in six configurations at prices from about USD $1,700 to $2,500[22] or by individual application.[23] The Windows version of Photoshop includes 64-bit processing.[23] On December 3, 2008, Adobe laid off 600 of its employees (8% of the worldwide staff) citing the weak economic environment.
On November 10, 2009, the company laid off a further 680 employees.[24] Adobe announced it was investigating a "coordinated attack" against corporate network systems in China, managed by the company.[25]
Adobe's 2010 was marked by continuing front-and-back arguments with Apple over the latter's non-support for Adobe Flash on its iPhone, iPad and other products.[26] Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs claimed that Flash was not reliable or secure enough, while Adobe executives have argued that Apple wish to maintain control over the iOS platform. In April 2010, Steve Jobs published a post titled "Thoughts on Flash" where he outlined his thoughts on Flash and the rise of HTML 5.[27] In July 2010, Adobe bought Day Software[28] integrating their line of CQ Products: WCM,[29] DAM,[30] SOCO,[31] and Mobile[32]
In January 2011, Adobe acquired DemDex, Inc. with the intent of adding DemDex's audience-optimization software to its online marketing suite.[33] At Photoshop World 2011, Adobe unveiled a new mobile photo service.[34] Carousel is a new application for iPhone, iPad and Mac that uses Photoshop Lightroom technology for users to adjust and fine-tune images on all platforms.[34] Carousel will also allow users to automatically sync, share and browse photos.[34] The service was later renamed to "Adobe Revel".[35]
In October 2011, Adobe acquired Nitobi Software, the makers of the mobile application development framework PhoneGap. As part of the acquisition, the source code of PhoneGap was submitted to the Apache Foundation, where it became Apache Cordova.[36]
On November 9, 2011, Adobe announced that they would cease development of Flash for mobile devices following version 11.1. Instead it would focus on HTML 5 for mobile devices.[37] On December 1, 2011, Adobe announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately held Efficient Frontier.[38]
In December 2012, Adobe opened a new 280,000 square foot corporate campus in Lehi, Utah.[39]
 In 2013, Adobe Systems endured a major security breach. Vast portions of the source code for the company's software were stolen and posted online[40] and over 150 million records of Adobe's customers have been made readily available for download.[41] In 2012, about 40 million sets of payment card information were compromised by a hack of Adobe.[42]
A class-action lawsuit alleging that the company suppressed employee compensation was filed against Adobe, and three other Silicon Valley-based companies in a California federal district court in 2013.[43] In May 2014, it was revealed the four companies, Adobe, Apple, Google, and Intel had reached agreement with the plaintiffs, 64,000 employees of the four companies, to pay a sum of $324.5 million to settle the suit.

Reception[edit]
Since 1995, Fortune has ranked Adobe as an outstanding place to work. Adobe was rated the 5th best U.S. company to work for in 2003, 6th in 2004, 31st in 2007, 40th in 2008, 11th in 2009, 42nd in 2010, 65th in 2011, 41st in 2012, and 83rd in 2013.[46] In 2015, Adobe Systems India was ranked 21st of great places to work in India.[47] In June 2014, it was ranked 6th of great places to work in India.,[48] In October 2008, Adobe Systems Canada Inc. was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in Maclean's newsmagazine.[49]
Criticisms[edit]
Pricing[edit]
Adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices,[50][51] with retail prices being up to twice as much in non-US countries.[52] As pointed out by many, it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the United States and purchase one particular collection of Adobe's software there than to buy it locally in Australia.[53][54]
After Adobe revealed the pricing for the Creative Suite 3 Master Collection, which was £1,000 higher for European customers,[55] a petition to protest over "unfair pricing" was published and signed by 10,000 users.[56] In June 2009, Adobe further increased its prices in the UK by 10% in spite of weakening of the pound against the dollar,[57] and UK users are not allowed to buy from the US store.[58]
Adobe ranked no. 5 on a list of Internet’s 9 Most Hated Companies, based on a 2013 survey on Reddit.com.[59] Adobe's Reader and Flash were listed on The 10 most hated programs of all time on TechRadar.com.[60]
Security[edit]
Hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in Adobe programs, such as Adobe Reader, to gain unauthorized access to computers.[61] Adobe's Flash Player has also been criticized for, among other things, suffering from performance, memory usage and security problems (see criticism of Flash Player). A report by security researchers from Kaspersky Lab criticized Adobe for producing the products having top 10 security vulnerabilities.[62]
Observers noted that Adobe was spying on its customers by including spyware in the Creative Suite 3 software and quietly sending user data to a firm named Omniture.[63] When users became aware, Adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they: "could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account".[64] When a security flaw was later discovered in Photoshop CS5, Adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched, so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade.[65] Following a fierce backlash Adobe decided to provide the software patch.[66]
Adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including third-party browser toolbars and free virus scanners, usually as part of the Flash update process,[67] and for pushing a third-party scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs.[68]
Customer data breach[edit]
On October 3, 2013, the company initially revealed that 2.9 million customers' sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information.[69][70][71] Adobe later admitted that 38 million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their IDs and encrypted passwords, as well as to many inactive Adobe accounts.[72][73] The company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted, such as email addresses and physical addresses, though data privacy laws in 44 states require this information to be encrypted.[74][75]
A 3.8 GB file stolen from Adobe and containing 152 million usernames, reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on AnonNews.org.[76] LastPass, a password security firm, said that Adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not salted them.[77][78] Another security firm, Sophos, showed that Adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort.[79] According to an IT expert Simon Bain, Adobe has failed its customers and ‘should hang their heads in shame’.[80]
Many of the credit cards were tied to the Creative Cloud software-by-subscription service.[81] Adobe offered its affected US customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service, but no similar arrangements have been made for non-US customers.[82][83] When a data breach occurs in the US, penalties depend on the state where the victim resides, not where the company is based.[84]
After stealing the customers' data, cyber-thieves also accessed Adobe's source code repository, likely in mid-August 2013.[85] Because hackers acquired copies of the source code of Adobe proprietary products,[86] they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security, computer experts warned.[87] Security researcher Alex Holden, chief information security officer of Hold Security, characterized this Adobe breach, which affected Acrobat, ColdFusion and numerous other applications, as "one of the worst in US history".[88] Adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of Photoshop, which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques[89] and would make it easier to pirate Adobe's expensive products.[90]
Published on a server of a Russian-speaking hacker group,[91] the "disclosure of encryption algorithms, other security schemes, and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data" and may have opened the gateway to new generation zero-day attacks. Hackers already used ColdFusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of PR Newswire's customers, which has been tied to the Adobe security breach.[citation needed] They also used a ColdFusion exploit to breach Washington state court and expose up to 160,000 Social Security numbers.[92]

Anti-competitive practices[edit]
Adobe acquired Aldus Corp. in 1994, a software vendor that sold FreeHand, a competing product.[93][94] Freehand was direct competition to Adobe Illustrator, Adobe's flagship vector-graphics editor.[94][93] The Federal Trade Commission intervened and forced Adobe to sell FreeHand back to Altsys, and also banned Adobe from buying back FreeHand or any similar program for the next 10 years (1994-2004).[94][93] Altsys was then bought by Macromedia, which released versions 5 to 11.[94] When Adobe acquired Macromedia in December 2005, it stalled development of Freehand in 2007, effectively rendering it obsolete.[93][95] With FreeHand and Illustrator, Adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for Macintosh operating systems.[93]
In 2011, a group of 5,000 Freehand graphic designers convened under the banner Free Freehand, and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Adobe.[94][93][96][97] The suit alleged that Adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market and that Adobe has engaged in a series of exclusionary and anti-competitive acts and strategies designed to kill FreeHand, the dominant competitor to Adobe’s Illustrator software product, instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism.[93][96][97] Adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled.[93][95] The FreeHand community believes Adobe should release the product to an open-source community if it cannot update it internally.[94]
As of 2010, on its FreeHand product page Adobe stated "While we recognize FreeHand has a loyal customer base, we encourage users to migrate to the new Adobe Illustrator CS4 software which supports both PowerPC and Intel-based Macs and Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Vista." As of 2016, the Freehand page no longer exists and simply redirects to the Illustrator page. Adobe's software FTP server still contains a directory for FreeHand, but it is empty.

Adobe Systems Incorporated (/əˈdoʊbiː/) is an American multinational computer software company. The company is headquartered in San Jose, California, United States. Adobe has historically focused upon the creation of multimedia and creativity software products, with a more recent foray towards rich Internet application software development. It is best known for Photoshop, an image editing software, Acrobat Reader, the Portable Document Format (PDF) and Adobe Creative Suite, as well as its successor Adobe Creative Cloud.
Adobe was founded in December 1982[4] by John Warnock and Charles Geschke, who established the company after leaving Xerox PARC in order to develop and sell the PostScript page description language. In 1985, Apple Computer licensed PostScript for use in its LaserWriter printers, which helped spark the desktop publishing revolution.[5]
As of 2015[update], Adobe Systems has about 15,000 employees worldwide,[4] about 40% of whom work in San Jose. Adobe also has major development operations in Newton, Massachusetts;[6] New York City, New York; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Lehi, Utah; Seattle, Washington; San Francisco and San Luis Obispo, California in the United States.

History[edit]
The company was started in Warnock's garage.[7] The name of the company, Adobe, comes from Adobe Creek in Los Altos, California, which ran behind Warnock's house.[4] Adobe's corporate logo features a stylized "A" and was designed by the wife of John Warnock, Marva Warnock, who is a graphic designer.[8]
Steve Jobs asked to buy the company for five million dollars[9] in 1982, but Warnock and Geschke refused. Their investors urged them to work something out with Jobs, so they agreed to sell him shares worth 19 percent of the company, for which Jobs paid a five-times multiple of their company's valuation at the time, plus a five-year license fee for PostScript, in advance. The purchase and advance made Adobe the first company in the history of Silicon Valley to become profitable in its first year.[10]
Warnock and Geschke considered various business options including a copy-service business and a turnkey system for office printing. Then they chose to focus on developing specialized printing software, and created the Adobe PostScript page description language.[11]
PostScript was the first truly international standard for computer printing, as it included algorithms describing the letter-forms of many languages. Adobe added kanji printer products in 1988.[12] Warnock and Geschke were also able to bolster the credibility of Postscript by connecting with a typesetting manufacturer. They weren't able to work with Compugraphic, but then worked with Linotype to license the Helvetica and Times Roman fonts (through the Linotron 100).[13] By 1987, PostScript had become the industry-standard printer language with more than 400 third-party software programs and licensing agreements with 19 printer companies.[14]
Warnock described the language as "extensible", in its ability to apply graphic arts standards to office printing.[15]
Adobe's first products after PostScript were digital fonts, which they released in a proprietary format called Type 1. Apple subsequently developed a competing standard, TrueType, which provided full scalability and precise control of the pixel pattern created by the font's outlines, and licensed it to Microsoft.
In the mid-1980s, Adobe entered the consumer software market with Illustrator, a vector-based drawing program for the Apple Macintosh. Illustrator, which grew from the firm's in-house font-development software, helped popularize PostScript-enabled laser printers.
Adobe Systems entered NASDAQ in August 1986. Its revenue has grown from roughly $1 billion in 1999 to roughly $4 billion in 2012.[16] Adobe's fiscal years run from December to November. For example, the 2007 fiscal year ended on November 30, 2007.
In 1989, Adobe introduced what was to become its flagship product, a graphics editing program for the Macintosh called Photoshop. Stable and full-featured, Photoshop 1.0 was ably marketed by Adobe and soon dominated the market.
In 1993, Adobe introduced PDF, the Portable Document Format, and its Adobe Acrobat and Reader software. PDF is now an International Standard: ISO 32000-1:2008.
In December 1991, Adobe released Adobe Premiere, which Adobe rebranded as Adobe Premiere Pro in 2003. In 1992, Adobe acquired OCR Systems, Inc. In 1994, Adobe acquired Aldus and added PageMaker and After Effects to its product line later in the year; it also controls the TIFF file format. In 1995, Adobe added FrameMaker, the long-document DTP application, to its product line after Adobe acquired Frame Technology Corp. In 1996, Adobe Systems Inc added Ares Software Corp.[17] In 2002, Adobe acquired Canadian company Accelio (also known as JetForm).[18]

On December 12, 2005, Adobe acquired its main rival, Macromedia, in a stock swap valued at about $3.4 billion, adding ColdFusion, Contribute, Captivate, Acrobat Connect (formerly Macromedia Breeze), Director, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Flash, FlashPaper, Flex, FreeHand, HomeSite, JRun, Presenter, and Authorware to Adobe's product line.[19]
Adobe released Adobe Media Player in April 2008.[20] On April 27, Adobe discontinued development and sales of its older HTML/web development software, GoLive in favor of Dreamweaver. Adobe offered a discount on Dreamweaver for GoLive users and supports those who still use GoLive with online tutorials and migration assistance. On June 1, Adobe launched Acrobat.com, a series of web applications geared for collaborative work.[21] Creative Suite 4, which includes Design, Web, Production Premium and Master Collection came out in October 2008 in six configurations at prices from about USD $1,700 to $2,500[22] or by individual application.[23] The Windows version of Photoshop includes 64-bit processing.[23] On December 3, 2008, Adobe laid off 600 of its employees (8% of the worldwide staff) citing the weak economic environment.
On November 10, 2009, the company laid off a further 680 employees.[24] Adobe announced it was investigating a "coordinated attack" against corporate network systems in China, managed by the company.[25]
Adobe's 2010 was marked by continuing front-and-back arguments with Apple over the latter's non-support for Adobe Flash on its iPhone, iPad and other products.[26] Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs claimed that Flash was not reliable or secure enough, while Adobe executives have argued that Apple wish to maintain control over the iOS platform. In April 2010, Steve Jobs published a post titled "Thoughts on Flash" where he outlined his thoughts on Flash and the rise of HTML 5.[27] In July 2010, Adobe bought Day Software[28] integrating their line of CQ Products: WCM,[29] DAM,[30] SOCO,[31] and Mobile[32]
In January 2011, Adobe acquired DemDex, Inc. with the intent of adding DemDex's audience-optimization software to its online marketing suite.[33] At Photoshop World 2011, Adobe unveiled a new mobile photo service.[34] Carousel is a new application for iPhone, iPad and Mac that uses Photoshop Lightroom technology for users to adjust and fine-tune images on all platforms.[34] Carousel will also allow users to automatically sync, share and browse photos.[34] The service was later renamed to "Adobe Revel".[35]
In October 2011, Adobe acquired Nitobi Software, the makers of the mobile application development framework PhoneGap. As part of the acquisition, the source code of PhoneGap was submitted to the Apache Foundation, where it became Apache Cordova.[36]
On November 9, 2011, Adobe announced that they would cease development of Flash for mobile devices following version 11.1. Instead it would focus on HTML 5 for mobile devices.[37] On December 1, 2011, Adobe announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately held Efficient Frontier.[38]
In December 2012, Adobe opened a new 280,000 square foot corporate campus in Lehi, Utah.[39]
 In 2013, Adobe Systems endured a major security breach. Vast portions of the source code for the company's software were stolen and posted online[40] and over 150 million records of Adobe's customers have been made readily available for download.[41] In 2012, about 40 million sets of payment card information were compromised by a hack of Adobe.[42]
A class-action lawsuit alleging that the company suppressed employee compensation was filed against Adobe, and three other Silicon Valley-based companies in a California federal district court in 2013.[43] In May 2014, it was revealed the four companies, Adobe, Apple, Google, and Intel had reached agreement with the plaintiffs, 64,000 employees of the four companies, to pay a sum of $324.5 million to settle the suit.

Reception[edit]
Since 1995, Fortune has ranked Adobe as an outstanding place to work. Adobe was rated the 5th best U.S. company to work for in 2003, 6th in 2004, 31st in 2007, 40th in 2008, 11th in 2009, 42nd in 2010, 65th in 2011, 41st in 2012, and 83rd in 2013.[46] In 2015, Adobe Systems India was ranked 21st of great places to work in India.[47] In June 2014, it was ranked 6th of great places to work in India.,[48] In October 2008, Adobe Systems Canada Inc. was named one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in Maclean's newsmagazine.[49]
Criticisms[edit]
Pricing[edit]
Adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices,[50][51] with retail prices being up to twice as much in non-US countries.[52] As pointed out by many, it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the United States and purchase one particular collection of Adobe's software there than to buy it locally in Australia.[53][54]
After Adobe revealed the pricing for the Creative Suite 3 Master Collection, which was £1,000 higher for European customers,[55] a petition to protest over "unfair pricing" was published and signed by 10,000 users.[56] In June 2009, Adobe further increased its prices in the UK by 10% in spite of weakening of the pound against the dollar,[57] and UK users are not allowed to buy from the US store.[58]
Adobe ranked no. 5 on a list of Internet’s 9 Most Hated Companies, based on a 2013 survey on Reddit.com.[59] Adobe's Reader and Flash were listed on The 10 most hated programs of all time on TechRadar.com.[60]
Security[edit]
Hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in Adobe programs, such as Adobe Reader, to gain unauthorized access to computers.[61] Adobe's Flash Player has also been criticized for, among other things, suffering from performance, memory usage and security problems (see criticism of Flash Player). A report by security researchers from Kaspersky Lab criticized Adobe for producing the products having top 10 security vulnerabilities.[62]
Observers noted that Adobe was spying on its customers by including spyware in the Creative Suite 3 software and quietly sending user data to a firm named Omniture.[63] When users became aware, Adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they: "could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account".[64] When a security flaw was later discovered in Photoshop CS5, Adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched, so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade.[65] Following a fierce backlash Adobe decided to provide the software patch.[66]
Adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including third-party browser toolbars and free virus scanners, usually as part of the Flash update process,[67] and for pushing a third-party scareware program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs.[68]
Customer data breach[edit]
On October 3, 2013, the company initially revealed that 2.9 million customers' sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information.[69][70][71] Adobe later admitted that 38 million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their IDs and encrypted passwords, as well as to many inactive Adobe accounts.[72][73] The company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted, such as email addresses and physical addresses, though data privacy laws in 44 states require this information to be encrypted.[74][75]
A 3.8 GB file stolen from Adobe and containing 152 million usernames, reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on AnonNews.org.[76] LastPass, a password security firm, said that Adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not salted them.[77][78] Another security firm, Sophos, showed that Adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort.[79] According to an IT expert Simon Bain, Adobe has failed its customers and ‘should hang their heads in shame’.[80]
Many of the credit cards were tied to the Creative Cloud software-by-subscription service.[81] Adobe offered its affected US customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service, but no similar arrangements have been made for non-US customers.[82][83] When a data breach occurs in the US, penalties depend on the state where the victim resides, not where the company is based.[84]
After stealing the customers' data, cyber-thieves also accessed Adobe's source code repository, likely in mid-August 2013.[85] Because hackers acquired copies of the source code of Adobe proprietary products,[86] they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security, computer experts warned.[87] Security researcher Alex Holden, chief information security officer of Hold Security, characterized this Adobe breach, which affected Acrobat, ColdFusion and numerous other applications, as "one of the worst in US history".[88] Adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of Photoshop, which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques[89] and would make it easier to pirate Adobe's expensive products.[90]
Published on a server of a Russian-speaking hacker group,[91] the "disclosure of encryption algorithms, other security schemes, and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data" and may have opened the gateway to new generation zero-day attacks. Hackers already used ColdFusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of PR Newswire's customers, which has been tied to the Adobe security breach.[citation needed] They also used a ColdFusion exploit to breach Washington state court and expose up to 160,000 Social Security numbers.[92]

Anti-competitive practices[edit]
Adobe acquired Aldus Corp. in 1994, a software vendor that sold FreeHand, a competing product.[93][94] Freehand was direct competition to Adobe Illustrator, Adobe's flagship vector-graphics editor.[94][93] The Federal Trade Commission intervened and forced Adobe to sell FreeHand back to Altsys, and also banned Adobe from buying back FreeHand or any similar program for the next 10 years (1994-2004).[94][93] Altsys was then bought by Macromedia, which released versions 5 to 11.[94] When Adobe acquired Macromedia in December 2005, it stalled development of Freehand in 2007, effectively rendering it obsolete.[93][95] With FreeHand and Illustrator, Adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for Macintosh operating systems.[93]
In 2011, a group of 5,000 Freehand graphic designers convened under the banner Free Freehand, and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Adobe.[94][93][96][97] The suit alleged that Adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market and that Adobe has engaged in a series of exclusionary and anti-competitive acts and strategies designed to kill FreeHand, the dominant competitor to Adobe’s Illustrator software product, instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism.[93][96][97] Adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled.[93][95] The FreeHand community believes Adobe should release the product to an open-source community if it cannot update it internally.[94]
As of 2010, on its FreeHand product page Adobe stated "While we recognize FreeHand has a loyal customer base, we encourage users to migrate to the new Adobe Illustrator CS4 software which supports both PowerPC and Intel-based Macs and Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Vista." As of 2016, the Freehand page no longer exists and simply redirects to the Illustrator page. Adobe's software FTP server still contains a directory for FreeHand, but it is empty.

Education[edit]
Geschke attended Saint Ignatius High School, and earned a BA in classics and an MS in mathematics from Xavier University, as well as a PhD in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University.[2][3] He taught mathematics at John Carroll University from 1963 to 1968.
Background[edit]
Prior to co-founding Adobe, Geschke and Warnock worked at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). Geschke had started there in October 1972. His first project was to build a mainframe and then worked on programming languages and developing the tools which were used to build the Star workstation.[4]
Geschke formed and headed PARC's Imaging Sciences Laboratory in 1978 where he directed research activities in the fields of computer science, graphics, image processing, and optics.
At PARC, Geschke hired his long-term research partner, John Warnock and together they invented a page description language (PDL), which provided a means to describe complex forms like typefaces electronically – called Interpress. Unable to convince Xerox management of the commercial value of Warnock's InterPress graphics language for controlling printing, the two left Xerox to co-found Adobe Systems.[5]
Adobe[edit]
Geschke and co-founder Warnock's Interpress language evolved into Adobe's PostScript, which when combined with hardware from Apple computer, formed the first desktop publishing (DTP) system where anyone could set type, compose documents, and print them as they appeared on the screen electronically. PostScript was marketable as it was machine-independent and extremely flexible. With this new approach, they brought their product to the market, allowing business users to greatly improve the quality and efficiency of their document production, and thus began an entire industry.[5] From December 1986 until July 1994 Geschke was Adobe's Chief Operating Officer, and from April 1989 until April 2000 he was the company's president. Geschke retired as president of Adobe in 2000, shortly before his partner Warnock left as CEO. He has served as Co-Chairman of the Board of Adobe since September 1997.[2][3][6]
Geschke's company was ranked as number 1,069th on the Forbes Global 2000 in 2010, and in 2009 was mentioned in Forbes List of 400 Best Big Companies in 2009.[2]
1992 kidnapping[edit]
On the morning of May 26, 1992, Geschke was kidnapped at gunpoint from the Adobe parking lot in Mountain View, California by two men as he arrived for work. He was held for four days before being recovered from a house in Hollister, California by the FBI. On May 31, Geschke was freed when a suspect caught with $650,000 in ransom money led authorities to a bungalow hideout, according to the FBI.[7]
The two kidnappers, Mouhannad Albukhari, 26, of San Jose, and Jack Sayeh, 25, of Campbell, were eventually sentenced to life terms in state prison.[7]
Awards[edit]
In 1999, Charles Geschke was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.
In 2002, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum for "his accomplishments in the commercialization of desktop publishing with John Warnock and for innovations in scalable type, computer graphics and printing."[5]
In October 2006, Geschke, along with co-founder John Warnock received the AeA Annual Medal of Achievement Award, making them the first software executives to receive this award. In 2008 he received the Computer Entrepreneur Award from the IEEE Computer Society. In 2009, he also won the 2008 National Medal of Technology, awarded by President Barack Obama.[6][8] On October 15, 2010, the Marconi Society co-awarded Geschke and Warnock the Marconi Prize.[9]
On Sunday, May 20, 2012, Geschke delivered the Address to the Graduates (Keynote Address) at John Carroll University in University Heights, Ohio where he was a mathematics professor early in his career and was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters.[10]
Affiliations[edit]
Geschke serves on the boards of the San Francisco Symphony,[11] the National Leadership Roundtable on Church Management,[12] the Commonwealth Club of California,[13] and Tableau Software.[14] He serves on the computer science advisory board of Carnegie-Mellon University, the Board of the Egan Maritime Foundation, and the board of the Nantucket Boys and Girls Club. He is also a member of the National Academy of Engineering and an ACM Fellow.[5][6]
Also, in 1995 he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering, and in 2008 he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He recently, in 2010, completed his term as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the University of San Francisco.[6]
Personal life[edit]
Geschke met his wife, Nan (Nancy McDonough), at a religious conference on social action in the spring of 1961.[15] They married in 1964, and the two are still married with children and grandchildren.[16] Both Charles and Nancy are graduates of Catholic institutions. In 2012 they received the St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Award from the National Catholic Educational Association (NCEA), for their contributions to Catholic education.[17][15] Charles identifies as Catholic.[18]
Geschke's parents were very concerned when Charles quit his job at Xerox at the age of 40 (including a nice big office overlooking the whole Bay Area), in order to found Adobe.
Geschke's mother was a bankruptcy court paralegal. Both Geschke's paternal grandfather and father worked as letterpress photo engravers[19]. Geschke's father helped in the early days of Adobe in checking color separation work with his engraver's loupe. Geschke describes his father's acknowledgement of the high quality of the halftone patterns as "...a wonderful moment.".[4]

Education[edit]
Geschke attended Saint Ignatius High School, and earned a BA in classics and an MS in mathematics from Xavier University, as well as a PhD in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University.[2][3] He taught mathematics at John Carroll University from 1963 to 1968.
Background[edit]
Prior to co-founding Adobe, Geschke and Warnock worked at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). Geschke had started there in October 1972. His first project was to build a mainframe and then worked on programming languages and developing the tools which were used to build the Star workstation.[4]
Geschke formed and headed PARC's Imaging Sciences Laboratory in 1978 where he directed research activities in the fields of computer science, graphics, image processing, and optics.
At PARC, Geschke hired his long-term research partner, John Warnock and together they invented a page description language (PDL), which provided a means to describe complex forms like typefaces electronically – called Interpress. Unable to convince Xerox management of the commercial value of Warnock's InterPress graphics language for controlling printing, the two left Xerox to co-found Adobe Systems.[5]
Adobe[edit]
Geschke and co-founder Warnock's Interpress language evolved into Adobe's PostScript, which when combined with hardware from Apple computer, formed the first desktop publishing (DTP) system where anyone could set type, compose documents, and print them as they appeared on the screen electronically. PostScript was marketable as it was machine-independent and extremely flexible. With this new approach, they brought their product to the market, allowing business users to greatly improve the quality and efficiency of their document production, and thus began an entire industry.[5] From December 1986 until July 1994 Geschke was Adobe's Chief Operating Officer, and from April 1989 until April 2000 he was the company's president. Geschke retired as president of Adobe in 2000, shortly before his partner Warnock left as CEO. He has served as Co-Chairman of the Board of Adobe since September 1997.[2][3][6]
Geschke's company was ranked as number 1,069th on the Forbes Global 2000 in 2010, and in 2009 was mentioned in Forbes List of 400 Best Big Companies in 2009.[2]
1992 kidnapping[edit]
On the morning of May 26, 1992, Geschke was kidnapped at gunpoint from the Adobe parking lot in Mountain View, California by two men as he arrived for work. He was held for four days before being recovered from a house in Hollister, California by the FBI. On May 31, Geschke was freed when a suspect caught with $650,000 in ransom money led authorities to a bungalow hideout, according to the FBI.[7]
The two kidnappers, Mouhannad Albukhari, 26, of San Jose, and Jack Sayeh, 25, of Campbell, were eventually sentenced to life terms in state prison.[7]
Awards[edit]
In 1999, Charles Geschke was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.
In 2002, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum for "his accomplishments in the commercialization of desktop publishing with John Warnock and for innovations in scalable type, computer graphics and printing."[5]
In October 2006, Geschke, along with co-founder John Warnock received the AeA Annual Medal of Achievement Award, making them the first software executives to receive this award. In 2008 he received the Computer Entrepreneur Award from the IEEE Computer Society. In 2009, he also won the 2008 National Medal of Technology, awarded by President Barack Obama.[6][8] On October 15, 2010, the Marconi Society co-awarded Geschke and Warnock the Marconi Prize.[9]
On Sunday, May 20, 2012, Geschke delivered the Address to the Graduates (Keynote Address) at John Carroll University in University Heights, Ohio where he was a mathematics professor early in his career and was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters.[10]
Affiliations[edit]
Geschke serves on the boards of the San Francisco Symphony,[11] the National Leadership Roundtable on Church Management,[12] the Commonwealth Club of California,[13] and Tableau Software.[14] He serves on the computer science advisory board of Carnegie-Mellon University, the Board of the Egan Maritime Foundation, and the board of the Nantucket Boys and Girls Club. He is also a member of the National Academy of Engineering and an ACM Fellow.[5][6]
Also, in 1995 he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering, and in 2008 he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He recently, in 2010, completed his term as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the University of San Francisco.[6]
Personal life[edit]
Geschke met his wife, Nan (Nancy McDonough), at a religious conference on social action in the spring of 1961.[15] They married in 1964, and the two are still married with children and grandchildren.[16] Both Charles and Nancy are graduates of Catholic institutions. In 2012 they received the St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Award from the National Catholic Educational Association (NCEA), for their contributions to Catholic education.[17][15] Charles identifies as Catholic.[18]
Geschke's parents were very concerned when Charles quit his job at Xerox at the age of 40 (including a nice big office overlooking the whole Bay Area), in order to found Adobe.
Geschke's mother was a bankruptcy court paralegal. Both Geschke's paternal grandfather and father worked as letterpress photo engravers[19]. Geschke's father helped in the early days of Adobe in checking color separation work with his engraver's loupe. Geschke describes his father's acknowledgement of the high quality of the halftone patterns as "...a wonderful moment.".[4]

Education[edit]
Geschke attended Saint Ignatius High School, and earned a BA in classics and an MS in mathematics from Xavier University, as well as a PhD in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University.[2][3] He taught mathematics at John Carroll University from 1963 to 1968.
Background[edit]
Prior to co-founding Adobe, Geschke and Warnock worked at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). Geschke had started there in October 1972. His first project was to build a mainframe and then worked on programming languages and developing the tools which were used to build the Star workstation.[4]
Geschke formed and headed PARC's Imaging Sciences Laboratory in 1978 where he directed research activities in the fields of computer science, graphics, image processing, and optics.
At PARC, Geschke hired his long-term research partner, John Warnock and together they invented a page description language (PDL), which provided a means to describe complex forms like typefaces electronically – called Interpress. Unable to convince Xerox management of the commercial value of Warnock's InterPress graphics language for controlling printing, the two left Xerox to co-found Adobe Systems.[5]
Adobe[edit]
Geschke and co-founder Warnock's Interpress language evolved into Adobe's PostScript, which when combined with hardware from Apple computer, formed the first desktop publishing (DTP) system where anyone could set type, compose documents, and print them as they appeared on the screen electronically. PostScript was marketable as it was machine-independent and extremely flexible. With this new approach, they brought their product to the market, allowing business users to greatly improve the quality and efficiency of their document production, and thus began an entire industry.[5] From December 1986 until July 1994 Geschke was Adobe's Chief Operating Officer, and from April 1989 until April 2000 he was the company's president. Geschke retired as president of Adobe in 2000, shortly before his partner Warnock left as CEO. He has served as Co-Chairman of the Board of Adobe since September 1997.[2][3][6]
Geschke's company was ranked as number 1,069th on the Forbes Global 2000 in 2010, and in 2009 was mentioned in Forbes List of 400 Best Big Companies in 2009.[2]
1992 kidnapping[edit]
On the morning of May 26, 1992, Geschke was kidnapped at gunpoint from the Adobe parking lot in Mountain View, California by two men as he arrived for work. He was held for four days before being recovered from a house in Hollister, California by the FBI. On May 31, Geschke was freed when a suspect caught with $650,000 in ransom money led authorities to a bungalow hideout, according to the FBI.[7]
The two kidnappers, Mouhannad Albukhari, 26, of San Jose, and Jack Sayeh, 25, of Campbell, were eventually sentenced to life terms in state prison.[7]
Awards[edit]
In 1999, Charles Geschke was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.
In 2002, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum for "his accomplishments in the commercialization of desktop publishing with John Warnock and for innovations in scalable type, computer graphics and printing."[5]
In October 2006, Geschke, along with co-founder John Warnock received the AeA Annual Medal of Achievement Award, making them the first software executives to receive this award. In 2008 he received the Computer Entrepreneur Award from the IEEE Computer Society. In 2009, he also won the 2008 National Medal of Technology, awarded by President Barack Obama.[6][8] On October 15, 2010, the Marconi Society co-awarded Geschke and Warnock the Marconi Prize.[9]
On Sunday, May 20, 2012, Geschke delivered the Address to the Graduates (Keynote Address) at John Carroll University in University Heights, Ohio where he was a mathematics professor early in his career and was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters.[10]
Affiliations[edit]
Geschke serves on the boards of the San Francisco Symphony,[11] the National Leadership Roundtable on Church Management,[12] the Commonwealth Club of California,[13] and Tableau Software.[14] He serves on the computer science advisory board of Carnegie-Mellon University, the Board of the Egan Maritime Foundation, and the board of the Nantucket Boys and Girls Club. He is also a member of the National Academy of Engineering and an ACM Fellow.[5][6]
Also, in 1995 he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering, and in 2008 he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He recently, in 2010, completed his term as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the University of San Francisco.[6]
Personal life[edit]
Geschke met his wife, Nan (Nancy McDonough), at a religious conference on social action in the spring of 1961.[15] They married in 1964, and the two are still married with children and grandchildren.[16] Both Charles and Nancy are graduates of Catholic institutions. In 2012 they received the St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Award from the National Catholic Educational Association (NCEA), for their contributions to Catholic education.[17][15] Charles identifies as Catholic.[18]
Geschke's parents were very concerned when Charles quit his job at Xerox at the age of 40 (including a nice big office overlooking the whole Bay Area), in order to found Adobe.
Geschke's mother was a bankruptcy court paralegal. Both Geschke's paternal grandfather and father worked as letterpress photo engravers[19]. Geschke's father helped in the early days of Adobe in checking color separation work with his engraver's loupe. Geschke describes his father's acknowledgement of the high quality of the halftone patterns as "...a wonderful moment.".[4]

The two kidnappers, Mouhannad Albukhari, 26, of San Jose, and Jack Sayeh, 25, of Campbell, were eventually sentenced to life terms in state prison.[7]
Awards[edit]
In 1999, Charles Geschke was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.
In 2002, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum for "his accomplishments in the commercialization of desktop publishing with John Warnock and for innovations in scalable type, computer graphics and printing."[5]
In October 2006, Geschke, along with co-founder John Warnock received the AeA Annual Medal of Achievement Award, making them the first software executives to receive this award. In 2008 he received the Computer Entrepreneur Award from the IEEE Computer Society. In 2009, he also won the 2008 National Medal of Technology, awarded by President Barack Obama.[6][8] On October 15, 2010, the Marconi Society co-awarded Geschke and Warnock the Marconi Prize.[9]
On Sunday, May 20, 2012, Geschke delivered the Address to the Graduates (Keynote Address) at John Carroll University in University Heights, Ohio where he was a mathematics professor early in his career and was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters.[10]
Affiliations[edit]
Geschke serves on the boards of the San Francisco Symphony,[11] the National Leadership Roundtable on Church Management,[12] the Commonwealth Club of California,[13] and Tableau Software.[14] He serves on the computer science advisory board of Carnegie-Mellon University, the Board of the Egan Maritime Foundation, and the board of the Nantucket Boys and Girls Club. He is also a member of the National Academy of Engineering and an ACM Fellow.[5][6]
Also, in 1995 he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering, and in 2008 he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He recently, in 2010, completed his term as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the University of San Francisco.[6]
Personal life[edit]
Geschke met his wife, Nan (Nancy McDonough), at a religious conference on social action in the spring of 1961.[15] They married in 1964, and the two are still married with children and grandchildren.[16] Both Charles and Nancy are graduates of Catholic institutions. In 2012 they received the St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Award from the National Catholic Educational Association (NCEA), for their contributions to Catholic education.[17][15] Charles identifies as Catholic.[18]
Geschke's parents were very concerned when Charles quit his job at Xerox at the age of 40 (including a nice big office overlooking the whole Bay Area), in order to found Adobe.
Geschke's mother was a bankruptcy court paralegal. Both Geschke's paternal grandfather and father worked as letterpress photo engravers[19]. Geschke's father helped in the early days of Adobe in checking color separation work with his engraver's loupe. Geschke describes his father's acknowledgement of the high quality of the halftone patterns as "...a wonderful moment.".[4]

Education[edit]
Geschke attended Saint Ignatius High School, and earned a BA in classics and an MS in mathematics from Xavier University, as well as a PhD in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University.[2][3] He taught mathematics at John Carroll University from 1963 to 1968.
Background[edit]
Prior to co-founding Adobe, Geschke and Warnock worked at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). Geschke had started there in October 1972. His first project was to build a mainframe and then worked on programming languages and developing the tools which were used to build the Star workstation.[4]
Geschke formed and headed PARC's Imaging Sciences Laboratory in 1978 where he directed research activities in the fields of computer science, graphics, image processing, and optics.
At PARC, Geschke hired his long-term research partner, John Warnock and together they invented a page description language (PDL), which provided a means to describe complex forms like typefaces electronically – called Interpress. Unable to convince Xerox management of the commercial value of Warnock's InterPress graphics language for controlling printing, the two left Xerox to co-found Adobe Systems.[5]
Adobe[edit]
Geschke and co-founder Warnock's Interpress language evolved into Adobe's PostScript, which when combined with hardware from Apple computer, formed the first desktop publishing (DTP) system where anyone could set type, compose documents, and print them as they appeared on the screen electronically. PostScript was marketable as it was machine-independent and extremely flexible. With this new approach, they brought their product to the market, allowing business users to greatly improve the quality and efficiency of their document production, and thus began an entire industry.[5] From December 1986 until July 1994 Geschke was Adobe's Chief Operating Officer, and from April 1989 until April 2000 he was the company's president. Geschke retired as president of Adobe in 2000, shortly before his partner Warnock left as CEO. He has served as Co-Chairman of the Board of Adobe since September 1997.[2][3][6]
Geschke's company was ranked as number 1,069th on the Forbes Global 2000 in 2010, and in 2009 was mentioned in Forbes List of 400 Best Big Companies in 2009.[2]
1992 kidnapping[edit]
On the morning of May 26, 1992, Geschke was kidnapped at gunpoint from the Adobe parking lot in Mountain View, California by two men as he arrived for work. He was held for four days before being recovered from a house in Hollister, California by the FBI. On May 31, Geschke was freed when a suspect caught with $650,000 in ransom money led authorities to a bungalow hideout, according to the FBI.[7]
The two kidnappers, Mouhannad Albukhari, 26, of San Jose, and Jack Sayeh, 25, of Campbell, were eventually sentenced to life terms in state prison.[7]
Awards[edit]
In 1999, Charles Geschke was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.
In 2002, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum for "his accomplishments in the commercialization of desktop publishing with John Warnock and for innovations in scalable type, computer graphics and printing."[5]
In October 2006, Geschke, along with co-founder John Warnock received the AeA Annual Medal of Achievement Award, making them the first software executives to receive this award. In 2008 he received the Computer Entrepreneur Award from the IEEE Computer Society. In 2009, he also won the 2008 National Medal of Technology, awarded by President Barack Obama.[6][8] On October 15, 2010, the Marconi Society co-awarded Geschke and Warnock the Marconi Prize.[9]
On Sunday, May 20, 2012, Geschke delivered the Address to the Graduates (Keynote Address) at John Carroll University in University Heights, Ohio where he was a mathematics professor early in his career and was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters.[10]
Affiliations[edit]
Geschke serves on the boards of the San Francisco Symphony,[11] the National Leadership Roundtable on Church Management,[12] the Commonwealth Club of California,[13] and Tableau Software.[14] He serves on the computer science advisory board of Carnegie-Mellon University, the Board of the Egan Maritime Foundation, and the board of the Nantucket Boys and Girls Club. He is also a member of the National Academy of Engineering and an ACM Fellow.[5][6]
Also, in 1995 he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering, and in 2008 he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He recently, in 2010, completed his term as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the University of San Francisco.[6]

In 2012 they received the St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Award from the National Catholic Educational Association (NCEA), for their contributions to Catholic education.[17][15] Charles identifies as Catholic.[18]

Charles M. 'Chuck' GeschkeChuck GeschkeChairman of the Board and Co-FounderAdobe Systems Charles Geschke co-founded Adobe Systems in 1982 with John Warnock. A respected and inspiring leader in the software industry for more than 30 years, Geschke retired from his position as president of Adobe in 2000 and continues to share the chairmanship of the board with Warnock.
October 28, 2011 City Club of Cleveland
Speaking at the City Club of Cleveland, Chuck Geschke gave insights into the birth of Silicon Valley and the computer industry.Chuck Geschke at the City Club of Cleveland
Dr. Geshke was introduced as the "Gutenberg of Digital Type."  In his introduction, Chuck Geschke gave a shout out to his colleague from his John Carroll University math department days, Dr. Robert Kolesar, who couldn't be there that day.  The Great Lakes Geek told Dr. Geschke that he too was a fan of Dr. Kolesar.  In fact it was Bob Kolesar who convinced the Geek to pursue and earn his math degrees.Chuck Geshcke's Cleveland connections go father back then JCU though.  He was born in Cleveland and attended St, Ignatius High School and his wife attended Magnificat High School.
Chuck Geschke with students from his alma mater St. Ignatius High School (left to right) Nick Hallisy, Kevin Anderson, Greg Blanc, Stephan Franco, Peter Landoll Geschke told stories from the early days at Stanford Industrial Park and the push that became ARPA after Sputnik.  Many of the "ARPA Brats" ended up in the Stanford Industrial Park which became Silicon Valley.  Geschke recalled that in 1976 while at Xerox PARC he had a personal computer with a mouse, e-mail, Word-like word processor, Ethernet connectivity (courtesy of his officemate Bob Metcalfe) and a laser printer.When he learned that his and John Warnock's InterPress graphics language might not become a Xerox product for 7 years, they started Adobe.  He told how Steve Jobs wanted to buy the entire company but they only wanted to sell their products.
Chuck Geschke
Geschke is very concerned by the "dramatically vanishing pool of US born engineers."  45% of PhD physicists in 2005 were born outisde the US.  China now produces more scientists with doctorates than the US.  He lamented that the "best and brightest" are not going into the sciences. 
You can view the entire speech (it's worth the time) on the City Club's YouTube channel below.
As is often the case, the Q&A period brought out some interesting ideas.Here are some audio snippets of Geschke's answers to audience  questions.What did the Great Lakes Geek ask Chuck Geschke after the speech?  Of all the revolutionary products that Adobe has released (Photoshop, Acrobat and PDF, Postscript, etc.) what was the one defining product?  The machine-independent Postscript, which led to desktop publishing and much more,  was his answer.  
What does a region, like Cleveland, need to be a source of entrepreneurs?

What about the Waldorf Schools approach?where kids learn without PCs or calculators?Chuck Geschke with Magnificat High School students Bridget Armanini, Chloe Altieri, Ilona Kereki, Lara Khan, Janie Walborn, Shannon Walton, and Bridgette Coyne
What disciplines to study?
Geschke was a Latin major in college and he advises students to take a variety of liberal arts courses along with pure science because that will stick with them

September 13, 2005 Interview
In this interview, held before a speech at the John Carroll University Entrepreneur Association, Mr Geschke talks about leaving Xerox and starting Adobe, how Apple and DEC approached them resulting in the creation of desktop publishing, why they targeted professionals and later consumers, how he left the safety of a teaching position, why Acrobat and PDF took off, what the Macromedia acquisition means, the paperless office and what the future holds. The Great Lakes Geek apologizes for the poor quality of some of the recording - Hey, even a geek has to learn from his mistakes.  But the interview is worth the sound quality issues.

Charles "Chuck" Geschke & John Warnock





	PostScript Programming Language

The ease with which today’s average consumer can engage in extremely robust, high-quality desktop publishing can be credited largely to the work of John Warnock and Charles “Chuck” Geschke, who founded Adobe Systems, Inc. in 1982 to deliver the programming language known as PostScript to printer and computing device makers.

	Warnock and Geschke first met while working for the research organization Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center), where Warnock, under the direction of Geschke, developed a language dubbed “Interpress” to enable Xerox printers to talk to computers. The pair’s mutual frustration with Xerox PARC’s unwillingness to commercialize the software inspired them to strike out on their own. Today Adobe is arguably the most important firm in desktop publishing software worldwide and is worth nearly $3 billion.

	Warnock was born on Oct. 6, 1940 in Salt Lake City, Utah. He attended the University of Utah, where he earned BS degrees in mathematics and philosophy, an MS in mathematics, and a PhD in engineering and computer science. He joined IBM Corp. while pursuing his doctoral degree and then left, planning to complete his education and become a professor. A job in the computer center at Utah inspired in him a love of technology and an interest in the burgeoning personal computing industry. He worked for a time for Evans & Sutherland Computer Corp. and Computer Sciences Corp. before he accepted a post in graphics research at Xerox PARC. Geschke was the man who hired him.

	Cleveland, Ohio native Geschke was born on September 11, 1939. He earned a BA in classics and an MS in mathematics at Xavier University, followed by a PhD in computer science from Carnegie Mellon in 1972. He joined Xerox PARC shortly after graduation. There he helped design the Mesa programming language and was charged in 1980 with forming a new laboratory focused on graphics and imaging research. He formed the Imaging Sciences Laboratory where he led the development of Interpress, a device-agnostic printing protocol, working closely with Warnock.

	At that time, personal computing devices were beginning to come to the marketplace for the first time. Printers were being developed, but these were of the dot-matrix variety, which produced results with extremely poor quality. Printing from computers was typically done using typesetting machines that cost upwards of $150,000, and production was labor-intensive.

	While Xerox made Interpress its internal standard, the firm was not interested in licensing the technology to others. Warnock and Geschke believed that this was a tremendous missed-opportunity. They resigned from Xerox PARC in 1982 and created a new language from scratch to enable computers to communicate to printers exactly how text, images, and lines should appear on paper. They named their firm after a creek that ran behind Warnock’s home.

	Their original plan was to start a service business where they would provide printing services to businesses and consumers. Encouraged by their financial advisors, they moved toward a software development model and focused on making PostScript truly portable, based on Warnock’s innovative algorithm for “hidden surface determination in computer graphics.”

	They caught the attention of Steve Jobs and Apple Computer, which bought a 19 percent stake in Adobe and agreed to use PostScript in its LaserWriter printer. That printer hit the market in 1985. A year later, Texas Instruments released IBM-compatible PCs equipped with the PostScript protocol. Adobe held its initial public offering in 1986. By 1988, it had grown to an $83 million company.

	Adobe expanded its offerings, adding Illustrator design software in 1987, Acrobat in 1993, and later, Photoshop and Premiere. The company also created the Acrobat portable document format (PDF), which made it possible to transfer files between incompatible systems and keep the look consistent. Adobe remains an industry standard setter and continues to update and add to its product line.

	Warnock held the position of Chairman, CEO, and Chief Technical Officer of Adobe Systems until 2001. He holds six patents and has been honored with numerous awards for his work, including the ACM Systems Award, the Bodleian Medal, and many others. He is also a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.

	Geschke held the post of president of Adobe until 2000. His long list of awards includes the John W. Gardner Leadership Award and, with Warnock, the 2006 American Electronics Association’s Medal of Achievement. In 2009, they both received the National Medal of Technology and Innovation, one of the most prestigious awards given to scientists, engineers, and inventors. Today, Geshcke and Warnock continue to serve as co-chairmen of the board at Adobe Systems.

Supports K@W's Leadership Content 


In 2007, Adobe Systems marked its 25th anniversary, a relatively long tenure for a company that sells personal computer software, an industry barely more than 30 years old. Surviving so long in this rapidly-changing business has required a certain nimbleness. Adobe’s products — and its business models — have evolved as computing moved from standalone PCs to the global communications network of the Internet and worldwide web. But behind these changing technologies is a consistent set of business principles established by Adobe’s two co-founders and current co-chairmen Charles M. (Chuck) Geschke and John Warnock.
Computer scientists who originally worked together at Xerox’s storied Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), Geschke and Warnock founded Adobe Systems in 1982 to commercialize their ideas for electronic document production. The company’s first product, PostScript, was a computer language for describing printed pages that Adobe sold to printer manufacturers. This largely behind-the-scenes technology built into printers set the stage for the desktop publishing revolution of the late 1980s. 
One key to PostScript’s success was its sophisticated technology for rendering digital typefaces. Adobe’s font business moved the company into the retail software market. Its software business expanded when the company developed Adobe Illustrator, a drawing program to allow graphic artists to take advantage of PostScript’s rich imaging features. Photoshop, another imaging program for editing photographs and other “bit-mapped” images, was licensed from brothers Thomas and John Knoll in 1988. 







In June 1993, Adobe shipped the first version of its Acrobat software for creating and viewing electronic documents. Acrobat was slow to catch on initially, but once the Reader software required to view Acrobat’s PDF documents — originally priced at $50 per user — was distributed without charge, the technology began to gain traction with users. With the rise of the web, PDF became a de facto standard for distributing richly formatted electronic documents. 
The desire to support rich content on the web also motivated Adobe’s acquisition of Macromedia in 2005. When Knowledge@Wharton asked then CEO Bruce Chizen about the primary motivation behind the deal, his one-word response was: “Flash.” 
With PostScript, PDF and Flash, Adobe established core standards that laid the foundation for desktop publishing, electronic document interchange and interactive web content. With the company’s AIR (Adobe Integrated Runtime) platform, Adobe hopes to have a similar impact on the development of the next generation of web-connected software. 
Knowledge@Wharton recently met with Adobe Systems’ co-founder and co-chairman Charles Geschke near his home in Los Altos, Calif. In this edited version of that interview, the 68-year-old Geschke discusses how Adobe Systems was born and how the company’s business plans and its product portfolio have continued to evolve.
Knowledge@Wharton: Do you recall when you first met John Warnock?
Geschke: Very well. [Working at Xerox’s PARC] I’d just put on a demonstration of what the future office could be like for Xerox senior management in Boca Raton, Florida. It was a big deal. We did a stage production that was scripted and set up in Hollywood. 
This was the body language of essentially every Xerox executive looking at all this stuff. [Folds his arms and tenses up.] It was pretty clear to me that we were fighting a tough battle, but I was committed. 
When I got back I was given the opportunity to start a new lab focused on graphics, electronic printing and some other stuff. First, I needed to find a chief scientist. I didn’t want to recruit somebody from inside PARC because I wanted some fresh ideas.
I’d known John by reputation but I’d never actually met him. I called him up and said, “I’d like to talk to you about some interesting things I’m doing.” We met for lunch. He had a beard and I had a beard. He had three kids, two boys and one girl. I had two boys and one girl. He refereed soccer and so did I. He was a mathematician. I was originally a mathematician by training. 
We hit it off, and I hired him. It was the best hiring decision I ever made. 
Knowledge@Wharton: What prompted you and Warnock to leave Xerox? 
Xerox loved [what we had done]. They said, “We’ll make it a corporate standard.” I said, “Great!” I went to Connecticut to [Xerox] headquarters and said, “I’m here to talk about the marketing plan for rolling this out.” They said, “Oh, wait a minute. At Xerox it takes seven years to develop a product — and we can’t talk about this because other people will get the idea and beat us to market.”
I said, “Seven years! [In the] industry you’re about to go into, that’s two to three generations. By the time you bring it out it will be worthless.” [They said,] “Sorry, [it takes] seven years at Xerox.” 
John and I were frustrated. It turned out that his thesis adviser at the University of Utah was on the board of the investment bank Hambrecht & Quist. Bill Hambrechtwas one of the first guys pushing venture investing in high-tech companies.
We told him our plan, which was to build a complete turnkey publishing system — the computers, the printers, the typesetting equipment, everything — and sell it to the Fortune 500 so they could bring a lot of their production work in house. He liked the idea because he hated financial printers. Every time he did a prospectus he felt that he was being robbed. He agreed to invest $2.5 million over two years in two equal payments and told us we would have to quit our jobs — which was a little bit of a gut wrench, although we knew with our backgrounds we could get a job in [Silicon] Valley pretty easily. 
So we opened our doors and began recruiting people. 
Knowledge@Wharton: If your original plan was to sell complete, turnkey publishing systems, why did you switch to just marketing PostScript printer software?
Geschke: One of my professors from Carnegie Mellon, Gordon Bell, had left Carnegie to become the head of R&D for Digital Equipment [Corporation]. After about two months he came by to see what we were doing.
We showed him what we were involved in and described our business plan. He said, “Wow, that looks very cool and it solves a problem I’m having. But, of course, I don’t need any computers — I’m Digital Equipment. And I’ve got a deal with Ricoh for the printer so I don’t need that. But I have two or three development teams that are failing miserably at figuring out how to interface them together. That’s what you guys are doing as part of your solution. Why don’t you just sell me that software?” 
We said, “Well, Gordon, we’ve got this business plan that raised $2.5 million dollars. We have to do that.” He said, “Well, if you change your mind, call me.” 
In about two more months, a friend of ours who had left Xerox to work for Steve Jobs [on the] Macintosh brought Steve over. We showed Steve what we were doing and he said, “Wow! But I don’t need the computers, I’ve got this Macintosh [in development]” which he showed us. “I have a deal with Canon for the laser printer, so I don’t need that.” He said, “But my development guys are getting nowhere with this software. Sell me your company, come work for me and I’ll put it in my product.”
Knowledge@Wharton: Did you actually consider selling the entire company to Apple?
Geschke: No, not really. We heard him, we were polite. But we said, “You know, Steve, we really want to start our own company.” And he said, “Oh, all right, I can understand that. So, sell me the software.” We said, “We have this business plan that raised $2.5 million.” He said, “I think you guys are nuts. You’ll change your mind. When you do, call me.”
So we talked to the chairman of our board, Q.T. Wiles, whom Bill put in as sort of a fatherly figure to advise us. He said, “Jobs is right — you’re nuts! That business plan was only there to get you the money. Your customers are telling you what your business ought to be. Throw the business plan out and do a deal.”
I called up Steve, hat in hand, and said, “We changed our mind; we would like to arrange a deal to license you the software.” He said, “How much do you want for the company?” We said, “We’re not for sale, Steve.” He said, “Oh, all right.” 
So we worked a deal with him. He bought 19.9% [of Adobe Systems] as part of the deal, which was a 5x multiple on the original venture investment and we did a deal with a prepayment of future royalties. Altogether we brought in about $3.5 million. So our second round of venture investment did not come in as a tax preferred investment. They just bought stock with it.
Knowledge@Wharton: This is how Adobe began as a printer software company? 
Geschke: Yes. We developed the [PostScript] language after we left PARC. What really caught people’s attention was what we were doing in terms of rendering type on-the-fly from outlines [the curves used to define the characters of a typeface at any size or angle].
Popular mythology at the time said that couldn’t be done; you have to hire a bunch of monks to build bitmaps. We knew that wouldn’t fly because we really wanted [to do] arbitrary expansion and contraction [of the typefaces]. You could never have enough bitmaps or enough typefaces to satisfy the printing world. It was just infeasible. You had to do it from outlines. We eventually developed software that did that and continue to use it today.
We built our own outline type business at the same time. We were the first to be licensed the trademarks “Times” and “Helvetica” by the Linotype corporation.
Knowledge@Wharton: Was that hard to convince a traditional font company like Linotype to go into digital type? This was very different from the business they were in [selling fonts for traditional typesetting equipment].
Geschke: Oh yeah. They had a lock on the customers who bought their type. If you decided to get rid of them and go to Agfa or Compugraphic, it was a big deal because nobody’s equipment was compatible.
We went to Compugraphic first because they were an American company and we thought that would be easier. They were very arrogant. They had the lion’s share of the market at the time. Linotype needed an edge up and so they agreed to do business with us.
Within about two years they had the lion’s share of the business in the United States because they had PostScript compatibility. Compugraphic had to sell itself to Agfa and basically went out of business.
Knowledge@Wharton: By the time you developed your actual business plan, you had Apple as a partner?
Geschke: And Linotype.
IBM came to talk to us, but we deliberately decided to go really slow. We figured that in order to get a decent deal with them we had to have leverage — namely a competitor already doing well. We tried to do a deal with HP [Hewlett-Packard]. They were extremely arrogant because the [Hewlett-Packard] LaserJet was doing very well and they didn’t want to talk to us. 
After the [Apple] LaserWriter and desktop publishing became a phenomenon, IBM decided they had to get into the game and we did a deal with them. As soon as we announced the IBM deal, then Hewlett-Packard called and said, “We think we need to do business.”
Knowledge@Wharton: When did you enter the Japanese market?
Geschke: We licensed type technology for the Japanese market in 1986 or 1987. [It was] almost the identical situation as with Compugraphic and Linotype. 
Originally the Japanese typesetting industry had only one company before World War II. The two guys who ran it got into a disagreement over the Japanese conduct of going to war. One guy was a supporter [of the war effort] and the other was not. So they split the business. One guy stayed in Tokyo and his business took off, because he was at the seat of power. And the other guy took his part of the business to Osaka. He did okay, but he was struggling. 
We first went to the Tokyo branch. At that point it was run by a woman, which was quite unusual in Japanese industry. She was the widow of the fellow who had stayed in Tokyo. I could never get to the second cup of tea with her. She just didn’t want to talk. She had 90% of the business and she didn’t need anything new-fangled.
So we went to Osaka and talked to the other company and, again, because they wanted to get into a stronger position and they intuitively knew the industry was going to change, we did a deal with them. We got the license to their type library and they now have 80% to 90% of the business.
Knowledge@Wharton: As was the case with Linotype, the incumbent wasn’t interested, but the underdog was. And it completely changed the fortunes of both companies.
Geschke: I think if you did a study of business deals, it’s almost always that way.
The companies that think they’re in control of their long-term destiny don’t want to talk to a young start-up company that’s going to change the rules of the business.
Knowledge@Wharton: From the beginning, you documented the specification for the PostScript language.
Geschke: Yes. We published the spec about three or four months before the first LaserWriter shipped.
Knowledge@Wharton: These days this is fairly common practice to help establish a standard platform, but it was much less common back then. Was this merely a practical necessity because people needed to write software to drive PostScript printers or was this a strategic move to establish PostScript as a standard?
Geschke: It wasn’t strategic in the sense that we understood this would become a standard way of doing business. It was the only way we could figure out to get the hardware manufacturers and the software developers and the platform vendors to collaborate. You couldn’t do independent deals with each of them because there would always be somebody left out. 
If you really wanted to make it a standard — and our goal from the beginning was to have it be a universal standard — you have to publish. You just have no choice. You’re taking the risk that someone will do a better job of implementing it. We had the self confidence that we would always have the best implementation, and that has turned out to be true.
Knowledge@Wharton: A lot of PostScript clones did come along eventually.
Geschke: At one time there were over 75 of them.


Knowledge@Wharton High School






Knowledge@Wharton: Did it ever worry you that they would start to chip away at your market share?
Geschke: No. But it turned out that Microsoft acquired one of them.
Knowledge@Wharton: From Bauer Enterprises.
Geschke: Right. TrueImage, they called it. Microsoft did a deal to license TrueImage [to Apple]and Apple would license TrueType to Microsoft. That was pretty scary for us.
Knowledge@Wharton: When did you first hear about the Microsoft-Apple partnership for TrueImage and TrueType?
Geschke: A few days before it was announced.
Knowledge@Wharton: This was announced at the Seybold [publishing systems] Conference in September 1989. You heard about it a couple days prior to that?
Geschke: The preceding Friday. I had a conversation with Bill Gates.
Knowledge@Wharton: Did Gates call you?
Geschke: No, we were trying to close a deal. We were [hoping to] license him ATM [Adobe Type Manager] which was Adobe’s version of TrueType for [on-screen font] display.
The deal we offered Microsoft was [already] running technology ready to ship in a matter of weeks, all the type libraries already licensed, all of the agreements in place and we were not going to charge them. It was free!
Knowledge@Wharton: How could he say no?
Geschke: That’s what I asked Bill. And I’m not going to tell you the answer.
Knowledge@Wharton: But he told you in that phone call that he was going a different way and was going to do a deal with Apple to license its font technology?
Geschke: Yes. It’s why he was going a different way that I’m not going to tell you.
Knowledge@Wharton: Presumably it was a control issue — he didn’t want the control of that core technology in the hands of an independent company.
Geschke: Let’s leave it at that. Let’s move on.
Knowledge@Wharton: Okay. What was the response to the Apple-Microsoft announcement at that Seybold Conference?
Geschke: I think if you were to talk to Adobe customers in any era, one of the things they’ll tell you is that, while they may have a disagreement about this or that, by and large they were treated fairly. They could depend upon getting great technology licensed to them on a fair and equitable basis. Customers like that. If you treat them the way you like to be treated, they sense that. That was always part of our core philosophy as a company. 
At that Seybold Conference, when the announcement was made between Apple and Microsoft, the Seybold people immediately changed the schedule to put a panel on the last day to discuss all of this. Before the panel began, the moderator got up and said, “I want to take a straw vote. I want everyone to raise their hand who thinks they would rather have Apple and Microsoft take over this segment of the business.” There were a few hands raised — I’ve always believed they were Microsoft and Apple people — but, basically, no one voted against us. They all wanted Adobe to continue to be their vendor. 
We brought ATM out within about 60 days and sold hundreds of thousands of units in the first quarter, which was a lot in those days. It was three years before Apple and Microsoft shipped TrueType.
Knowledge@Wharton: And TrueImage really never got out of the starting gate.
Geschke: No, it never got anywhere. Apple tried to build one product on it. They eventually gave up, called us and said, “Will you come back?”
Knowledge@Wharton: How was it to go from being a company that sold printer software to OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] to being a shrink-wrapped desktop software company with products like Illustrator and Photoshop?
Geschke: It was a “come to Jesus” moment inside the company, because all the profits were being made by PostScript. As we began to invest in not only development, which was relatively inexpensive — just a few people — but more importantly in building a sales and marketing presence in the retail channel, we were chewing up resources. It was difficult in the early days to demonstrate profitability in that business. Every time we would have a budget debate, you can imagine how that went: “I’m bringing in most of the money. I should be getting these resources.”
Knowledge@Wharton: What motivated you to stick with this second line of business?
Geschke: One of the obvious lessons in business is that you can’t continue to be a one product company and survive. We also felt we couldn’t be a one channel company and survive. We were captive of those OEMs [of PostScript printers]. If they ever decided to drop us, we [would have been] toast. We had no channel. 
In fact, one of the things that we did to try to get HP’s attention — The [Hewlett-Packard] LaserJet had cartridges [to add features to the printer]. We built a device to convert a LaserJet into a PostScript printer and sold it at retail [as a LaserJet cartridge]. So we already knew we were going to a retail sales channel. 
The other thing that was happening is that the [software] applications in those days on DOS — Windows wasn’t even there yet — and the Macintosh weren’t using more than 20% of the capability inside [a PostScript] printer. In fact, our own graphic designers at Adobe had to learn how to program in PostScript to do graphics. We knew that wasn’t going to fly.
John’s wife was — and is — a graphic designer. John had a second job [when he went] home at night writing PostScript code to do what she wanted to do on the LaserWriter. He got a couple of engineers to come up with Illustrator. We launched Illustrator and it did very well. 
We realized then that we spent a lot of money to build a retail channel and a sales force and we had to feed it. There had to be more products.
Knowledge@Wharton: That led to Photoshop?
Geschke: A couple guys from the University of Michigan — the Knoll brothers — came out to California and showed us this thing they were working on for manipulating photographs. John and I couldn’t figure out if there would ever be much of a market, but it looked like a pretty good idea. By that time it was obvious that the printing industry was going to go completely digital with our technology — and that the same would be true in all imaging dimensions. It should be true in photography. It should be true in video. Why wouldn’t all imagery be digital?
So we decided to buy the two-man company and hire the guys. We did a royalty deal with them so we could keep the price reasonable.
When we made that decision there were no digital cameras. A scanner was about the size of a refrigerator and cost $30,000 to $40,000. A power user on a Macintosh had this little black and white display with an extra disk that held maybe 20 megabytes. And we are bringing out a product that was going to push all those dimensions right off the map. 
We instinctively knew that was where things were going. The only business book that John and I ever read, and the only chapter that I remember from it was a chapter entitled “Market Gap Analysis.” The one idea I remember was that it is easier to build a business if you find a new solution to an already perceived problem that no one has come out with before — because you instantly are [at] 100% market share. 
We did that with PostScript, we did that with Illustrator, and we were going to do it with Photoshop even though we knew we were going in early. And it has worked out very well. 
We did the same thing with Acrobat. We brought Acrobat out about three years before the Internet really took off, thinking that local area networking would be enough to support it, but it wasn’t. 
And we’re trying to do the same thing with AIR [the Adobe Integrated Runtime development platform for cross-operating system software]: Bring it out before anyone else has the idea of the concept, get the platform established, and then shame on us if we can’t make money off it.
Knowledge@Wharton: While the technology has changed greatly over the past two decades, there appears to be a certain consistency in Adobe’s business strategy.
Geschke: That’s one of the things that contrasts us with Microsoft. They have never invented anything that I am aware of. They clone someone else’s idea and use their market position to try and force their way into the business.
Tell me a new market innovation they opened up. Windows came from PARC. Word came from PARC. Excel came from Lotus. PowerPoint came from Aldus Persuasion. And they can’t take credit for e-mail.
Knowledge@Wharton: You mentioned that Acrobat was a product that was different than anything that had come before. What was the initial insight that led to the development of Acrobat and PDF?
Geschke: We had already, in effect, converted anything that went to physical media into digital form. Paper is a great way to read information, but it’s not a very effective way to store it. It’s a very expensive way to ship it, and it’s very hard to search. But a digital representation of the page doesn’t have any of those problems. It’s very cheap to store — you can store the entire world knowledge in a couple of filing cabinets. You can ship electronic information and let the recipient decide how they want to read it — on a screen, on paper or on film. And searching it is much more efficient. 
It came out of that idea. If everything that matters goes through our [PostScript] printer driver, we can just capture it at the printing point and turn it into this electronic form.
Knowledge@Wharton: Initially, Acrobat Reader 1.0 wasn’t free — it had a retail price of $50 per seat. With Acrobat 2.0, the Reader became free. Was that decision difficult internally for you to make?
Geschke: Oh, yeah. The concept of giving away software was anathema, a very foreign concept. But it became obvious that doing that was the only way we could get market penetration. Microsoft could assume that somehow or another everybody had Word. We couldn’t assume that everyone was going to buy the Reader.
Knowledge@Wharton: For a long time it cost Adobe more to develop and market Acrobat than the revenue it returned. 
Geschke: Oh yeah, the antibodies inside the company were just all over it.
Knowledge@Wharton: People wanted to kill the product?
Geschke: Of course, because they said, “Look, we’re selling all this Photoshop. We’re selling all these printers. Why the hell are we investing in this thing, and giving it away?”
Knowledge@Wharton: Why did you continue to invest in Acrobat for so long? What gave you the confidence to continue to pour money into it?
Geschke: Your own instincts. You can’t analyze a market that has never existed. 
When people were analyzing whether to invest in the Haloid Company, which was the precursor of Xerox, they went out and measured the carbon paper market, and they said, “It’s not very big and it’s not growing very much.” They were measuring the wrong thing.
Knowledge@Wharton: Adobe is a publicly held company. Would the current market let you run that long with a product that was costing you more than the revenue it was generating?
Geschke: As long as we were making a lot of money on everything else, they never knew. The trick is to be very aggressive in other parts of your business. 
And if you’re lucky enough to get a “franchise” product like Photoshop, you can’t become complacent. For example, when we brought out PhotoDeluxe we were initially the strongest competitor for Photoshop. Rather than cede the low end of the market to someone else, we took it. And that allowed us to upgrade people. With hindsight it was the exactly the right thing to do — not give someone the ability to undercut you, come in and be “good enough.” 
We learned that from the LaserJet. [Although a] PostScript [printer like] the LaserWriter was a much better product, eventually the [Hewlett-Packard] LaserJet was good enough. [Although PostScript is] still a profitable business.
Knowledge@Wharton: Even with all the PostScript clones?
Geschke: And the fact that all the money is in the ink. There is no money in the printers anymore.
[Do you know who today is] our biggest customer for desktop printing? Xerox. I own two Xerox printers now, both of which have PostScript. One’s black and white and one’s color.
So whatever goes around comes around.
Knowledge@Wharton: In the summer of 1998 Adobe Systems went through a difficult period. The stock price was depressed. Quark, one of your leading competitors in the page layout business attempted a hostile takeover. What caused that situation?
Geschke: A year or two earlier, I walked into John [Warnock’s] office and said, “John, I think I don’t want to work at a full-time job in a year that begins with the numeral 2. It just doesn’t seem right.” He said, “What are you telling me?” I said, “I’m telling you we’re both getting pretty close to 60.” I was flying a quarter of a million miles a year. I said, “I just don’t think it’s good for me to keep doing this because if I can’t do it full out like I always have, I won’t feel good about it, and I don’t think I’ll be good for the company. We really need to think about what to do.” 
We have always been highly leveraged — our revenue per employee has always been high. As a result, we kept a pretty lean organization with a pretty shallow management structure. We frankly hadn’t done work trying to groom anybody [as a successor], because we weren’t thinking about it. 
So — this was not our brightest decision — we decided we could recruit replacement talent, spend a couple of years with them, get them up to speed, and their natural abilities would take over. 
We hired three or four very bright people, [people who were] very successful in their previous businesses and had the right pedigree to run a business like Adobe. We figured we would meld them into a team. 
Well, each one of them thought that he should be the future CEO of the company. Rather than melding as a team, they fought like cats. It became miserable. It was impossible to have a staff meeting without it breaking out into angry disputes. It was getting ugly. Because of people trying to build turf, spending was getting ahead of revenue. And in the summer of 1998, the Japanese market went off a cliff for six months. It just stopped. I’ve never fully understood why it happened. And we found ourselves having to preannounce a very bad quarter and dealing with these people who weren’t getting along. 
John and I decided that we would fire all of them on the same day.
We identified the person — Bruce Chizen — we wanted to groom from the inside. [We decided to] just gut it out — announce the bad quarter and go back to our knitting. 
After we announced all that, we got the [hostile takeover] letter and that became public immediately. This was the second time that we had to go to a Seybold Conference and deal with a very awkward moment in our history.
Because our crack marketing people were so divisive internally, we didn’t have a keynote position in that conference. We talked to Steve Jobs, who had come back [to Apple]. We showed him InDesign [Adobe’s page layout software] running on a Mac and said, “We’d like to talk about this. Can you give us some of your time?” He said, “Sure.” We went up on stage, showed [InDesign], and people loved what they saw, because they could see the PostScript imaging model coming right up on the display, which is something Steve always wanted to ship on the Macintosh, but when he left and [Jean-Louis] Gassée came in, Gassée squelched that. 
The audience loved it. On the last day, they had another one of those panels [where they polled the audience to see who supported a Quark acquisition of Adobe]. I don’t know how much you know about Quark, but their customers have a lot of difficulty with them. This time, there wasn’t a single hand raised in the room when the question was asked.
And we now have market leadership in that market. It’s the only time we’ve ever dislodged an entrenched competitor. We were ticked off. And fortunately we built a superior product.
Knowledge@Wharton: As part of this management change, of all the executives in the company why did you look to Bruce Chizen?
Geschke: He had a sales and marketing background. He had worked for a while for Microsoft and at Claris [a software company started by Apple Computer].
He was actually being hired by Aldus the week that we announced the acquisition. [Then Aldus president] Paul Brainerd and I went to the San Francisco airport, Paul introduced me to Bruce, and I convinced him to stay even though his job was going to be different.
We didn’t know how it would be different. Shortly after the merger, we changed what he would do. He’s the guy who brought out PhotoDeluxe.
We watched him bring out a product, launch it and build a new category [for Adobe software]. As a result, we had a lot of respect for his abilities and gave him higher-power jobs. By 1998, he was running all of our application products business. He seemed like the natural candidate to groom. We did that for a couple of years, and when I announced my retirement, we moved him in as the president.
About six months later John decided he didn’t want to work anymore and then [Chizen] became the CEO. Bruce did an incredible job [and stepped down in December 2007].
Fortunately we didn’t repeat the mistake. We had been grooming [current CEO] Shantanu [Narayen] for several years to move in that position. “We’ll find another person to groom so that when Shantanu [steps down], we’ll do it again.”
Knowledge@Wharton: The issue of succession seems to be a challenge for many technology companies. Apple is very centered on Steve Jobs. Oracle is very Larry Ellison centric.
Geschke: It’s hard. If you want to give real value to your shareholders and build a company that has a long life, you realize pretty quickly that that is a major problem and you’ve got to start working on it. We should have been brighter and known that we couldn’t go outside; you have to do it from the inside.
I have always believed that the principles and values of the company you build is an important ingredient in its success. You can’t get someone to come in from the outside and just pick that up in a six-month training period. It doesn’t work that way. Not everybody agrees with some of those principles — they think they have to do it a different way. 
Knowledge@Wharton: It seems like you’ve tried to maintain the consistency of Adobe’s corporate culture even as the company’s technology focus has evolved.
Geschke: We really didn’t start emphasizing [corporate culture] until roughly 1989.
When we began, John and I wanted to build a company that we would like to work in. Why would you build a business you didn’t want to work in? 
We both had enough experience that we knew there were a lot of things we felt we shouldn’t do and had some ideas about things that we thought were important to do. But we didn’t really start verbalizing it until it became clear that, as we got bigger and we had to confront tough things, we needed to make sure that everybody understood and could help us enunciate what those principles were, what that culture was about, and make this ingrained in how the business ran. So I started at least once a year giving talks on the whole thing.
In 1998, I wrote a [six-page] memo and distributed it to the whole company about not only what the background cultural ideas were, but some of the things that we had started to do that were deviating from good principles of how the business would run. When new employees come in, they’re still getting a session at employee indoctrination to give them that background so that they understand the kind of company they are coming to work for.
Knowledge@Wharton: What were some of the key points in the memo you sent to the employees?
Geschke: I talked about the fact that we were having way too many meetings that were too large. If you have a decision-making meeting, you can only have four or five people in the room. If you have a communication meeting, be careful whether you even need to have it. There are lots of ways to communicate; you don’t need to bring all the people physically into one place. Mundane stuff like that. Treat the company’s assets the way you would treat your own. They don’t belong to you; they belong to the shareholders. 
One of the things I talk a lot about is the necessity to juggle all of the constituencies that have an interest in the business: shareholders, customers, employees, vendors, and the communities in which we operate. Those constituencies are all mildly in conflict with one another in terms of what’s best for them. Your job as a leader in a company is to find an appropriate way to juggle those conflicting interests so everybody feels like they’re getting a fair deal, without letting any one dominate the others because they’ll drag your company down.
Geschke on Adobe’s Culture

Read the Memo (15kb)
I talked about the difference between leadership and management. Your job as a leader is to create more leaders — not more followers. That’s what you need to do as a manager. That’s actually a quote from Ralph Nader, de-politicized. If you’d like to see that paper, I’d be happy to ship it to you. There was nothing private about it. [For more on Geschke’s memo, see sidebar: “Geschke on Adobe’s Culture”]
Don’t tell my friends at the Wharton School, but I never took a business class in my life. John didn’t either. 
Knowledge@Wharton: The two of you co-managed the company for much of its history. How did you split the tasks and balance what each of you did?
Geschke: It’s a very unique business relationship. I know a little bit about the internals of the interactions between Packard and Hewlett — which were very similar in most respects. John and I have worked together ever since I hired him in 1978. That’s 30 years and we’ve never had a serious argument. We haven’t always agreed about everything, but we never left work angry at one another. We had a shared perception of our principles and values.
We paid ourselves the same, we get the same stock options — everything was identical. We can’t both have the same title but, I don’t care much about titles, because it didn’t matter — we were both running the company independent of our title. It’s a wonderful way to run a business, because it gives you so much more freedom. You have a real soul mate.
Although [former CEO] Bruce [Chizen] developed a lot of that relationship with [current CEO] Shantanu [Narayen], [running a company] can feel pretty lonely. Who do you talk to? That’s one thing John and I have always tried to do for Bruce and Shantanu. We don’t keep an office at Adobe. I don’t want to be perceived as looking over their shoulders. [But] we make ourselves available anytime that they want to sit down. We usually have breakfast once a month with Shantanu to chat and see how things are going. If he wants to call, we’ll be there immediately.
Knowledge@Wharton: Are you and John still close, now?
Geschke: Yes. I talked to him on the phone yesterday. We have common friends in Los Altos where we live. [Our wives] Nan and Marva have always had a good friendship. And our kids get along great.
It’s been a very unusual, very wonderful relationship. I feel extremely fortunate. I can’t imagine doing it alone.
Knowledge@Wharton: What do you think is the biggest mistake Adobe made in its 25-year history?
Geschke: That’s always hard to answer. I’d say [it was] trying to prepare for handing over the company to the next generation. That was a huge mistake. 
We are so lucky that we were able to recover from that. It could have been disastrous. It was a combination of a pretty strong economy overall and the fact that once we got the cost controls in place the top line of the business was very healthy, so we were able to get back in economic control of the business. But that was a scary, scary time when you fire your four most senior executives in the same day. 
Knowledge@Wharton: Looking back on the history of the company, what are you most proud of?
Geschke: My grandfather and father were letterpress photo engravers. I grew up around ink and printing all my life. I remember the first color work that we did at Adobe. I brought home samples of some halftones [for printing photographs] and I showed them to my Dad. He took out his engraver’s loupe and looked at it. He looked at it again. He said, “Charles…” — when he called me “Charles” I knew it was bad news — “Charles,” he said, “This doesn’t look very good.”
I said, “I know, Dad, but I just wanted to show you this because we are going to get it right. We’re just not there yet.” 
My father was a very kind and gentle guy — tough, but still gentle in the way he was tough. About two years later we made dramatic breakthroughs and had gotten to the point where our halftones formed the right kind of rosettes. They looked as good, if not better, than conventional technology for printing.
I brought a sample home and said, “Dad, we did some new work here. I want you to take a look at.” He took out his loupe and he looked. And he looked about four or five times at it. With a big grin on his face, he said, “Charlie…” — he’s one of the few people who could call me Charlie — “Charlie, you’ve done it.” And to me that’s the thing I’m proudest of. During my dad’s lifetime — fortunately he lived to be almost 99 — I could show him that I had done something, from a completely different direction, that he could see the value in. You don’t often get a chance to do that with a parent. That was really cool.
Knowledge@Wharton: What do you think is the biggest challenge Adobe is facing going forward?
Geschke: Inventing the future. We’ll never succeed unless we continue to open up new vistas. 
I honestly believe that our technology and what’s happening in the market — where essentially all visual communication is going to the web — is the sweetheart point in our whole envelope of products and technologies. Shame on us if we can’t figure out a way to take advantage of that shift in the way the world is moving with the distribution of information. 
A lot of what are there today — the limitations of browsers and of the web imaging standards — are things that we think we have a solution for. As they become the primary delivery mechanism, that value is going to differentiate.
