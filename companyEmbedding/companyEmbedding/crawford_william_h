Early life[edit]
Crawford was born on February 24, 1772 in the portion of Amherst County, Virginia that later became Nelson County, the son of Joel Crawford and Fanny Harris, but at least one source has given his birthplace as Tusculum, a house whose site remains in Amherst County.[1] He moved with his family to Edgefield County, South Carolina in 1779 and to Columbia County, Georgia in 1783. Crawford was educated at private schools in Georgia and at Richmond Academy in Augusta. After his father's death, Crawford became the family's main financial provider, and he worked on the Crawford family farm and taught school. He later studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1799 and began to practice in Lexington. Also in 1799, Crawford was appointed by the state legislature to prepare a digest of Georgia's statutes.
State politics[edit]
He influenced Georgia politics for decades.[2] In 1803, Crawford was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, and he served until 1807. He allied himself with Senator James Jackson. Their enemies were the Clarkites, led by John Clark. In 1802, he shot and killed Peter Lawrence Van Alen, a Clark ally, in a duel. Four years later, on December 16, 1806, Crawford faced Clark himself in a duel, and Crawford's left wrist being shattered by a shot from Clark, but he eventually recovered.[3]
In Congress[edit]
In 1807, Crawford joined the 10th United States Congress as the junior U.S. Senator from Georgia when the Georgia legislature elected him to replace George Jones, who had held the office for a few months after the death of Abraham Baldwin.
Crawford was elected President pro tempore in 1811. When Vice President George Clinton died on April 20, 1812, Crawford, as President pro tempore, became the first Acting Vice President until March 4, 1813.
In 1811, Crawford declined to serve as Secretary of War in the Madison administration. In the Senate, he voted for several acts leading up to the War of 1812, and he supported the entry into the war, but he was ready for peace:[4] "Let it then be the wisdom of this nation to remain at peace, as long as peace is within its option."[5]
Minister to France[edit]
In 1813, President James Madison appointed Crawford as the US minister to France during the waning years of the First French Empire; Crawford held that ministerial post until 1815, shortly after the end of the war.[6]
Cabinet[edit]
Upon Crawford's return, Madison appointed him as Secretary of War. After slightly more than a year of satisfactory service in that post and after disclaiming interest in the 1816 presidential race as the Democratic-Republican nomination, Crawford moved within the Cabinet to become Secretary of the Treasury. He remained in that position through the rest of Madison's term and James Monroe's Sentire administration, which ended in 1825.
1824 election[edit]
Crawford was again a leading candidate for the Democratic-Republican presidential nomination in the 1824 election. However, Crawford was put out of the running because of a paralytic stroke he had suffered in 1823 because of a prescription given to him by his physician.[7] The Democratic-Republican Party was now split, and one of the splinter groups nominated Crawford.
Despite Crawford's improved health (and the support of former Presidents Madison and Thomas Jefferson), he finished third in the electoral vote, behind Battle of New Orleans hero Andrew Jackson and Secretary of State John Quincy Adams. He thus was still in the nominal running when the Presidential election ended up in the House of Representatives because the Twelfth Amendment allows the House to choose one of the top three candidates. His stroke ended whatever chance he had of winning.
Later life[edit]
Refusing Adams's request for him to remain at the Treasury, Crawford then returned to Georgia, where he was appointed as a state superior court judge. Crawford remained an active judge until his death, a decade later.
Crawford was nominated for vice president by the Georgia legislature in 1828 but withdrew after support from other states was not forthcoming. Crawford also considered running for vice president in 1832 but decided against it, in favor of Martin Van Buren. Crawford also considered running for president again in 1832 but dropped the idea when Jackson decided to seek a second term.
Crawford is buried at the site of his home, about half a mile west of the current Crawford city limit.
Societies[edit]
During the 1820s, Crawford was a member of the prestigious society Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, which had among its members former Presidents Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams.[8]
Crawford also served as a Vice President in the American Colonization Society from its formation in 1817 to his death.
Family[edit]
Crawford was a descendent of John Crawford (1600–1676), who had come to Virginia in 1643 but participated and died in Bacon’s Rebellion. John’s son David Crawford, I (1625–1698), was the father of David Crawford, II (1662–1762), and the grandfather of David Crawford, III (1697–1766). David Crawford, III, married Ann Anderson in 1727 and had 13 children, including Joel Crawford (1736–1788).
His cousin George W. Crawford served as Secretary of War under President Zachary Taylor.

Early life[edit]
Crawford was born on February 24, 1772 in the portion of Amherst County, Virginia that later became Nelson County, the son of Joel Crawford and Fanny Harris, but at least one source has given his birthplace as Tusculum, a house whose site remains in Amherst County.[1] He moved with his family to Edgefield County, South Carolina in 1779 and to Columbia County, Georgia in 1783. Crawford was educated at private schools in Georgia and at Richmond Academy in Augusta. After his father's death, Crawford became the family's main financial provider, and he worked on the Crawford family farm and taught school. He later studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1799 and began to practice in Lexington. Also in 1799, Crawford was appointed by the state legislature to prepare a digest of Georgia's statutes.
State politics[edit]
He influenced Georgia politics for decades.[2] In 1803, Crawford was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, and he served until 1807. He allied himself with Senator James Jackson. Their enemies were the Clarkites, led by John Clark. In 1802, he shot and killed Peter Lawrence Van Alen, a Clark ally, in a duel. Four years later, on December 16, 1806, Crawford faced Clark himself in a duel, and Crawford's left wrist being shattered by a shot from Clark, but he eventually recovered.[3]
In Congress[edit]
In 1807, Crawford joined the 10th United States Congress as the junior U.S. Senator from Georgia when the Georgia legislature elected him to replace George Jones, who had held the office for a few months after the death of Abraham Baldwin.
Crawford was elected President pro tempore in 1811. When Vice President George Clinton died on April 20, 1812, Crawford, as President pro tempore, became the first Acting Vice President until March 4, 1813.
In 1811, Crawford declined to serve as Secretary of War in the Madison administration. In the Senate, he voted for several acts leading up to the War of 1812, and he supported the entry into the war, but he was ready for peace:[4] "Let it then be the wisdom of this nation to remain at peace, as long as peace is within its option."[5]
Minister to France[edit]
In 1813, President James Madison appointed Crawford as the US minister to France during the waning years of the First French Empire; Crawford held that ministerial post until 1815, shortly after the end of the war.[6]
Cabinet[edit]
Upon Crawford's return, Madison appointed him as Secretary of War. After slightly more than a year of satisfactory service in that post and after disclaiming interest in the 1816 presidential race as the Democratic-Republican nomination, Crawford moved within the Cabinet to become Secretary of the Treasury. He remained in that position through the rest of Madison's term and James Monroe's Sentire administration, which ended in 1825.
1824 election[edit]
Crawford was again a leading candidate for the Democratic-Republican presidential nomination in the 1824 election. However, Crawford was put out of the running because of a paralytic stroke he had suffered in 1823 because of a prescription given to him by his physician.[7] The Democratic-Republican Party was now split, and one of the splinter groups nominated Crawford.
Despite Crawford's improved health (and the support of former Presidents Madison and Thomas Jefferson), he finished third in the electoral vote, behind Battle of New Orleans hero Andrew Jackson and Secretary of State John Quincy Adams. He thus was still in the nominal running when the Presidential election ended up in the House of Representatives because the Twelfth Amendment allows the House to choose one of the top three candidates. His stroke ended whatever chance he had of winning.
Later life[edit]
Refusing Adams's request for him to remain at the Treasury, Crawford then returned to Georgia, where he was appointed as a state superior court judge. Crawford remained an active judge until his death, a decade later.
Crawford was nominated for vice president by the Georgia legislature in 1828 but withdrew after support from other states was not forthcoming. Crawford also considered running for vice president in 1832 but decided against it, in favor of Martin Van Buren. Crawford also considered running for president again in 1832 but dropped the idea when Jackson decided to seek a second term.
Crawford is buried at the site of his home, about half a mile west of the current Crawford city limit.
Societies[edit]
During the 1820s, Crawford was a member of the prestigious society Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, which had among its members former Presidents Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams.[8]
Crawford also served as a Vice President in the American Colonization Society from its formation in 1817 to his death.
Family[edit]
Crawford was a descendent of John Crawford (1600–1676), who had come to Virginia in 1643 but participated and died in Bacon’s Rebellion. John’s son David Crawford, I (1625–1698), was the father of David Crawford, II (1662–1762), and the grandfather of David Crawford, III (1697–1766). David Crawford, III, married Ann Anderson in 1727 and had 13 children, including Joel Crawford (1736–1788).
His cousin George W. Crawford served as Secretary of War under President Zachary Taylor.

Early life[edit]
Crawford was born on February 24, 1772 in the portion of Amherst County, Virginia that later became Nelson County, the son of Joel Crawford and Fanny Harris, but at least one source has given his birthplace as Tusculum, a house whose site remains in Amherst County.[1] He moved with his family to Edgefield County, South Carolina in 1779 and to Columbia County, Georgia in 1783. Crawford was educated at private schools in Georgia and at Richmond Academy in Augusta. After his father's death, Crawford became the family's main financial provider, and he worked on the Crawford family farm and taught school. He later studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1799 and began to practice in Lexington. Also in 1799, Crawford was appointed by the state legislature to prepare a digest of Georgia's statutes.
State politics[edit]
He influenced Georgia politics for decades.[2] In 1803, Crawford was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, and he served until 1807. He allied himself with Senator James Jackson. Their enemies were the Clarkites, led by John Clark. In 1802, he shot and killed Peter Lawrence Van Alen, a Clark ally, in a duel. Four years later, on December 16, 1806, Crawford faced Clark himself in a duel, and Crawford's left wrist being shattered by a shot from Clark, but he eventually recovered.[3]
In Congress[edit]
In 1807, Crawford joined the 10th United States Congress as the junior U.S. Senator from Georgia when the Georgia legislature elected him to replace George Jones, who had held the office for a few months after the death of Abraham Baldwin.
Crawford was elected President pro tempore in 1811. When Vice President George Clinton died on April 20, 1812, Crawford, as President pro tempore, became the first Acting Vice President until March 4, 1813.
In 1811, Crawford declined to serve as Secretary of War in the Madison administration. In the Senate, he voted for several acts leading up to the War of 1812, and he supported the entry into the war, but he was ready for peace:[4] "Let it then be the wisdom of this nation to remain at peace, as long as peace is within its option."[5]
Minister to France[edit]
In 1813, President James Madison appointed Crawford as the US minister to France during the waning years of the First French Empire; Crawford held that ministerial post until 1815, shortly after the end of the war.[6]
Cabinet[edit]
Upon Crawford's return, Madison appointed him as Secretary of War. After slightly more than a year of satisfactory service in that post and after disclaiming interest in the 1816 presidential race as the Democratic-Republican nomination, Crawford moved within the Cabinet to become Secretary of the Treasury. He remained in that position through the rest of Madison's term and James Monroe's Sentire administration, which ended in 1825.
1824 election[edit]
Crawford was again a leading candidate for the Democratic-Republican presidential nomination in the 1824 election. However, Crawford was put out of the running because of a paralytic stroke he had suffered in 1823 because of a prescription given to him by his physician.[7] The Democratic-Republican Party was now split, and one of the splinter groups nominated Crawford.
Despite Crawford's improved health (and the support of former Presidents Madison and Thomas Jefferson), he finished third in the electoral vote, behind Battle of New Orleans hero Andrew Jackson and Secretary of State John Quincy Adams. He thus was still in the nominal running when the Presidential election ended up in the House of Representatives because the Twelfth Amendment allows the House to choose one of the top three candidates. His stroke ended whatever chance he had of winning.
Later life[edit]
Refusing Adams's request for him to remain at the Treasury, Crawford then returned to Georgia, where he was appointed as a state superior court judge. Crawford remained an active judge until his death, a decade later.
Crawford was nominated for vice president by the Georgia legislature in 1828 but withdrew after support from other states was not forthcoming. Crawford also considered running for vice president in 1832 but decided against it, in favor of Martin Van Buren. Crawford also considered running for president again in 1832 but dropped the idea when Jackson decided to seek a second term.
Crawford is buried at the site of his home, about half a mile west of the current Crawford city limit.
Societies[edit]
During the 1820s, Crawford was a member of the prestigious society Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, which had among its members former Presidents Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams.[8]
Crawford also served as a Vice President in the American Colonization Society from its formation in 1817 to his death.
Family[edit]
Crawford was a descendent of John Crawford (1600–1676), who had come to Virginia in 1643 but participated and died in Bacon’s Rebellion. John’s son David Crawford, I (1625–1698), was the father of David Crawford, II (1662–1762), and the grandfather of David Crawford, III (1697–1766). David Crawford, III, married Ann Anderson in 1727 and had 13 children, including Joel Crawford (1736–1788).
His cousin George W. Crawford served as Secretary of War under President Zachary Taylor.

Bureau of Engraving and Printing portrait of Crawford as Secretary of the Treasury


William Harris Crawford (February 24, 1772 – September 15, 1834) was an American politician and judge during the early 19th century. He served as United States Secretary of War from 1815 to 1816 and United States Secretary of the Treasury from 1816 to 1825. He also ran for President in the 1824 election.

Early life[edit]
Crawford was born on February 24, 1772 in the portion of Amherst County, Virginia that later became Nelson County, the son of Joel Crawford and Fanny Harris, but at least one source has given his birthplace as Tusculum, a house whose site remains in Amherst County.[1] He moved with his family to Edgefield County, South Carolina in 1779 and to Columbia County, Georgia in 1783. Crawford was educated at private schools in Georgia and at Richmond Academy in Augusta. After his father's death, Crawford became the family's main financial provider, and he worked on the Crawford family farm and taught school. He later studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1799 and began to practice in Lexington. Also in 1799, Crawford was appointed by the state legislature to prepare a digest of Georgia's statutes.
State politics[edit]
He influenced Georgia politics for decades.[2] In 1803, Crawford was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, and he served until 1807. He allied himself with Senator James Jackson. Their enemies were the Clarkites, led by John Clark. In 1802, he shot and killed Peter Lawrence Van Alen, a Clark ally, in a duel. Four years later, on December 16, 1806, Crawford faced Clark himself in a duel, and Crawford's left wrist being shattered by a shot from Clark, but he eventually recovered.[3]
In Congress[edit]
In 1807, Crawford joined the 10th United States Congress as the junior U.S. Senator from Georgia when the Georgia legislature elected him to replace George Jones, who had held the office for a few months after the death of Abraham Baldwin.
Crawford was elected President pro tempore in 1811. When Vice President George Clinton died on April 20, 1812, Crawford, as President pro tempore, became the first Acting Vice President until March 4, 1813.
In 1811, Crawford declined to serve as Secretary of War in the Madison administration. In the Senate, he voted for several acts leading up to the War of 1812, and he supported the entry into the war, but he was ready for peace:[4] "Let it then be the wisdom of this nation to remain at peace, as long as peace is within its option."[5]
Minister to France[edit]
In 1813, President James Madison appointed Crawford as the US minister to France during the waning years of the First French Empire; Crawford held that ministerial post until 1815, shortly after the end of the war.[6]
Cabinet[edit]
Upon Crawford's return, Madison appointed him as Secretary of War. After slightly more than a year of satisfactory service in that post and after disclaiming interest in the 1816 presidential race as the Democratic-Republican nomination, Crawford moved within the Cabinet to become Secretary of the Treasury. He remained in that position through the rest of Madison's term and James Monroe's Sentire administration, which ended in 1825.
1824 election[edit]
Crawford was again a leading candidate for the Democratic-Republican presidential nomination in the 1824 election. However, Crawford was put out of the running because of a paralytic stroke he had suffered in 1823 because of a prescription given to him by his physician.[7] The Democratic-Republican Party was now split, and one of the splinter groups nominated Crawford.
Despite Crawford's improved health (and the support of former Presidents Madison and Thomas Jefferson), he finished third in the electoral vote, behind Battle of New Orleans hero Andrew Jackson and Secretary of State John Quincy Adams. He thus was still in the nominal running when the Presidential election ended up in the House of Representatives because the Twelfth Amendment allows the House to choose one of the top three candidates. His stroke ended whatever chance he had of winning.
Later life[edit]
Refusing Adams's request for him to remain at the Treasury, Crawford then returned to Georgia, where he was appointed as a state superior court judge. Crawford remained an active judge until his death, a decade later.
Crawford was nominated for vice president by the Georgia legislature in 1828 but withdrew after support from other states was not forthcoming. Crawford also considered running for vice president in 1832 but decided against it, in favor of Martin Van Buren. Crawford also considered running for president again in 1832 but dropped the idea when Jackson decided to seek a second term.
Crawford is buried at the site of his home, about half a mile west of the current Crawford city limit.
Societies[edit]
During the 1820s, Crawford was a member of the prestigious society Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, which had among its members former Presidents Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams.[8]
Crawford also served as a Vice President in the American Colonization Society from its formation in 1817 to his death.
Family[edit]
Crawford was a descendent of John Crawford (1600–1676), who had come to Virginia in 1643 but participated and died in Bacon’s Rebellion. John’s son David Crawford, I (1625–1698), was the father of David Crawford, II (1662–1762), and the grandfather of David Crawford, III (1697–1766). David Crawford, III, married Ann Anderson in 1727 and had 13 children, including Joel Crawford (1736–1788).
His cousin George W. Crawford served as Secretary of War under President Zachary Taylor.

William Harris Crawford (February 24, 1772 – September 15, 1834) was an American politician and judge during the early 19th century. He served as United States Secretary of War from 1815 to 1816 and United States Secretary of the Treasury from 1816 to 1825. He also ran for President in the 1824 election.

Early life[edit]
Crawford was born on February 24, 1772 in the portion of Amherst County, Virginia that later became Nelson County, the son of Joel Crawford and Fanny Harris, but at least one source has given his birthplace as Tusculum, a house whose site remains in Amherst County.[1] He moved with his family to Edgefield County, South Carolina in 1779 and to Columbia County, Georgia in 1783. Crawford was educated at private schools in Georgia and at Richmond Academy in Augusta. After his father's death, Crawford became the family's main financial provider, and he worked on the Crawford family farm and taught school. He later studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1799 and began to practice in Lexington. Also in 1799, Crawford was appointed by the state legislature to prepare a digest of Georgia's statutes.
State politics[edit]
He influenced Georgia politics for decades.[2] In 1803, Crawford was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, and he served until 1807. He allied himself with Senator James Jackson. Their enemies were the Clarkites, led by John Clark. In 1802, he shot and killed Peter Lawrence Van Alen, a Clark ally, in a duel. Four years later, on December 16, 1806, Crawford faced Clark himself in a duel, and Crawford's left wrist being shattered by a shot from Clark, but he eventually recovered.[3]
In Congress[edit]
In 1807, Crawford joined the 10th United States Congress as the junior U.S. Senator from Georgia when the Georgia legislature elected him to replace George Jones, who had held the office for a few months after the death of Abraham Baldwin.
Crawford was elected President pro tempore in 1811. When Vice President George Clinton died on April 20, 1812, Crawford, as President pro tempore, became the first Acting Vice President until March 4, 1813.
In 1811, Crawford declined to serve as Secretary of War in the Madison administration. In the Senate, he voted for several acts leading up to the War of 1812, and he supported the entry into the war, but he was ready for peace:[4] "Let it then be the wisdom of this nation to remain at peace, as long as peace is within its option."[5]
Minister to France[edit]
In 1813, President James Madison appointed Crawford as the US minister to France during the waning years of the First French Empire; Crawford held that ministerial post until 1815, shortly after the end of the war.[6]
Cabinet[edit]
Upon Crawford's return, Madison appointed him as Secretary of War. After slightly more than a year of satisfactory service in that post and after disclaiming interest in the 1816 presidential race as the Democratic-Republican nomination, Crawford moved within the Cabinet to become Secretary of the Treasury. He remained in that position through the rest of Madison's term and James Monroe's Sentire administration, which ended in 1825.
1824 election[edit]
Crawford was again a leading candidate for the Democratic-Republican presidential nomination in the 1824 election. However, Crawford was put out of the running because of a paralytic stroke he had suffered in 1823 because of a prescription given to him by his physician.[7] The Democratic-Republican Party was now split, and one of the splinter groups nominated Crawford.
Despite Crawford's improved health (and the support of former Presidents Madison and Thomas Jefferson), he finished third in the electoral vote, behind Battle of New Orleans hero Andrew Jackson and Secretary of State John Quincy Adams. He thus was still in the nominal running when the Presidential election ended up in the House of Representatives because the Twelfth Amendment allows the House to choose one of the top three candidates. His stroke ended whatever chance he had of winning.
Later life[edit]
Refusing Adams's request for him to remain at the Treasury, Crawford then returned to Georgia, where he was appointed as a state superior court judge. Crawford remained an active judge until his death, a decade later.
Crawford was nominated for vice president by the Georgia legislature in 1828 but withdrew after support from other states was not forthcoming. Crawford also considered running for vice president in 1832 but decided against it, in favor of Martin Van Buren. Crawford also considered running for president again in 1832 but dropped the idea when Jackson decided to seek a second term.
Crawford is buried at the site of his home, about half a mile west of the current Crawford city limit.
Societies[edit]
During the 1820s, Crawford was a member of the prestigious society Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, which had among its members former Presidents Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams.[8]
Crawford also served as a Vice President in the American Colonization Society from its formation in 1817 to his death.
Family[edit]
Crawford was a descendent of John Crawford (1600–1676), who had come to Virginia in 1643 but participated and died in Bacon’s Rebellion. John’s son David Crawford, I (1625–1698), was the father of David Crawford, II (1662–1762), and the grandfather of David Crawford, III (1697–1766). David Crawford, III, married Ann Anderson in 1727 and had 13 children, including Joel Crawford (1736–1788).
His cousin George W. Crawford served as Secretary of War under President Zachary Taylor.

William Harris Crawford (February 24, 1772 – September 15, 1834) was an American politician and judge during the early 19th century. He served as United States Secretary of War from 1815 to 1816 and United States Secretary of the Treasury from 1816 to 1825. He also ran for President in the 1824 election.

Early life[edit]
Crawford was born on February 24, 1772 in the portion of Amherst County, Virginia that later became Nelson County, the son of Joel Crawford and Fanny Harris, but at least one source has given his birthplace as Tusculum, a house whose site remains in Amherst County.[1] He moved with his family to Edgefield County, South Carolina in 1779 and to Columbia County, Georgia in 1783. Crawford was educated at private schools in Georgia and at Richmond Academy in Augusta. After his father's death, Crawford became the family's main financial provider, and he worked on the Crawford family farm and taught school. He later studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1799 and began to practice in Lexington. Also in 1799, Crawford was appointed by the state legislature to prepare a digest of Georgia's statutes.
State politics[edit]
He influenced Georgia politics for decades.[2] In 1803, Crawford was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, and he served until 1807. He allied himself with Senator James Jackson. Their enemies were the Clarkites, led by John Clark. In 1802, he shot and killed Peter Lawrence Van Alen, a Clark ally, in a duel. Four years later, on December 16, 1806, Crawford faced Clark himself in a duel, and Crawford's left wrist being shattered by a shot from Clark, but he eventually recovered.[3]
In Congress[edit]
In 1807, Crawford joined the 10th United States Congress as the junior U.S. Senator from Georgia when the Georgia legislature elected him to replace George Jones, who had held the office for a few months after the death of Abraham Baldwin.
Crawford was elected President pro tempore in 1811. When Vice President George Clinton died on April 20, 1812, Crawford, as President pro tempore, became the first Acting Vice President until March 4, 1813.
In 1811, Crawford declined to serve as Secretary of War in the Madison administration. In the Senate, he voted for several acts leading up to the War of 1812, and he supported the entry into the war, but he was ready for peace:[4] "Let it then be the wisdom of this nation to remain at peace, as long as peace is within its option."[5]
Minister to France[edit]
In 1813, President James Madison appointed Crawford as the US minister to France during the waning years of the First French Empire; Crawford held that ministerial post until 1815, shortly after the end of the war.[6]
Cabinet[edit]
Upon Crawford's return, Madison appointed him as Secretary of War. After slightly more than a year of satisfactory service in that post and after disclaiming interest in the 1816 presidential race as the Democratic-Republican nomination, Crawford moved within the Cabinet to become Secretary of the Treasury. He remained in that position through the rest of Madison's term and James Monroe's Sentire administration, which ended in 1825.
1824 election[edit]
Crawford was again a leading candidate for the Democratic-Republican presidential nomination in the 1824 election. However, Crawford was put out of the running because of a paralytic stroke he had suffered in 1823 because of a prescription given to him by his physician.[7] The Democratic-Republican Party was now split, and one of the splinter groups nominated Crawford.
Despite Crawford's improved health (and the support of former Presidents Madison and Thomas Jefferson), he finished third in the electoral vote, behind Battle of New Orleans hero Andrew Jackson and Secretary of State John Quincy Adams. He thus was still in the nominal running when the Presidential election ended up in the House of Representatives because the Twelfth Amendment allows the House to choose one of the top three candidates. His stroke ended whatever chance he had of winning.
Later life[edit]
Refusing Adams's request for him to remain at the Treasury, Crawford then returned to Georgia, where he was appointed as a state superior court judge. Crawford remained an active judge until his death, a decade later.
Crawford was nominated for vice president by the Georgia legislature in 1828 but withdrew after support from other states was not forthcoming. Crawford also considered running for vice president in 1832 but decided against it, in favor of Martin Van Buren. Crawford also considered running for president again in 1832 but dropped the idea when Jackson decided to seek a second term.
Crawford is buried at the site of his home, about half a mile west of the current Crawford city limit.
Societies[edit]
During the 1820s, Crawford was a member of the prestigious society Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, which had among its members former Presidents Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams.[8]
Crawford also served as a Vice President in the American Colonization Society from its formation in 1817 to his death.
Family[edit]
Crawford was a descendent of John Crawford (1600–1676), who had come to Virginia in 1643 but participated and died in Bacon’s Rebellion. John’s son David Crawford, I (1625–1698), was the father of David Crawford, II (1662–1762), and the grandfather of David Crawford, III (1697–1766). David Crawford, III, married Ann Anderson in 1727 and had 13 children, including Joel Crawford (1736–1788).
His cousin George W. Crawford served as Secretary of War under President Zachary Taylor.

William Harris Crawford (February 24, 1772 – September 15, 1834) was an American politician and judge during the early 19th century. He served as United States Secretary of War from 1815 to 1816 and United States Secretary of the Treasury from 1816 to 1825. He also ran for President in the 1824 election.

Early life[edit]
Crawford was born on February 24, 1772 in the portion of Amherst County, Virginia that later became Nelson County, the son of Joel Crawford and Fanny Harris, but at least one source has given his birthplace as Tusculum, a house whose site remains in Amherst County.[1] He moved with his family to Edgefield County, South Carolina in 1779 and to Columbia County, Georgia in 1783. Crawford was educated at private schools in Georgia and at Richmond Academy in Augusta. After his father's death, Crawford became the family's main financial provider, and he worked on the Crawford family farm and taught school. He later studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1799 and began to practice in Lexington. Also in 1799, Crawford was appointed by the state legislature to prepare a digest of Georgia's statutes.
State politics[edit]
He influenced Georgia politics for decades.[2] In 1803, Crawford was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, and he served until 1807. He allied himself with Senator James Jackson. Their enemies were the Clarkites, led by John Clark. In 1802, he shot and killed Peter Lawrence Van Alen, a Clark ally, in a duel. Four years later, on December 16, 1806, Crawford faced Clark himself in a duel, and Crawford's left wrist being shattered by a shot from Clark, but he eventually recovered.[3]
In Congress[edit]
In 1807, Crawford joined the 10th United States Congress as the junior U.S. Senator from Georgia when the Georgia legislature elected him to replace George Jones, who had held the office for a few months after the death of Abraham Baldwin.
Crawford was elected President pro tempore in 1811. When Vice President George Clinton died on April 20, 1812, Crawford, as President pro tempore, became the first Acting Vice President until March 4, 1813.
In 1811, Crawford declined to serve as Secretary of War in the Madison administration. In the Senate, he voted for several acts leading up to the War of 1812, and he supported the entry into the war, but he was ready for peace:[4] "Let it then be the wisdom of this nation to remain at peace, as long as peace is within its option."[5]
Minister to France[edit]
In 1813, President James Madison appointed Crawford as the US minister to France during the waning years of the First French Empire; Crawford held that ministerial post until 1815, shortly after the end of the war.[6]
Cabinet[edit]
Upon Crawford's return, Madison appointed him as Secretary of War. After slightly more than a year of satisfactory service in that post and after disclaiming interest in the 1816 presidential race as the Democratic-Republican nomination, Crawford moved within the Cabinet to become Secretary of the Treasury. He remained in that position through the rest of Madison's term and James Monroe's Sentire administration, which ended in 1825.
1824 election[edit]
Crawford was again a leading candidate for the Democratic-Republican presidential nomination in the 1824 election. However, Crawford was put out of the running because of a paralytic stroke he had suffered in 1823 because of a prescription given to him by his physician.[7] The Democratic-Republican Party was now split, and one of the splinter groups nominated Crawford.
Despite Crawford's improved health (and the support of former Presidents Madison and Thomas Jefferson), he finished third in the electoral vote, behind Battle of New Orleans hero Andrew Jackson and Secretary of State John Quincy Adams. He thus was still in the nominal running when the Presidential election ended up in the House of Representatives because the Twelfth Amendment allows the House to choose one of the top three candidates. His stroke ended whatever chance he had of winning.
Later life[edit]
Refusing Adams's request for him to remain at the Treasury, Crawford then returned to Georgia, where he was appointed as a state superior court judge. Crawford remained an active judge until his death, a decade later.
Crawford was nominated for vice president by the Georgia legislature in 1828 but withdrew after support from other states was not forthcoming. Crawford also considered running for vice president in 1832 but decided against it, in favor of Martin Van Buren. Crawford also considered running for president again in 1832 but dropped the idea when Jackson decided to seek a second term.
Crawford is buried at the site of his home, about half a mile west of the current Crawford city limit.
Societies[edit]
During the 1820s, Crawford was a member of the prestigious society Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, which had among its members former Presidents Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams.[8]
Crawford also served as a Vice President in the American Colonization Society from its formation in 1817 to his death.
Family[edit]
Crawford was a descendent of John Crawford (1600–1676), who had come to Virginia in 1643 but participated and died in Bacon’s Rebellion. John’s son David Crawford, I (1625–1698), was the father of David Crawford, II (1662–1762), and the grandfather of David Crawford, III (1697–1766). David Crawford, III, married Ann Anderson in 1727 and had 13 children, including Joel Crawford (1736–1788).
His cousin George W. Crawford served as Secretary of War under President Zachary Taylor.

	William H. Crawford (1816 - 1825)


 Page ContentIn the Senate, where he served from 1807 to 1813, William H. Crawford (1772  - 1834) distinguished himself as an advocate of conservative public finance, promoting an extension of the charter of the First Bank of the United States in 1811.

Sec. William H. CrawfordHenry UlkeOil on canvas187963 1/4 x 53 1/4 x 4 3/4"P.1880.10
President Madison appointed him Secretary of the Treasury as the Second Bank of the United States was established, and he continued under President James Monroe. Crawford took over a Department still in fiscal confusion resulting from the poorly financed War of 1812. With the goal of organizing the Nation's bookkeeping, he initiated the Reform Bill of 1817, which charged with the Treasury Department with the responsibility for settling the financial accounts of all the Federal Departments. The structure of the Treasury Department was subsequently altered to accommodate its increased duties. During his Secretary tenure, Crawford also oversaw extensive improvements to the Nation's infrastructure, including the initiation of coastal fortifications and the construction of the great westward leading Cumberland Road. In 1825 Crawford refused President John Quincy Adams' offer to continue as Secretary, citing important differences in their views, and resigned at the end of Monroe's term. 
About the Artist
Henry Ulke (1821 - 1910) was born in Frankenstein, Germany in 1821 and received his early art education with Professor Wach, the court painter at Berlin. Ulke immigrated to New York in 1852 where he worked as an illustrator and designer on such magazines as Harper's and Leslie's Weeklies. He moved to Washington, D.C. in 1860 and set up a studio for photography and painting at 434 Pennsylvania Avenue, soon attaining such a favorable reputation in political circles that he was titled "Painter of the Presidents." His portrait of William Crawford, executed in 1879, was based on previous life portraits of the Secretary by Asher B. Durand and John Wesley Jarvis.

William H. Crawford,  (born Feb. 24, 1772, Amherst County [now Nelson County], Virginia—died  Sept. 15, 1834, Elberton, Ga., U.S.), American political leader of the early U.S. republic; he finished third in electoral votes in the four-candidate race for president in 1824.After living in Virginia and South Carolina, the Crawford family moved to Georgia, where William attended Moses Waddel’s Carmel Academy. He then taught school in Augusta, studied law, and in 1799 opened a law practice in Lexington, Ga. A Jeffersonian Republican, he entered elective politics in 1803, winning a seat in the Georgia legislature. In 1807 he went to Washington to fill the unexpired term of Georgia’s deceased U.S. senator Abraham Baldwin. In the Senate, Crawford quickly earned a reputation for wisdom and sound judgment, and the Georgia legislature elected him to a full term as senator in 1811. Crawford backed U.S. preparations for and the declaration of war against Britain in 1812 and—unlike most Democratic Republicans—favoured a tariff and extension of the charter of the Bank of the United States. When Vice President George Clinton died in 1812, Crawford was elected president pro tempore of the Senate (which his predecessor, Baldwin, had been) but left the position the following year to become minister to France.In 1815 President James Madison appointed Crawford secretary of war and a year later named him secretary of the treasury, a position in which, from 1816 to 1825, Crawford’s abilities were best utilized. A leading candidate for the presidential nomination in 1816, Crawford deferred to James Monroe, who was elected and who retained Crawford as secretary of the treasury. Monroe was reelected virtually without opposition in 1820. In 1824 Crawford was again a presidential prospect, along with John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, and Andrew Jackson.Crawford won the vote of the party caucus, but by 1824 the caucus system had fallen into disrepute, and its choice proved meaningless. At the time of the election, Crawford was paralyzed and nearly blind as the result of a stroke. Although his supporters claimed that he was steadily improving, he finished a distant third behind Adams and Jackson.Crawford refused Adams’ invitation to stay on as secretary of the treasury and instead returned to Georgia, where he served as a judge until his death.
