Investment Objective
The fund's goals are preservation of capital, liquidity, and, consistent with these, the highest possible current income.
Strategy
The fund invests in high-quality, short-term securities with maturities of 13 months or less.







							Risk/Reward Potential**
						


						Click on the risk/reward spectrum below to view the funds in that category
					









Higher
Moderate
Lower






















The fund offers a relatively secure, liquid investment for money you may need for occasional or unexpected expenses and for money awaiting investment in longer-term bond or stock funds.  In addition to preserving capital, the fund seeks to provide the highest possible income available from low-risk, short-term securities.

You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.

					**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.

Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis.  A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. 
If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. 
When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.


Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.

When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.

All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal.  Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk.  Please consult the funds' prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds' risks.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details.

The mutual funds referred to in this website are offered and sold only to persons residing in the United States and are offered by prospectus only. The prospectuses include investment objectives, risks, fees, expenses, and other information that you should read and consider carefully before investing.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

*144 of our 330 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 3/31/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 122 of these 144 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 204 of 311 (66%), 175 of 213, 140 of 178 (79%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 3/31/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
24 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 3/31/17 (includes all share classes). 23 of these 24 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 35 of 36, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 3/31/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 168 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 3/31/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details. 
Past performance cannot guarantee future results. All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal. Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.
Based on cumulative total return, 174 of 232 (75%), 142 of 160 (89%), 115 of 127 (91%), and 105 of 114 (92%) T. Rowe Price stock funds (including all share classes and excluding funds used in insurance products) outperformed their Lipper averages for the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)

1Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
*The principal value of the Retirement Funds and Target Funds (collectively, the "target date funds") is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The target date funds' allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The Retirement Funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term retirement withdrawal horizon. The Target Funds emphasize asset accumulation prior to retirement, balance the need for reduced market risk and income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a moderate postretirement withdrawal horizon. The target date funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The key difference between the Retirement Funds and the Target Funds is the overall allocation to equity; although they each maintain significant allocations to equities both prior to and after the target date, the Retirement Funds maintain a higher equity allocation, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

*144 of our 330 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 3/31/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 122 of these 144 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 204 of 311 (66%), 175 of 213, 140 of 178 (79%), of T.

The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details. 
Past performance cannot guarantee future results. All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal. Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.
Based on cumulative total return, 174 of 232 (75%), 142 of 160 (89%), 115 of 127 (91%), and 105 of 114 (92%) T. Rowe Price stock funds (including all share classes and excluding funds used in insurance products) outperformed their Lipper averages for the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)

1Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
*The principal value of the Retirement Funds and Target Funds (collectively, the "target date funds") is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The target date funds' allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The Retirement Funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term retirement withdrawal horizon. The Target Funds emphasize asset accumulation prior to retirement, balance the need for reduced market risk and income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a moderate postretirement withdrawal horizon. The target date funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The key difference between the Retirement Funds and the Target Funds is the overall allocation to equity; although they each maintain significant allocations to equities both prior to and after the target date, the Retirement Funds maintain a higher equity allocation, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

Log in to your account at troweprice.com for more information.Manager�s Letter Fellow ShareholdersMoney market yields remained low throughout the year ended May 31, 2016. The second half of our fiscal year was notable, however, because the Federal Reserve made the first change to its monetary policy in seven years. At the December meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank raised its target for short-term interest rates to a range of 0.25% to 0.50% from a previous range of 0.00% to 0.25%. Since that time, the Fed has delayed subsequent rate
increases due to concerns about global economic weakness. Given global market uncertainty, slowing employment growth, and low inflation, we believe that future rate increases will be slow in coming.ECONOMY AND INTEREST RATESThe U.S. economy expanded over the last year, though the headline growth rate has been decelerating with each passing quarter. While first-quarter gross domestic product growth in 2016 was measured at a sluggish 0.8% rate, according to the most recent estimate, we believe growth is likely to rebound over the balance of the year. The job growth trend has been slowing in recent months, but other labor market indicators have been resilient over the last year, particularly in the face of unfavorable economic developments overseas. The national unemployment rate dropped to 4.7% in May, a level not seen since late 2007, though a declining labor force
served to mute this good news.Broad measures of inflation have been very low due to declining prices of oil and other commodities�which is a plus for consumers and many businesses�but core inflation, which excludes food and energy costs, is beginning to turn higher. When the Fed raised short-term rates in December, Fed officials acknowledged the strong labor market, expressed confidence that inflation will rise to the Fed�s 2% objective, and cited the need to be proactive because of the usual lagged response of monetary policy changes. Due to the slowdown in economic activity and global risks, however, the central bank has kept rates unchanged thus far in 2016.
MONEY MARKET REVIEW
Because of the Fed�s December rate
increase, other money market rates that depend on the fed funds target rate have
increased commensurately. Three-month LIBOR, for example, rose from 0.42% to
0.69% over the last six months. Higher LIBOR rates allow money funds to invest
in debt issued by banks and corporations at more attractive rates. Interest
rates on municipal variable rate securities eventually moved higher, too.
Three-month Treasury bill yields rose from 0.22% to 0.34% over the last six
months, even with the persistent demand for short-term, high-quality assets
spurred by new money fund regulations. One-year Treasury bill yields began the
most recent six-month period at 0.51% and oscillated in the 0.40% to 0.70% range
before ending the period at 0.68%. The overwhelming demand for, and smaller
supply of, these high-quality investments has kept the Treasury yield curve very
flat. Notwithstanding the low rates, the funds continue to hold Treasuries for
their liquidity and diversification benefits.
PORTFOLIO REVIEW
T. Rowe Price Reserve Investment
Fund
The fund returned 0.19% in its fiscal year
versus 0.23% for the Lipper Institutional Money Market Funds Index. Fund
performance reflects ultralow expenses and a very
low interest rate environment for money market securities.
As you may know, the Reserve Investment
Fund will be changing its investment mandate to that of a government money
market fund, with a new name�T. Rowe Price Government Reserve Fund�to reflect
this. Effectively, this will limit the fund�s investments to include U.S.
Treasuries and U.S. government debt, as well as
repurchase agreements backed by similar collateral. As nongovernment debt
positions mature, we are moving the fund away from its current mandate and
toward its future mandate, which becomes effective August 1, 2016. This mandate
change, made in response to SEC rule changes, allows the fund to retain the attractive features our investors have enjoyed,
including a net asset value (NAV) managed to stay at $1.00 per share and a focus
on liquidity and stability of principal. Our hope is that this mandate change
will not disrupt existing shareholders.
As of May 31, 2016, about 71% of the
fund�s assets were invested in Treasury securities and other obligations of the
U.S. government and its agencies, while repurchase agreements represented
about 18%. The remaining assets were invested
primarily in commercial paper and medium-term notes. In keeping with the
liquidity needs of the fund, and in anticipation of rising short-term rates, we
are maintaining a conservative posture with regards to maturity. The bulk of our
purchases have a weighted average maturity of 60 days or less.
T. Rowe Price Government Reserve
Investment FundThe fund returned 0.17%
during its fiscal year versus 0.06% for the Lipper Institutional U.S. Treasury
Money Market Funds Index. Fund performance reflects ultralow expenses and
investments in government-backed short-term securities that offered the highest
yields in a very low interest rate environment.
As you may know, the Government Reserve
Investment Fund will be changing its name to T. Rowe Price Treasury Reserve
Fund, effective August 1, 2016. While this name change is made in response to
SEC money fund rule changes, investors will see virtually no change in the way
we manage the fund. As a government money market fund under the new SEC rules, it will invest almost exclusively in U.S. Treasuries
and U.S. government debt, as well as repurchase agreements backed by similar
collateral. Also, it will retain the attractive features our investors have enjoyed, including a net asset value (NAV)
managed to stay at $1.00 per share and a focus on liquidity and stability of
principal.
As of May 31, 2016, about 41% of fund
assets were invested in repurchase agreements, while the remainder was invested
primarily in U.S. Treasury notes and bills. In keeping with the liquidity needs
of the fund, and in anticipation of rising short-term rates, we are maintaining
a conservative posture with regards to maturity.
The bulk of our purchases have a weighted average maturity of 60 days or
less.
OUTLOOK
While the timing of the Fed�s next move is
still unclear, we continue to believe that Fed rate hikes will be gradual.
Recent statements from Fed officials indicate that they are motivated to raise
rates if the data indicate it is necessary. The Fed, by its own admission, is
cognizant of the global markets� ability to impact the U.S. economy, so Fed
officials are keeping a watchful eye on global forces as
they make their decisions. Therefore, we are maintaining weighted average
maturities that are near those of our average competitors to take advantage of
higher rates when they come.
As always, we thank you for investing with
T. Rowe Price.

The Reserve Investment Fund and Government
Reserve Investment Fund are not available for direct purchase by members of the
public, and their shares are offered solely to institutional investors pursuant
to an exemption from the registration requirements under the federal securities
law. The investment in either fund is generally made by T. Rowe Price on behalf
of its mutual funds and institutional clients. The disclosure of either of the

to purchase shares of the fund.
RISKS OF INVESTING IN MONEY MARKET
SECURITIES
You could lose money by investing in
the funds. Although the funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at
$1.00 per share, they cannot guarantee they will do so. An investment in the
funds is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
or any other government agency. The funds� sponsor has no legal obligation to
provide financial support to the funds, and you should not expect that the
sponsor will provide financial support to the funds at any time.

Lipper indexes: Fund benchmarks that consist of a small number (10 to 30) of
the largest mutual funds in a particular category as tracked by Lipper
Inc.
Repurchase agreement
(repo): A form of short-term borrowing using
collateral in which a bank or broker-dealer sells government securities to
another party, such as the Federal Reserve, and commits to buy them back at a
fixed price on a future date, usually within a week.
SEC yield (7-day
simple): A method of calculating a money
fund�s yield by annualizing the fund�s net investment income for the last seven
days of each period divided by the fund�s net asset value at the end of the
period. Yield will vary and is not guaranteed. 
Weighted average life: A measure of a fund�s credit quality risk. In general, the
longer the average life, the greater the fund�s credit quality risk. The average
life is the dollar-weighted average maturity of a portfolio�s individual
securities without taking into account interest rate readjustment dates. Money
funds must maintain a weighted average life of less than 120 days.
Weighted average
maturity: A measure of a fund�s interest rate
sensitivity. In general, the longer the average maturity, the greater the fund�s
sensitivity to interest rate changes. The weighted average maturity may take
into account the interest rate readjustment dates for certain securities. Money
funds must maintain a weighted average maturity of less than 60
days.

Fund
  Expense Example
As a mutual fund shareholder, you may
incur two types of costs: (1) transaction costs, such as redemption fees or
sales loads, and (2) ongoing costs, including management fees, distribution and
service (12b-1) fees, and other fund expenses. The following example is intended
to help you understand your ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the fund
and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual
funds. The example is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning
of the most recent six-month period and held for the entire period.
Actual ExpensesThe first line of the following table (Actual) provides
information about actual account values and expenses based on the fund�s actual
returns. You may use the information on this line, together with your account
balance, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period. Simply divide
your account value by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600 account value divided by
$1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number on the first line under
the heading �Expenses Paid During Period� to estimate the expenses you paid on
your account during this period.
Hypothetical Example for Comparison
PurposesThe information on the second
line of the table (Hypothetical) is based on hypothetical account values and
expenses derived from the fund�s actual expense ratio and an assumed 5% per year
rate of return before expenses (not the fund�s actual return). You may compare
the ongoing costs of investing in the fund with other funds by contrasting this
5% hypothetical example and the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the
shareholder reports of the other funds. The hypothetical account values and
expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or
expenses you paid for the period.
Note: T. Rowe Price charges an annual account service fee of $20, generally
for accounts with less than $10,000. The fee is waived for any investor whose T.
Rowe Price mutual fund accounts total $50,000 or more; accounts electing to
receive electronic delivery of account statements, transaction confirmations,
prospectuses, and shareholder reports; or accounts of an investor who is a T.
Rowe Price Preferred Services, Personal Services, or Enhanced Personal Services
client (enrollment in these programs generally requires T. Rowe Price assets of
at least $100,000). This fee is not included in the accompanying table. If you
are subject to the fee, keep it in mind when you are estimating the ongoing
expenses of investing in the fund and when comparing the expenses of this fund
with other funds.
You should also be aware that the expenses
shown in the table highlight only your ongoing costs and do not reflect any
transaction costs, such as redemption fees or sales loads. Therefore, the second
line of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only and will not help
you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds. To the extent
a fund charges transaction costs, however, the total cost of owning that fund is
higher.

T. Rowe Price Reserve Investment Funds







Notes to
  Financial Statements
T. Rowe Price Reserve Investment Funds,
Inc. (the corporation), is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940
(the 1940 Act) as a diversified, open-end management investment company. T. Rowe
Price Reserve Investment Fund (Reserve Fund) and T. Rowe Price Government
Reserve Investment Fund (Government Reserve Fund) are two portfolios
(collectively, the funds) established by the corporation and both incepted
on August
25, 1997. The funds are offered as cash management options to mutual funds,
trusts, and other accounts managed by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. (Price
Associates) and/or its affiliates and are not available for direct purchase by
members of the public. The funds seek to maximize preservation of capital,
liquidity, and, consistent with these goals, the highest possible current
income. Each fund operates in compliance with Rule 2a-7 under the 1940
Act.
In accordance with amendments to rules
governing money market funds under the 1940 Act (amendments) and as approved by
each fund�s Board, each fund intends to operate as a government money market
fund and Government Reserve Fund will continue to operate with a government
mandate. On August 1, 2016, the Reserve Fund will change its name to the T. Rowe
Price Government Reserve Fund and will adopt a policy to, under normal
conditions, invest at least 80% of its net assets in U.S. government securities
and repurchase agreements that are collateralized by U.S. government securities
or cash. On August 1, 2016, the Government Reserve Fund will change its name to
the T. Rowe Price Treasury Reserve Fund; the fund�s principal investment
strategies will remain the same. On October 14, 2016, each fund will also adopt
a policy to invest at least 99.5% of its total assets in cash, U.S. government
securities, and/or repurchase agreements that are collateralized by U.S.
government securities or cash. Each fund will generally continue to value its
securities at amortized cost and transact at a stable $1.00 NAV. The amendments
do not require government money market funds to, and neither fund has the
intention to voluntarily, impose liquidity fees on redemptions or temporarily
suspend redemptions.
NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
Basis of Preparation Each fund is an investment company and follows accounting and
reporting guidance in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 946 (ASC 946). The
accompanying financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of
America (GAAP), including but not limited to ASC 946. GAAP requires the use of
estimates made by management. Management believes that estimates and valuations
are appropriate; however, actual results may differ from those estimates, and
the valuations reflected in the accompanying financial statements may differ
from the value ultimately realized upon sale or
maturity.
Investment Transactions, Investment
Income, and Distributions Income and expenses
are recorded on the accrual basis. Premiums and discounts on debt securities are
amortized for financial reporting purposes. Income tax-related interest and
penalties, if incurred, would be recorded as income tax expense. Investment
transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and losses are
reported on the identified cost basis. Distributions to shareholders are
recorded on the ex-dividend date. Income distributions are declared daily and
paid monthly.
New Accounting Guidance
In June 2014, FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-11, Transfers
and Servicing (Topic 860), Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase
Financings, and Disclosures. The ASU changes
the accounting for certain repurchase agreements and expands disclosure
requirements related to repurchase agreements, securities lending,
repurchase-to-maturity and similar transactions. The ASU is effective for
interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014. Adoption
had no effect on the funds� net assets or results of operations.
NOTE 2 - VALUATION
Each fund�s financial instruments are
valued and its net asset value (NAV) per share is computed at the close of the
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), normally 4 p.m. ET, each day the NYSE is open
for business. Each fund�s financial instruments are reported at fair value,
which GAAP defines as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date. The T. Rowe Price Valuation Committee (the Valuation
Committee) has been established by the funds� Board of Directors (the Board) to
ensure that financial instruments are appropriately priced at fair value in
accordance with GAAP and the 1940 Act. Subject to oversight by the Board, the
Valuation Committee develops and oversees pricing-related policies and
procedures and approves all fair value determinations.
Various valuation techniques and inputs
are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments. GAAP establishes
the following fair value hierarchy that categorizes the inputs used to measure
fair value:
Level 1 � quoted prices (unadjusted) in
active markets for identical financial instruments that the fund can access at
the reporting date
Level 2 � inputs other than Level 1 quoted
prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly (including, but not
limited to, quoted prices for similar financial instruments in active markets,
quoted prices for identical or similar financial instruments in inactive
markets, interest rates and yield curves, implied volatilities, and credit
spreads)
Level 3 � unobservable inputs
Observable inputs are developed using
market data, such as publicly available information about actual events or
transactions, and reflect the assumptions market participants would use to price
the financial instrument. Unobservable inputs are those for which market data
are not available and are developed using the best information available about
the assumptions that market participants would use to price the financial
instrument. GAAP requires valuation techniques to maximize the use of relevant
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Input levels are
not necessarily an indication of the risk or liquidity associated with financial
instruments at that level but rather the degree of judgment used in determining
those values. For example, securities held by a money market fund are generally
high quality and liquid; however, they are reflected as Level 2 because the
inputs used to determine fair value are not quoted prices in an active
market.
In accordance with Rule 2a-7 under the
1940 Act, each fund values its securities at amortized cost, which approximates
fair value. Securities for which amortized cost is deemed not to reflect fair
value are stated at fair value as determined in good faith by the Valuation
Committee. On May 31, 2016, all of the funds� financial instruments were
classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
NOTE 3 - INVESTMENT
TRANSACTIONS
Consistent with its investment objective,
each fund engages in the following practices to manage exposure to certain risks
and/or to enhance performance. The investment objectives, policies, program, and
risk factors of each fund are described more fully in its prospectus and
Statement of Additional Information.Repurchase Agreements Each fund may engage in repurchase agreements, pursuant to which it pays cash to and receives securities from a counterparty that agrees to �repurchase� the securities at a specified time, typically within seven business days, for a specified price. All repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by U.S. government securities or related agency securities, which are held by the custodian designated by the agreement. Collateral is evaluated daily to ensure that its market value exceeds the delivery value of the repurchase agreements at maturity. Although risk is mitigated by the collateral, a fund could experience a delay in recovering its value and a possible loss of income or value if the counterparty fails to perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement.Restricted
Securities Each fund may invest in securities that are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale. Prompt sale of such securities at an acceptable price may be difficult and may involve substantial delays and additional costs.NOTE 4 - FEDERAL INCOME TAXESNo provision for federal income taxes is required since each fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code and distribute to shareholders all of its taxable income and gains. Distributions determined in accordance with federal income tax regulations may differ in amount or character from net investment income and realized gains for financial reporting purposes. Financial reporting records are adjusted for permanent book/tax differences to reflect tax character
but are not adjusted for temporary differences.Each fund files U.S. federal, state, and local tax returns as required. Each fund�s tax returns are subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities until expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, which is generally three years after the filing of the tax return, but which can be extended to six years in certain circumstances. Tax returns for open years have incorporated no uncertain tax positions that require a provision for income taxes.
For the Government Reserve Fund,
reclassifications to paid-in capital relate primarily to a tax practice that
treats a portion of the proceeds from each redemption of capital shares as a
distribution of taxable net investment income or realized capital gain. For the
year ended May 31, 2016, the following reclassifications were recorded to
reflect tax character; there was no impact on results of operations or net
assets:
Distributions during the year ended May
31, 2016 and May 31, 2015 were characterized as ordinary income for tax purposes
and totaled $38,061,000 and $11,826,000, respectively, for the Reserve Fund and
$3,760,000 and $898,000, respectively, for the Government Reserve Fund. At May
31, 2016, the tax-basis cost of investments and components of net assets were as
follows:
Each fund intends to retain realized gains
to the extent of available capital loss carryforwards. Because capital loss
carryforwards that do not expire are required to be used before capital loss
carryforwards with expiration dates, it is possible that all or a portion of
each fund�s
capital loss carryforwards subject to expiration could ultimately go unused.
Additionally, all or a portion of a fund�s capital loss
carryforwards may be from losses realized between November 1 and the fund�s
fiscal year-end, which are deferred for tax purposes until the subsequent year
but recognized for financial reporting purposes in the year realized. During the
year ended May 31, 2016, Reserve Fund utilized $262,000 of capital loss
carryforwards and Government Reserve Fund utilized no capital loss
carryforwards. As of May 31, 2016, the Reserve Fund had $3,590,000 of available
capital loss carryforwards, which all expire in fiscal 2017. Additionally, as of May 31, 2016, the Government Reserve Fund
had $20,000 of available capital loss carryforwards, which have no
expiration.
NOTE 5 - RELATED PARTY
TRANSACTIONS
The funds are managed by Price Associates,
a wholly owned subsidiary of T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (Price Group). Price
Associates, directly or through sub-advisory agreements with its wholly owned
subsidiaries, also provides investment management services to all shareholders
of the funds. The funds pay no management fees; however, Price Associates
receives management fees from the mutual funds and other accounts invested in
the funds. Certain officers and directors of the funds are also officers and
directors of Price Associates and its subsidiaries and of other T. Rowe
Price-sponsored funds (Price funds) invested in the funds.
Pursuant to various service agreements,
Price Associates and its wholly owned subsidiaries provide shareholder and
administrative, transfer and dividend disbursing, accounting, and certain other
services to the funds. For the year
ended May 31, 2016, expenses incurred by the
Reserve Fund pursuant to these service agreements were $62,000 for Price
Associates. For the year ended May 31, 2016, expenses incurred by the Government
Reserve Fund pursuant to these service agreements were $58,000 for Price
Associates. The amounts payable at period-end pursuant to these agreements are
included in Due to Affiliates in the accompanying financial
statements.
The funds may participate in securities
purchase and sale transactions with other funds or accounts advised by Price
Associates (cross trades), in accordance with procedures adopted by each fund�s
Board and Securities and Exchange Commission rules, which require, among other
things, that such purchase and sale cross trades be effected at the independent
current market price of the security. During the year ended May 31, 2016, the
Reserve Fund and Government Reserve Fund had no purchases or sales cross trades
with other funds or accounts advised by Prices
Associates.NOTE 6 - INTERFUND LENDING PROGRAMPrice Associates has developed and manages an interfund lending program that provides temporary liquidity to the T. Rowe Price-sponsored mutual funds. The program permits the borrowing and lending of cash between the Reserve Fund and other T. Rowe Price-sponsored mutual funds at rates beneficial to both the borrowing and lending funds. Pursuant to program guidelines, the fund may lend up to 15% of its net assets, and no more than 5% of its net assets may be lent to any one borrower. Loans totaling 10% or more of a borrowing fund�s total assets require collateralization at 102% of the value of the loan; loans of less than 10% are unsecured. During the year ended May 31, 2016, the Reserve Fund earned $5,000 in interest income related to loans made to other funds on 6 days
in the average amount of $23,650,000 and at an average annual rate of 1.21%. At May 31, 2016, there were no loans outstanding.

T. Rowe Price Reserve Investment Fund







Approval
  of Investment Management Agreement
On March 11, 2016, the fund�s Board of
Directors (Board), including a majority of the fund�s independent directors,
approved the continuation of the investment management agreement (Advisory
Contract) between the fund and its investment advisor, T. Rowe Price Associates,
Inc. (Advisor). In connection with its deliberations, the Board requested, and
the Advisor provided, such information as the Board (with advice from
independent legal counsel) deemed reasonably necessary. The Board considered a
variety of factors in connection with its review of the Advisory Contract, also
taking into account information provided by the Advisor during the course of the
year, as discussed below:
Services Provided by the
AdvisorThe Board considered the nature,
quality, and extent of the services provided to the fund by the Advisor. These
services included, but were not limited to, directing the fund�s investments in
accordance with its investment program and the overall management of the fund�s
portfolio, as well as a variety of related activities such as financial,
investment operations, and administrative services; compliance; maintaining the
fund�s records and registrations; and shareholder communications. The Board also
reviewed the background and experience of the Advisor�s senior management team
and investment personnel involved in the management of the fund, as well as the
Advisor�s compliance record. The Board concluded that it was satisfied with the
nature, quality, and extent of the services provided by the Advisor.
Investment Performance of the
FundThe Board reviewed the fund�s
three-month, one-year, and year-by-year returns, as well as the fund�s average
annualized total returns over the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods, and compared
these returns with a wide variety of comparable performance measures and market
data, including those supplied by Lipper and Morningstar, which are independent
providers of mutual fund data.
On the basis of this evaluation and the
Board�s ongoing review of investment results, and factoring in the relative
market conditions during certain of the performance periods, the Board concluded
that the fund�s performance was satisfactory.
Costs, Benefits, Profits, and Economies
of ScaleThe Advisor does not receive
management fees from the fund. Accordingly, the Board did not review information
relating to revenues received by the Advisor under the Advisory Contract. The
Board did review information regarding benefits that the Advisor (and its
affiliates) may have realized from its relationship with the fund or other T.
Rowe Price funds that invest in the fund, including research received under
�soft dollar� agreements and commission-sharing arrangements with
broker-dealers. The Board considered that the Advisor may receive some benefit
from its soft-dollar arrangements pursuant to which it receives research from
broker-dealers that execute the applicable fund�s portfolio transactions. The
Board also received information on the estimated costs incurred and profits
realized by the Advisor and its affiliates from advising T. Rowe Price mutual
funds and concluded that the Advisor�s profits were
reasonable. Because the Advisor does not receive a management fee from the fund,
the Board did not consider whether the fund or other funds benefit under the fee
levels set forth in the Advisory Contract from any economies of scale realized
by the Advisor, and the Board did not review fees and expenses of other
comparable funds or of institutional accounts of the Advisor and its
affiliates.
Approval of the Advisory
ContractAs noted, the Board approved the
continuation of the Advisory Contract. No single factor was considered in
isolation or to be determinative to the decision. Rather, the Board concluded,
in light of a weighting and balancing of all factors considered, that it was in
the best interests of the fund and its shareholders for the Board to approve the
continuation of the Advisory Contract (including the fees to be charged for
services thereunder). The independent directors were advised throughout the
process by independent legal counsel.

Investment Performance of the
FundThe Board reviewed the fund�s
three-month, one-year, and year-by-year returns, as well as the fund�s average
annualized total returns over the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods, and compared
these returns with a wide variety of comparable performance measures and market

Item 2. Code of Ethics. 
The registrant has adopted a code of
ethics, as defined in Item 2 of Form N-CSR, applicable to its principal
executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions. A copy of this code of
ethics is filed as an exhibit to this Form N-CSR. No substantive amendments were
approved or waivers were granted to this code of ethics during the period
covered by this report. 
Item 3. Audit Committee Financial Expert.

The registrant�s Board of
Directors/Trustees has determined that Mr. Bruce W. Duncan qualifies as an
audit committee financial expert, as defined in Item 3 of Form N-CSR. Mr.
Duncan is considered independent for purposes of Item 3 of Form
N-CSR.
Item 4. Principal Accountant Fees and
Services. 
(a) � (d) Aggregate fees billed for the last two fiscal years for professional services rendered to, or on behalf of, the
registrant by the registrant�s principal accountant were as follows: 

Audit fees include amounts related to
the audit of the registrant�s annual financial statements and services normally
provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings.
Audit-related fees include amounts reasonably related to the performance of the
audit of the registrant�s financial statements and specifically include the
issuance of a report on internal controls and, if applicable, agreed-upon
procedures related to fund acquisitions. Tax fees include amounts related to
services for tax compliance, tax planning, and tax advice. The nature of these
services specifically includes the review of distribution calculations and the
preparation of Federal, state, and excise tax returns. All other fees include
the registrant�s pro-rata share of amounts for agreed-upon procedures in
conjunction with service contract approvals by the registrant�s Board of
Directors/Trustees. 
(e)(1) The registrant�s audit
committee has adopted a policy whereby audit and non-audit services performed by
the registrant�s principal accountant for the registrant, its investment
adviser, and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant require
pre-approval in advance at regularly scheduled audit committee meetings. If such
a service is required between regularly scheduled audit committee meetings,
pre-approval may be authorized by one audit committee member with ratification
at the next scheduled audit committee meeting. Waiver of pre-approval for audit
or non-audit services requiring fees of a de minimis amount is not permitted.

���� (2) No
services included in (b) � (d) above were approved pursuant to paragraph
(c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.
(f) Less than 50 percent of the hours
expended on the principal accountant�s engagement to audit the registrant�s
financial statements for the most recent fiscal year were attributed to work
performed by persons other than the principal accountant�s full-time, permanent
employees. 
(g) The aggregate fees billed for the
most recent fiscal year and the preceding fiscal year by the registrant�s
principal accountant for non-audit services rendered to the registrant, its
investment adviser, and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
registrant were $2,409,000 and $2,554,000, respectively.
(h) All non-audit services rendered
in (g) above were pre-approved by the registrant�s audit committee. Accordingly,
these services were considered by the registrant�s audit committee in
maintaining the principal accountant�s independence. 
Item 5. Audit Committee of Listed
Registrants. 
Not applicable.
Item 6. Investments. 
(a) Not applicable. The complete
schedule of investments is included in Item 1 of this Form N-CSR. 
(b) Not applicable.

executive officer and principal financial officer have evaluated the
registrant�s disclosure controls and procedures within 90 days of this filing
and have concluded that the registrant�s disclosure controls and procedures were
effective, as of that date, in ensuring that information required to be
disclosed by the registrant in this Form N-CSR was recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported timely.
(b) The registrant�s principal
executive officer and principal financial officer are aware of no change in the

affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant�s

ethics pursuant to Item 2 of Form N-CSR is attached.

(3) Written
solicitation to repurchase securities issued by closed-end companies: not
applicable. 
(b) A certification by the
registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and required by Rule
30a-2(b) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, is

Philosophy[edit]
Thomas Rowe Price Jr. started in finance in the 1920s as an entry-level researcher and account manager at Baltimore-area brokerages. He found that he liked the challenges imposed by investing nearly as much as he disliked the common practices of sales-oriented brokerages at the time. So, in 1937, he founded a firm that went against that grain in three major ways: charging fees based on assets under management rather than sales volume, actively managing his clients' accounts strictly as a fiduciary, and investing in growth stocks instead of value stocks. This approach, which emphasized "discipline, process consistency, and fundamental research," garnered success for the firm and its namesake, who became well known as the "father of growth investing" and was nicknamed the "Sage of Baltimore" by Forbes.[3][4] The firm has diversified its products and methodology, but hews closely to the original values upon which it was founded.[1][5]
History[edit]
1937-1986[edit]
Thomas Rowe Price, Jr. founded T. Rowe Price & Associates in Baltimore in 1937. The firm was originally headquartered at 10 Light Street and staffed by a small pool of associates, many of whom left Legg Mason's precursor, MacKubin, Legg and Co. along with Mr. Price.[6] Initially a very small firm focused on wealth management and private investing accounts for Baltimore-area families, the company struggled through the financial turbulence of the Great Depression and World War II before gaining solid footing at the end of the 1940s. By 1950, its clientele grew too large for the staff to manage accounts individually, so the firm incorporated and launched its first mutual fund, the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund.[3][7]




100 East Pratt Street


Gaining traction in Baltimore and along the U.S. eastern seaboard, the firm continued a steady expansion of clientele, staff, and geographic reach. By 1960, Mr. Price felt the need to open a second fund, named the New Horizons Fund, focused on growth investment opportunities, and especially technological firms like Xerox, IBM, and Boeing.[7] In need of more room, headquarters were moved in 1962 to the new One Charles Center building designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe nearby in downtown Baltimore.[8] At this same juncture, Mr. Price began to prepare for retirement, resigning as president of the firm in 1963, delegating some responsibilities, and selling his shares in the company.[7] Despite this, Mr. Price maintained an active presence in the firm for several years, and urged the opening of the New Era Fund in 1969 as a response to the rapid inflation he predicted would dominate the 1970s.[9] In 1971, the year Mr. Price completely retired, T. Rowe Price opened its Fixed Income Division, and began to modernize and diversify its operations.
In the 1970s and early 1980s, T. Rowe Price kicked off more assertive growth than before, moving to its current location at 100 East Pratt Street and opening its first international office. In 1979, T. Rowe Price launched a joint venture with British asset manager Robert Fleming & Co. named Rowe Price-Fleming International. The venture, which managed $39 billion at its height in 2000, allowed T. Rowe Price to offer a broader range of services and expertise internationally.[10]
1986-present[edit]
T. Rowe Price held its initial public offering, valued at nearly $200 million dollars, in 1986.[11] Shortly thereafter, the firm began establishing larger office complexes in the U.S. and research offices around the world, beginning with a Hong Kong office in 1987. Retirement Plan Services were launched in the 1990s alongside additional new services and funds, including mutual funds acquired from other companies such as USF&G.[12] This momentum, and the firm reaching $100 billion assets under management, pushed T. Rowe Price to create an asset management partnership with Sumitomo Bank and Daiwa Securities in Tokyo in 1999, and to purchase 100% interest of the London-based Rowe Price-Fleming International, which was renamed T. Rowe Price International.[7] Also in 1999, T. Rowe Price was added to the S&P 500 Index.[13][14]
On the strength of its ethic of risk aversion, fundamental research, and active management approach, T. Rowe Price somewhat predicted and largely avoided the dot-com bubble of 2000. Its ethic of caution was so different from the norm at the time that The Wall Street Journal expressed surprise at its non-speculation on profitable technology stocks just a week before the markets began to crash in March 2000.[15] In 2001, the company launched T. Rowe Price Funds SICAV, domiciled in Luxembourg, for non-U.S. institutional investors and financial intermediaries. Two years later it created target-date retirement funds.[16] In 2010, T. Rowe Price bought a significant interest in Unit Trust of India, India's oldest mutual fund company and one of its five largest.[17] Since 2000, T. Rowe Price has opened global offices in locations ranging from Madrid and Dubai to Stockholm and Sydney.[18]

Philosophy[edit]
Thomas Rowe Price Jr. started in finance in the 1920s as an entry-level researcher and account manager at Baltimore-area brokerages. He found that he liked the challenges imposed by investing nearly as much as he disliked the common practices of sales-oriented brokerages at the time. So, in 1937, he founded a firm that went against that grain in three major ways: charging fees based on assets under management rather than sales volume, actively managing his clients' accounts strictly as a fiduciary, and investing in growth stocks instead of value stocks. This approach, which emphasized "discipline, process consistency, and fundamental research," garnered success for the firm and its namesake, who became well known as the "father of growth investing" and was nicknamed the "Sage of Baltimore" by Forbes.[3][4] The firm has diversified its products and methodology, but hews closely to the original values upon which it was founded.[1][5]
History[edit]
1937-1986[edit]
Thomas Rowe Price, Jr. founded T. Rowe Price & Associates in Baltimore in 1937. The firm was originally headquartered at 10 Light Street and staffed by a small pool of associates, many of whom left Legg Mason's precursor, MacKubin, Legg and Co. along with Mr. Price.[6] Initially a very small firm focused on wealth management and private investing accounts for Baltimore-area families, the company struggled through the financial turbulence of the Great Depression and World War II before gaining solid footing at the end of the 1940s. By 1950, its clientele grew too large for the staff to manage accounts individually, so the firm incorporated and launched its first mutual fund, the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund.[3][7]




100 East Pratt Street


Gaining traction in Baltimore and along the U.S. eastern seaboard, the firm continued a steady expansion of clientele, staff, and geographic reach. By 1960, Mr. Price felt the need to open a second fund, named the New Horizons Fund, focused on growth investment opportunities, and especially technological firms like Xerox, IBM, and Boeing.[7] In need of more room, headquarters were moved in 1962 to the new One Charles Center building designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe nearby in downtown Baltimore.[8] At this same juncture, Mr. Price began to prepare for retirement, resigning as president of the firm in 1963, delegating some responsibilities, and selling his shares in the company.[7] Despite this, Mr. Price maintained an active presence in the firm for several years, and urged the opening of the New Era Fund in 1969 as a response to the rapid inflation he predicted would dominate the 1970s.[9] In 1971, the year Mr. Price completely retired, T. Rowe Price opened its Fixed Income Division, and began to modernize and diversify its operations.
In the 1970s and early 1980s, T. Rowe Price kicked off more assertive growth than before, moving to its current location at 100 East Pratt Street and opening its first international office. In 1979, T. Rowe Price launched a joint venture with British asset manager Robert Fleming & Co. named Rowe Price-Fleming International. The venture, which managed $39 billion at its height in 2000, allowed T. Rowe Price to offer a broader range of services and expertise internationally.[10]
1986-present[edit]
T. Rowe Price held its initial public offering, valued at nearly $200 million dollars, in 1986.[11] Shortly thereafter, the firm began establishing larger office complexes in the U.S. and research offices around the world, beginning with a Hong Kong office in 1987. Retirement Plan Services were launched in the 1990s alongside additional new services and funds, including mutual funds acquired from other companies such as USF&G.[12] This momentum, and the firm reaching $100 billion assets under management, pushed T. Rowe Price to create an asset management partnership with Sumitomo Bank and Daiwa Securities in Tokyo in 1999, and to purchase 100% interest of the London-based Rowe Price-Fleming International, which was renamed T. Rowe Price International.[7] Also in 1999, T. Rowe Price was added to the S&P 500 Index.[13][14]
On the strength of its ethic of risk aversion, fundamental research, and active management approach, T. Rowe Price somewhat predicted and largely avoided the dot-com bubble of 2000. Its ethic of caution was so different from the norm at the time that The Wall Street Journal expressed surprise at its non-speculation on profitable technology stocks just a week before the markets began to crash in March 2000.[15] In 2001, the company launched T. Rowe Price Funds SICAV, domiciled in Luxembourg, for non-U.S. institutional investors and financial intermediaries. Two years later it created target-date retirement funds.[16] In 2010, T. Rowe Price bought a significant interest in Unit Trust of India, India's oldest mutual fund company and one of its five largest.[17] Since 2000, T. Rowe Price has opened global offices in locations ranging from Madrid and Dubai to Stockholm and Sydney.[18]

Philosophy[edit]
Thomas Rowe Price Jr. started in finance in the 1920s as an entry-level researcher and account manager at Baltimore-area brokerages. He found that he liked the challenges imposed by investing nearly as much as he disliked the common practices of sales-oriented brokerages at the time. So, in 1937, he founded a firm that went against that grain in three major ways: charging fees based on assets under management rather than sales volume, actively managing his clients' accounts strictly as a fiduciary, and investing in growth stocks instead of value stocks. This approach, which emphasized "discipline, process consistency, and fundamental research," garnered success for the firm and its namesake, who became well known as the "father of growth investing" and was nicknamed the "Sage of Baltimore" by Forbes.[3][4] The firm has diversified its products and methodology, but hews closely to the original values upon which it was founded.[1][5]
History[edit]
1937-1986[edit]
Thomas Rowe Price, Jr. founded T. Rowe Price & Associates in Baltimore in 1937. The firm was originally headquartered at 10 Light Street and staffed by a small pool of associates, many of whom left Legg Mason's precursor, MacKubin, Legg and Co. along with Mr. Price.[6] Initially a very small firm focused on wealth management and private investing accounts for Baltimore-area families, the company struggled through the financial turbulence of the Great Depression and World War II before gaining solid footing at the end of the 1940s. By 1950, its clientele grew too large for the staff to manage accounts individually, so the firm incorporated and launched its first mutual fund, the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund.[3][7]




100 East Pratt Street


Gaining traction in Baltimore and along the U.S. eastern seaboard, the firm continued a steady expansion of clientele, staff, and geographic reach. By 1960, Mr. Price felt the need to open a second fund, named the New Horizons Fund, focused on growth investment opportunities, and especially technological firms like Xerox, IBM, and Boeing.[7] In need of more room, headquarters were moved in 1962 to the new One Charles Center building designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe nearby in downtown Baltimore.[8] At this same juncture, Mr. Price began to prepare for retirement, resigning as president of the firm in 1963, delegating some responsibilities, and selling his shares in the company.[7] Despite this, Mr. Price maintained an active presence in the firm for several years, and urged the opening of the New Era Fund in 1969 as a response to the rapid inflation he predicted would dominate the 1970s.[9] In 1971, the year Mr. Price completely retired, T. Rowe Price opened its Fixed Income Division, and began to modernize and diversify its operations.
In the 1970s and early 1980s, T. Rowe Price kicked off more assertive growth than before, moving to its current location at 100 East Pratt Street and opening its first international office. In 1979, T. Rowe Price launched a joint venture with British asset manager Robert Fleming & Co. named Rowe Price-Fleming International. The venture, which managed $39 billion at its height in 2000, allowed T. Rowe Price to offer a broader range of services and expertise internationally.[10]
1986-present[edit]
T. Rowe Price held its initial public offering, valued at nearly $200 million dollars, in 1986.[11] Shortly thereafter, the firm began establishing larger office complexes in the U.S. and research offices around the world, beginning with a Hong Kong office in 1987. Retirement Plan Services were launched in the 1990s alongside additional new services and funds, including mutual funds acquired from other companies such as USF&G.[12] This momentum, and the firm reaching $100 billion assets under management, pushed T. Rowe Price to create an asset management partnership with Sumitomo Bank and Daiwa Securities in Tokyo in 1999, and to purchase 100% interest of the London-based Rowe Price-Fleming International, which was renamed T. Rowe Price International.[7] Also in 1999, T. Rowe Price was added to the S&P 500 Index.[13][14]
On the strength of its ethic of risk aversion, fundamental research, and active management approach, T. Rowe Price somewhat predicted and largely avoided the dot-com bubble of 2000. Its ethic of caution was so different from the norm at the time that The Wall Street Journal expressed surprise at its non-speculation on profitable technology stocks just a week before the markets began to crash in March 2000.[15] In 2001, the company launched T. Rowe Price Funds SICAV, domiciled in Luxembourg, for non-U.S. institutional investors and financial intermediaries. Two years later it created target-date retirement funds.[16] In 2010, T. Rowe Price bought a significant interest in Unit Trust of India, India's oldest mutual fund company and one of its five largest.[17] Since 2000, T. Rowe Price has opened global offices in locations ranging from Madrid and Dubai to Stockholm and Sydney.[18]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
