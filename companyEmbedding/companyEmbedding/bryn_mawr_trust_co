Personal Checking
Some banks claim they have free checking.














In today’s world, everyone has different needs. So we give you the checking options you need to meet them… but without so many choices that you can’t decide what’s right for you.
As the Easy Comparison chart below shows, you get a wide range of benefits no matter which account you choose. It all boils down to the balances you typically keep, and the relative importance of earning interest on your checking dollars.

Smart loan solutions for every need and lifestyle.




How much you need, how much you can afford, and how you use it differ for everyone and are very personal. So our experts can help you find the perfect solution — from variable rate lines that give you cash whenever you need it to fixed rate loans that are great for financing major purchases or restructuring debt.
Whichever you choose, we try to make applying – and getting you a quick decision – as fast and easy as possible. You can find solutions for your borrowing needs here, in any Bryn Mawr Trust office, or please fill out the form to the right (or below if on mobile).

One of our banking experts can help you. To sign up for Direct Deposit of your payroll, check with your employer.


Overdraft Protection


You can guard against overdrafts, and overdraft charges, by registering for Automatic Overdraft Protection. This authorizes us to automatically transfer the necessary funds from your savings account or line of credit.


eStatements


eStatements save space and time and they are secure. Once you are enrolled in PC Banking, you can easily request eStatements in place of Paper — with one request, every account accessible on PC Banking will automatically receive an e-Statement. And, as with paper statements, you can get a single statement that combines your Bryn Mawr Trust checking, savings and money market accounts, as well as CDs and most loan accounts. It makes it a lot easier to stay on top of your finances.
