Jonathan R. Poole
Our Firm » Jonathan R. Poole
Jonathan focuses his practice on litigation, education law, and employment law. He has represented colleges and universities in matters involving employment law, disability law, faculty misconduct, FERPA, Clery Act, student discipline, teacher discipline, tenure, regulatory compliance, accreditation, federal funding, governance, and risk management. He advises charter schools regarding governance and operational issues, as well as special education matters. Jonathan also routinely advises educational institutions in Title IX compliance matters, including assisting clients in preparing policies and procedures that meet state and federal requirements.

He has successfully defended numerous discrimination cases arising under Title VII, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, and the Fair Labor Standards Act, as well as a variety of employment-related tort cases. He provides advice, counseling, and training to employers designed to minimize their exposure to claims of discrimination, harassment, retaliation, wrongful termination, breach of contract, torts, and workers’ compensation.

Jonathan’s background also includes insurance defense and workers’ compensation. He has spoken at numerous employment law related programs, as well as published materials regarding employment law matters.

Jonathan was selected for inclusion in the 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 Georgia SuperLawyer Rising Stars list by Atlanta Magazine.

information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem?

the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours? 
Cost - How are the lawyer's fees structured - hourly or flat
fee? Can the lawyer estimate the cost of your case?

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1885 edition. Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper.

Item Description: Jonathan Freeman, 1815, 1815. No Binding. Book Condition: Very Good. 1st Edition.. Nicely presented original manuscript document on hand-made ragpaper, certifying the votes for town representation in the General Court of the State. Measures 6.5" x 8". Light agewear, Nice condition - very attractive and quite scarce. ============== "New Hampshire's political culture was and continues to be steeped in the desire to preserve local, community interests." The method of voting began with voice votes at town meetings, but by 1804 New Hampshire had directed in state statute that town clerks be chosen by ballot. Ballots were hand written, although by the 1830s, printed ballots came into use. Early in the new republic, the right to vote reflected the tension between the Federalists, those property owners with a "stake in society," and the Republicans (Democratic-Republicans), who wanted to expand democratic participation as broadly as possibleso broadly, in fact, that some feared "mob rule" at the other end of the spectrum. By 1800 New Hampshire was one of just three states (the others were Kentucky and Vermont) that had universal white manhood suffrage, having done away with the requirement of property ownership. All of New England except Connecticut allowed African Americans to vote without significant restriction. New Hampshire endorsed the principle that the more people taking part in the democratic process, the better." - Tufts U. ============= Interesting relic of the early town voting custom in NH. Priced reasonably for your consideration, packaged carefully and will be shipped to you immediately. Would look great framed. Bookseller Inventory Language: eng Language: eng. Signed by Author(s).
