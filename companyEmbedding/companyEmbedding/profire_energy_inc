Profire Energy Adds New Mid-Range PF1800 Burner Management System To Product Line






GlobeNewswire



May 29, 2013 9:15 AM EDT













 


























































    LINDON, Utah, May 29, 2013 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Profire Energy, Inc. (OTCBB:PFIE), a technology company which manufactures, installs and services burner management systems and other combustion management technologies for the oil and gas industry, today announced the release of a new burner management system (BMS), named the PF1800. The system is designed to enhance the company's product line by providing fundamental burner management functionality without all the enhanced benefits of the company's flagship PF2100 system.  "We believe the PF1800 fills a gap in the industry's available burner management technology," said Brenton Hatch, chief executive officer of Profire Energy. "Currently, the industry is generally offered two products: a basic sparker-system, or a full-featured burner management system. The PF1800 offers a mid-range option for customers who don't need the enhanced features of our PF2100 system, but still require a safe re-ignition option with some burner management capabilities."  The new system will be available beginning in June 2013, with full CSA/UL approvals to current codes. Once launched, the company anticipates the PF1800 will appeal to a smaller market segment than its PF2100 system, due to its simplified feature-set:  "It's worth noting that the PF1800 does not have the versatility or capability of our flagship PF2100 system," said Patrick Fisher, Lead Product Designer at Profire Energy. "For example, the PF1800 provides only basic fuel-train control, and does not have the integrated features or expandability of the PF2100. The focused functionality of the PF1800 will, however, prove a viable option for a specific segment of our customers."  The system is already installed on select sites in North America, and can be purchased by contacting a Profire Energy representative. To learn more about the PF1800 or other Profire Energy products, please visit   www.ProfireEnergy.com  About Profire Energy, Inc.  Profire Energy assists energy production companies in the safe and efficient transportation, refinement and production of oil and natural gas. As energy companies seek greater safety for their employees, compliance with more stringent EPA standards and enhanced margins with their energy production processes, Profire Energy's burner management systems are increasingly becoming part of their solution. To learn more about the company's products and services, please visit   www.ProfireEnergy.com . Profire Energy has offices in Lindon, Utah; Houston, Texas; and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.   Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Statements made in this release that are not historical are forward-looking statements. This release contains forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to statements regarding the need for a more simplified burner management product and the existence of a market for the PF1800, including the type of customer for whom this product might be a viable option.  All such forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from the events or results described in, or anticipated by, the forward-looking statements. Factors that could materially affect such forward-looking statements include certain economic, business, public market and regulatory risks and factors identified in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this release and the Company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. CONTACT: Profire Energy, Inc.         Andrew Limpert, CFO         (801) 796-5127                  Profire Energy, Inc.

History[edit]
Profire Energy was established in Alberta, Canada in March 2002 as a private company ("Profire Combustion"). Brenton W. Hatch (now CEO), Harold E. Albert (now COO) co-founded the company to service oil/gas producers, but soon created a control panel for the management of burners, a system called the Profire 1100. After a few years of continued development, the company made the decision to go public (in 2008) under the name Profire Energy, Inc. (OTCBB: PFIE). They have since developed additional (and more advanced) products, opened multiple offices throughout the US, and continued development of their product line for domestic and international use.
Markets[edit]
Profire Energy predominately serves the North American upstream and midstream oil/gas industry, but announced a Brazilian distribution channel in early 2012, as well as an Australian distribution channel in early 2014.[3]

History[edit]
Profire Energy was established in Alberta, Canada in March 2002 as a private company ("Profire Combustion"). Brenton W. Hatch (now CEO), Harold E. Albert (now COO) co-founded the company to service oil/gas producers, but soon created a control panel for the management of burners, a system called the Profire 1100. After a few years of continued development, the company made the decision to go public (in 2008) under the name Profire Energy, Inc. (OTCBB: PFIE). They have since developed additional (and more advanced) products, opened multiple offices throughout the US, and continued development of their product line for domestic and international use.
Markets[edit]
Profire Energy predominately serves the North American upstream and midstream oil/gas industry, but announced a Brazilian distribution channel in early 2012, as well as an Australian distribution channel in early 2014.[3]

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

History[edit]
Profire Energy was established in Alberta, Canada in March 2002 as a private company ("Profire Combustion"). Brenton W. Hatch (now CEO), Harold E. Albert (now COO) co-founded the company to service oil/gas producers, but soon created a control panel for the management of burners, a system called the Profire 1100. After a few years of continued development, the company made the decision to go public (in 2008) under the name Profire Energy, Inc. (OTCBB: PFIE). They have since developed additional (and more advanced) products, opened multiple offices throughout the US, and continued development of their product line for domestic and international use.
Markets[edit]
Profire Energy predominately serves the North American upstream and midstream oil/gas industry, but announced a Brazilian distribution channel in early 2012, as well as an Australian distribution channel in early 2014.[3]
