Mangrove Partners Delivers Letter To Board Of Directors Of Home Loan Servicing Solutions, Ltd. Urging Termination Of HLSS's Relationship With Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC

		  Outlines HLSS's Opportunity to Generate Significant Value for Shareholders by Forcing Servicing Transfers Away from OcwenAnnounces Intention to Nominate a Slate of Directors to the HLSS Board for Election at the Company's 2015 Annual Meeting

NEW YORK, Feb. 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The Mangrove Partners Master Fund, Ltd., a significant shareholder of Home Loan Servicing Solutions, Ltd. (Nasdaq:   HLSS), today announced it has delivered a letter to the members of HLSS's Board of Directors. 
The full text of the letter follows and has been posted to www.freeHLSS.com: 
The Board of Directors
Home Loan Servicing Solutions, Ltd.
c/o Intertrust Corporate Services (Cayman) Limited
190 Elgin Avenue
George Town, Grand Cayman KY1-9005
Cayman Islands
CC:  Michael Lubin, Corporate Secretary
Dear Members of the Board:
We are writing you in response to your letter dated February 5, 2015 ("Response"). Based on the latest publicly available shareholdings list, The Mangrove Partners Master Fund, Ltd. ("Mangrove Partners") is one of the ten largest shareholders of Home Loan Servicing Solutions, Ltd. ("HLSS" or the "Company"). As we expressed in our February 2, 2015 letter, we believe it is imperative for the Company to exercise its contractual rights to terminate its relationship with Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC ("Ocwen") without delay. We believe that continuing to expose HLSS to Ocwen-related risks by leaving the Ocwen relationship intact constitutes a dereliction of your duty to the Company and a grave risk to all shareholders. Your Response was inadequate. As a result, it is our intention to nominate a slate of replacement directors for election this year because time is not the Company's friend and you as the Board are showing no signs of taking concrete action to protect shareholders in this serious situation.  
We believe that there have been multiple Termination Events under the documents governing HLSS's purchase of Rights to MSRs ("RMSRs") from Ocwen. Pursuant to each sale supplement governing HLSS's purchase of RMSRs from Ocwen, a Termination Event is defined as "the occurrence of any one or more of the following events…(e) Seller [Ocwen] fails to maintain residential primary servicer ratings for subprime loans of at least 'Average' by Standard & Poor's Rating Services…'SQ3' by Moody's Investors Service, Inc ("Moody's")…and 'RPS4+' and 'RSS4+' by Fitch Ratings." A Termination Event therefore occurred on January 29, 2015, when Moody's downgraded Ocwen's servicer quality (SQ) assessments to SQ3- from SQ3 and as a special servicer of residential mortgage loans to SQ3- from SQ3. Another Termination Event occurred on February 4, 2015, when Fitch Ratings downgraded Ocwen's residential primary servicer rating for Subprime product to "RPS4" from "RPS3." Section 6.13 of the sales supplements specifies that "(i)n the case that any Termination Event occurs with respect to any Servicing Agreement… [Ocwen] shall, upon HLSS's written direction to such effect, use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer the Servicing Rights relating to any affected Servicing Agreement to a third party servicer identified by HLSS." Importantly, Section 6.13 of the sales supplements then proceeds to state that "HLSS shall be entitled to receive all proceeds of such transfer" (emphasis added).
We believe that there are compelling reasons why HLSS should immediately begin the process of exercising its rights to direct Ocwen to transfer the servicing rights to one or more different servicers. Most importantly, servicing transfers will isolate HLSS from the risks of an ongoing relationship with Ocwen. A number of these risks were outlined in our prior letter to you. You are no doubt aware that Moody's downgraded HLSS's corporate family rating from Ba3 to B2 on October 21, 2014, citing HLSS's "reliance on Ocwen" as the primary reason for the downgrade. Additionally, we remind you that the California Department of Business Oversight threatened to suspend Ocwen's servicing license multiple times during 2014. It is our belief that HLSS's continued affiliation with Ocwen is an unacceptable risk and contrary to the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. We believe that restructuring HLSS's servicing counterparty relationships would be a significant positive development for the Company in the current operating environment and would be viewed positively by all of the Company's lending relationships. Transferring servicing would give HLSS the opportunity to engage with servicers that have greater servicing stability, better management oversight, stronger relationships with regulators, and higher ratings.
In addition to shielding HLSS shareholders from Ocwen-related risks, we believe that a transfer of the servicing rights will create significant value for HLSS and its shareholders. While our valuation work shows a range of potential values, we believe that a reasonable estimate of the value created by transferring the servicing rights would be between $8 and $13 per share of incremental value to HLSS.  Based on the Company's book value on September 30, 2014, this represents an increase in book value of between 44% and 72%. In addition, we believe the Company's stock is currently trading at a discounted multiple due to the Company's close ties to Ocwen. Once the Company ends its association with Ocwen, we see no reason why the Company would not return to trading at its historic multiple of between 120% and 130% of book value. In a reasonable scenario, this would give shareholders a value of between $31 and $40 per share. We have included our analysis of the value available to HLSS with a servicing transfer in the appendix to this letter.
Although you may be concerned that HLSS's exercise of its rights to force servicing transfers could create further instability at Ocwen, Mangrove Partners believes that Ocwen's cash flows would only be affected after the servicing transfers are completed. Likewise, while the servicing transfers away from Ocwen would likely cause Ocwen to turn loss-making and give rise to multiple covenant breaches in Ocwen's credit facility pursuant to section 6.07(a) and 6.07(b) of the Ocwen Senior Secured Term Loan Facility Agreement dated February 15, 2013, these breaches would occur only after substantially all servicing transfers requested by HLSS had been completed. As such, any ensuing Ocwen default would be irrelevant to HLSS and the Company's remaining exposure to Ocwen would be de minimis. 
We urge you to fulfill your fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the Company by causing the Company to exercise its contractual rights to force a transfer of the servicing rights. In doing so, the Board can and should insulate HLSS from further Ocwen risk and create substantial value for the Company and its shareholders. Your Response's vague reassurances and legal boilerplate did nothing to ease Mangrove Partners' increasing and justified concerns about the direction of the Company. To be clear, we are not looking for you to make selective disclosure to us—we are looking for you to take prudent action to protect the Company and shareholder interests. Accordingly, until such time as the Company announces it has entered into definitive agreements to transfer the servicing rights away from Ocwen pursuant to competitive processes conducted by top-tier advisors, it is our intention to bring new leadership to the Board by nominating a highly qualified slate of directors this week.
Sincerely,
Nathaniel August
President and Portfolio Manager
Mangrove Partners
VALUATION APPENDIX
1. Ocwen profits as servicer on MSRs for which HLSS funds advances. 
Ocwen acts as servicer for all of the RMSRs that HLSS owns. We believe that Ocwen earns significant profits from this relationship. Our analysis of the value accruing to Ocwen as servicer for HLSS RMSRs is below and assumes that Ocwen's profitability on agency and non-agency MSR are equal as a percentage of UPB serviced. We note that Ocwen management has indicated that agency servicing is significantly less profitable than non-agency servicing and that Ocwen intends to exit its agency servicing business.

In a servicing transfer, we believe that the earnings Ocwen currently generates from the MSRs that HLSS has the right to transfer would be worth over $8 in incremental value per HLSS share.  We have benchmarked our valuation against what HLSS has indicated it believes Ocwen earns on this relationship. On June 11, 2013, HLSS indicated in a lender presentation that Ocwen earns a contribution profit of 36 bps of UPB as servicer on HLSS RMSRs. As shown below, this suggests that our valuation of Ocwen's servicing relationship with HLSS is less than 1x its contribution profit to Ocwen in our low case. We believe this reflects the conservatism embedded in our valuation.

2. Clean up call rights. 
On a December 22, 2014 conference call, Ocwen stated that it owns call rights: "(A)s the servicer of almost $200 billion of UPB of private label mortgages…we estimate that we will execute approximately $5 billion of calls over the next two years and they could be worth two to three points of profit to [Ocwen]." Since these clean up call rights belong to the servicer of the private label mortgages, their value should accrue to HLSS as part of the price it receives in a transfer of the MSRs.

Based on the guidance given by Ocwen's management, it is Mangrove Partners' opinion that the clean up call rights to which HLSS is entitled could be worth at least $1-2 per share, taking into consideration only those clean up call rights that were in-the-money as of December 2014.
3. Altisource Portfolio Solutions, S.A. ("ASPS") profits from Ocwen's non-agency portfolio. 
In January 2015, ASPS provided estimates of potential Technology and Mortgage Services pre-tax income it expects to generate from Ocwen's existing non-GSE portfolio. We believe that substantially all of this pre-tax income is generated from Ocwen's non-agency portfolio. HLSS owns the RMSRs to over 96% of Ocwen's non-agency servicing portfolio. A third party servicer to which HLSS transfers servicing could derive significant value from performing the services that ASPS is currently performing, and we believe that HLSS could be compensated for this in the sale price of the servicing rights. Our estimate of the value another servicer could realize from the cash flows that ASPS forecast in its recent presentation is presented below.

Value per HLSS share












$5.47

Based on ASPS's projections, the cash flows that a buyer of the MSRs could realize may be worth over $5 per HLSS share. Although this value would likely be divided between HLSS and the MSR purchaser, it may also be conservative because it excludes earnings related to mortgage charge-off collection services that would likely be valuable to another servicer.
4. Transaction comparable. 
In January 2014, Ocwen agreed to acquire a primarily private label mortgage servicing portfolio from Wells Fargo with total principal balance of $39 billion (the "Wells Fargo Portfolio"). The agreed-upon purchase price was $2.7 billion, including $280 million for the MSR, $115 million for deferred servicing fees, and $2.3 billion for outstanding servicing advances. Although this transaction was not consummated, it serves as a point of reference for the value HLSS could receive in a sale to a third party.

We note that this analysis does not take into account the cost of capital associated with deferred servicing fees that Ocwen agreed to pay up front, nor the difference in servicing advance requirements between the Wells Fargo Portfolio and the RMSRs that HLSS currently owns. Servicing advances as a percentage of HLSS's RMSR UPB stood at 3.685% at September 30, 2014, compared to servicing advances as a percentage of UPB in the Wells Fargo Portfolio of 5.897%. Also, the HLSS portfolio is entirely private label, whereas over 8% of the UPB associated with the Wells Fargo Portfolio was Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac servicing. This suggests that based on a comparable transaction analysis, HLSS's exercise of its right to transfer servicing away from Ocwen could result in a gain to HLSS shareholders well in excess of $8 per share. This gain would represent an increase of approximately 45% to HLSS's September 30, 2014 book value per share.
5. HLSS's RMSRs are valued on its balance sheet using assumptions that are more conservative than realized performance. 
A servicing transfer that results in the sale of MSRs that HLSS finances is likely to result in a significant gain to HLSS.

The personally identifiable information you submit to the Company Entities is used only to determine whether you will be admitted as a Fund Entity investor, to determine whether a Fund Entity will accept a further investment from an existing Fund Entity investor, to service your account and/or to provide you with information on the Company Entities and the Fund Entities. We will not sell, share or rent your personally identifiable information to others in contravention of this Privacy Policy. Please contact us by email or telephone as specified below to update your account information whenever such information ceases to be complete or accurate.
Additionally, if you access parts of the Website that are password protected, then (a) once you submit your password and enter, the Website will recognize who you are and collect all information that you submit, including all electronic information (including all transaction information), and (b) any information collected about you from the Website may be associated with other identifying information that we have about you.
We generally record certain usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to our Website. This information may include the websites that you access immediately before and after your visit to our Website, the Internet browser you are using and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. If we use such data at all it will be on an aggregate basis, and we will not disclose to third parties any information that could be used to identify you personally.
Cookies: Cookies are small text files that are stored in your computer's memory and hard drive when you visit certain web pages. They are used to enable websites to function or to provide information to the owners of a website. Cookies help us to provide customized services and information. We use or may in the future use cookies on the Website for the following purposes:

Analytical purposes: Analytical cookies allow us to recognize, measure and track visitors to the Website. This helps us to improve and develop the way the Website works, for example, by determining whether site visitors can find information easily, or by identifying the aspects of the site that are of the most interest to them.
Usage preferences: Some of the cookies on the Website are activated when visitors to our sites make a choice about their usage of the site. Our Website then ‘remembers' the settings preferences of the user concerned. This allows us to tailor aspects of the site to the individual user.
Terms and conditions: We use or may in the future use cookies on the Website to record when a site visitor has seen a policy, such as this one, or provided consent, such as consent to the terms and conditions on our Website. This helps to improve the user's experience of the site – for example, it avoids a user from repeatedly being asked to consent to the same terms.
Session management: The software that runs the Website uses cookies for technical purposes needed by the internal workings of our servers. For instance, we use or may in the future use cookies to distribute requests among multiple servers, authenticate users and determine what features of the site they can access, verify the origin of requests, keep track of information about a user's session and determine which options or pages to display in order for the site to function.

To make full use of the Website, your computer or mobile device will need to accept cookies, as the site will not function properly without them. In addition, cookies are required in order to provide you with personalized features on the Website.
Local Flash Storage: We may include content on the Website designed for display using Adobe Flash Player, such as animations, videos and tools. Local flash storage (often referred to as "Flash cookies") can be used to help improve your experience as a user. Flash storage is retained on your device in much the same way as standard cookies, but is managed directly by your Flash software.
If you wish to disable or delete information stored locally in Flash, please see the documentation for your Flash software, located at www.adobe.com.  Please note that, if you disable Flash cookies, some site functionality may not work.
Third party cookies: When you visit the Website, you may receive cookies that are set by third parties.  These may include cookies set by Google, Unica, Forsee, Wall Street on Demand, Morningstar, Media Mind and/or Flurry.  These cookies are used for the purposes described in the bullet points above.  We do not control the setting of these third party cookies, so we suggest you might wish to check the third party websites for more information about their use of cookies and how to manage them.
Amending cookie preferences: You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, notify you when a cookie is set, or delete cookies that have already been set. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on our Website. In addition, a number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit websites anonymously.
The site www.allaboutcookies.org includes instructions for managing cookies on many commonly used browsers, or you may consult the vendor documentation for your specific software.
Privacy Preferences: The Website may contain information, including P3P privacy policies ("Privacy Preference Information"), intended to work with your selected privacy preferences. While we have tried to make such Privacy Preference Information included within the Website conform to this full-text of this Privacy Policy, this Privacy Policy is the definitive statement of the privacy policies and practices for the Website.
Service Providers: We may use internal or external service providers to operate our Website and employ other persons to perform work on our behalf, such as sending postal mail and e-mail. These persons may have access to the personally identifiable information you submit through the Website, but only for the purpose of performing their duties. These personnel are not permitted to use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
Except as described above, the Company Entities, the Fund Entities and the Administrator do not obtain nonpublic personal information about Fund Entity investors from any other source.
Disclosure of Nonpublic Personal Information
	The Company Entities, the Fund Entities and the Administrator do not disclose nonpublic personal information about Fund Entity investors to nonaffiliated third parties or to affiliated entities, except as permitted by U.S. law or the consent of Fund Entity investors.  For example, the Company Entities, the Fund Entities and the Administrator may share nonpublic personal information in the following situations:

To respond to a subpoena or court order, judicial process or regulatory authorities;
To protect against fraud, unauthorized transactions (such as money laundering), claims or other liabilities;
To service providers in connection with the administration and servicing of the Fund Entities and the Company Entities, which may include attorneys, accountants, auditors, or other professionals;
To service or process Fund Entity transactions; and
Upon consent of a Fund Entity investor to release such information, including authorization to disclose such information to persons acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity on behalf of the Fund Entity investor.

Each Fund Entity investor has the right to opt out of the disclosure of its nonpublic personal information to persons who are not affiliated with the Company Entities. If you wish to do so, please contact us immediately by calling 212 897-9535 or by email to info@mangrovepartners.com. We will honor your opt out election until you revoke it.
Protection of Investor Information
	The Company Entities and the Fund Entities maintain safeguards that comply with U.S. Federal standards to protect investor information.  The Company Entities and the Fund Entities restrict access to the personal and account information of Fund Entity investors to those persons who need to know such information in the course of their job responsibilities.  Third parties with which the Company Entities or the Fund Entities share investor information must agree to follow appropriate standards of security and confidentiality.
E-mail and Marketing
	The Company Entities and the Fund Entities do not sell investor e-mail addresses, and do not provide your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes. The Company Entities and the Fund Entities will not send you e-mail messages without first receiving your permission, unless it relates to servicing your account or unless you have consented to receiving electronic delivery of fund documents. We recommend that you do not send us any individual personal information via nonsecure methods of correspondence, including via public electronic communication channels, such as Internet e-mail, which are generally not secure.
Business Transfers
	If all or some of the business, stock or assets of the Company Entities are acquired or merged with another business entity, we will share all or some of your information with this entity to continue to provide service to you. You will receive notice of such an event and the new entity will inform you of any changes to the practices in this Privacy Policy. If the new entity wishes to make additional use of your information, you may decline such use at such time.
Children's Privacy
	Although the Website is not targeted toward children, we are concerned about the safety and privacy of children who use the Internet. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information without verifiable parental consent, we will use our best efforts to remove such information from our files. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable information without verifiable parental consent, he or she should contact us immediately.
Third Party Websites
	The Company Entities may establish links between the Website and one or more websites operated by third parties. The Company Entities have no control over any such other websites, the contents therein or the products/services offered. Your access to and use of such linked websites is governed by the terms of use and privacy policies of those sites, and shall be at your own risk. The Company Entities and the Fund Entities disclaim responsibility for the privacy policies and customer information practices of third-party internet websites hyperlinked from our Website.
Security
	No data transmission over the internet can be 100% secure, so the Company Entities cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you submit to us on the Website.
Contact Us
	If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our privacy related practices, or if you would like a copy of the Company Entities' Regulation S-P privacy policy, please contact us.

This Amendment No. 2 to Schedule 13D (this Amendment
No. 2) is being filed with respect to the common shares, par value $0.01 per share, of Peabody Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the Issuer), to amend the Schedule 13D filed on
October 24, 2016, as amended by Amendment No. 1 filed on December 9, 2016 (collectively, the Schedule 13D). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the
Schedule 13D.   


Item 4.
Purpose of Transaction.  Item 4 is hereby supplemented and amended by adding the following information
thereto:  On January 20, 2017, the Master Fund along with certain other equity holders and certain members of the Ad Hoc Group of Non-Consenting Creditors in the Chapter 11 Cases (together with the Master Fund, the Commitment Parties) executed and delivered to Peabody Energy Corporation (the Company) and the Official
Committee of Unsecured Creditors a Backstop Commitment Letter (the Backstop Commitment Letter). On or about January 17, 2017, the Commitment Parties submitted a restructuring proposal to the Company, but the Company informed the
Commitment Parties of certain concerns it had regarding the restructuring proposal. The Backstop Commitment Letter supersedes such restructuring proposal in all respects. 
The Backstop Commitment Letter provides that, if the Debtors countersign the Backstop Commitment letter, the Commitment Parties and the Debtors will cooperate
and negotiate in good faith the terms of a long-form agreement (the Backstop Commitment Agreement) consistent with the terms of the Backstop Commitment Letter that would supersede the Backstop Commitment Letter. 
Under the Backstop Commitment Letter, the Commitment Parties have committed, among other things, to exercise any subscription rights that remain unfilled at
the conclusion of a proposed $1,770,000,000 equity rights offering (the Rights Offering) of reorganized Peabody Energy Corporation (Reorganized Peabody), which will provide a portion of the financing for a proposed
restructuring of the Debtors contemplated by the Backstop Commitment Letter (the Alternative Transaction). The Alternative Transaction would be different from the plan of reorganization filed by the Debtors with the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri (the Bankruptcy Court) on December 22, 2016.  The Alternative Transaction is
described in the Plan Term Sheet, attached as Exhibit C to the Backstop Commitment Letter. Pursuant to the Alternative Transaction, each holder of equity (including the Master Fund) of the Company will receive its pro rata share of
warrants for 5% of the shares of Reorganized Peabody exercisable for seven years at a valuation at which convertible noteholders receive a par recovery. The price per share in the Rights Offering is to be determined using a plan enterprise value of
$6,750,000,000 (the Plan Enterprise Value) and applying a 45% discount thereto. The Master Fund believes that the actual enterprise value of the Debtors is substantially higher than the Plan Enterprise Value but agreed to become a
Commitment Party for the investment opportunity of acquiring equity of Reorganized Peabody at a price substantially lower than its intrinsic value. 


In addition, the Alternative Transaction contemplates, among other things, that (i) each holder of an Allowed
First Lien Lender Claim1 will receive its aggregate pro rata share of cash equal to the full amount of its Allowed First Lien Lender Claims, including interest at the default rate, (ii) each
holder of an Allowed Second Lien Notes Claim will receive either (A) Reinstatement of any Allowed Second Lien Notes Claim or (B) an option to exchange such Second Lien Notes for its pro rata share (based on 100% of the Allowed Second Lien Note
Claims) of (x) $750 million in cash (75% of the stated principal amount of the Second Lien Notes, excluding accrued and unpaid interest) and (y) 17.4% of the shares in Reorganized Peabody (which shall be subject to dilution as described in the
Plan Term Sheet), (iii) each holder of an Allowed Unsecured Senior Notes Claim will receive the holders pro rata share of (A) 100% of shares of Reorganized Peabody less any shares of Reorganized Peabody that holders of Allowed Second
Lien Notes Claims elect to receive (which shall be subject to dilution as described in the Plan Term Sheet) and (B) the Section 1145 Equity Rights and (iv) each holder of convertible notes will receive its pro rata share of warrants for
20% of shares of Reorganized Peabody, exercisable for seven years at a valuation at which participating holders of Allowed Unsecured Senior Notes Claims receive a par recovery. Participants in the Rights Offering will also be granted
oversubscription rights such that any subscription rights that remain unfilled by the participants of the Rights Offering may be subscribed for by other Rights Offering participants. 
The obligations of the Debtors to issue shares in the Rights Offering, and of the Commitment Parties to purchase their commitments contemplated by the
Backstop Commitment Letter, are subject to certain conditions, including, among other things, (i) execution and delivery by the Commitment Parties and the Debtors of the Backstop Commitment Agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to the requisite number of Commitment Parties and the Debtors, (ii) consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Backstop Commitment Letter and (iii) receipt of final orders from the Bankruptcy Court approving the transactions
contemplated by the Backstop Commitment Letter. In exchange for their commitments to exercise any unfilled subscription rights, the Commitment Parties would receive, among other things, a backstop commitment premium (payable in the form of new
common stock of Reorganized Peabody) and penny warrants for shares of Reorganized Peabody.  The Backstop Commitment Letter is subject to termination
(i) automatically upon execution and delivery of the Backstop Commitment Agreement, (ii) upon approval or authorization by the Bankruptcy Court of any reorganization or similar transaction other than the Alternative Transaction or if the
Debtors enter into any agreement providing for any such transaction, (iii) on April 28, 2017 (which date may be extended or waived (but not to a date later than June 30, 2017) in certain circumstances) (iv) if the board of
directors of Peabody Energy Corporation determines in good faith, based upon the advice of outside legal counsel, that continued performance under the Backstop Commitment Letter would be inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, and (v) upon the occurrence of material breaches of a partys representations, warranties or covenants contained in the Backstop Commitment Letter if such breaches remain uncured for 5 business days following written notice
thereof.  The foregoing description of the Backstop Commitment Letter and any exhibits thereto is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of
the Backstop Commitment Letter, including the Plan Term Sheet attached as Exhibit C thereto, which is filed as Exhibit 99.3 to this Amendment No. 2. 
The information contained in this Amendment No. 2 is not intended, and should not be construed, as part of any solicitation process or
related purpose, as such term is defined, described, or referenced under title 11 of the United States Code or otherwise. Such information is included in this Amendment No. 2 for the purpose of compliance with Regulation 13D-G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Mangrove Partners Delivers Letter To Board Of Directors Of Home Loan Servicing Solutions, Ltd. Urging Termination Of HLSS's Relationship With Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC

Outlines HLSS's Opportunity to Generate Significant Value for Shareholders by Forcing Servicing Transfers Away from Ocwen
Announces Intention to Nominate a Slate of Directors to the HLSS Board for Election at the Company's 2015 Annual Meeting




Feb 9, 2015, 10:00am EST














NEW YORK, Feb. 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The Mangrove Partners Master Fund, Ltd., a significant shareholder of Home Loan Servicing Solutions, Ltd. (Nasdaq: HLSS), today announced it has delivered a letter to the members of HLSS's Board of Directors. 
The full text of the letter follows and has been posted to www.freeHLSS.com: 
The Board of DirectorsHome Loan Servicing Solutions, Ltd.c/o Intertrust Corporate Services (Cayman) Limited190 Elgin AvenueGeorge Town, Grand Cayman KY1-9005Cayman Islands
CC:  Michael Lubin, Corporate Secretary
Dear Members of the Board:
We are writing you in response to your letter dated February 5, 2015 ("Response"). Based on the latest publicly available shareholdings list, The Mangrove Partners Master Fund, Ltd. ("Mangrove Partners") is one of the ten largest shareholders of Home Loan Servicing Solutions, Ltd. ("HLSS" or the "Company"). As we expressed in our February 2, 2015 letter, we believe it is imperative for the Company to exercise its contractual rights to terminate its relationship with Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC ("Ocwen") without delay. We believe that continuing to expose HLSS to Ocwen-related risks by leaving the Ocwen relationship intact constitutes a dereliction of your duty to the Company and a grave risk to all shareholders. Your Response was inadequate. As a result, it is our intention to nominate a slate of replacement directors for election this year because time is not the Company's friend and you as the Board are showing no signs of taking concrete action to protect shareholders in this serious situation.  
We believe that there have been multiple Termination Events under the documents governing HLSS's purchase of Rights to MSRs ("RMSRs") from Ocwen. Pursuant to each sale supplement governing HLSS's purchase of RMSRs from Ocwen, a Termination Event is defined as "the occurrence of any one or more of the following events…(e) Seller [Ocwen] fails to maintain residential primary servicer ratings for subprime loans of at least 'Average' by Standard & Poor's Rating Services…'SQ3' by Moody's Investors Service, Inc ("Moody's")…and 'RPS4+' and 'RSS4+' by Fitch Ratings." A Termination Event therefore occurred on January 29, 2015, when Moody's downgraded Ocwen's servicer quality (SQ) assessments to SQ3- from SQ3 and as a special servicer of residential mortgage loans to SQ3- from SQ3. Another Termination Event occurred on February 4, 2015, when Fitch Ratings downgraded Ocwen's residential primary servicer rating for Subprime product to "RPS4" from "RPS3." Section 6.13 of the sales supplements specifies that "(i)n the case that any Termination Event occurs with respect to any Servicing Agreement… [Ocwen] shall, upon HLSS's written direction to such effect, use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer the Servicing Rights relating to any affected Servicing Agreement to a third party servicer identified by HLSS." Importantly, Section 6.13 of the sales supplements then proceeds to state that "HLSS shall be entitled to receive all proceeds of such transfer" (emphasis added).
We believe that there are compelling reasons why HLSS should immediately begin the process of exercising its rights to direct Ocwen to transfer the servicing rights to one or more different servicers. Most importantly, servicing transfers will isolate HLSS from the risks of an ongoing relationship with Ocwen. A number of these risks were outlined in our prior letter to you. You are no doubt aware that Moody's downgraded HLSS's corporate family rating from Ba3 to B2 on October 21, 2014, citing HLSS's "reliance on Ocwen" as the primary reason for the downgrade. Additionally, we remind you that the California Department of Business Oversight threatened to suspend Ocwen's servicing license multiple times during 2014. It is our belief that HLSS's continued affiliation with Ocwen is an unacceptable risk and contrary to the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. We believe that restructuring HLSS's servicing counterparty relationships would be a significant positive development for the Company in the current operating environment and would be viewed positively by all of the Company's lending relationships. Transferring servicing would give HLSS the opportunity to engage with servicers that have greater servicing stability, better management oversight, stronger relationships with regulators, and higher ratings.
In addition to shielding HLSS shareholders from Ocwen-related risks, we believe that a transfer of the servicing rights will create significant value for HLSS and its shareholders. While our valuation work shows a range of potential values, we believe that a reasonable estimate of the value created by transferring the servicing rights would be between $8 and $13 per share of incremental value to HLSS.  Based on the Company's book value on September 30, 2014, this represents an increase in book value of between 44% and 72%. In addition, we believe the Company's stock is currently trading at a discounted multiple due to the Company's close ties to Ocwen. Once the Company ends its association with Ocwen, we see no reason why the Company would not return to trading at its historic multiple of between 120% and 130% of book value. In a reasonable scenario, this would give shareholders a value of between $31 and $40 per share. We have included our analysis of the value available to HLSS with a servicing transfer in the appendix to this letter.
Although you may be concerned that HLSS's exercise of its rights to force servicing transfers could create further instability at Ocwen, Mangrove Partners believes that Ocwen's cash flows would only be affected after the servicing transfers are completed. Likewise, while the servicing transfers away from Ocwen would likely cause Ocwen to turn loss-making and give rise to multiple covenant breaches in Ocwen's credit facility pursuant to section 6.07(a) and 6.07(b) of the Ocwen Senior Secured Term Loan Facility Agreement dated February 15, 2013, these breaches would occur only after substantially all servicing transfers requested by HLSS had been completed. As such, any ensuing Ocwen default would be irrelevant to HLSS and the Company's remaining exposure to Ocwen would be de minimis. 
We urge you to fulfill your fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the Company by causing the Company to exercise its contractual rights to force a transfer of the servicing rights. In doing so, the Board can and should insulate HLSS from further Ocwen risk and create substantial value for the Company and its shareholders. Your Response's vague reassurances and legal boilerplate did nothing to ease Mangrove Partners' increasing and justified concerns about the direction of the Company. To be clear, we are not looking for you to make selective disclosure to us—we are looking for you to take prudent action to protect the Company and shareholder interests. Accordingly, until such time as the Company announces it has entered into definitive agreements to transfer the servicing rights away from Ocwen pursuant to competitive processes conducted by top-tier advisors, it is our intention to bring new leadership to the Board by nominating a highly qualified slate of directors this week.
Sincerely,
Nathaniel AugustPresident and Portfolio ManagerMangrove Partners
VALUATION APPENDIX
1. Ocwen profits as servicer on MSRs for which HLSS funds advances. 
Ocwen acts as servicer for all of the RMSRs that HLSS owns. We believe that Ocwen earns significant profits from this relationship. Our analysis of the value accruing to Ocwen as servicer for HLSS RMSRs is below and assumes that Ocwen's profitability on agency and non-agency MSR are equal as a percentage of UPB serviced. We note that Ocwen management has indicated that agency servicing is significantly less profitable than non-agency servicing and that Ocwen intends to exit its agency servicing business.

In a servicing transfer, we believe that the earnings Ocwen currently generates from the MSRs that HLSS has the right to transfer would be worth over $8 in incremental value per HLSS share.  We have benchmarked our valuation against what HLSS has indicated it believes Ocwen earns on this relationship. On June 11, 2013, HLSS indicated in a lender presentation that Ocwen earns a contribution profit of 36 bps of UPB as servicer on HLSS RMSRs. As shown below, this suggests that our valuation of Ocwen's servicing relationship with HLSS is less than 1x its contribution profit to Ocwen in our low case. We believe this reflects the conservatism embedded in our valuation.

2. Clean up call rights. 
On a December 22, 2014 conference call, Ocwen stated that it owns call rights: "(A)s the servicer of almost $200 billion of UPB of private label mortgages…we estimate that we will execute approximately $5 billion of calls over the next two years and they could be worth two to three points of profit to [Ocwen]." Since these clean up call rights belong to the servicer of the private label mortgages, their value should accrue to HLSS as part of the price it receives in a transfer of the MSRs.

Based on the guidance given by Ocwen's management, it is Mangrove Partners' opinion that the clean up call rights to which HLSS is entitled could be worth at least $1-2 per share, taking into consideration only those clean up call rights that were in-the-money as of December 2014.
3. Altisource Portfolio Solutions, S.A. ("ASPS") profits from Ocwen's non-agency portfolio. 
In January 2015, ASPS provided estimates of potential Technology and Mortgage Services pre-tax income it expects to generate from Ocwen's existing non-GSE portfolio. We believe that substantially all of this pre-tax income is generated from Ocwen's non-agency portfolio. HLSS owns the RMSRs to over 96% of Ocwen's non-agency servicing portfolio. A third party servicer to which HLSS transfers servicing could derive significant value from performing the services that ASPS is currently performing, and we believe that HLSS could be compensated for this in the sale price of the servicing rights. Our estimate of the value another servicer could realize from the cash flows that ASPS forecast in its recent presentation is presented below.

Based on ASPS's projections, the cash flows that a buyer of the MSRs could realize may be worth over $5 per HLSS share. Although this value would likely be divided between HLSS and the MSR purchaser, it may also be conservative because it excludes earnings related to mortgage charge-off collection services that would likely be valuable to another servicer.
4. Transaction comparable. 
In January 2014, Ocwen agreed to acquire a primarily private label mortgage servicing portfolio from Wells Fargo with total principal balance of $39 billion (the "Wells Fargo Portfolio"). The agreed-upon purchase price was $2.7 billion, including $280 million for the MSR, $115 million for deferred servicing fees, and $2.3 billion for outstanding servicing advances. Although this transaction was not consummated, it serves as a point of reference for the value HLSS could receive in a sale to a third party.

We note that this analysis does not take into account the cost of capital associated with deferred servicing fees that Ocwen agreed to pay up front, nor the difference in servicing advance requirements between the Wells Fargo Portfolio and the RMSRs that HLSS currently owns. Servicing advances as a percentage of HLSS's RMSR UPB stood at 3.685% at September 30, 2014, compared to servicing advances as a percentage of UPB in the Wells Fargo Portfolio of 5.897%. Also, the HLSS portfolio is entirely private label, whereas over 8% of the UPB associated with the Wells Fargo Portfolio was Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac servicing. This suggests that based on a comparable transaction analysis, HLSS's exercise of its right to transfer servicing away from Ocwen could result in a gain to HLSS shareholders well in excess of $8 per share. This gain would represent an increase of approximately 45% to HLSS's September 30, 2014 book value per share.
5. HLSS's RMSRs are valued on its balance sheet using assumptions that are more conservative than realized performance. 
A servicing transfer that results in the sale of MSRs that HLSS finances is likely to result in a significant gain to HLSS.

NEW YORK, Feb. 12, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The Mangrove Partners Master Fund, Ltd. ("Mangrove"), a significant shareholder of Home Loan Servicing Solutions, Ltd. (Nasdaq:   HLSS), today announced it has formally nominated five highly qualified and independent director nominees — Nathaniel August, Kevin J. Doyle, John S. Dubel, A. Jay Meyerson and Amy C. Schumacher — for election to the Board of Directors of HLSS at its upcoming 2015 Annual General Meeting of shareholders. 
Nathaniel August, the founder and President of Mangrove Partners and a nominee, stated: "As we have previously explained to the Board, we have serious concerns that this Board is exposing HLSS shareholders to potentially significant value destruction through the Company's continued relationship with Ocwen. We believe that ending the Company's relationship with Ocwen both protects shareholders from value destruction and moreover has the potential to generate significant additional value.
"Our valuation work leads us to believe that transferring the servicing rights away from Ocwen could create significant value for HLSS — between $8 and $13 per share of incremental value to HLSS in our reasonable estimation. Based on the Company's book value on September 30, 2014, this would represent an increase in book value of between 44% and 72%."  
Mr. August continued: "But instead of action, this Board has provided us with nothing more than vague assurances that it has been working to address these issues. Given the significant value destruction that shareholders are facing coupled with the value-creating opportunity this Board appears intent on wasting, empty promises and ambiguous commitments are moot. That is why we are taking the extraordinary step of nominating a slate of five highly qualified independent nominees to the Board who we believe will be committed to completing the strategic actions necessary to protect and enhance shareholder value at HLSS."
Mr. August concluded: "While we remain open to further discussion with the Board and are amenable to reaching a mutually agreeable resolution that benefits all shareholders, we remain firm in our position on this matter — HLSS must terminate its relationship with Ocwen. If this Board continues to refuse to take action, we look forward to presenting shareholders with what we believe will represent the far superior choice of leadership at the Company's 2015 Annual Meeting."
Mangrove's nominees are:
Nathaniel August. Mr. August is the founder and President of Mangrove Partners and has an extensive background in financial analysis and a broad understanding of the operational, financial and strategic issues facing public companies.
