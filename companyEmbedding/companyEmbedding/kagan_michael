Cooperative Learning & Science: High School Activities
To make science content fun and interactive for Grades 8-12, this book features Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures such as RallyRobin, Find Someone Who, Pairs Check, Mix-N-Match, and Give One, Get One. Page after page of age-appropriate activity ideas and ready-to-use blackline masters make science learning motivating and memorable for biology, chemistry, earth science, physical science, and general and lab science. High school (and advanced middle school/junior high) science classes will hum with excitement and interest.




SUMMARY
Cooperative Learning and Science: High School Activities, by Michael Michels, Angela Manzi and Janina Mele, specifically outlines how cooperative learning methods may help secondary students understand such science concepts as the periodic table, the layers of the earth, the difference between speed and velocity, macromolecules, and the nature of a DNA helix.
Cooperative learning is booming at the secondary school level after thriving for many years at the elementary level. A large scale meta-analysis (Johnson et al., 1981) revealed similarly large, consistent gains in academic and social variables when cooperative learning was used with high school students as with elementary school students, across hundreds of research studies. Today, demand for cooperative learning trainings and resources among high school and college professors rivals the demand among elementary school teachers. High school (and advanced middle school/junior high) teachers respond with unbridled enthusiasm: "Finally a workshop just for me!" 
Cooperative Learning and Science offers activity ideas and ready-to-use blackline masters so that  teachers no longer need to re-invent generic cooperative learning materials. The authors adopt Dr. Spencer Kagan's instructional approach to cooperative learning. Dr. Kagan is known worldwide for distinguishing what teachers teach from how they teach. He contrasts a curricular approach that would treat science topics as an explicit curriculum – and demand that teachers develop new presentations of scientific content – against his instructional approach, which would treat the scientific method as a process that students can master. Following Dr. Kagan's lead, Michels, Manzi and Mele make it clear to science teachers how they may teach existing topics using new instructional strategies that foster scientific thinking. These instructional strategies are called structures.
 Kagan Structures are content-free sequences of rule-based student interactions. As the name structures indicates, these sequences literally structure students' interaction with each other, and/or with the content, and/or with the teacher. RallyRobin™ is one of the simplest of over two hundred Kagan Structures. It can be used with no preparation and no change in content, at almost any point in a lesson. In brief, the rules for RallyRobin tell students to work in pairs and take turns speaking, usually recalling or generating ideas, such as possible alternative explanations for a scientific phenomenon.
While these structures increase student engagement for any subject across the curriculum, they embed a particularly important proposition into science lessons: Learning to work in teams is particularly vital to science. The independent worker may remain the norm in the traditional realm of the Humanities, but 21st century science depends on interdependent teams, often in different locales, coordinating their efforts toward a shared goal. Likewise, the teacher discovers, after using RallyRobin or any other structure just a few times, that it is easy to use the structures repeatedly to generate new activities for any science topic.

FROM THE FOREWORD BY DR. SPENCER KAGAN
"Michael Michels, Angela Manzi, and Janina Mele have made an important contribution to the process of releasing the power of cooperative learning in high school classrooms. With Cooperative Learning and Science, any high school science teacher will find ready-made, proven activities."
"As science continues to build on the complex methodologies and findings that are being established, interdependence among scientists will become even more the norm and teamwork skills will be prerequisite for full participation in the scientific community."
"The book should come with a warning label: Caution Advised. Use of the Enclosed Activities Is Likely to Lead to an Addiction! All it will take is trying a few of these activities in your own classroom and observing the reaction and performance of students, and you will get hooked."

Michael Kagan on location for "Air America."








The head of production for Cannon Films in the 1980s, he produced such films as “Death Wish 3,” “Superman IV: The Quest for Peace” and “The Jungle Book.”

Michael Kagan, the head of production at Cannon Films during its heyday who later produced such films as Air America and Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, died Nov. 10 of natural causes in London. He was 87.
Kagan was the top production executive from 1982-88 at Cannon, which became a great Hollywood success story after it was purchased by Israeli cousins Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus for $500,000 in 1979.
Also a native of Israel, Kagan served as associate producer on two films directed by British helmer Michael Winner -- the remake of The Wicked Lady (1983), starring Faye Dunaway, Alan Bates and John Gielgud, and Death Wish 3 (1985) – and executive produced Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987) during his time at Cannon.
Kagan’s résumé also includes the Agatha Christie tale Ordeal by Innocence (1984), also starring Dunaway; Déjà Vu (1985), starring Jaclyn Smith; Tobe Hooper’s Lifeforce (1985); the Golan-written and -directed Mack the Knife (1989), toplined by Raul Julia and Richard Harris; and The Jungle Book (1994).
Kagan was a supervising producer for one season on the NBC sitcom Nurses, which aired from 1991-94 and was created by Susan Harris. That show was a spinoff of Harris' Empty Nest, itself a spinoff of The Golden Girls. 
Survivors include his wife, Kate.
