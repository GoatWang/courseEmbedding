Full-Time / Evening & Weekend MBANUVention: Medical Innovation I (HEMA-915-0) **HEMA-915 is a two-quarter sequence course in conjunction with HEMA-916**

NUvention Medical is a two term, interdisciplinary course designed to give students the experience of being an innovator and entrepreneur in the world of medical devices and health information technology.  Students form teams and each team conceives of or identifies an innovative new product or service that meets an existing market need and develops a prototype and a plan to commercial the product or service. A primary goal of the course is to help students understand and work through the challenges facing a new business in the area of medical technology. Students from Feinberg School of Medicine, McCormick School of Engineering, Pritzker School of Law and Kellogg School of Management will participate in the course. Each team will have at least one student from each school. 

	In the fall term, student teams will explore unmet market needs, understand market characteristics that are important to investors, conceive of or identify an innovative product with a convincing value proposition and “pitch” their idea.  In the winter term, the teams will be expected to analyze the customer and influential stakeholders, formulate a commercialization plan and develop the appropriate regulatory, intellectual property and reimbursement strategies. These will be incorporated into a comprehensive business plan and an investor presentation. Each team will also be required to develop and present a viable prototype.  Both the fall pitch and final presentation will be made to a group of experienced health care executives and investors. 
Students who are interested in learning how to start a business in the area of medical technology are welcome to apply to the course. Knowledge of he health care industry is certainly helpful but not a requirement. It puts a premium on individual initiative, an interest in the health care industry and working effectively on a team with others from different disciplines. As part of the course, opportunities to observe clinicians (shadowing) and learn from experienced hospital manages will be available. To take full advantage of this, students will need to complete the necessary paperwork and gain the proper hospital clearances, a process that takes approximately 30 days. This process can start as soon as the student is accepted to the course and should ideally be completed before the first class. 
NUvention Medical is supported by leading health care companies represented by an advisory board. These companies provide financial assistance as well as valuable advice and feedback to the students and faculty. This collective effort results in a unique learning experience as well innovative new products. 


To enroll in this course, permission from the instructor is required before registration. Students must take both the fall (I) and winter (II) quarter courses, in sequence, and will earn 2.0 credits after successfully completing both courses.NUvention: Medical Innovation II (HEMA-916-0) **HEMA-915 is a two-quarter sequence course in conjunction with HEMA-916**
Medical Innovation focuses on the creation of innovations for the health industry. Guided by faculty and physicians, students from Kellogg, the Law School, Feinberg, and McCormick work in teams to develop medical products. Students experience the entire innovation life cycle from ideation to prototyping, legal protection, market sizing and business plan development. At the end of the course, the teams present their business plans to a panel of venture capitalists with the goal of securing funding and possible formation of a start-up.
Key deliverables in this class include:
 - "Elevator pitch" to request prototype/pilot funding 
- Prototype development 
- Provisional patent application 
- FDA 510/K application 
- Business plan presentation to venture capitalists 
To enroll in this course, permission from the instructor is required before registration. Students must take both the fall (I) and winter (II) quarter courses, in sequence, and will earn 2.0 credits after successfully completing both courses.

Faculty and ResearchThe Kellogg School faculty is an esteemed group of scholars and practitioners, and members provide a rich source of international experience in professional management problems and practices. Faculty members combine real-world and academic knowledge of management problems to augment their theoretical training. Senior faculty members also teach courses to senior executives through the Kellogg School’s executive programs. This approach reinforces faculty research and keeps faculty members abreast of changes in corporate practices. All Kellogg School courses combine theory and practice. Teaching methods include case study, field study, seminars, simulations, and independent work. Faculty members choose the method most appropriate to the material and their individual styles. Research is a vital component of Kellogg’s program, and faculty members have developed groundbreaking theories in many academic fields, such as marketing, banking, strategy, and game theory. There are several research centers, on topics ranging from dispute resolution to banking. Several scholarly journals are edited at Kellogg, two of which—the Journal of Economics and Management Strategy and Games and Economic Behavior—were founded here. The Journal of Financial Intermediation was also founded at Kellogg.

      execution, regulatory success, and the build-out of a world-class

      franchise infrastructure supporting the global commercial launch of

      OTEZLA®. Going forward, he also assumes an expanded role in

      strategic corporate initiatives.

    


      Peter will join Celgene on July 1, 2014, and will become CFO effective

      August 1st. Peter will be responsible for core financial functions

      including Investor Relations, in addition to Corporate Strategy,

Personal[edit]
Peter attended Babson College in Wellesley, MA and the Berkshire School in Sheffield, MA. He is the son of James Crane Kellogg, III of Wall Street specialist firm Spear, Leeds & Kellogg; he joined his father's firm in 1967 after working at Dominick & Dominick. His fortune is primarily from his successful leadership of Spear, Leeds & Kellogg in the 1980s through to its sale in 2000 to Goldman Sachs for a reported $6.5 billion.[2] Kellogg attended Babson College, but later dropped out.
Kellogg spends his summers in Mantoloking, New Jersey.
NYSE[edit]
The NASD had publicly announced on November 3, 2003 that it “filed a disciplinary action against Peter Kellogg alleging that he directed fraudulent wash trades and matched trades between four accounts he controlled”. Wash sales are trades of securities without a real change in ownership of the securities traded. Matched orders are orders to buy or sell securities that are entered with knowledge that a matching order on the opposite side has been or will be entered.[3]
The NASD subsequently announced on August 6, 2004 that an NASD panel convened to hear the case dismissed this complaint against Kellogg alleging that he engaged in fraudulent wash and matched trades during August 2001. The public notice stated that "The Hearing Panel found that there was no evidence that Kellogg carried out the four transactions at issue with the intention to defraud, manipulate or deceive. Rather, the panel found that Kellogg conducted the transactions for legitimate business and tax purposes.”[4]
AMEX[edit]
Spear, Leeds was fined $1 million in 2002 by the AMEX and ordered to conduct a review of the supervision of its clearance and specialist operations on the AMEX floor.[5] This came in the wake of a violation of AMEX trading rules in the mid-1990s by a Spear Leeds employee who the AMEX found was not properly supervised by the firm. The employee, who was fined $100,000 and barred from the industry,[6] was reported in the news media[7] to have testified that his actions were known to senior Spear Leeds officials, including Kellogg.
Taxes[edit]
Kellogg is the controlling shareholder of IAT Reinsurance Co. which has received media attention in the past for its former use of a U.S. law exempting small insurance companies from paying federal tax. Congress exempted insurance companies from taxes if they collected less than $350,000 in annual premiums; IAT qualified for this exemption at one time.[8]
