I love all the Lauren shoes especially the wedges and espadrilles, however they are all cut narrow.
Wish they would cut the box of the shoe a little wider.

Love these - adorable with a sundress or nice jeans. Comfortable to walk around the city all day long (even tolerable on the cobblestones of Havana!). Highly recommend them.

Bought these in May of 2016. I am very particular about the fit of my shoes (I ordered 6 pair and returned 5, including the Ralph Lauren Cecilia, a similar style!) These fit great. I generally wear a 10.5, but most shoes do not come in this size and an 11 ends up being too large. I bought the size 10, in blue to match a custom-made dress, and they are a perfect fit. After a year of wearing them (not too often due to their color), they are just now looking a little worn on the bottoms, but they will make it another season.

What’s Brewing Over at Ralph Lauren, and It’s More Than Ralph’s Coffee 
July 12, 2017 By Pam Danziger









 


“Double, double toil and trouble,” wrote Shakespeare, and I can’t think of a better description of the situation at Ralph Lauren Corporation. “Double, double,” refers to two leaders in two short years. On February 2 the company announced that then-CEO Stefan Larsson was stepping down due to creative differences, followed with another on May 17th with the appointment of his replacement, P&G alum Patrice Louvet.
Mid-July Louvet will inherit the company’s “toil and trouble,” which is well documented. In its most recent reporting, quarterly sales were down 16.3 percent, marking the ninth straight fall in quarterly sales. For the full year 2017, all company revenue streams were down: wholesale off by 15 percent, retail down 6 percent and licensing off 1 percent.
Numerous analysts, including yours truly, have described the company’s troubling specifics – declining sales, dynamic competition, channel disruption, over-reliance on discounting and off-price outlets, ineffective omnichannel strategies and numerous operational inefficiencies.
To date, the company has addressed some of these, including closing underperforming stores, reducing promotions, reducing and realigning management structure and cutting out excess SKUs and overlapping product lines to focus on higher-demand products.
Yet still, the company expects sales to continue to slide in the current quarter. As a result, its stock is nearing its two-year low. Louvet has plenty of toil ahead to deal with the troubles.
Bringing in a fashion outsider may be the key to RL’s success.
Some experts question whether Louvet, without experience in the intricacies of the fashion industry and managing fashion’s creative resources, will be able to get up to speed quickly enough. Managing a team that is creating a new shampoo or razor blade takes a totally different skill set than designing next season’s fashion. Admittedly, while Louvet comes with a great business resume, he doesn’t know the unique challenges of bringing fashion through the entire design process into the market.
On the other hand, coming in as a fashion industry outsider may prove to be a key advantage for Louvet when he assumes his new leadership role. Above all, he won’t be blinded by some of the cumbersome, long established conventions and structures so prevalent in the fashion industry today. He will have a fresh unbiased eye. He will also be able to adapt his expertise in leveraging the many market and structural changes that have taken place since the recession. Unhampered by conventional wisdom, Louvet can find innovative ways to shift the company as it faces a customer who has changed and a market that has evolved.
First and foremost, it will mean nurturing a consumer-centric culture within the company that lets the customer lead. This is not a discipline common in the fashion industry, especially with visionary designers like Ralph Lauren who view their role as the leaders that customers follow.
The board at Ralph Lauren, having chosen a leader from outside of the fashion industry, is clearly betting that Louvet will shift the existing corporate culture to be responsive to the current fashion market where the customer, not the company, ultimately has all the power.
I reached out to a number of my contacts, all of which wished to remain anonymous, to get an insiders’ view of the company as it prepares to welcome Patrice Louvet to the corner office.
1. How will RL restore customer loyalty?
One of the most profound things I have found in the circles I run in, both in the industry and among fashion consumers, is the deep affection people feel for Ralph Lauren and the company he built. Many are as saddened by the company’s current troubles as are the employees who work there. They recognize that Ralph Lauren and his company paved the way for so many brands and nurtured terrific design talent that moved on to further success.
Ralph Lauren’s creative vision is what made the brand great, and what insiders believe can make the brand great again. But great design alone isn’t enough anymore. “Mr. Lauren has an illustrious career and success as a luxury design visionary, but the brand needs to speak to today’s consumer. That is the stumbling block,” said one retail executive. “It’s not so much about the product, but it’s how we get it to the customer.”
In the realm of fashion, the company signals it will retain its iconic American lifestyle heritage, all the while reinterpreting it to the sensibilities of modern American tastes. The company plans to do that by getting back to basics: great product, great quality, and great customer experiences. As a result, back-to-basics then seems to be the “Way Forward” for Ralph Lauren, referencing the plan that previous CEO Stefan Larrson put into place in June 2016 and continues to guide the future of the company.
But while the company will look back to the brand’s heritage in product, it is looking forward to new ways to engage customers and deliver the Ralph Lauren iconic looks to today’s connected customers. That means evolving the customer shopping experience. “Technology will be increasingly important, but so will the customer experience at all touchpoints. It has lost traction in proper positioning strategy and technology,” said one insider. “The improvements being made reflect work being done to strengthen the brand, but it has a ways to go.”
The company needs to build pathways to share insights, ideas and perspectives from the customer-facing lines up the corporate ladder. “That is how you find out how well you are doing and where you get ideas in how to strengthen your brand. Your customer speaks to you,” said another insider.
Creative enterprises, like fashion, need cross-pollination, both from within and outside the company. But some see that the RL culture isn’t necessarily breeding that free flow of ideas. “Great companies listen to the customers and they also listen to the people that work there. That is where you get your answers. You have to be where your people are and where your customers are,” another advised.
The “Way Forward Plan” included provision to cut out excess layers of management from nine to six layers, but even those six degrees of separation may be too many to channel effective communications up and down the ladder.
RELATED:   Macy’s: Imagine What Could Be There2. How will RL build investor confidence?
As a public company, renewing investor confidence is a critical question for the company, made even more so by the flagging stock valuations over the past several years. Seeking Alpha stock analyst and blogger, Alisa Kazimirchik, recently wrote, “The company is the weakest player on earth,” referring to negative ROA and ROE figures as of the company’s most recent reporting.
Restoring investor confidence will be a major focus for Patrice Louvet in the days ahead. He was selected for that capability, as he brings a proven track record of transforming and growing major global brands and streamlining and refocusing business units. How well he will work with Mr. Ralph Lauren remains to be seen, as those differences were reportedly the cause of Larsson’s exit.
The “Way Forward Plan” includes attacking many efficiencies, such as reducing supply chain lead times, employing best-in-class sourcing and executing a disciplined multi-channel distribution and expansion strategy in order to right size the cost structure and implement an ROI-driven financial model to free up resources to invest in the brand and drive high-quality sales, according to the official release.
Those tactics continue to be the priorities for the company in order to convince Wall Street and the investment community that RL is a brand they can trust to grow in the future. But other fashion-centric public companies are struggling with the same challenge, including Michael Kors and Coach.
“We are in a volatile world of change in retail in general and so many established brands are struggling,” one executive said. “It’s not so much that Ralph Lauren Corporation has gotten off track, but the industry is going through unprecedented change. Trying to find effective ways to shift is especially hard in this environment because the consumer has changed and continues to change.”
3. Where does “Ralph’s Coffee” experience fit into the plans for the company?
Two things that puzzled me in the company’s April announcement: first it was closing the flagship Polo store in Manhattan on Fifth Avenue and 55th Street, and second, its plans to expand its Ralph’s Coffee bar franchise. My initial thoughts were that expanding the Ralphs’ Coffee bar concept was what the brand needed to create relevance to the next generation of shoppers. But shouldn’t Ralph Lauren be serving up better reasons to buy an authentic $300 Ralph Lauren polo shirt, instead of serving a $3 cup of coffee?
However, there may be method to the madness, as the coffee bar concept extends the heritage of the iconic fashion brand into meaningful social experiences for customers as an introduction to the RL world. It is just another brand extension in RL’s 50-year history.
Following the millennial demand for experience, the new Way Forward for Ralph Lauren may be through creating social meet-ups based on food and drink. The company already has a track record of delivering successful food service through its global hospitality portfolio encompassing Ralph’s, RL Restaurant, The Polo Bar and Ralph’s Coffee & Bar.
The bet is that customers can experience the Ralph Lauren brand in new more personal ways rather than just trying on clothes. While I remain skeptical about the coffee connection, the company clearly is looking to engage and connect the Ralph Lauren lifestyle with customers in a more experiential way.
Personally, I am rooting for Messrs. Lauren and Louvet and the new team to revitalize the brand and set the company on a path to greater success in the future. I am encouraged, as others should be, by the company’s “Way Forward Plan” and its back-to-basics approach for the brand’s iconic heritage, all the while looking to new ways to meet and engage today’s experientially driven customers. Critical to success will be innovative design, dynamic omnichannel strategies and open two-way communications both inside and outside the company.
Clearly there won’t be any “double, double” short cuts or quick fixes for the company. The “toil” will involve dogged hard work, putting one foot in front of the other and learning and adjusting to get out of its “trouble” and find a profitable Way Forward. We can hope that Louvet with his disciplined P&G training and experience could be the right leader at the right time for the evolving Ralph Lauren Corporation.

What’s Brewing Over at Ralph Lauren, and It’s More Than Ralph’s Coffee 
July 12, 2017 By Pam Danziger









 


“Double, double toil and trouble,” wrote Shakespeare, and I can’t think of a better description of the situation at Ralph Lauren Corporation. “Double, double,” refers to two leaders in two short years. On February 2 the company announced that then-CEO Stefan Larsson was stepping down due to creative differences, followed with another on May 17th with the appointment of his replacement, P&G alum Patrice Louvet.
Mid-July Louvet will inherit the company’s “toil and trouble,” which is well documented. In its most recent reporting, quarterly sales were down 16.3 percent, marking the ninth straight fall in quarterly sales. For the full year 2017, all company revenue streams were down: wholesale off by 15 percent, retail down 6 percent and licensing off 1 percent.
Numerous analysts, including yours truly, have described the company’s troubling specifics – declining sales, dynamic competition, channel disruption, over-reliance on discounting and off-price outlets, ineffective omnichannel strategies and numerous operational inefficiencies.
To date, the company has addressed some of these, including closing underperforming stores, reducing promotions, reducing and realigning management structure and cutting out excess SKUs and overlapping product lines to focus on higher-demand products.
Yet still, the company expects sales to continue to slide in the current quarter. As a result, its stock is nearing its two-year low. Louvet has plenty of toil ahead to deal with the troubles.
Bringing in a fashion outsider may be the key to RL’s success.
Some experts question whether Louvet, without experience in the intricacies of the fashion industry and managing fashion’s creative resources, will be able to get up to speed quickly enough. Managing a team that is creating a new shampoo or razor blade takes a totally different skill set than designing next season’s fashion. Admittedly, while Louvet comes with a great business resume, he doesn’t know the unique challenges of bringing fashion through the entire design process into the market.

Made in America? Iconic ‘American’ Products That Aren’t Actually Made in the U.S.

President Donald Trump’s recent push to bring jobs and companies back to America has caused quite a stir — especially because many of his personal business goods are outsourced overseas. Regardless, a few companies, such as Under Armor and Samsonite, have recently vowed to commit to manufacturing products that are truly made in America.
Most Americans — 70% — consider it important to buy U.S.-made products. Despite that sentiment, 37% said they would refuse to pay more for American-made goods versus cheaper imports. Consumers like to outwardly punish companies who manufacture products overseas, yet balk at a higher markup for a tag that’s stitched with a “Made in America” emblem. So companies continue to vie for people’s buying loyalty all while enduring a balancing act between patriotism and profits.
For some companies, money talks. No amount of American-themed beer cans or highly targeted ads can hide the fact that many iconic American brands have switched to outsourcing their goods in exchange for cheap labor. Let’s take a look at 15 brands that might ooze red, white, and blue but are actually made outside U.S. borders.
1. Rawlings baseballs
 America’s sport uses baseballs made in Costa Rica. | iStock.com/poetic_disorder
Beer, brats, and a solid nine innings of good, wholesome competition: The game of baseball is pure American. The ball, however, is a different story. The only factory authorized to supply Major League Baseball is in the town of Terriaba in central Costa Rica. Rawlings Sporting Goods has an exclusive contract with the MLB, and once each ball receives its 108 stitches, the baseballs are sent to Miami and transported all across the country.

2. Ford F-150
 Like many vehicles, the Ford F-150 is not made in America. | Ford
Ford is synonymous with the Motor City of Detroit and is quintessentially American. In fact, a recent Cars.com survey showed that the F-150 is a vehicle most likely to be assumed as “American” by the public. But only 60% of parts are actually made in America. The rest is outsourced to places, such as Mexico and Canada.
Is there any 100% American-made car? Not really. The Jeep Wrangler and Jeep Cherokee top the list for the most American cars of 2017. About 74% of Wrangler and 70% of Cherokee parts are domestic, according to Cars.com. All engines and nearly all transmissions for the Wrangler and Cherokee hail from the U.S.

3. Barbie dolls
 Barbies have not been made in the U.S. since the 1950s. | Mattel.com
Iconic Barbie dolls swept the nation, making Ken and Barbie a picture-perfect American couple. However, these dolls were made virtually everywhere but the United States. Mattel manufactures most of its products overseas. During the 1960s and early ’70s they were made in Japan. After that, they were made in Hong Kong and Mexico.
Collectors have learned to use the “made in” sticker to determine whether they have a vintage doll. What does a vintage Barbie run? The first Barbie doll sold for $27,450 at an auction, according to Good Housekeeping.
Next: The King of Beers sold its soul.
4. Budweiser

Clydesdales and red, white, and blue-themed cans send a poignant message that Budweiser is American to the last sip. But the brewery with German roots is now owned by Belgium company InBev. It bought the brand from Anheuser-Busch for $52 billion back in 2008 in an effort to make the brew more marketable globally.
Once Coors sold out to Canadian brewer Molson in 2005, Yuengling became the oldest and largest American brewery in the country. It has been family-owned for two centuries.
Next: Our greatest American symbol is not made in America.
5. American flags

All signs point to money when we consider why most American flags are produced in China. Flags made in China cost significantly less than ones produced in here at home. An estimated $3.3 million worth of American flags are imported from Beijing each year. Legislation was since passed banning the U.S. military from purchasing flags not made in America.

6. Levi’s

It’s highly unlikely we see a “Made in America” tag on any denim jean nowadays. Levi’s jeans are seemingly as American as apple pie — but only in our minds. Its headquarters is in San Francisco, but the jeans are actually made Asia, Latin America, and Haiti. Only one style is made in Texas from fabric in North Carolina
Next: Chuck Taylors
7. Converse
 Shoes from Converse | Converse
Converse Chuck Taylors were once the go-to basketball shoe for players in the 1960’s and ’70s. Even celebrities, such as Kurt Cobain, The Rolling Stones, and Olympic athletes, sported Chucks in their day. But as other, more high-tech shoes hit the market, Converse lost its stronghold. Its American manufacturing reputation quickly followed suit. It went bankrupt in 2001 and was bought by Nike in 2003, which promptly switched all production to Indonesia.

8. Monopoly pieces

You haven’t really lived until you’ve endured an endless game of Monopoly with your relatives. And what better way to learn about capitalism than to finagle a way to invest in Marvin Gardens, Park Place, and St. James Place? However, most of the iconic game pieces are made in Ireland, according to The Street.
Next: Craftsman and Sears
9. Craftsman tools

Craftsman Tools and Sears faced a class-action lawsuit in 2004 for wrongly labeling products as “Made in the USA” and attempting to sway American buyers with a patriotic purchase. In reality, many of Craftsman’s metal parts were made in China, Austria, and Denmark. The Federal Trade Commission prohibits using such a claim unless all of the product is American made.
Next: Guitars used by legends are not made in America. 
10. Fender Stratocaster

The Fender Stratocaster is an iconic guitar made even more famous by American rock legends, such as Buddy Holly, Jimmy Hendrix, Eric Clapton, and John Mayer. Although Fender still does craft an American-made version, the standard — and therefore cheaper — version is made in Mexico. The standard version starts at a paltry $599, whereas the American Elite nears $2,000.

11. Samsonite Luggage
 Samsonite was once headquartered Denver before it outsourced its products. | Mrporter.com
What started as a brick-and-mortar retail business in Denver was transitioned to Hong Kong after a profit slip in the 2000s. Most Samsonite suitcases hail from Europe, India, China, and Vietnam now that it left the U.S. But Samsonite is the world largest luggage retailer, and 40% of its business comes from the U.S. Its recent purchase of American suitcase manufacturer, Tumi, could mean it’s gearing up to bring work back to the States to compete in the ever-growing e-commerce realm.
Next: The company that invented portable electric drills
12. Black & Decker
 Many Black & Decker tools are made in China. | Amazon.com
The portable electric drill was invented by Black & Decker in its Baltimore machine shop in 1917. While some activity still occurs in Baltimore and North America, most of its manufacturing is done in China. Things could come full circle, however. Earlier this year, Stanley Black & Decker announced plans to move more manufacturing back to the U.S. from overseas after acquiring Craftsman from Sears.

13. Olympic Uniforms

Business mogul Ralph Lauren caught a lot of flak after rumors circulated regarding his 2012 Team U.S.A. Olympic uniforms. Apparently, the iconic U.S uniforms were made in China — much like all of Polo Ralph Lauren products are. Still, the U.S. Olympic committee stood by the sponsorship deal with Polo Ralph Lauren as they took heat for outsourcing an opportunity to highlight American companies and their workers, calling Ralph Lauren “an iconic American company.”
Next: The Christmas spirit is in China.
14. Christmas lights
 Most Christmas decorations are not made in America. | Columbia Pictures
Yiwu is a small city in China that produces 60% of the world’s Christmas decorations. There are 600 factories in this town that make the LED lights, Santa hats, and tinsel people display in their homes every December. Thus, the majority of your Christmas decorations probably aren’t made in America.
Next: Speakers
15. Beats Electronics
 Products from Beats Electronics are outsourced to China. | Amazon
Beats Electronics is known for stylish headphones and speakers. Founded by rapper Dr. Dre, it’s headquartered in California but was bought by Apple in 2014. Just like many others on this list, the electronics are mostly manufactured overseas for cost efficiency. Beats headphones are priced at around $200, but when you break it down the product only costs about $20 to make.

Mattel manufactures most of its products overseas. During the 1960s and early ’70s they were made in Japan. After that, they were made in Hong Kong and Mexico.
Collectors have learned to use the “made in” sticker to determine whether they have a vintage doll. What does a vintage Barbie run? The first Barbie doll sold for $27,450 at an auction, according to Good Housekeeping.

4. Budweiser

Clydesdales and red, white, and blue-themed cans send a poignant message that Budweiser is American to the last sip. But the brewery with German roots is now owned by Belgium company InBev. It bought the brand from Anheuser-Busch for $52 billion back in 2008 in an effort to make the brew more marketable globally.
Once Coors sold out to Canadian brewer Molson in 2005, Yuengling became the oldest and largest American brewery in the country. It has been family-owned for two centuries.

All signs point to money when we consider why most American flags are produced in China. Flags made in China cost significantly less than ones produced in here at home. An estimated $3.3 million worth of American flags are imported from Beijing each year. Legislation was since passed banning the U.S. military from purchasing flags not made in America.

It’s highly unlikely we see a “Made in America” tag on any denim jean nowadays. Levi’s jeans are seemingly as American as apple pie — but only in our minds. Its headquarters is in San Francisco, but the jeans are actually made Asia, Latin America, and Haiti. Only one style is made in Texas from fabric in North Carolina

Converse Chuck Taylors were once the go-to basketball shoe for players in the 1960’s and ’70s. Even celebrities, such as Kurt Cobain, The Rolling Stones, and Olympic athletes, sported Chucks in their day. But as other, more high-tech shoes hit the market, Converse lost its stronghold. Its American manufacturing reputation quickly followed suit. It went bankrupt in 2001 and was bought by Nike in 2003, which promptly switched all production to Indonesia.

You haven’t really lived until you’ve endured an endless game of Monopoly with your relatives. And what better way to learn about capitalism than to finagle a way to invest in Marvin Gardens, Park Place, and St. James Place? However, most of the iconic game pieces are made in Ireland, according to The Street.

Craftsman Tools and Sears faced a class-action lawsuit in 2004 for wrongly labeling products as “Made in the USA” and attempting to sway American buyers with a patriotic purchase. In reality, many of Craftsman’s metal parts were made in China, Austria, and Denmark. The Federal Trade Commission prohibits using such a claim unless all of the product is American made.

The Fender Stratocaster is an iconic guitar made even more famous by American rock legends, such as Buddy Holly, Jimmy Hendrix, Eric Clapton, and John Mayer. Although Fender still does craft an American-made version, the standard — and therefore cheaper — version is made in Mexico. The standard version starts at a paltry $599, whereas the American Elite nears $2,000.

What started as a brick-and-mortar retail business in Denver was transitioned to Hong Kong after a profit slip in the 2000s. Most Samsonite suitcases hail from Europe, India, China, and Vietnam now that it left the U.S. But Samsonite is the world largest luggage retailer, and 40% of its business comes from the U.S. Its recent purchase of American suitcase manufacturer, Tumi, could mean it’s gearing up to bring work back to the States to compete in the ever-growing e-commerce realm.

The portable electric drill was invented by Black & Decker in its Baltimore machine shop in 1917. While some activity still occurs in Baltimore and North America, most of its manufacturing is done in China. Things could come full circle, however. Earlier this year, Stanley Black & Decker announced plans to move more manufacturing back to the U.S. from overseas after acquiring Craftsman from Sears.

Business mogul Ralph Lauren caught a lot of flak after rumors circulated regarding his 2012 Team U.S.A. Olympic uniforms. Apparently, the iconic U.S uniforms were made in China — much like all of Polo Ralph Lauren products are. Still, the U.S. Olympic committee stood by the sponsorship deal with Polo Ralph Lauren as they took heat for outsourcing an opportunity to highlight American companies and their workers, calling Ralph Lauren “an iconic American company.”

14. Christmas lights

Yiwu is a small city in China that produces 60% of the world’s Christmas decorations. There are 600 factories in this town that make the LED lights, Santa hats, and tinsel people display in their homes every December. Thus, the majority of your Christmas decorations probably aren’t made in America.

15. Beats Electronics
 Products from Beats Electronics are outsourced to China. | Amazon
Beats Electronics is known for stylish headphones and speakers. Founded by rapper Dr. Dre, it’s headquartered in California but was bought by Apple in 2014. Just like many others on this list, the electronics are mostly manufactured overseas for cost efficiency. Beats headphones are priced at around $200, but when you break it down the product only costs about $20 to make.

Ralph Lauren: New Faces New Laces - Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Ralph Lauren: New Faces New LacesJun.27.17 | About: Ralph Lauren (RL) Alisa Kazimirchik Long/short equity, valueSummaryRalph Lauren’s stock is near its 2 year lows having lost 44.7% since the appointment of the recent CEO Stefan Lauren.It is equally evident the market drags the company down and there are lots of stuff to be done to rebound.To stay afloat, the company should jump above its head.Asfor now, my recommendation is to hold the stock tightly.Ralph Lauren (RL) is a premium segment’s player with the wholesale, retail and license revenue streams. And while the products the company offers are highly diversified, all of them do belong to the market, which is currently under the massive pressure thanks to the challenges to be mentioned above. That transitions to the weak growth figures, sagging margins and unpleasant profitability ratios. It is a good question, whether it will be possible for such an experienced and highly recognizable brand to stay afloat. I do see some positive signs due to its 2017’s operational improvements, mentioned in the latest earnings call. However, I see the risk associated with the new CEO’s appointment as well as his ability to bring the metrics to the best. Stock’s performance For the 2-year period, pictured below, it is clearly seen the RL’s stock fell by 44.7%. Not to dig deep into the history, the company’s “health” is highly correlated with the “health” of its father-founder, Ralph Lauren. To name a few reasons of why the stock plummets, below are my modest attempts:  The top lines growth is very questionable, meaning the brand is losing its historical attractiveness as well as not delivering properly to its customer’s base. The owner and the head of the company is looking for a heir to his throne, but once he has already made a poor choice.  The appointment of Stefan Larsson, the CEO for the 2-year period happening between the end of 2015 and the middle of 2017, has led the stock back to the 2009 year’s levels. Not surprisingly, the next appointment of Patrice Louvet from the P&G’s beauty and care unit, who is fully equipped with the mindset of a FMCG’s guru, is hardly greeted with relief. It is seen on the chart below as a sharp drop at the end of May’17. I would like to point out the Ralph Lauren’s closest competitors are no good, either. We will discuss the Michael Kors’ business (KORS) a bit later, and as for now the fact is its stock has gone down by 25.3% within the last 2-year period. And the Philips-Van Heusen Corp. (PVH) has led its stock to lose 6.4% for the same time frame.


 (Source: Google Finance) Market conditions and company’s strategy As the Michael Kors’ business is very similar to one of Ralph Lauren’s, it is plain to see the major threats are similar as well. As was stated in the Kenra Investors’ article, KORS has made it to the informative messages on the market conditions happening in the sector. The key difficulties are:  Overcapacity in the apparel’s sector with the premium brand’s value weakening. Discounts to keep the revenue afloat, harming the comp’s growth and margins altogether. The shift to digital with such players as Amazon (AMZN) and RealReal, which leads to the lower pricing power of the premium segment’s players.  Both RL and KORS have started turnaround strategies, although from the different intrinsic levels. Ralph Lauren’s management has lowered inventory levels by 30%, reduced the number of SKUs by 20%, shortened the lead times and cut the fleet by 20 stores for the 4Q 2017. It seems to me the only thing to be really proud of in the short run is the gross margin of 57.9%, up by 110 basis points on a YOY basis. The Michael Kors’ strategy, although not completely similar, includes the same steps to get back to where it was three years earlier. Company’s financials When we have mentioned different intrinsic levels the peers should start from, we have meant the different growth rates in the past. While the RL’s revenue streams were up by maximum of 9% since 2014, both PVH and KORS were showing growth figures of 35% and 52%, respectively. That stands for the brand recognition and loyalty base, as well. 

 (Source: Morningstar.com) In terms of its profitability metrics, the company is the weakest player on earth having negative ROA and ROE figures as of March’17. Here again, we should spot the difference between the RL’s and KORS’ positions within the last 4-year period. 
 This is interesting as the company has made some attempts to fight the market in the last couple years. As of 2015 and 2016 the CFO’s growth figures were -1.4% and 12.6%, respectively. The right time to make redeployment is now, when it again comes to the negative cash from operations’ growth of 5.4% and the declining free cash flow’s growth of 13.5%. 

 (Source: Morningstar.com) Valuation In order to shed some light on the market’s sentiments in the face of the fast changing environment, I would say the RL’s valuation multiples are a complete disaster. Currently it has a negative PE of -58.4, which is not even stated on the Morningstar.com web-site. It could be compared with the RL’s 5-year average PE ratio of 21.2 or the current market’s ratio of 25.3. Moving further, Ralph is doubly weaker than it was before having the 5-year average P/B ratio of 3.3 versus the current 1.8. The only thing that could be somehow appealing to me is its dividend yield to be twice as big as the industry’s average of 1.4%. 

 (Source: Morningstar.com) Next steps I am not a big fan of such premium goods as the company offers. However, I would say it without a second thought: the company might have a bright future in the end. It has a strong balance sheet, meaning it has a strong ground to rebuild itself once more. The next steps depend on the way chosen by the management: it should either rebuild its brand in order to be attractive to younger public with less money or continue performing as a premium and scarce brand, but work on both its quality and directed marketing.
 Conclusion: Although the Ralph Lauren should put its cardinal turnaround strategy into practice, I am strongly convinced it would take a long time to go. Finally, as the probability of being successful or going bankrupt is nearly similar, I suggest the best advice is to stay tuned and have a bit more patience. Thus, my recommendation is to hold the stock for now.

History[edit]




Polo Ralph Lauren – the flagship brand of the company.


The Ralph Lauren Corporation started in 1967 with men's ties. At 28 years-old, Lauren worked for the tie manufacturer, Beau Brummell. He persuaded the company's president to let him start his own line. Drawing on his interests in sports, Lauren named his first full line of menswear ‘Polo’ in 1968. He worked out of a single "drawer" from a showroom in the Empire State Building and made deliveries to stores himself.[4]
By 1969, the Manhattan department store Bloomingdale's sold Lauren's men line exclusively. It was the first time that Bloomingdale's had given a designer his own in-store shop. In 1971, Ralph Lauren Corporation launched a line of tailored shirts for women, which introduced the Polo player emblem, appearing on the shirt cuff. The first full women's collection was launched the following year.[5]
1971 also marked the opening of Ralph Lauren's store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California, his first freestanding store.[citation needed] In 1977 Ralph Lauren Corporation introduced a signature cotton mesh Polo shirt in various colours. Featuring the polo player logo on the chest, the shirt became emblematic of the preppy look—one of Lauren's signature style.[citation needed]
In 1974, Ralph Lauren outfitted the male cast of The Great Gatsby in costumes chosen from his Polo line - a 1920s-style series of men's suits and sweaters, except for the pink suit which Lauren designed especially for Robert Redford’s Jay Gatsby. In 1977, Diane Keaton and Woody Allen wore Lauren's clothes in the Oscar-winning film, Annie Hall.[6]
In 1978, the first Ralph Lauren fragrances, produced by Warner-Lauren, Ltd were launched at Bloomingdale's. Lauren for women, and Polo the men's cologne. This was the first time that a designer introduced two fragrances – one for men and one for women – simultaneously.[citation needed]
The company entered the European market, and went international, in 1981 with the opening of the first freestanding store in New Bond Street in the West End of London, England. Lauren opened his first flagship in the Rhinelander mansion, on Madison Avenue and 72nd Street in New York City in 1986.[7] On June 12, 1997, the company becomes a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange.[8]
The 98-seat restaurant, RL, opened in March 1999 in a newly-constructed building adjacent to the largest Ralph Lauren store at the corner of Chicago and Michigan Avenues. It was followed by the opening of two additional restaurants – Ralph's at 173 Boulevard Saint Germain Paris store in 2010 and The Polo Bar at Polo's store in New York in 2015.[9]
The company launched its website and online shop in 2000 as polo.com by RL Media (a cooperation between Ralph Lauren and NBC). In 2007, Ralph Lauren Corporation acquired the NBC share of RL Media and the website was relaunched as ralphlauren.com. In September 2015, it was announced that Stefan Larsson would replace the company's founder, Ralph Lauren, as CEO in November. Lauren will stay on as executive chairman and chief creative officer.[10][11]
In February 2017 it was announced that Larsson had agreed to leave his position as CEO effective May 1, 2017 due to differences with Lauren.[12] On May 17, 2017, Ralph Lauren named Patrice Louvet President and Chief Executive Officer.[13] Louvet most recently served as Group President, Global Beauty at Procter & Gamble (P&G).[14] He will take over on July 17, 2017.[15][16][17]

History[edit]




Polo Ralph Lauren – the flagship brand of the company.


The Ralph Lauren Corporation started in 1967 with men's ties. At 28 years-old, Lauren worked for the tie manufacturer, Beau Brummell. He persuaded the company's president to let him start his own line. Drawing on his interests in sports, Lauren named his first full line of menswear ‘Polo’ in 1968. He worked out of a single "drawer" from a showroom in the Empire State Building and made deliveries to stores himself.[4]
By 1969, the Manhattan department store Bloomingdale's sold Lauren's men line exclusively. It was the first time that Bloomingdale's had given a designer his own in-store shop. In 1971, Ralph Lauren Corporation launched a line of tailored shirts for women, which introduced the Polo player emblem, appearing on the shirt cuff. The first full women's collection was launched the following year.[5]
1971 also marked the opening of Ralph Lauren's store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California, his first freestanding store.[citation needed] In 1977 Ralph Lauren Corporation introduced a signature cotton mesh Polo shirt in various colours. Featuring the polo player logo on the chest, the shirt became emblematic of the preppy look—one of Lauren's signature style.[citation needed]
In 1974, Ralph Lauren outfitted the male cast of The Great Gatsby in costumes chosen from his Polo line - a 1920s-style series of men's suits and sweaters, except for the pink suit which Lauren designed especially for Robert Redford’s Jay Gatsby. In 1977, Diane Keaton and Woody Allen wore Lauren's clothes in the Oscar-winning film, Annie Hall.[6]
In 1978, the first Ralph Lauren fragrances, produced by Warner-Lauren, Ltd were launched at Bloomingdale's. Lauren for women, and Polo the men's cologne. This was the first time that a designer introduced two fragrances – one for men and one for women – simultaneously.[citation needed]
The company entered the European market, and went international, in 1981 with the opening of the first freestanding store in New Bond Street in the West End of London, England. Lauren opened his first flagship in the Rhinelander mansion, on Madison Avenue and 72nd Street in New York City in 1986.[7] On June 12, 1997, the company becomes a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange.[8]
The 98-seat restaurant, RL, opened in March 1999 in a newly-constructed building adjacent to the largest Ralph Lauren store at the corner of Chicago and Michigan Avenues. It was followed by the opening of two additional restaurants – Ralph's at 173 Boulevard Saint Germain Paris store in 2010 and The Polo Bar at Polo's store in New York in 2015.[9]
The company launched its website and online shop in 2000 as polo.com by RL Media (a cooperation between Ralph Lauren and NBC). In 2007, Ralph Lauren Corporation acquired the NBC share of RL Media and the website was relaunched as ralphlauren.com. In September 2015, it was announced that Stefan Larsson would replace the company's founder, Ralph Lauren, as CEO in November. Lauren will stay on as executive chairman and chief creative officer.[10][11]
In February 2017 it was announced that Larsson had agreed to leave his position as CEO effective May 1, 2017 due to differences with Lauren.[12] On May 17, 2017, Ralph Lauren named Patrice Louvet President and Chief Executive Officer.[13] Louvet most recently served as Group President, Global Beauty at Procter & Gamble (P&G).[14] He will take over on July 17, 2017.[15][16][17]

History[edit]




Polo Ralph Lauren – the flagship brand of the company.


The Ralph Lauren Corporation started in 1967 with men's ties. At 28 years-old, Lauren worked for the tie manufacturer, Beau Brummell. He persuaded the company's president to let him start his own line. Drawing on his interests in sports, Lauren named his first full line of menswear ‘Polo’ in 1968. He worked out of a single "drawer" from a showroom in the Empire State Building and made deliveries to stores himself.[4]
By 1969, the Manhattan department store Bloomingdale's sold Lauren's men line exclusively. It was the first time that Bloomingdale's had given a designer his own in-store shop. In 1971, Ralph Lauren Corporation launched a line of tailored shirts for women, which introduced the Polo player emblem, appearing on the shirt cuff. The first full women's collection was launched the following year.[5]
1971 also marked the opening of Ralph Lauren's store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California, his first freestanding store.[citation needed] In 1977 Ralph Lauren Corporation introduced a signature cotton mesh Polo shirt in various colours. Featuring the polo player logo on the chest, the shirt became emblematic of the preppy look—one of Lauren's signature style.[citation needed]
In 1974, Ralph Lauren outfitted the male cast of The Great Gatsby in costumes chosen from his Polo line - a 1920s-style series of men's suits and sweaters, except for the pink suit which Lauren designed especially for Robert Redford’s Jay Gatsby. In 1977, Diane Keaton and Woody Allen wore Lauren's clothes in the Oscar-winning film, Annie Hall.[6]
In 1978, the first Ralph Lauren fragrances, produced by Warner-Lauren, Ltd were launched at Bloomingdale's. Lauren for women, and Polo the men's cologne. This was the first time that a designer introduced two fragrances – one for men and one for women – simultaneously.[citation needed]
The company entered the European market, and went international, in 1981 with the opening of the first freestanding store in New Bond Street in the West End of London, England. Lauren opened his first flagship in the Rhinelander mansion, on Madison Avenue and 72nd Street in New York City in 1986.[7] On June 12, 1997, the company becomes a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange.[8]
The 98-seat restaurant, RL, opened in March 1999 in a newly-constructed building adjacent to the largest Ralph Lauren store at the corner of Chicago and Michigan Avenues. It was followed by the opening of two additional restaurants – Ralph's at 173 Boulevard Saint Germain Paris store in 2010 and The Polo Bar at Polo's store in New York in 2015.[9]
The company launched its website and online shop in 2000 as polo.com by RL Media (a cooperation between Ralph Lauren and NBC). In 2007, Ralph Lauren Corporation acquired the NBC share of RL Media and the website was relaunched as ralphlauren.com. In September 2015, it was announced that Stefan Larsson would replace the company's founder, Ralph Lauren, as CEO in November. Lauren will stay on as executive chairman and chief creative officer.[10][11]
In February 2017 it was announced that Larsson had agreed to leave his position as CEO effective May 1, 2017 due to differences with Lauren.[12] On May 17, 2017, Ralph Lauren named Patrice Louvet President and Chief Executive Officer.[13] Louvet most recently served as Group President, Global Beauty at Procter & Gamble (P&G).[14] He will take over on July 17, 2017.[15][16][17]

History[edit]




Polo Ralph Lauren – the flagship brand of the company.


The Ralph Lauren Corporation started in 1967 with men's ties. At 28 years-old, Lauren worked for the tie manufacturer, Beau Brummell. He persuaded the company's president to let him start his own line. Drawing on his interests in sports, Lauren named his first full line of menswear ‘Polo’ in 1968. He worked out of a single "drawer" from a showroom in the Empire State Building and made deliveries to stores himself.[4]
By 1969, the Manhattan department store Bloomingdale's sold Lauren's men line exclusively. It was the first time that Bloomingdale's had given a designer his own in-store shop. In 1971, Ralph Lauren Corporation launched a line of tailored shirts for women, which introduced the Polo player emblem, appearing on the shirt cuff. The first full women's collection was launched the following year.[5]
1971 also marked the opening of Ralph Lauren's store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California, his first freestanding store.[citation needed] In 1977 Ralph Lauren Corporation introduced a signature cotton mesh Polo shirt in various colours. Featuring the polo player logo on the chest, the shirt became emblematic of the preppy look—one of Lauren's signature style.[citation needed]
In 1974, Ralph Lauren outfitted the male cast of The Great Gatsby in costumes chosen from his Polo line - a 1920s-style series of men's suits and sweaters, except for the pink suit which Lauren designed especially for Robert Redford’s Jay Gatsby. In 1977, Diane Keaton and Woody Allen wore Lauren's clothes in the Oscar-winning film, Annie Hall.[6]
In 1978, the first Ralph Lauren fragrances, produced by Warner-Lauren, Ltd were launched at Bloomingdale's. Lauren for women, and Polo the men's cologne. This was the first time that a designer introduced two fragrances – one for men and one for women – simultaneously.[citation needed]
The company entered the European market, and went international, in 1981 with the opening of the first freestanding store in New Bond Street in the West End of London, England. Lauren opened his first flagship in the Rhinelander mansion, on Madison Avenue and 72nd Street in New York City in 1986.[7] On June 12, 1997, the company becomes a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange.[8]
The 98-seat restaurant, RL, opened in March 1999 in a newly-constructed building adjacent to the largest Ralph Lauren store at the corner of Chicago and Michigan Avenues. It was followed by the opening of two additional restaurants – Ralph's at 173 Boulevard Saint Germain Paris store in 2010 and The Polo Bar at Polo's store in New York in 2015.[9]
The company launched its website and online shop in 2000 as polo.com by RL Media (a cooperation between Ralph Lauren and NBC). In 2007, Ralph Lauren Corporation acquired the NBC share of RL Media and the website was relaunched as ralphlauren.com. In September 2015, it was announced that Stefan Larsson would replace the company's founder, Ralph Lauren, as CEO in November. Lauren will stay on as executive chairman and chief creative officer.[10][11]
In February 2017 it was announced that Larsson had agreed to leave his position as CEO effective May 1, 2017 due to differences with Lauren.[12] On May 17, 2017, Ralph Lauren named Patrice Louvet President and Chief Executive Officer.[13] Louvet most recently served as Group President, Global Beauty at Procter & Gamble (P&G).[14] He will take over on July 17, 2017.[15][16][17]

History[edit]




Polo Ralph Lauren – the flagship brand of the company.


The Ralph Lauren Corporation started in 1967 with men's ties. At 28 years-old, Lauren worked for the tie manufacturer, Beau Brummell. He persuaded the company's president to let him start his own line. Drawing on his interests in sports, Lauren named his first full line of menswear ‘Polo’ in 1968. He worked out of a single "drawer" from a showroom in the Empire State Building and made deliveries to stores himself.[4]
By 1969, the Manhattan department store Bloomingdale's sold Lauren's men line exclusively. It was the first time that Bloomingdale's had given a designer his own in-store shop. In 1971, Ralph Lauren Corporation launched a line of tailored shirts for women, which introduced the Polo player emblem, appearing on the shirt cuff. The first full women's collection was launched the following year.[5]
1971 also marked the opening of Ralph Lauren's store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California, his first freestanding store.[citation needed] In 1977 Ralph Lauren Corporation introduced a signature cotton mesh Polo shirt in various colours. Featuring the polo player logo on the chest, the shirt became emblematic of the preppy look—one of Lauren's signature style.[citation needed]
In 1974, Ralph Lauren outfitted the male cast of The Great Gatsby in costumes chosen from his Polo line - a 1920s-style series of men's suits and sweaters, except for the pink suit which Lauren designed especially for Robert Redford’s Jay Gatsby. In 1977, Diane Keaton and Woody Allen wore Lauren's clothes in the Oscar-winning film, Annie Hall.[6]
In 1978, the first Ralph Lauren fragrances, produced by Warner-Lauren, Ltd were launched at Bloomingdale's. Lauren for women, and Polo the men's cologne. This was the first time that a designer introduced two fragrances – one for men and one for women – simultaneously.[citation needed]
The company entered the European market, and went international, in 1981 with the opening of the first freestanding store in New Bond Street in the West End of London, England. Lauren opened his first flagship in the Rhinelander mansion, on Madison Avenue and 72nd Street in New York City in 1986.[7] On June 12, 1997, the company becomes a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange.[8]
The 98-seat restaurant, RL, opened in March 1999 in a newly-constructed building adjacent to the largest Ralph Lauren store at the corner of Chicago and Michigan Avenues. It was followed by the opening of two additional restaurants – Ralph's at 173 Boulevard Saint Germain Paris store in 2010 and The Polo Bar at Polo's store in New York in 2015.[9]
The company launched its website and online shop in 2000 as polo.com by RL Media (a cooperation between Ralph Lauren and NBC). In 2007, Ralph Lauren Corporation acquired the NBC share of RL Media and the website was relaunched as ralphlauren.com. In September 2015, it was announced that Stefan Larsson would replace the company's founder, Ralph Lauren, as CEO in November. Lauren will stay on as executive chairman and chief creative officer.[10][11]
In February 2017 it was announced that Larsson had agreed to leave his position as CEO effective May 1, 2017 due to differences with Lauren.[12] On May 17, 2017, Ralph Lauren named Patrice Louvet President and Chief Executive Officer.[13] Louvet most recently served as Group President, Global Beauty at Procter & Gamble (P&G).[14] He will take over on July 17, 2017.[15][16][17]

History[edit]




Polo Ralph Lauren – the flagship brand of the company.


The Ralph Lauren Corporation started in 1967 with men's ties. At 28 years-old, Lauren worked for the tie manufacturer, Beau Brummell. He persuaded the company's president to let him start his own line. Drawing on his interests in sports, Lauren named his first full line of menswear ‘Polo’ in 1968. He worked out of a single "drawer" from a showroom in the Empire State Building and made deliveries to stores himself.[4]
By 1969, the Manhattan department store Bloomingdale's sold Lauren's men line exclusively. It was the first time that Bloomingdale's had given a designer his own in-store shop. In 1971, Ralph Lauren Corporation launched a line of tailored shirts for women, which introduced the Polo player emblem, appearing on the shirt cuff. The first full women's collection was launched the following year.[5]
1971 also marked the opening of Ralph Lauren's store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California, his first freestanding store.[citation needed] In 1977 Ralph Lauren Corporation introduced a signature cotton mesh Polo shirt in various colours. Featuring the polo player logo on the chest, the shirt became emblematic of the preppy look—one of Lauren's signature style.[citation needed]
In 1974, Ralph Lauren outfitted the male cast of The Great Gatsby in costumes chosen from his Polo line - a 1920s-style series of men's suits and sweaters, except for the pink suit which Lauren designed especially for Robert Redford’s Jay Gatsby. In 1977, Diane Keaton and Woody Allen wore Lauren's clothes in the Oscar-winning film, Annie Hall.[6]
In 1978, the first Ralph Lauren fragrances, produced by Warner-Lauren, Ltd were launched at Bloomingdale's. Lauren for women, and Polo the men's cologne. This was the first time that a designer introduced two fragrances – one for men and one for women – simultaneously.[citation needed]
The company entered the European market, and went international, in 1981 with the opening of the first freestanding store in New Bond Street in the West End of London, England. Lauren opened his first flagship in the Rhinelander mansion, on Madison Avenue and 72nd Street in New York City in 1986.[7] On June 12, 1997, the company becomes a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange.[8]
The 98-seat restaurant, RL, opened in March 1999 in a newly-constructed building adjacent to the largest Ralph Lauren store at the corner of Chicago and Michigan Avenues. It was followed by the opening of two additional restaurants – Ralph's at 173 Boulevard Saint Germain Paris store in 2010 and The Polo Bar at Polo's store in New York in 2015.[9]
The company launched its website and online shop in 2000 as polo.com by RL Media (a cooperation between Ralph Lauren and NBC). In 2007, Ralph Lauren Corporation acquired the NBC share of RL Media and the website was relaunched as ralphlauren.com. In September 2015, it was announced that Stefan Larsson would replace the company's founder, Ralph Lauren, as CEO in November. Lauren will stay on as executive chairman and chief creative officer.[10][11]
In February 2017 it was announced that Larsson had agreed to leave his position as CEO effective May 1, 2017 due to differences with Lauren.[12] On May 17, 2017, Ralph Lauren named Patrice Louvet President and Chief Executive Officer.[13] Louvet most recently served as Group President, Global Beauty at Procter & Gamble (P&G).[14] He will take over on July 17, 2017.[15][16][17]

History[edit]




Polo Ralph Lauren – the flagship brand of the company.


The Ralph Lauren Corporation started in 1967 with men's ties. At 28 years-old, Lauren worked for the tie manufacturer, Beau Brummell. He persuaded the company's president to let him start his own line. Drawing on his interests in sports, Lauren named his first full line of menswear ‘Polo’ in 1968. He worked out of a single "drawer" from a showroom in the Empire State Building and made deliveries to stores himself.[4]
By 1969, the Manhattan department store Bloomingdale's sold Lauren's men line exclusively. It was the first time that Bloomingdale's had given a designer his own in-store shop. In 1971, Ralph Lauren Corporation launched a line of tailored shirts for women, which introduced the Polo player emblem, appearing on the shirt cuff. The first full women's collection was launched the following year.[5]
1971 also marked the opening of Ralph Lauren's store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California, his first freestanding store.[citation needed] In 1977 Ralph Lauren Corporation introduced a signature cotton mesh Polo shirt in various colours. Featuring the polo player logo on the chest, the shirt became emblematic of the preppy look—one of Lauren's signature style.[citation needed]
In 1974, Ralph Lauren outfitted the male cast of The Great Gatsby in costumes chosen from his Polo line - a 1920s-style series of men's suits and sweaters, except for the pink suit which Lauren designed especially for Robert Redford’s Jay Gatsby. In 1977, Diane Keaton and Woody Allen wore Lauren's clothes in the Oscar-winning film, Annie Hall.[6]
In 1978, the first Ralph Lauren fragrances, produced by Warner-Lauren, Ltd were launched at Bloomingdale's. Lauren for women, and Polo the men's cologne. This was the first time that a designer introduced two fragrances – one for men and one for women – simultaneously.[citation needed]
The company entered the European market, and went international, in 1981 with the opening of the first freestanding store in New Bond Street in the West End of London, England. Lauren opened his first flagship in the Rhinelander mansion, on Madison Avenue and 72nd Street in New York City in 1986.[7] On June 12, 1997, the company becomes a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange.[8]
The 98-seat restaurant, RL, opened in March 1999 in a newly-constructed building adjacent to the largest Ralph Lauren store at the corner of Chicago and Michigan Avenues. It was followed by the opening of two additional restaurants – Ralph's at 173 Boulevard Saint Germain Paris store in 2010 and The Polo Bar at Polo's store in New York in 2015.[9]
The company launched its website and online shop in 2000 as polo.com by RL Media (a cooperation between Ralph Lauren and NBC). In 2007, Ralph Lauren Corporation acquired the NBC share of RL Media and the website was relaunched as ralphlauren.com. In September 2015, it was announced that Stefan Larsson would replace the company's founder, Ralph Lauren, as CEO in November. Lauren will stay on as executive chairman and chief creative officer.[10][11]
In February 2017 it was announced that Larsson had agreed to leave his position as CEO effective May 1, 2017 due to differences with Lauren.[12] On May 17, 2017, Ralph Lauren named Patrice Louvet President and Chief Executive Officer.[13] Louvet most recently served as Group President, Global Beauty at Procter & Gamble (P&G).[14] He will take over on July 17, 2017.[15][16][17]

Best pillows I've ever owned.
December 19, 2016



mscarlata

from 
Long Island, NY



Age: 
30-39


Gender: 
Female



I was a little hesitant after ordering these online and then picking them up, they seemed a little too soft and I wasn't sure how well I would do sleeping on them as I'm used to pillows that are a little more firm. Since using them, I notice that I actually sleep better. They are sooo soft (but they don't sink into nothing when you lay on them- they actually keep their depth, if that makes sense). I would honestly say that these are the best pillows that I've ever owned and I won't be using anything but them from now on.
Yes, I recommend this product.

Not what I expected
December 14, 2016



Liveandlearn

from 




Age: 



Gender: 




Purchased on Black Friday thinking that the price was unbelievable for "Down Alternative" pillows. Ordered 3 medium firm, king sized. Turns out, these are not down alternative but fiber filled. Good for propping up but way too much loft for a good night's sleep. Would not recommend if you are looking for real DA pillows.

Quite Comfortable

JaverQuinata

Age:

Gender: 
Male



I at first bought the pillow cause it was cheap. When I got home later that night and just laid down on my bed with it, I was in such a comfort zone. I could not believe the comfort this pillow had. I went back and bought 3 more, 1 for me and 2 for my parents. These make great gifts for anyone that is a sleeper, and I highly recommend the product.
Yes, I recommend this product.

Gender:

i SHOULD BE A PILLOW EXPERT I like a soft firm pillow I've tried so many I have tried soft, medium, firm and extra firm.I use like three stacking Then finally I found these and extra firm was the one pillow for my head no more stacking and firm king for my legs i'm the person that shows up for a visit with my pillows like a child with a blankety. It's great to have these I've used for while now and they don't flatten out i have neck and back issues so to be comfortable and sleep is amazing finally.

Lumpy after less than a year
September 17, 2016



Kcross

from 




Age: 



Gender: 




Have had these pillows for about 8 months and after several nights of terrible sleep we noticed that the filling in all four of our pillows have bunched up in each pillow creating one large, lumpy ball. Have never washed these pillows as we have them in hypoallergenic pillow protectors, so I know the culprit is not the washer/dryer, but the terrible craftsmanship. Dissapointing considering the price for these pillows and having to replace them already.

The medium density pillows have a dark blue logo. The firm density pillows have a tan logo. The extra firm pillows have a light blue logo.

Macy's Bed & BathA beautiful day begins in bed and bath. From shower rods to bath mats, you’ll find everything you need for the tub—even shower caddies to hold favorite toiletries. A basic liner and shower curtain hooks are the place to start, but don’t miss our selection of decorative shower curtains either. And check out bath rugs to tie together the whole theme. Spend much of your morning at the mirror? Set up the counter with essential bath accessories to help with your routine. Line the sink with lotion dispensers, toothbrush holders and soap dishes. Jars, tissue holders and matching trashcans are a few more getting-ready must-haves. If you run out of cabinet space, add bathroom furniture to the mix; you’ll have the perfect storage spot for hair care products. From brushes and combs to rollers and hair dryers, everyone needs a few styling tools. Discover everything from curling irons to flat irons. And why stop at straighteners? A scale is another electric made for the bathroom.  Looking to update your towel rack? Fluffy bath towels are the perfect addition to your towel bar or linen closet. Fold up all the essentials—from fingertip towels and washcloths to hand towels and bath sheets. Keep an eye out for favorite colors, or look for fashion and beach towels with fantastic patterns. For the spa treatment, also shop luxe bathrobes in amazing shades. With hooded towels for the little ones, kids are sure to have a blast in the bath. And thanks to hampers, cleanup’s a cinch. Ready to decorate the bedroom? If you’re shopping for a dorm room or first apartment, you’ll need bedding basics like pillows and sheets. Then, top off a bed with a decorative comforter, quilt or bedspread. No control over the temp? Layer on blankets and throws for much-needed warmth. To redesign a room, simply switch duvet covers. But for an entirely fresh start, it’s out with the old and in with a brand new bed in a bag. A few great accents like decorative pillows or dramatic bed canopies can also transform your bedroom. And for fans of a canopy, browse the kids bedding or teen bedding section—it can give the bed a complete makeover.Looking to elevate a bed’s comfort level? Add a luxurious feather bed, fiber bed or foam topper over your mattress pad, and explore cozy down comforters for the finishing touch. With bath and bedding collections, Macy’s has the ingredients for restful nights and good mornings. Looking for huge savings or gift ideas? Shop our Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Holiday Gift Guide! Shop Macy’s gift guides for almost every event, including our picks of Mother’s Day gifts and Father’s Day gifts to make mom and dad smile.
