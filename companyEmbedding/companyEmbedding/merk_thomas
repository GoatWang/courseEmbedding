Comedy with a "peoples-hero" twist






                        20 February 2000 | by Paul Lush

                              (London, England)
                        – See all my reviews


 Mark Thomas has made a huge success from his unusual comedy talent.  To understand his programme, you really need an understanding of how the UK Government, big corporation and international leave the UK citizen completely in the dark.  He and his team will hear of an injustice or something that should be brought to public attention.  Through his standup/live recordings/interviews he, well, puts across a very good point to these people that dont care.  Dressing up as Hitler and following around powerful UK minister telling them how much he likes their politics really leaves you in tears of laughter.  Having a friend who works for a large government organisation that is frequently a target for Mark Thomas gives even more of an insight that will always draw me back to his show.  A perfect 10 out of 10.  Keep it up Mark

Forward-Looking Statement


Forward-Looking Statement of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA 
This website of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA (the “company”) includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of the company’s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. There can be no guarantees with respect to pipeline products that the products will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that they will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
					
Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation in the United States and internationally; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances, new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development, including obtaining regulatory approval; the company’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of the company’s patents and other protections for innovative products; and the exposure to litigation, including patent litigation, and/or regulatory actions. 
The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in the company’s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the company’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) available at the SEC’s Internet site (www.sec.gov). 
No Duty to Update  
The information contained in this website was current as of the date presented. The company assumes no duty to update the information to reflect subsequent developments. Consequently, the company will not update the information contained in the website and investors should not rely upon the information as current or accurate after the presentation date.
