Vol. 12. Special titanium Nikon cameras and NASA cameras

This will be the final installment of my review of the history of Nikon cameras.
        In this last edition I will concentrate on camera models that were born of Nikon's highest-grade cameras.
        The discussion will focus on titanium-coated cameras as well as cameras Nikon made for NASA.
        I'm certain that many readers will be seeing this information for the first time.
Titanium and Nikon

When a focal-plane shutter camera with direct optical viewfinder is pointed toward the sun, the lens acts as a magnifying glass and the shutter curtain serves as black paper which was found during experiments performed with children (Caution ! Never look at the sun through a camera. Retina damage and blindness may result.).
          As a result, the sun may burn a hole in a shutter curtain. It is said that normal cloth shutter curtains may be damaged if a camera is pointed toward the sun without the lens cap and with a lens aperture set at brighter than f/8.
          In 1957, Nippon Kogaku K.K. started working on developing a thin, burn-resistant material for shutter curtains.
          The laboratory determined that they should aim for pure titanium sheets used in industry.
          Titanium, which is ultra light and has high flexibility, was regarded as suitable for shutter curtains.
          It was, however, also well known as a material that was difficult to treat. With its improved treatment technology, Nippon Kogaku somehow succeeded in contorting the sticky material into the shape of a shutter curtain. However, Nippon Kogaku had many problems along the way, such as accuracy, scratches, damage, and performance when exposed to low temperatures. They gradually cleared these obstacles and were able to begin using titanium for shutter curtains in 1959, immediately after the announcement of the Nikon F. The Nikon F was an SLR camera, and the mirror prevented the sun from burning a hole in a shutter curtain.
          However, the Nikon F had a mirror up mechanism. With the mirror up, the shutter curtain might be burnt by the sun.
          The Nikon F, which was often used in the titanium curtain experiments, was the first camera to actually incorporate titanium shutter curtains.
          Later, the Nikon SP, which employed the same shutter unit as the Nikon F, also applied titanium shutter curtains.
          This was the beginning of the relationship between Nikon and Titanium.
          Through mass production, Nippon Kogaku refined titanium technology and made it a specialty of theirs.

Discovery of versatility of titanium

The Nikon F2 was introduced in 1971 as the successor to the F. With the F2, titanium was used not only for the shutter curtains, but also for the reflex mirror frame.
          Nippon Kogaku wanted to increase mirror speed without having to strengthen the driving spring.
          By applying titanium for the mirror frame, the F2's mirror unit became lighter and provided a shorter shutter time lag than the F.
          The titanium used for the mirror was 20 times thicker than that used for the shutter curtains. For thicker titanium plates, metal molds were easily blunted via the conventional steel-plate treatment method. New treatment methods for punching and pressing needed to be developed.
          It was the technology for the reflex mirror frame — not for the more well-known shutter curtains — that eventually led to the development of titanium-coated cameras.

Nikon F2 Titan

For many years, it was generally recognized that camera covers were made of brass (copper/zinc alloy).
          As I have mentioned repeatedly in past articles, Nikon cameras have been used in some extremely trying conditions.
          The bodies of virtually all Nikon F and F2 cameras suffered dents after they had been used in the demanding professional photography environment.
          As an experiment, Nippon Kogaku made an F2 body covered by light, durable titanium.
          Although they experienced many difficulties such as in press-treating the finder unit, Nippon Kogaku gained the expertise necessary to produce a titanium cover that both looked good and was durable.
          Unlike today's titanium cameras, the covers of titanium cameras of that day were unpainted and the titanium showed through.
          Following the experimental product, a limited number of models were manufactured and a few models were actually marketed in 1978.
          Users commented that the titanium cover was not suited to professional use because the light color stood out too much and was too reflective.
          In 1979, several hundred of the Nikon F2 Titan (Black) models, with black matte leather-look covers, were manufactured and marketed on a limited basis.
          Later, Nippon Kogaku introduced the F2 titanium body with "Titan" engraved in the cover.
The F2 titanium body, though manufactured and marketed in small quantities, gradually gained acceptance.
          I (Mr. TATENO) heard that the number of bodies produced with "Titan" letters engraved in them was considerably greater than the number of non-engraved bodies.

Nikon F3/T (Titan)








                Nikon F3/T
              



The Nikon F3, the successor to the F2, was released in 1980. Two years later, in 1982, came the Nikon F3 High Eyepoint which enabled users to see the entire viewfield of the finder.
              The High-Eyepoint Viewfinder DE-3 was extremely popular among general photographers, as well as wearers of eyeglasses.
Therefore, Nippon Kogaku decided that the F3 High-Eyepoint should be used as the base body for the titanium version of the F3.
              The F3's body was entirely black. To add the variety of color to their F3-series cameras, Nippon Kogaku manufactured the titanium F3 body painted in the color of titanium.
That was the F3/T, released in 1982. In 1984, the black-painted F3/T models were released and continued to appear on the market longer than titanium color.
              By the way, the viewfinder cover of the F3 Limited (1994) was also made of titanium.
              Unlike the original F3 body, the titanium cover of the F3 Limited enabled an accessory Speedlight to be mounted on the interchangeable finders.
              Titanium was employed for the cover in order to strengthen the accessory shoe.
              We have talked about the titanium bodies of the F2 and F3. Nikon's pioneer titan cameras are superior to those of other manufacturers, in body design and durability as well.
              Competitors who tried to copy Nikon sometimes used negative techniques such as adding materials to improve press-treating.
              Nikon, despite the trouble with press-treating, continued to use pure titanium.

Cameras for a higher cause

                used in Apollo 15
              



After W.W. II, the U.S.A. had been involved in a race for space with the U.S.S.R., to gain ultimate superpower status.
              Both countries continued their work and research, and were able to execute a manned space flight by the 1960's.
              Around this time they had started using cameras for recording.
              At first, NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) used primarily 70mm-format films.
              They found, however, that they needed a more portable camera for more active shooting situations.
              Nikon, whose cameras had a reputation for reliability in the U.S. market, was selected as a special manufacturer of 35mm cameras for NASA.
              Although the Nikon U.S. distributor accepted the order of the special cameras for NASA, a special team at Nippon Kogaku's Ohi Plant took charge of product development.

Space photography








                Nikon Photomic FTN
                used in Apollo 15
              



A camera used in space would be subjected to a vacuum and zero-gravity conditions.
              As the spacecraft compartment is airtight, it is crucial that harmful gas or fire never be generated.
              The camera should be easy to operate for someone wearing gloves.
              And reliability became a major issue.
The rays of the sun and their reflection on the camera body may be stronger than those on the earth's surface, and the weight of cargo aboard the craft should be limited as much as possible for launching, so there's no room for a spare camera in case the main one malfunctions.
In order to meet these demanding conditions, Nippon Kogaku's special product development team used the Nikon F as the base body and made numerous modifications.
              For example, the leather-like body cover generally used for the Nikon F had been changed to a metal plate painted in matte black.
              Adhesive used adhered to NASA specifications.
              For plastic parts, materials generally used for F cameras had to be changed to specified parts.
              The battery chamber was designed to prevent accidental leakage from the camera body. Electrical parts were soldered in accordance with NASA standards.
              The standard thickness of the plating was modified. Dimensions were also changed to accommodate thinner polyester-based films.
              Modifications made to operating parts included an enlarged finger pad for the film advance lever, a larger film rewinding knob, and enlarged film counter figures and windows.
              Interchangeable lenses were also modified.
              The addition of two horns on the focusing ring was the most significant change.
              It made focusing simple as the user needed only to rotate the ring using the horn.
              NASA's standards for shutter accuracy were even more stringent than those of Nikon.

Nikon — and users — benefitted from NASA experience








                Nikon F used in Skylab
              



The technologies Nikon used in developing cameras for NASA finally went into use in 1971.
              The modified F camera and some modified interchangeable lenses were provided to NASA for the Apollo 15 mission.
              Then, in 1973, a modified version of the F camera with a motor drive and modified lens were supplied for use aboard Skylab.









                Nikon F used in Skylab
              



The cameras Nikon developed for use in space exploration are still in use today, and maintenance is still being provided.
              These NASA cameras were of course very costly.
              It is said that Nippon Kogaku took heavy losses. However, these losses were balanced out by the value of the experience in the space project. Nippon Kogaku took what they had learned and used it to improve the reliability and operational performance of Nikon products.
The development of the camera for NASA using the Nikon F body as a base and the development of the Nikon F2 occurred in parallel.
              NASA did not require increasing numbers of the modified F2 cameras, and in fact the camera was never actually manufactured.

F3 and F4 cameras for NASA








                Nikon F3 "Big Camera"
              



After some time had passed, Nikon went to work on camera models for NASA that were based on the F3 body.
              There were the "Small Camera", which was equipped with a motor drive, and the "Big Camera" for long film that were delivered to NASA for use aboard the space shuttle in 1981.
              While the Nikon F3 was still being developed and many issues had yet to be decided, NASA went ahead and formally declared the Nikon F3 to be an official NASA camera.
              The F3 models for NASA, and those for mass consumption, were developed side-by-side at the Ohi Plant.
              Another special team was assigned to the development of the F3 for NASA. The "Big Camera" was equipped with an interchangeable film back and used a thinner special long film for bulk loading.
              Members of the special team needed to concentrate on developing a new technology that would accelerate film advancement.
              After much effort and brainstorming, they solved the problem and succeeded in delivering the cameras for the space shuttle.
              The F3 for NASA had many of the same features as the F3 for mass consumption, including internal parts.
              Compared to the modified F models for NASA, the F3 for NASA was much more similar to the F3 models made for the public.









                Nikon F3 "Small Camera"
              



In 1989, Nikon delivered the modified F4 to NASA. There were only a few small differences between the modified F4 and mass-consumption F4 models.
              Nikon positively applied the experiences obtained during development of NASA cameras to the development of cameras for the general public.
              At the same time, NASA learned about the specifications that were required for the camera's use in space.
              These were the reasons why very few modifications were required for recent NASA cameras.

Nikon a product of its users

In this final issue, we've talked about Nikon's titanium cameras and the cameras they developed for NASA.
          These cameras are tough enough to withstand the most unusual and severe conditions.
          During the Korean War in the 1950's, Nikon cameras gained a reputation for high performance in extremely low temperatures.
          Since then, Nikon cameras have been put to the test in myriad situations around the globe.
          The development of titanium cameras and special cameras for space use were two ways Nikon was able to show its true strength and prowess. These experiences also contributed to a rise in the performance of subsequent Nikon products, thus broadening the user base and increasing consumer confidence.
          This shows how much effect users actually have on the development of Nikon cameras and Nikkor lenses — by relating their own experiences using Nikon products.
          As I look back over the first 11 issues of this column, I see the same thing.
          I firmly believe that Nikon will continue to offer excellent products if it maintains, and improves, this connection with its users.
          This is a heavy responsibility for Nikon to bear, but one that will serve them well in the years to come.
This ends my review of the history of Nikon cameras.
          I'd like to thank you for reading this column, and I hope you'll continue to access Nikon's homepage for more interesting information.

Overall BGIF Emerging Markets Equity Index Fund received a Morningstar Rating of 3 stars for the 3-year period, - stars stars for the 5-year period and - stars stars for the 10-year period, rated against 1722, 1201 and 476 Global Emerging Markets Equity Funds, respectively. Performance results represent past performance and are no guarantee of future results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For each U.S.-domiciled fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingTM based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund&#39;s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive five stars, the next 22.5% receive four stars, the next 35% receive three stars, the next 22.5% receive two stars and the bottom 10% receive one star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morningstar Ratings are for the share classes cited only; other classes may have different ratings.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares ETF and BlackRock Mutual Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


The fund invests a large portion of assets which are denominated in other currencies; hence changes in the relevant exchange rate will affect the value of the investment. Compared to more established economies, the value of investments in developing Emerging Markets may be subject to greater volatility due to differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from economic or political instability.


Important Information
This material is solely for educational purposes, and does not constitute investment advice, or an offer or solicitation to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any shares of any fund (nor shall any such shares be offered or sold to any person) in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of that jurisdiction. This material is not intended for distribution to, or use by, any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution would be unlawful under the securities laws of such.

Current performance may be lower or higher than that shown. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividend and capital gain distributions. The Funds may be exposed to the following non-exhaustive list of risks, including financial derivative instrument risks, currency risk, counterparty defaults and taxation risk. Index performance is shown for illustrative purposes only. You cannot invest directly in an index.

BlackRock Investment Management (UK) Limited is the UK distributor of BGIF. Most of the protections provided by the UK regulatory system, and the compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, will not be available. The BGIF range employs a swing-pricing methodology in order to protect existing investors from the dilution impact of trading costs caused by shareholder activity in the funds.

The published Net Asset Value (NAV) of a fund may include such adjustments which have the potential to distort apparent performance and tracking error.
Subscriptions in BGIF are valid only if made on the basis of the current Prospectus, the most recent financial reports and the Key Investor Information Document, which may not be available to investors in certain jurisdictions where the Fund in question has not been authorised.

Titanium: The Metal Of The Gods

March 22, 2010 




 
Tom Vulcan 





 



  



In our latest installment of our Strategic Metals series, we look at titanium metal, the exceptional metal key to the aerospace industry.

How titanium lives up to its namesake
Why titanium metal was so hard hit in 2009
Investing in titanium’s ‘holy grail’



 
Not many strategic metals have more than four industry associations devoted to it. But titanium does:

French Titanium Association
International Titanium Association
Japan Titanium Society
Interstate Association Titan
Titanium Information Group

 
But perhaps this isn't too surprising for the fourth-most abundant metallic element and ninth-most abundant element in the Earth's crust, or for a metal with such a multiplicity of uses.
On the other hand, it is a little curious, since only 5 percent of all mined and synthetic titanium minerals are actually used to make titanium metal, with the remaining 95 percent used to manufacture titanium dioxide (TiO2).
In this article, we will look only at titanium metal, leaving the subject of titanium dioxide to a future piece.
So, what is it with titanium that makes it so special?
 
The Metal Of The Gods
It seems particularly appropriate that titanium (before it was so named) should originally have been discovered by a man of God—Reverend William Gregor—in Cornwall, England, back in 1790. It wasn't until five years later, however, that the metal was actually named titanium, after the Titans, by the German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth.
One hundred years later, in 1910, American chemist Matthew A. Hunter succeeded in obtaining titanium metal from one of its ores; consequently, he had the first industrial process to extract the metal named after him.
That the metal should be named after the Titans is particularly apt, to a degree that would probably have astounded Professor Klaproth.
Amongst other characteristics, titanium can boast of its:
 

Lightness: Its low density means that it weighs only around 56 percent as much as steel. 

 
 

Data Source: The Engineering ToolBox
 

Strength-to-Weight Ratio: Titanium is the highest of any of today's structured metals.
 
 

Note: ksi = kilo-pounds per square inch (1 ksi = 1,000 psi)
Source: International Titanium Association (ITA)
 

Flexibility: With its low modulus of elasticity (14.9 x 106 psi), about half that of steel, titanium is not only extraordinarily flexible, but it also springs back very strongly after it has been stressed, e.g., when acting as a spring.

 Resistance to Corrosion and Erosion: Titanium is exceptionally resistant to both corrosion and erosion. In the former instance, its naturally forming oxide film protects it against a variety of agents: alkaline media, chlorine and other halides, gases, inorganic salt solutions, organic acids and chemicals, oxidizing mineral acids and water—in all its guises. (It also protects against microbiologically influenced corrosion.) In the case of erosion, titanium's oxide film provides it with strong resistance to anything from abrasion to cavitation and erosion—particularly at high-flow velocities. 
 High Thermal Conductivity: Titanium conducts heat extremely efficiently. 
 Low Coefficient of Expansion: Titanium's low coefficient of expansion makes it much easier to use in combination with ceramics, composites and glass than most other metals.
By any measure, this is quite an exceptional combination of characteristics for one single metal. But as an oxide, too, titanium possesses some very special characteristics; hence the fact that some 95 percent of the titanium mined is turned into TiO2. For starters, titanium dioxide makes the brightest of the white pigments. In addition, TiO2 has not only an extremely high refractive index, but as a powder, it is also a highly effective opacifier, so it is used in everything from paints and paper to plastics, pills, inks and more.
 
Whence Titanium?
Titanium occurs naturally and most commonly in two forms: as ilmenite, or titanium iron oxide (Fe TiO2), and as rutile, or titanium oxide (TiO); their primary sources are mineral sands. (See Zirconium: Not Just Bling.) It is from these two minerals that titanium, in whatever form it's eventually used, is nearly always extracted.

Ilmenite is found mainly in Australia, Canada, Finland, South Africa and the U.S.

Rutile, too, is commonly found in Australia and South Africa, but also India, Sri Lanka and Sierra Leone.
 



*U.S. rutile production included in that for ilmenite above
Source: USGS
 
Ilmenite currently accounts for more than 90 percent of global titanium mineral supply. In order to offer up the titanium it contains, however, ilmenite is nearly always "upgraded" to either synthetic rutile or titanium slag, which are then used in tandem with naturally occurring rutile for the production of titanium.

From Mineral To Metal...
...by way of sponge. The most common first step in the production of titanium metal is to produce titanium sponge, so called because its texture is like that of a natural sea sponge.

This is most usually achieved by chlorinating rutile. Titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) is produced by combining the rutile ore, coke and chlorine. Then, in what's called the Kroll process, this TiCl4 is reduced in an inert atmosphere using magnesium, producing magnesium chloride and titanium sponge. (Historically the Hunter process was used to produce titanium sponge, but now nearly all commercially produced sponge is obtained using the Kroll process.)
The titanium sponge can then be melted, and remelted, a number of times (and in various different ways), either with or without alloying elements (which include aluminum, molybdenum, tin, vanadium and zirconium), to make various titanium alloys or pure forms of the metals itself.

Main Uses Of Titanium Metal
Particularly in the U.S., one of the largest consumers of titanium metal is the aerospace industry, both commercial and defense. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that in 2009, some 76 percent of the metal was used in "aerospace applications." Of the remaining 24 percent, use was made of it in "armor, chemical processing, marine, medical, power generation and sporting goods." In fact, it was only after 1965 that titanium started to be used anywhere other than in the aerospace industry, and over the past 50 years, both the commercial aerospace and defense industries have increased their use of titanium dramatically.

A comparison of the amounts of titanium used in Boeing's commercial aircraft throws considerable light on how important titanium is just to this one manufacturer. The picture is most likely very similar for Airbus in Europe.

In addition to those uses listed by the USGS, other significant applications of titanium include:
 

Architecture and construction
Armaments
Automotive
Chlor-alkali processing
Consumer goods (spectacle frames, watches, cameras, jewelry)
Desalination
Downhole oil & gas

Market Drivers And The Prospects For Titanium Metal
Since the aerospace industry is a prime consumer of titanium, how it fares inevitably affects how the metal does. Understandably, the last couple of years haven't been easy for either.
As the USGS states it: "Delays in aircraft construction and the global economic slowdown in 2009 resulted in a significant drop in titanium sponge metal production, lower prices, and delayed capacity expansion."
Even China, the world's largest titanium sponge producer, felt the pain in 2009. Back at the end of 2008, in its review of that year and the prospects for 2009, Asian Metal could not have put it more bluntly: "It is predicted that there will be no great rebound in 2009" in the Chinese export market. And of the domestic market, Asian Metal wrote: "Chinese titanium sponge production is far greater than demand, and the domestic situation remains grim in 2009."
But it would be a mistake to think that demand from the aerospace industry is the only major driver of titanium metal prices. There are other significant drivers on both the supply and demand sides, not least industrial demand for the metal, which is as significant a driver as demand from the commercial aerospace industry.
Figures from a 2008 report on titanium by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics gave the breakout of titanium mill product use in 2005 as: industry (49 percent of global consumption), commercial aerospace (31 percent), military (10 percent, of which 7 percent was military aerospace), consumer (8 percent) and medical (2 percent). Some four years later, demand for titanium from the steel and industrial equipment industries, as well as demand for its use in military armor, still remains extremely important.
The same report accounts for global consumption of such products in 2005: North America (30 percent), the European Union (24 percent), China (15 percent) and Japan (12 percent). While these last figures are useful indications, consumption in China has risen significantly in the last five years.
On the supply side, capacity (and capacity expansion) has been, and still is, a major driver.
Within the aerospace industry, demand for titanium depends on at least three major factors: commercial aircraft order levels, the increase in the use of titanium in such aircraft—not only as a percentage of all materials used, but also in terms of absolute weight used; and, finally, its use in military aircraft.
Thus the future for titanium metal is subject to at least the following three significant influences: its continuing and increased use in aircraft (both commercial and military), the titanium supply situation, and its continuing consumption in the steel and other industries—particularly in China.
 
Opportunities In Titanium Metal
For those sanguine not only about the continuing and increased use of titanium in aircraft (not least because of the marked improvements in fuel efficiency its use can help provide), but also about China's continuing consumption of titanium, there are a number of ways of participating in the titanium metal market. Setting aside owning the physical metal itself, these range from the production of titanium mineral concentrates all the way to production of the metal itself.
Interestingly, however, unlike with a number of other strategic/minor metals, the universe of investment opportunities is surprisingly circumscribed—not because private titanium-related companies outnumber public ones, but simply because so very few companies exist in this space.
 
Titanium Mineral Concentrates
In the U.S., the two main producers of titanium mineral concentrates are Iluka Resources, Inc., a subsidiary of Australia's Iluka Resources Limited (ASX: ILU) and E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DuPont) (NYSE: DD).
Other major producers around the world, in addition to Iluka and DuPont, include:

Exxaro Resources Limited


NYSE: RTP
Rio Tinto Group


NYSE: BHP
BHP Billiton


Private
Bemax Resources Limited

Tiwest JV


*Owned 50/50 between Tronox Western Australia Pty Ltd and subsidiaries of Exxaro Australia Sands Pty Ltd
 
There are also a number of other, smaller, producers operating in such places as Mozambique (for example Kenmare Resources PLC (LON: KMR) at its Moma mine) and Vietnam. Indeed, in December last year, the fifth mining company to be listed on the Hanoi Stock Exchange was Sai Gon-Quy Nhon Mining Co with a titanium slag plant in the central province of Binh Dinh.
 
Titanium Sponge Producers
While titanium mineral concentrates are to be found in a number of different regions around the globe, currently there are only six countries that actually produce titanium sponge from those concentrates.

Titanium Metal Producers
Of the sponge producers, Russia's VSMPO-AVISMA (VSMPO) is also the world's largest producer of high-quality aerospace titanium. In the U.S., the main high-quality aerospace titanium producer is TIMET (Titanium Metals Corporation). In the industrial sector, the market, in addition to being served by TIMET, is also served by the Japanese ingot producers RTI International Metals, Inc. and UNITI - a joint venture between VSMPO and ATI.
In the U.S., there are three further, very much smaller (in terms of weight), titanium ingot producers: Alcoa Howmet, a subsidiary of Alcoa (NYSE: AA); AlloyWorks, LLC, a private company out of Salisbury, N.C.; and Perryman Company, another private concern, out of Houston, Pa.
 
The Question Of Cost
Anybody looking at the figures for titanium sponge production can only be surprised at just how small they are for such an obviously important metal. In a recent paper, the RAND Corporation noted that: "The titanium market is very small - only one ten-thousandth the size of the steel market." Why?
The answer: Cost. Titanium is very expensive to produce. As RAND puts it: "Titanium is expensive to refine, process, and fabricate. In terms of processing cost per cubic inch, titanium is five times more expensive than aluminum to refine and more than ten times as expensive as aluminum to forge into ingots and to fabricate into finished products ... Fabrication is the most costly processing stage, followed by sponge production."
Apart from simple capital requirements, another major factor involved is energy consumption. It takes a great deal of energy to produce titanium, not only in the initial processing from ore to sponge, but thereafter from sponge to ingot. For some aerospace applications, the sponge may need to be melted and remelted three times before the correct purity is achieved.
 



Source: The RAND Corporation
 
The situation remains as true today as it did back in September 2005 when then president of TIMET, J. Landis Martin, said in a presentation: "We must continue to chase the Holy Grail—that is, a method of producing sponge that is less expensive than the Kroll Process, which dates back to the 1950s."
The search for a process cheaper than the Kroll process is deemed so important (particularly in relation to titanium's use in military aircraft, armor, etc.) that even the likes of DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) is offering funding to develop cheaper processes.
According to a 2007 report from London-based consultant Roskill, at that time, there were at least 29 continuing R&D projects looking at new titanium production processes. Such projects were spread across the globe and included work continuing in Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Africa, the U.K. and the U.S.
Since no one yet has announced that it has discovered the Holy Grail, it is very difficult to know just how far along on the quest any particular project actually is. But for the investor who may be seeking another angle, and a different way, of obtaining exposure to titanium, keeping an eye on what is going on in this space may prove particularly interesting—especially if there were ever a way of getting a slice (through, perhaps, participation in the associated intellectual property or the developing entities) of any modern-day substitutes for the Kroll and Hunter processes.
On the other hand, if a cheaper way of producing titanium sponge is developed, it is a pretty sure-fire thing that use of the metal will increase significantly.
