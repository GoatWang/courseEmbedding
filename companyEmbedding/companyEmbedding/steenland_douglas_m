NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--American International Group, Inc. (NYSE: AIG) today announced that 
      Douglas M. Steenland will succeed Robert S. “Steve” Miller as 
      non-executive Chairman of the AIG Board of Directors, effective July 1, 
      2015.
    


      Mr. Miller has served as Chairman of the AIG Board since July 2010. 
      AIG’s Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that generally an 
      individual should not serve in that role for more than five years. Both 
      Mr. Steenland and Mr. Miller are standing for re-election at AIG’s 
      upcoming annual meeting on May 13, 2015.
    

      “On behalf of the entire board, we would like to thank Steve for his 
      tireless service and outstanding leadership since he was named chairman 
      in 2010, and we all look forward to working with Doug in his new 
      leadership role,” said Suzanne Nora Johnson, chairman of the Nominating 
      and Governance Committee of the AIG Board of Directors, which led the 
      Board’s succession process.
    

      “It has been a great honor to serve as Chairman of the Board during the 
      past five extraordinary years in AIG’s history, and I look forward to 
      continuing to serve on the Board,” Mr. Miller said.
    

      “AIG plays a unique role in the world, helping companies and consumers 
      all over the world manage their risks and realize opportunities,” Mr. 
      Steenland said. “We remain committed to an AIG that is transparent, 
      well-managed, and valued by all of its stakeholders, and it is in that 
      spirit that I deeply appreciate the opportunity to succeed Steve,” Mr. 
      Steenland said.
    

      Mr. Steenland and Mr. Miller joined the AIG Board at the same time, in 
      June 2010. Mr. Steenland is currently Chairman of the Board’s 
      Regulatory, Compliance and Public Policy Committee, and a member of the 
      Board’s Risk and Capital Committee.
    

      Mr. Steenland is the former Chief Executive Officer of Northwest 
      Airlines Corporation, serving from 2004 to 2008, and President, serving 
      from 2001 to 2004. Prior to that, he served in a number of Northwest 
      Airlines executive positions after joining Northwest Airlines in 1991, 
      including Executive Vice President, Chief Corporate Officer, and Senior 
      Vice President and General Counsel. Mr. Steenland retired from Northwest 
      Airlines upon its merger with Delta Air Lines, Inc.
    

      American International Group, Inc. (AIG) is a leading global insurance 
      organization serving customers in more than 100 countries and

Letter from the Chairman
PDF



Dear AIG Shareholder,
I would like to start my letter to you by thanking Peter Hancock for his service as President and Chief Executive Officer. During his tenure at AIG, Peter has tackled the company's most complex issues, including his role in the repayment of AIG's obligations to the U.S. Treasury in full and with a profit. He set the course for AIG to deliver higher quality, more sustainable earnings and dramatically reduced reserve risk. The Board of Directors and I are grateful for his leadership over the seven years he has been with the company.
Peter brought together a highly talented Executive Leadership Team. The Board has great confidence in this team to continue executing against the two-year Strategic Plan as announced in January 2016. We remain committed to our financial targets and objectives, including the return of capital to our shareholders and exceeding our expense reduction targets.
The Board and management team believe strongly that we are on the right strategic path. In fulfilling our fiduciary duties to you, the Board regularly examines strategic options. We previously rejected a potential split of the company between our Commercial and Consumer businesses as the analysis showed this to be value-destructive. This analysis still stands. Beyond the capital demands of such a scenario, we would also be sacrificing the value of AIG's global franchise. Across our Commercial and Consumer platforms, we see opportunities to serve our customers through our broad offering of product solutions. For example, we offer bespoke products that utilize the Commercial Multinational platform for individuals in the Private Client Group and Commercial/Consumer combined solutions for clients serving the shared economy.
Looking ahead, I have great confidence in the future  of the company. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we expect to gain the benefit from actions taken in 2016, with a significantly improved risk profile and a more efficient cost base. Within the businesses, we expect our Consumer business to continue to perform well, and for the operating improvements in Commercial to positively impact financial performance.
The Board is actively engaged in the process of identifying the right individual to serve as CEO and lead the company at this important time. AIG is a world-class insurance company with its best years ahead of it.
The Board and I would like to thank our diligent and hard-working employees around the world for continuing to provide the highest levels of service to our clients. To AIG customers, thank you for choosing AIG as your partner to navigate an ever-changing and challenging world. Everyone at AIG is committed to continually improving our service and products to be our clients' most valued insurer. 
Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your support. We are committed to delivering value to you, both today and long into the future.

Sincerely,

Douglas M. Steenland
Non-Executive Chairman of the Board
