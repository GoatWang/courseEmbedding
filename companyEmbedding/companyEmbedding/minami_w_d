Minami


Minami is committed to the advancement of scientific support for omega-3 nutrition and has participated in 11 human clinical studies. Minami uses the latest omega-3 research to formulate specific ratios of EPA and DHA to support the body and its systems, obtains fish from sustainably managed waters and is the only fish oil in the world to receive EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) status—a highly stringent European standard. 
Minami is also one of the highest-concentrated omega-3s available, so you get more omega-3 nutrition per softgel, which means fewer pills to swallow. With unsurpassed purity, Minami oils go through rigorous in-house and third-party testing and have remarkably low levels of oxidation as well as undetectable levels of dioxins, pesticides and heavy metals such as mercury.

General-purpose type Screen Printer
High specification type Screen Printer

















General purpose, fully automatic high-speed screen printing machine with image recognition device


It is possible to meet various needs of users by customizing.
It is compatible to fine pattern, BGA bump of Φ0.2mm and QFP of 0.3mm lead pitch with the world's top class repetitive positioning accuracy (±0.015mm or less when using image recognition).
Eight axes servo motors are used for a rotary squeegee version machine, and stability is secured for the basic operations where high accuracy is required. Moreover, the basic operational cycle time is shortened to 8 seconds (M Type) by making the linkage of each operation more closely and by software improvement.
Because of simple operation and simple structure, high skill level is not required for the operator.
The direction of PCB conveyor, line configuration (fixed side conveyer) and mask design standards can be freely selected at free of charge so that there is no impact to the user's equipment planning and the existing mask can be used. It can be connected to any type of mounters.
Operator friendly "Windows XP" is used as the OS, and the language can be selected from Japanese, English and Chinese.
By using the rotary squeegee (option), deterioration and the consumption amount of solder can be suppressed. It contributes to manufacturing of high-quality products and also to the cost reduction.

High accuracy special printer
Ball Placer with Screen Printer


























Solder ball placing machine with a built-in high precision general purpose screen printer




This is a solder ball placing machine which accomplishes solder ball placing automatically onto wafers or substrates of 50mm�~50mm �` 480mm�~304.8mm size.
All moving parts are controlled by servo motors, and this equipment is a highly functional and highly precision solder ball placing machine.
Because the solder ball placing head scatters the solder balls without touching them by air curtain method, stable solder ball supply is accomplished without damaging or deforming the solder balls.
Because the distance between the printed work and the stencil can be controlled, ball placing can be continued without contaminating the stencil.
Uniquely designed head does not allow any ball from the previous work to remain precluding the risk of different size balls getting mixed when setting up for the next work using a different size ball.
