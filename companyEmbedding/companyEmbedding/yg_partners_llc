What are analysts saying about Crown Holdings stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Crown Holdings stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Crown Holdings expects adjusted diluted earnings per share to lie in the range of $3.90–$4.05 in 2017. Compared with the $3.93 earned in fiscal 2016, the mid-point of the guidance reflects a 1% rise. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter are projected in the range of $1.35–$1.45. Crown Holdings is expected to gain from a rise in global beverage can demand. Beverage can volume has generally continued to grow in emerging markets driven by increased per capita incomes and consumption. To meet growing beverage can demand, the company intends to build new facilities and is poised to gain from the geographic expansion of its beverage can lines. Additionally, it is poised to gain from potential strategic acquisitions in geographic areas and product lines." (7/24/2017)
2. KeyCorp analysts commented, "We are increasing our 2017 adj. EPS estimate from $3.95 to $4.02 (guidance is $3.90- $4.05) on account of fewer shares outstanding, lower interest expense, lower D&A expense, and better operations; we had already incorporated a $1.14 euro rate into our estimates two weeks ago. Of CCK’s $0.07-$0.08 guidance increase, $0.03-$0.04 was FX, ~$0.02 was lower interest expense, and the rest was better operations. CCK did not increase its FCF guidance on account of a one-time payment, which offset the boost to net income guidance. Consequently, we are maintaining our 2017 FCF estimate of $365 million, which is lower than CCK’s guidance of $425 million because we are deducting dividends to minority interests (which the Company does not). For perspective, dividends to minorities in 1H17 were $37 million. We are assuming flat FCF in 2018 because we expect capex to be the same as in 2017 ($450 million). Our 2018 adj." (7/20/2017)
3. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "While CCK is facing some headwinds, it's managing it well and we expect earnings to inflect in 2018. Separately, following a multi-year reinvestment cycle, FCF generation should accelerate next year and we remain comfortable with our Buy." (2/6/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Crown Holdings (NYSE:CCK) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 5 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.56)Consensus Price Target: $64.25 (9.10% upside)

Time Held All:2.56 quarters

[1]:
                  Turnover is calculated by taking the # of new holdings (initial purchases) + the # of positions sold out of (not just reduced) divided by the total # of holdings for the quarter.
                
[2]:
                  Alt Turnover is calculated by taking either the total MV of new purchases or
                   the MV of securities sold, whichever is less,
                   divided by the total MV of the fund.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
