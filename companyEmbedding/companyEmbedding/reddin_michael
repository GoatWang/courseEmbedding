Michael J Reddin's Experience
Title: President and Chief Executive Officer
               Company: Davis Petroleum Corp.
Job Details
               Company Size: $25 mil to less than $50 mil - Employee Range: 25 to less than 100. The Company is focused in the Frio and Vicksburg trends in Texas and in the Miocene and expanded Oligocene trends in South Louisiana. These trends are attractive to the Company due to its experience and expertise, the high rates and recovery per well, and the availability of 3-D seismic which assists in reducing risk associated with drilling the initial test wells. The prospects in these trends are supported by 3-D seismic and typically exhibit seismic attributes consistent with hydrocarbon charged reservoir rock at one or more objectives. These attributes combine to yield high success rates and positive economics. Galveston Bay and Sabine Lake are primary focus areas for the Company in Galveston, Chambers and Jefferson Counties in Texas. Prospects generated by the Company have resulted in discoveries in the Eagle Bay, Vinceburg, Umbrella Point, Dorado and Pleasure Island areas. Southeast Louisiana is also a primary focus area for the Company across the Vermillion, Jefferson Davis and Lafayette Parishes. The Company's prospects in this area have resulted in recent discoveries at Leleux, Lake Arthur and Duson from the Het through the Bol Mex formations. Davis expanded its presence in South Louisiana in 2010 by acquiring three producing fields from a large Independent. In addition, the company significantly expanded its seismic database and is generating numerous exploration prospects with significant upside.
