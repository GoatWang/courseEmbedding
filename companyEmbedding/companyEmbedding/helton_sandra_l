Management uses Operating Cash Flow to evaluate the operating performance of its business, and it is a measure of performance used by some investors, security analysts and others to make informed investment decisions. Operating Cash Flow is used as an analytical indicator of income generated to service debt and fund capital expenditures. In addition, multiples of current or projected Operating Cash Flow are used to estimate current or prospective enterprise value. Operating Cash Flow does not give effect to cash used for debt service requirements, and thus does not reflect funds available for investment or other discretionary uses. Operating Cash Flow as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  35TDS Excellent Prospects Full-service provider with strong, established  wireless and wireline operations  Strong business units Well positioned in existing markets Proven business strategies focused on    customer satisfaction, network quality and competitive product offerings.
