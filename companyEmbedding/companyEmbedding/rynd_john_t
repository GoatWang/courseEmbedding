Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement.

What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Offshore Drilling High Points From Hercules CEO John Rynd

John Rynd, CEO of Hercules Offshore calls it like he sees it.  10 years spent at Rowan, 11 at Noble, and now almost 6 at the helm of Hercules Offshore have given him a unique perspective and unparalleled expertise on the Gulf of Mexico shallow water market.
Here's 5 high points he covered regarding the state of offshore drilling yesterday.  Keep in mind that Hercules Offshore is primarily a GOM jackup driller.


1.  For the first time, we can't nail supply in the jackup market. We just don't know the builders anymore.

John Rynd: "For the first time in my career, I have a very limited sense of where new supply really is [in terms of status / intent / outlook], and that's driven by the orderbook over the last nine months in China.  If you go through the list of what's being ordered, just about half of the newbuilds now are in China. And the ownership, we just don't know them. We don't know who they are. Usually in our business we know who's ordering.  Also they're ordering some rig designs that have not been built before in yards that have not built rigs before. I'm not saying these rigs are not going to get built, but when you try to get your handle on when are they truly going to hit the market, who's going to run them, who's going to ultimately own them—those kind of questions—it makes trying to figure out the supply side of our equation very tough to get your arms around. So it's a unique period, I think, in the jackup business where we can't nail supply. I mean historically, we've been able to nail supply."

2. Can the jackup market absorb all the newbuilds?

John Rynd: "Well, I think that you kind of tell me where commodity prices are going to be and where year-over-year spending growth is and I could probably solve a pretty good answer. I do think it's going to stay relatively healthy if the commodity prices stay relatively healthy. Demand is still growing internationally, you're just seeing the demand in deepwater kind of slide to the right. We're not seeing that yet at all in the jackup market. As I mentioned, we're working on 12 years of work just for two rigs and that's not even counting the rest of the work we're working on internationally on the tender. So the tendering activity is still very robust."

3. All's well in the GOM jackup market.

John Rynd: "Today, the balance between demand and supply of jackup rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico remains healthy. During the first quarter, we were able to keep most of our rigs under contract and on the payroll. Excluding scheduled shipyard downtime, we only had approximately one month of contracted rig days across our 18 marketed rig fleet, or said another way, this downtime represented less than 2% of our available days for the quarter. Pricing in the Gulf of Mexico remained stable. All of our new contracts and extensions executed since the beginning of the year have been priced at leading-edge dayrates, and I expect stable pricing under the current supply/demand environment. We are also starting to see some of the customers that stepped away from the market late last year re-engage. One of the big end users of jackups, Fieldwood, which brought the shallow water Gulf of Mexico assets of Apache, as well as SandRidge has had what we believe to be a temporary reduction in rig demand as they digest these acquisitions. Once they get their internal resource planning completed, I think Fieldwood can be a more active customer than what they are running today. Currently, Fieldwood has three jackups under contract across the region. At this time last year, its predecessor companies ran seven rigs."

4. M&A in the jackup market is coming—targets include new legacy jackup contractors and speculative newbuilds.

John Rynd: "The industry needs to further consolidate. Now with Shelf Drilling and the Noble spin, Paragon, those are the obvious candidates as you look around to the legacy assets around the world. Timing is always tough to dictate. I think people are going to gravitate probably first to the supply of rigs coming and about over half of the new rigs being built today are being built in China. And about two-thirds of those roughly are built by just pure investors that don't have any drilling experience. So I think that's going to be the interesting thing to really pay attention to as we go into 2015."

5. The established drillers are starting to do some due diligence on Chinese newbuilds, evaluating potential acquisition opportunities.

John Rynd: "We'd have to do a lot more diligence than we've done already. We made a round through China, third quarter last year to the various yards. We've got a sense of rigs coming out of certain yards that we would look hard at. And at this point without a lot more diligence, there're yards that we would be less likely to look hard. But again, it requires more diligence on our part."

These comments were made in Hercules Offshore's first quarter earnings conference call held 4/23/14.

			John T. Rynd, 60, was appointed to our Board of Directors as a Class II Director in June 2011. From June 2008 until December 2016, Mr. Rynd served as the Chief Executive Officer and President, and as a director, of Hercules Offshore, Inc. (NASDAQ:HERO), a publicly traded global provider of offshore contract drilling and liftboat services. From July 2007 to June 2008, he served as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Hercules Offshore, Inc. From October 2005 to July 2007, he served as Senior Vice President of Hercules Offshore, Inc. and President of Hercules Drilling Company, LLC. On August 13, 2015, Hercules Offshore, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under the provisions of Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. On November 6, 2015, Hercules Offshore, Inc. emerged from bankruptcy. On June 5, 2016, Hercules Offshore, Inc. again filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. On December 2, 2016, Hercules Offshore, Inc.'s assets were transferred to the HERO Liquidating Trust, and the common stock was canceled pursuant to its Chapter 11 plan. 

Prior to joining Hercules Offshore, Inc., Mr. Rynd worked at Noble Drilling Services Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Noble Corporation, a contract drilling company, as Vice President-Investor Relations from October 2000 to September 2005 and as Vice President-Marketing and Contracts from September 1994 to September 2000. From June 1990 to September 1994, Mr. Rynd worked for Chiles Offshore Corporation, a contract drilling company, in various positions, including as Vice President-Marketing. Mr. Rynd currently serves on the board of directors of NOIA.

As a former chief executive officer of a publicly traded drilling and marine services company with a presence in the Gulf of Mexico, or GoM, Mr. Rynd has a deep understanding of the unique challenges currently facing our Company and the rest of the offshore energy industry in our core geographic markets. We believe that this unique understanding, together with Mr. Rynd's leadership skills, allow him to make meaningful contributions to the Board and the committees on which he serves.
