Current Cross-Industry TrendWhat do guns and oil have in common?Five countries—Yemen, Iraq, Pakistan, Colombia, and Syria—accounted for over three-quarters of the total terrorism attacks on energy infrastructure and assets recorded by IHS Markit between 2013 and 2014. As a strategic asset, oil and gas infrastructure will always be an attractive target for individuals and groups who want to publicly air grievances. These are highly localized problems. Understanding them and their context is crucial to mitigating risk.Learn MoreWhat does Tom Cruise have to do with user experience?Cruise’s latest Mission Impossible film features a full-windscreen Head-Up display during a high-speed chase, as well as gesture and speech recognition controls to see the road ahead and catch the villain. His Minority Report had more of the same. This type of technology is getting ever closer to making the jump from the silver screen to your windscreen. Read about how the tech and automotive worlds are colliding—in a good way.Learn MoreHow is chemistry building a better television?To stay abreast of customer demand for innovative and attractive new devices, proactive electronic manufacturers must collaborate with the chemical industry to obtain the right polymers and resins. Those who committed to older technologies and materials may face significant supply chain—and market—issues.What does a remote control have to do with maritime trade?Naval architects, including those at Rolls Royce marine’s Oskar Levander, are working on autonomous ships, driven by the very latest satellite-linked technology. In fact, he claim a small team of trained, maritime-experienced technicians could operate a fleet of 50 or 100 vessels, saving typical downtime on long passages between ports. While benefits include cost reduction (no need to feed and house a crew) and greater space for cargo, security implications are still unresolved.Learn MoreHow does ROI intersect with devastating diseases?Pharmaceutical companies and device manufacturers struggle to ensure ROI over a product’s lifecycle through flexible pricing and tiered pricing (matching a product’s price to a locality). Used strategically, they hold the key to launching and sustaining value across markets. But neither is without risk. The price that a company sets—especially in emerging markets—can be fraught with both financial and social ramifications.

Current Cross-Industry TrendWhat do guns and oil have in common?Five countries—Yemen, Iraq, Pakistan, Colombia, and Syria—accounted for over three-quarters of the total terrorism attacks on energy infrastructure and assets recorded by IHS Markit between 2013 and 2014. As a strategic asset, oil and gas infrastructure will always be an attractive target for individuals and groups who want to publicly air grievances. These are highly localized problems. Understanding them and their context is crucial to mitigating risk.Learn MoreWhat does Tom Cruise have to do with user experience?Cruise’s latest Mission Impossible film features a full-windscreen Head-Up display during a high-speed chase, as well as gesture and speech recognition controls to see the road ahead and catch the villain. His Minority Report had more of the same. This type of technology is getting ever closer to making the jump from the silver screen to your windscreen. Read about how the tech and automotive worlds are colliding—in a good way.Learn MoreHow is chemistry building a better television?To stay abreast of customer demand for innovative and attractive new devices, proactive electronic manufacturers must collaborate with the chemical industry to obtain the right polymers and resins. Those who committed to older technologies and materials may face significant supply chain—and market—issues.What does a remote control have to do with maritime trade?Naval architects, including those at Rolls Royce marine’s Oskar Levander, are working on autonomous ships, driven by the very latest satellite-linked technology. In fact, he claim a small team of trained, maritime-experienced technicians could operate a fleet of 50 or 100 vessels, saving typical downtime on long passages between ports. While benefits include cost reduction (no need to feed and house a crew) and greater space for cargo, security implications are still unresolved.Learn MoreHow does ROI intersect with devastating diseases?Pharmaceutical companies and device manufacturers struggle to ensure ROI over a product’s lifecycle through flexible pricing and tiered pricing (matching a product’s price to a locality). Used strategically, they hold the key to launching and sustaining value across markets. But neither is without risk. The price that a company sets—especially in emerging markets—can be fraught with both financial and social ramifications.

History[edit]
In 1959, the Rogers Publishing Company, a publisher of technical news magazines, began indexing product catalogs on microfilm. Microfilming allowed catalogs to be updated without the expense of traditional publishing. In 1961, when Rogers was bought by Cahners Publishing, the catalogs division became Information Handling Services (IHS). IHS initially served the aerospace industry.[8] Early clients included Martin Marietta and Convair. The United States Army Missile Command (MICOM) (now a part of the United States Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM)) contracted with IHS to develop a common parts file to be used by contractors designing new products. In the 1980s, with the advent of the personal computer, IHS added electronic databases and full text CD-ROMs to its delivery methods. In the 1990s, IHS embraced the Internet by distributing its information products through online databases. IHS also expanded beyond the aerospace and defense industries to focus on the energy industry, while continuing to serve the automotive, construction, and electronics sectors. In 2005, IHS became a publicly traded company (NYSE: IHS) and changed its name from Information Handling Services to IHS Inc. IHS is classified as belonging to the publications industry.[9] Since that time, IHS continues to grow both organically and through acquisitions adding additional products and services and expanding the list of industries it serves. IHS (NYSE: IHS) and Markit (NASDAQ: MRKT) announced the signing of a definitive agreement under which the companies combined an all-share merger of equals to create a global leader in critical information, analytics and solutions on March 21, 2016. Based on the closing prices of IHS and Markit common stock on March 18, 2016, the implied equity value of the transaction was valued at more than $13 billion. Upon completion of the merger, the combined company was renamed IHS Markit and the headquarters moved from Englewood, Colorado to London, UK. However, certain key operations are still based in Englewood, Colorado.

History[edit]
In 1959, the Rogers Publishing Company, a publisher of technical news magazines, began indexing product catalogs on microfilm. Microfilming allowed catalogs to be updated without the expense of traditional publishing. In 1961, when Rogers was bought by Cahners Publishing, the catalogs division became Information Handling Services (IHS). IHS initially served the aerospace industry.[8] Early clients included Martin Marietta and Convair. The United States Army Missile Command (MICOM) (now a part of the United States Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM)) contracted with IHS to develop a common parts file to be used by contractors designing new products. In the 1980s, with the advent of the personal computer, IHS added electronic databases and full text CD-ROMs to its delivery methods. In the 1990s, IHS embraced the Internet by distributing its information products through online databases. IHS also expanded beyond the aerospace and defense industries to focus on the energy industry, while continuing to serve the automotive, construction, and electronics sectors. In 2005, IHS became a publicly traded company (NYSE: IHS) and changed its name from Information Handling Services to IHS Inc. IHS is classified as belonging to the publications industry.[9] Since that time, IHS continues to grow both organically and through acquisitions adding additional products and services and expanding the list of industries it serves. IHS (NYSE: IHS) and Markit (NASDAQ: MRKT) announced the signing of a definitive agreement under which the companies combined an all-share merger of equals to create a global leader in critical information, analytics and solutions on March 21, 2016. Based on the closing prices of IHS and Markit common stock on March 18, 2016, the implied equity value of the transaction was valued at more than $13 billion. Upon completion of the merger, the combined company was renamed IHS Markit and the headquarters moved from Englewood, Colorado to London, UK. However, certain key operations are still based in Englewood, Colorado.

History[edit]
In 1959, the Rogers Publishing Company, a publisher of technical news magazines, began indexing product catalogs on microfilm. Microfilming allowed catalogs to be updated without the expense of traditional publishing. In 1961, when Rogers was bought by Cahners Publishing, the catalogs division became Information Handling Services (IHS). IHS initially served the aerospace industry.[8] Early clients included Martin Marietta and Convair. The United States Army Missile Command (MICOM) (now a part of the United States Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM)) contracted with IHS to develop a common parts file to be used by contractors designing new products. In the 1980s, with the advent of the personal computer, IHS added electronic databases and full text CD-ROMs to its delivery methods. In the 1990s, IHS embraced the Internet by distributing its information products through online databases. IHS also expanded beyond the aerospace and defense industries to focus on the energy industry, while continuing to serve the automotive, construction, and electronics sectors. In 2005, IHS became a publicly traded company (NYSE: IHS) and changed its name from Information Handling Services to IHS Inc. IHS is classified as belonging to the publications industry.[9] Since that time, IHS continues to grow both organically and through acquisitions adding additional products and services and expanding the list of industries it serves. IHS (NYSE: IHS) and Markit (NASDAQ: MRKT) announced the signing of a definitive agreement under which the companies combined an all-share merger of equals to create a global leader in critical information, analytics and solutions on March 21, 2016. Based on the closing prices of IHS and Markit common stock on March 18, 2016, the implied equity value of the transaction was valued at more than $13 billion. Upon completion of the merger, the combined company was renamed IHS Markit and the headquarters moved from Englewood, Colorado to London, UK. However, certain key operations are still based in Englewood, Colorado.

History[edit]
In 1959, the Rogers Publishing Company, a publisher of technical news magazines, began indexing product catalogs on microfilm. Microfilming allowed catalogs to be updated without the expense of traditional publishing. In 1961, when Rogers was bought by Cahners Publishing, the catalogs division became Information Handling Services (IHS). IHS initially served the aerospace industry.[8] Early clients included Martin Marietta and Convair. The United States Army Missile Command (MICOM) (now a part of the United States Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM)) contracted with IHS to develop a common parts file to be used by contractors designing new products. In the 1980s, with the advent of the personal computer, IHS added electronic databases and full text CD-ROMs to its delivery methods. In the 1990s, IHS embraced the Internet by distributing its information products through online databases. IHS also expanded beyond the aerospace and defense industries to focus on the energy industry, while continuing to serve the automotive, construction, and electronics sectors. In 2005, IHS became a publicly traded company (NYSE: IHS) and changed its name from Information Handling Services to IHS Inc. IHS is classified as belonging to the publications industry.[9] Since that time, IHS continues to grow both organically and through acquisitions adding additional products and services and expanding the list of industries it serves. IHS (NYSE: IHS) and Markit (NASDAQ: MRKT) announced the signing of a definitive agreement under which the companies combined an all-share merger of equals to create a global leader in critical information, analytics and solutions on March 21, 2016. Based on the closing prices of IHS and Markit common stock on March 18, 2016, the implied equity value of the transaction was valued at more than $13 billion. Upon completion of the merger, the combined company was renamed IHS Markit and the headquarters moved from Englewood, Colorado to London, UK. However, certain key operations are still based in Englewood, Colorado.
