The Global Operations Headquarters is located in O'Fallon, Missouri, United States, a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri. Throughout the world, its principal business is to process payments between the banks of merchants and the card issuing banks or credit unions of the purchasers who use the "Mastercard" brand debit and credit cards to make purchases. Mastercard Worldwide has been a publicly traded company since 2006. Prior to its initial public offering, MasterCard Worldwide was a cooperative owned by the more than 25,000 financial institutions that issue its branded cards.
Mastercard, originally known as Interbank/Master Charge,[2] was created by several California banks as a competitor to the BankAmericard issued by Bank of America, which later became the Visa credit card issued by Visa Inc. From 1966 to 1979, Mastercard was called "Interbank" and "Master Charge".

The original banks behind MasterCard were United California Bank (later First Interstate Bank and subsequently merged into Wells Fargo Bank), Wells Fargo, Crocker National Bank (also subsequently merged into Wells Fargo), and the Bank of California (subsequently merged into the Union Bank of California).
In 1966, the aforementioned group of California banks formed the Interbank Card Association (ICA). With the help of New York's Marine Midland Bank (now HSBC Bank USA), these banks joined with the ICA to create "Master Charge: The Interbank Card". The card was given a significant boost in 1969, when First National City Bank joined, merging its proprietary Everything Card with Master Charge.
In 1968, the ICA and Eurocard started a strategic alliance, which effectively allowed the ICA access to the European market, and for Eurocard to be accepted on the ICA network. The Access card system from the United Kingdom joined the ICA/Eurocard alliance in 1972.
In 1979, "Master Charge: The Interbank Card" was renamed "MasterCard". In 1997, Mastercard took over the Access card; the Access brand was then retired.
In 2002, MasterCard International merged with Europay International, another large credit-card issuer association, of which Eurocard had become a part in 1992.
In mid-2006, MasterCard International changed its name to MasterCard Worldwide. This was done in order to suggest a more global scale of operations. In addition, the company introduced a new corporate logo adding a third circle to the two that had been used in the past (the familiar card logo, resembling a Venn diagram, remained unchanged). A new corporate tagline was introduced at the same time: "The Heart of Commerce".[3]
In August 2010, MasterCard expanded its e-commerce offering with the acquisition of DataCash, a UK-based payment processing and fraud/risk management provider.[4][5]
In March 2012, MasterCard announced the expansion of its mobile contactless payments program, including markets across the Middle East.[6]
In spring 2014, MasterCard acquired Australia's leading rewards program manager company Pinpoint for an undisclosed amount.[7]
MasterCard teamed with Apple in September 2014, to incorporate a new mobile wallet feature into Apple's new iPhone models, enabling users to more readily use their MasterCard, and other credit cards.[8]
IPO[edit]
The company, which had been organized as a cooperative of banks, had an initial public offering on May 25, 2006, selling 61.5 million shares at $39 each.[9] The stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol MA, with a market capitalization of $105.15 billion as of August 2016.[10]
Litigation[edit]
Anti-trust lawsuit by ATM operators[edit]
MasterCard, along with Visa, has been sued in a class action by ATM operators that claims the credit card networks' rules effectively fix ATM access fees. The suit claims that this is a restraint on trade in violation of federal law. The lawsuit was filed by the National ATM Council and independent operators of automated teller machines. More specifically, it is alleged that MasterCard's and Visa's network rules prohibit ATM operators from offering lower prices for transactions over PIN-debit networks that are not affiliated with Visa or MasterCard. The suit says that this price fixing artificially raises the price that consumers pay using ATMs, limits the revenue that ATM-operators earn, and violates the Sherman Act's prohibition against unreasonable restraints of trade. Johnathan Rubin, an attorney for the plaintiffs said, "Visa and MasterCard are the ringleaders, organizers, and enforcers of a conspiracy among U.S. banks to fix the price of ATM access fees in order to keep the competition at bay." [11]
Debit card swipe fee price fixing[edit]
Both MasterCard and Visa have paid approximately $3 billion in damages resulting from a class-action lawsuit filed by Hagens Berman in January 1996.[12] The litigation cites several retail giants as plaintiffs, including Wal-Mart, Sears, Roebuck & Co., and Safeway.[13]
Antitrust settlement with U.S. Justice Department[edit]
In October 2010, MasterCard and Visa reached a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department in another antitrust case. The companies agreed to allow merchants displaying their logos to decline certain types of cards (because interchange fees differ), or to offer consumers discounts for using cheaper cards.[14]
Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation[edit]
Main article: Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation
On November 27, 2012, a federal judge entered an order granting preliminary approval to a proposed settlement to a class-action lawsuit filed in 2005 by merchants and trade associations against MasterCard, Visa, and many credit card issuers. The suit was filed due to price fixing and other anti-competitive trade practices employed by MasterCard and Visa. A majority of named class plaintiffs have objected and vowed to opt out of the settlement. Opponents object to provisions that would bar future lawsuits and even prevent merchants from opting out of significant portions of the proposed settlement. Stephen Neuwirth, a lawyer representing Home Depot, said, "It’s so obvious Visa and MasterCard were prepared to make a large payment because of the scope of the releases being given. It’s all one quid pro quo and merchants like the Home Depot are being denied the chance to opt out of that quid pro quo and say this is a bad deal." [15]
Plaintiffs allege that Visa, MasterCard, and major credit card issuers engaged in a conspiracy to fix interchange fees, also known as swipe fees, that are charged to merchants for the privilege of accepting payment cards at artificially high levels. In their complaint, the plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unfairly interfere with merchants from encouraging customers to use less expensive forms of payment such as lower-cost cards, cash, and checks.[15]
The settlement provides for the cash equivalent of a 10 basis-point reduction (0.1 percent) of swipe fees charged to merchants for a period of eight months. This eight-month period would probably begin in the middle of 2013. The total value of the settlement will be about $7.25 billion.[15]
Criticism[edit]
Anti-trust issues in the United States[edit]
Few companies have faced more antitrust lawsuits both in the US and abroad.[16]
MasterCard, along with Visa, engaged in systematic parallel exclusion against American Express during the 1980s and 1990s. MasterCard used exclusivity clauses in its contracts and blacklists to prevent banks from doing business with American Express. Such exclusionary clauses and other written evidence were used by the United States Department of Justice in regulatory actions against MasterCard and Visa.[17] Discover has sued MasterCard for similar issues.[16]
In 1996 about 4 million merchants sued MasterCard in federal court for making them accept debit cards if they wanted to accept credit cards and dramatically increasing credit card swipe fees. This case was settled with a multibillion-dollar payment in 2003. This was the largest anti-trust award in history.[16]
In 1998, the Department of Justice sued MasterCard over rules prohibiting their issuing banks from doing business with American Express or Discover. The Department of Justice won in 2001 and the verdict withstood appeal. American Express also filed suit[16]
On August 23, 2001, MasterCard International Inc. was sued for violating the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.[18]
On November 15, 2004, MasterCard Inc. paid damages to American Express, due to anticompetitive practices that prevented American Express from issuing cards through U.S. banks,[19] and paid 1.8 billion dollars for settlement.[20]
Anti-trust investigations in Europe[edit]
The European Union has repeatedly criticised MasterCard for monopolistic trade practices. In April 2009, MasterCard reached a settlement with the European Union in an antitrust case, promising to reduce debit card swipe fees to 0.2 percent of purchases.[21] In December 2010, a senior official from the European Central Bank called for a break-up of the Visa/MasterCard duopoly by creation of a new European debit card for use in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).[22]
WikiLeaks published documents showing that American authorities lobbied Russia to defend the interests of Visa and MasterCard.[23] In response MasterCard blocked payments to WikiLeaks. Members of the European Parliament expressed concern that payments from European citizens to a European corporation could apparently be blocked by the United States, and called for a further reduction in the dominance of Visa and MasterCard in the European payment system.[24]
As of 2013, MasterCard is under investigation by the European Union for the high fees it charges tourists who use their cards in Europe, and other anti-competitive practices that could hinder electronic commerce and international trade, and high fees associated with premium credit cards. The EU's competition regulator said that these fees were of special concern because of the growing role of non-cash payments. MasterCard charges non-European tourists much more than customers using cards issued in Europe. MasterCard could be fined up to 10 percent of its 2012 revenue or around $740 million. MasterCard was banned from charging fees on cross-border transactions conducted wholly within the EU via a ruling by the European Commission in 2007.[25] The European Commission said that their investigation also includes large differences in fees across national borders. For instance, a 50-euro payment might cost 10 euro cents in the Netherlands but eight times that amount in Poland. The Commission argues that MasterCard rules that prohibit merchants from enjoying better terms offered in other EU countries may be against anti-trust law.
The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) praised the action against MasterCard. BEUC said interbank fees push up prices and hurt consumers. BEUC Director General Monique Goyens said, "So in the end, all consumers are hit by a scheme which ultimately rewards the card company and issuing bank." [25]
Sanctions of Russia[edit]
On December 27, 2014, Visa Inc. and MasterCard suspended servicing some Russian banks in Crimea:[26] Rossiya Bank, Sobinbank, SMP Bank and Investcapitalbank,[27] after the USA issued sanctions against the Russian government due to the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine.
Regulatory action in Australia and New Zealand[edit]
In 2003, the Reserve Bank of Australia required that interchange fees be dramatically reduced, from about 0.95% of the transaction to approximately 0.5%.[citation needed] One notable result has been the reduced use of reward cards and increased use of debit cards. Australia also prohibited the "no surcharge" rule, a policy established by credit card networks like Visa and MasterCard to prevent merchants from charging a credit card usage fee to the cardholder. A surcharge would mitigate or even exceed the merchant discount paid by a merchant, but would also make the cardholder more reluctant to use the card as the method of payment. Australia has also made changes to the interchange rates on debit cards and has considered abolishing interchange fees altogether.
As of November 2006, New Zealand was considering similar actions, following a Commerce Commission lawsuit alleging price-fixing by Visa and MasterCard. In New Zealand, merchants pay a 1.8% fee on every credit card transaction.
Blocking payments to WikiLeaks[edit]
In December 2010, MasterCard blocked all payments to WikiLeaks due to claims that they engage in illegal activity.[28] In a response, a group of online activists calling themselves "Anonymous" organised a denial-of-service attack; as a result, the MasterCard website experienced downtime on December 8–9, 2010.[29] On December 9, 2010 the servers of MasterCard underwent a massive attack[30] as part of an Operation Avenge Assange for closing down payments of whistleblowing platform WikiLeaks. According to several news sites, security of thousands of credit cards was compromised during that attack due to a phishing-site set up by the attackers.[31] However, MasterCard denied this, stating that "cardholder account data has not been placed at risk".[32] WikiLeaks spokesman said: "We neither condemn nor applaud these attacks."[33] U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay said that closing down credit lines for donations to WikiLeaks "could be interpreted as an attempt to censor the publication of information, thus potentially violating WikiLeaks' right to freedom of expression".[34]
The company that enables WikiLeaks to accept credit and debit card donations[who?] said it would take legal action against Visa Europe and MasterCard.[35] Iceland-based IT firm DataCell said it would move immediately to try to force the two companies to resume allowing payments to the website.[citation needed] DataCell had earlier[when?] said that suspension of payments towards WikiLeaks is a violation of the agreements with their customers. On July 14, 2011 DataCell announced they had filed a complaint with the European Commission claiming the closure by Visa and MasterCard of Datcell‘s access to the payment card networks violated the competition rules of the European Community.[36]
On July 12, 2012 a Reykjavík court ruled that Valitor, Visa and MasterCard's partner in Iceland, had to start processing donations within fourteen days[37] on pain of daily fines to the amount of ISK 800,000 (some $6000) for each day after that time, to open the payment gateway. Valitor also had to pay DataCell's litigation costs of ISK 1,500,000.[38][39]
Corporate branding of all Nigerian ID Cards[edit]
In 2014, pursuant to an agreement between MasterCard and the Nigerian Government, acting through the National Identity Management Commission, the new Nigerian ID cards will bear MasterCard logo, contain personal database data and double as payment cards, irrevocably linking such payments to the individuals,[40] sparking criticism by the Civil Rights Congress alleging that it "represents a stamped ownership of a Nigerian by an American company ... reminiscent of the logo pasted on the bodies of African slaves transported across the Atlantic."[41]
Prepaid debit cards[edit]
MasterCard, Comerica Bank, and the U.S. Treasury Department teamed up in 2008 to create the Direct Express Debit MasterCard prepaid debit card. The federal government uses the Express Debit product to issue electronic payments to people who do not have bank accounts, who are often referred to collectively as the "unbanked". Comerica Bank is the issuing bank for the debit card.
The Direct Express cards give recipients a number of consumer protections.
In June 2013, MasterCard announced a partnership with British Airways to offer members the Executive Club Multi-currency Cash Passport, which will allow members to earn extra points and make multi-currency payments. The Passport card allows users to load up to ten currencies (euro, pound, U.S. dollar, Turkish Lira, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, New Zealand dollar, U.A.E. dirham and South African rand) at a locked-in rate. When used, the card selects the local currency to ensure the best exchange rate, and if the local currency is not already loaded onto the card, funds are used from other currencies.[citation needed]
Advertising[edit]
MasterCard's current advertising campaign tagline is "Priceless". The slogan associated with the campaign is "There are some things money can't buy. For everything else, there's MasterCard." The Priceless campaign in more recent iterations has been applicable to both MasterCard's credit card and debit card products. They also use the Priceless description to promote products such as their "priceless travel" site which features deals and offers for MasterCard holders,[42] and "priceless cities", offers for people in specified locations.[43]
The first of these Priceless ads was run during the 1997 World Series and there are numerous different TV, radio and print ads.[44] MasterCard registered Priceless as a trademark.[45] Actor Billy Crudup has been the voice in the US market; in the UK, actor Jack Davenport is the voice. The original idea and concept of the campaign stems from the advertising agency of McCann Erickson (as it was named in 1997).[46]
The purpose of the campaign is to position MasterCard as a friendly credit card company with a sense of humor, as well as responding to the public's worry that everything is being commodified and that people are becoming too materialistic.[47]
Many parodies have been made using this same pattern, especially on Comedy Central, though MasterCard has threatened legal action,[48] contending that MasterCard views such parodies as a violation of its rights under the federal and state trademark and unfair competition laws, under the federal and state anti-dilution laws, and under the Copyright Act. Despite these claims, however, noted US consumer advocate and presidential candidate Ralph Nader emerged victorious (after a four-year battle) in the suit MasterCard brought against him after he produced his own "Priceless" political commercials.[49] In the election ads Nader had criticized the corporate financing of both the Bush and Gore campaigns. Using the theme and some of the language behind the MasterCard "Priceless" campaign the election specified the dollar amounts contributed by corporate interests to both candidates and then summed it up with "finding out the truth ... priceless". MasterCard sued Nader's campaign committee and filed a temporary restraining order to stop the ads. The TRO was not granted and Nader defended the ads by claiming they were protected under the fair use doctrine.[50]
Litigation of "Priceless" ad campaign[edit]
In 1994 Argentinian born Edgardo Apestguia created in Paraguay an ad campaign for Bancard's credit card. Its slogan was "There are things money can't buy, but, for everything else, there is Bancard".[51] Plagiarism lawsuits were filed in Paraguay and Chile against MasterCard and their publicist McCann, who registered the "priceless" slogan ads in the US in 1999 and was represented in Paraguay by Nafta and Biedermann publicists at the time.
MasterCard MarketPlace[edit]
Through a partnership with an Internet company that specializes in personalized shopping, MasterCard introduced a Web shopping mall on April 16, 2010 that it said can pinpoint with considerable accuracy what its cardholders are likely to purchase.[52]
Sports sponsorships[edit]
MasterCard engages in the sponsorship of major sporting events throughout the world. These include the New Zealand All Blacks the country's rugby team,[53] Major League Baseball, the UEFA Champions League, the PGA Tour's Arnold Palmer Invitational Presented by MasterCard,[54] the Canadian Hockey League's Memorial Cup and recently announced a new sponsorship deal with Australian Cricket team. Previously it also sponsored FIFA World Cup but withdrew its contract after a court settlement and its rival Visa took up the contract in 2007.[55] In 1997, MasterCard was the main sponsor of the MasterCard Lola Formula One team, which withdrew from the 1997 Formula One season after its first race due to financial problems.

Mastercard Contactless[edit]





PayPass RFID chip from a Mastercard






Mastercard issued by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Semi-transparency shows PayPass antenna, connecting to RFID chip.


Mastercard Contactless (formerly branded Paypass[60]) is an EMV-compatible, "contactless" payment feature similar to American Express' ExpressPay, and Visa payWave. All three use the same symbol as shown on the right. It is based on the ISO/IEC 14443 standard that provides cardholders with a simpler way to pay by tapping a payment card or other payment device, such as a phone or key fob, on a point-of-sale terminal reader rather than swiping or inserting a card. PayPass can currently be used on transactions up to and including 30 GBP, 25 EUR, 50 USD, 100 CAD, 200 NOK, 80 NZD, 100 AUD, 1000 RUB or 2000 INR.
In 2003, Mastercard concluded a nine-month PayPass market trial in Orlando, Florida with JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, and MBNA. More than 16,000 cardholders and more than 60 retailer locations participated in the market trial.[needs update] In addition, Mastercard worked with Nokia, AT&T Wireless, and JPMorgan Chase to incorporate Mastercard PayPass into mobile phones using near-field communication technology, in Dallas, Texas. In 2011, Google and Mastercard launched Google Wallet, an Android application which allows a mobile device to send credit/debit card information directly to a Paypass-enabled payment terminal, bypassing the need for a physical card, up until the creation of Android Pay.
During late 2015, Citicards in the USA stopped issuing Paypass-enabled plastic, but the keyfob was still available upon request. Effective July 16, 2016, Citicards will stop supporting Paypass completely. While existing plastic and keyfobs will continue to work until their expiration date, no new Paypass-enabled hardware will be issued to US customers after that date.
QkR[edit]
QkR is a mobile payment app developed by MasterCard, for the purpose of ordering products and services through a smartphone with payments charged to the associated credit card. It is being deployed for use in large scale events, such as sport events, concerts, or movie theaters. Unlike other MasterCard mobile payment apps such as Pay Pass, QkR does not use NFC from the phone, but rather an Internet connection.
Users can open the app, scan a QR code located on the back of the seat in front of them, and place orders for refreshments of their choice.[61][62] The order is dispatched to a nearby concession stand, from where a runner delivers the items to the patrons' seats. It is already deployed in Australian movie theaters and is being tested in Yankee Stadium.
QkR is being marketed to vendors as a replacement for other mobile payment apps and a mobile ordering app, either distributed by the vendor (such as Starbucks's app, McDonald's' app, or Chipotle's mobile ordering app) or by a third party, such as Square, headed by Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey.
Banknet[edit]
MasterCard operates Banknet, a global telecommunications network linking all MasterCard card issuers, acquirers, and data processing centers into a single financial network. The operations hub is located in St. Louis, Missouri. Banknet uses the ISO 8583 protocol.
MasterCard's network differs significantly from Visa's. Visa's is a star-based system where all endpoints terminate at one of several main data centers, where all transactions are processed centrally. MasterCard's network is an edge-based, peer-to-peer network where transactions travel a meshed network directly to other endpoints, without the need to travel to a single point. This allows MasterCard's network to be much more resilient, in that a single failure cannot isolate a large number of endpoints.[63]

Mastercard Incorporated or Mastercard Worldwide is an American multinational financial services corporation headquartered in the MasterCard International Global Headquarters, Purchase, New York, United States,[1] in Westchester County. The Global Operations Headquarters is located in O'Fallon, Missouri, United States, a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri. Throughout the world, its principal business is to process payments between the banks of merchants and the card issuing banks or credit unions of the purchasers who use the "Mastercard" brand debit and credit cards to make purchases. Mastercard Worldwide has been a publicly traded company since 2006. Prior to its initial public offering, MasterCard Worldwide was a cooperative owned by the more than 25,000 financial institutions that issue its branded cards.
Mastercard, originally known as Interbank/Master Charge,[2] was created by several California banks as a competitor to the BankAmericard issued by Bank of America, which later became the Visa credit card issued by Visa Inc. From 1966 to 1979, Mastercard was called "Interbank" and "Master Charge".

The original banks behind MasterCard were United California Bank (later First Interstate Bank and subsequently merged into Wells Fargo Bank), Wells Fargo, Crocker National Bank (also subsequently merged into Wells Fargo), and the Bank of California (subsequently merged into the Union Bank of California).
In 1966, the aforementioned group of California banks formed the Interbank Card Association (ICA). With the help of New York's Marine Midland Bank (now HSBC Bank USA), these banks joined with the ICA to create "Master Charge: The Interbank Card". The card was given a significant boost in 1969, when First National City Bank joined, merging its proprietary Everything Card with Master Charge.
In 1968, the ICA and Eurocard started a strategic alliance, which effectively allowed the ICA access to the European market, and for Eurocard to be accepted on the ICA network. The Access card system from the United Kingdom joined the ICA/Eurocard alliance in 1972.
In 1979, "Master Charge: The Interbank Card" was renamed "MasterCard". In 1997, Mastercard took over the Access card; the Access brand was then retired.
In 2002, MasterCard International merged with Europay International, another large credit-card issuer association, of which Eurocard had become a part in 1992.
In mid-2006, MasterCard International changed its name to MasterCard Worldwide. This was done in order to suggest a more global scale of operations. In addition, the company introduced a new corporate logo adding a third circle to the two that had been used in the past (the familiar card logo, resembling a Venn diagram, remained unchanged). A new corporate tagline was introduced at the same time: "The Heart of Commerce".[3]
In August 2010, MasterCard expanded its e-commerce offering with the acquisition of DataCash, a UK-based payment processing and fraud/risk management provider.[4][5]
In March 2012, MasterCard announced the expansion of its mobile contactless payments program, including markets across the Middle East.[6]
In spring 2014, MasterCard acquired Australia's leading rewards program manager company Pinpoint for an undisclosed amount.[7]
MasterCard teamed with Apple in September 2014, to incorporate a new mobile wallet feature into Apple's new iPhone models, enabling users to more readily use their MasterCard, and other credit cards.[8]
IPO[edit]
The company, which had been organized as a cooperative of banks, had an initial public offering on May 25, 2006, selling 61.5 million shares at $39 each.[9] The stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol MA, with a market capitalization of $105.15 billion as of August 2016.[10]
Litigation[edit]
Anti-trust lawsuit by ATM operators[edit]
MasterCard, along with Visa, has been sued in a class action by ATM operators that claims the credit card networks' rules effectively fix ATM access fees. The suit claims that this is a restraint on trade in violation of federal law. The lawsuit was filed by the National ATM Council and independent operators of automated teller machines. More specifically, it is alleged that MasterCard's and Visa's network rules prohibit ATM operators from offering lower prices for transactions over PIN-debit networks that are not affiliated with Visa or MasterCard. The suit says that this price fixing artificially raises the price that consumers pay using ATMs, limits the revenue that ATM-operators earn, and violates the Sherman Act's prohibition against unreasonable restraints of trade. Johnathan Rubin, an attorney for the plaintiffs said, "Visa and MasterCard are the ringleaders, organizers, and enforcers of a conspiracy among U.S. banks to fix the price of ATM access fees in order to keep the competition at bay." [11]
Debit card swipe fee price fixing[edit]
Both MasterCard and Visa have paid approximately $3 billion in damages resulting from a class-action lawsuit filed by Hagens Berman in January 1996.[12] The litigation cites several retail giants as plaintiffs, including Wal-Mart, Sears, Roebuck & Co., and Safeway.[13]
Antitrust settlement with U.S. Justice Department[edit]
In October 2010, MasterCard and Visa reached a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department in another antitrust case. The companies agreed to allow merchants displaying their logos to decline certain types of cards (because interchange fees differ), or to offer consumers discounts for using cheaper cards.[14]
Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation[edit]
Main article: Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation
On November 27, 2012, a federal judge entered an order granting preliminary approval to a proposed settlement to a class-action lawsuit filed in 2005 by merchants and trade associations against MasterCard, Visa, and many credit card issuers. The suit was filed due to price fixing and other anti-competitive trade practices employed by MasterCard and Visa. A majority of named class plaintiffs have objected and vowed to opt out of the settlement. Opponents object to provisions that would bar future lawsuits and even prevent merchants from opting out of significant portions of the proposed settlement. Stephen Neuwirth, a lawyer representing Home Depot, said, "It’s so obvious Visa and MasterCard were prepared to make a large payment because of the scope of the releases being given. It’s all one quid pro quo and merchants like the Home Depot are being denied the chance to opt out of that quid pro quo and say this is a bad deal." [15]
Plaintiffs allege that Visa, MasterCard, and major credit card issuers engaged in a conspiracy to fix interchange fees, also known as swipe fees, that are charged to merchants for the privilege of accepting payment cards at artificially high levels. In their complaint, the plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unfairly interfere with merchants from encouraging customers to use less expensive forms of payment such as lower-cost cards, cash, and checks.[15]
The settlement provides for the cash equivalent of a 10 basis-point reduction (0.1 percent) of swipe fees charged to merchants for a period of eight months. This eight-month period would probably begin in the middle of 2013. The total value of the settlement will be about $7.25 billion.[15]
Criticism[edit]
Anti-trust issues in the United States[edit]
Few companies have faced more antitrust lawsuits both in the US and abroad.[16]
MasterCard, along with Visa, engaged in systematic parallel exclusion against American Express during the 1980s and 1990s. MasterCard used exclusivity clauses in its contracts and blacklists to prevent banks from doing business with American Express. Such exclusionary clauses and other written evidence were used by the United States Department of Justice in regulatory actions against MasterCard and Visa.[17] Discover has sued MasterCard for similar issues.[16]
In 1996 about 4 million merchants sued MasterCard in federal court for making them accept debit cards if they wanted to accept credit cards and dramatically increasing credit card swipe fees. This case was settled with a multibillion-dollar payment in 2003. This was the largest anti-trust award in history.[16]
In 1998, the Department of Justice sued MasterCard over rules prohibiting their issuing banks from doing business with American Express or Discover. The Department of Justice won in 2001 and the verdict withstood appeal. American Express also filed suit[16]
On August 23, 2001, MasterCard International Inc. was sued for violating the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.[18]
On November 15, 2004, MasterCard Inc. paid damages to American Express, due to anticompetitive practices that prevented American Express from issuing cards through U.S. banks,[19] and paid 1.8 billion dollars for settlement.[20]
Anti-trust investigations in Europe[edit]
The European Union has repeatedly criticised MasterCard for monopolistic trade practices. In April 2009, MasterCard reached a settlement with the European Union in an antitrust case, promising to reduce debit card swipe fees to 0.2 percent of purchases.[21] In December 2010, a senior official from the European Central Bank called for a break-up of the Visa/MasterCard duopoly by creation of a new European debit card for use in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).[22]
WikiLeaks published documents showing that American authorities lobbied Russia to defend the interests of Visa and MasterCard.[23] In response MasterCard blocked payments to WikiLeaks. Members of the European Parliament expressed concern that payments from European citizens to a European corporation could apparently be blocked by the United States, and called for a further reduction in the dominance of Visa and MasterCard in the European payment system.[24]
As of 2013, MasterCard is under investigation by the European Union for the high fees it charges tourists who use their cards in Europe, and other anti-competitive practices that could hinder electronic commerce and international trade, and high fees associated with premium credit cards. The EU's competition regulator said that these fees were of special concern because of the growing role of non-cash payments. MasterCard charges non-European tourists much more than customers using cards issued in Europe. MasterCard could be fined up to 10 percent of its 2012 revenue or around $740 million. MasterCard was banned from charging fees on cross-border transactions conducted wholly within the EU via a ruling by the European Commission in 2007.[25] The European Commission said that their investigation also includes large differences in fees across national borders. For instance, a 50-euro payment might cost 10 euro cents in the Netherlands but eight times that amount in Poland. The Commission argues that MasterCard rules that prohibit merchants from enjoying better terms offered in other EU countries may be against anti-trust law.
The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) praised the action against MasterCard. BEUC said interbank fees push up prices and hurt consumers. BEUC Director General Monique Goyens said, "So in the end, all consumers are hit by a scheme which ultimately rewards the card company and issuing bank." [25]
Sanctions of Russia[edit]
On December 27, 2014, Visa Inc. and MasterCard suspended servicing some Russian banks in Crimea:[26] Rossiya Bank, Sobinbank, SMP Bank and Investcapitalbank,[27] after the USA issued sanctions against the Russian government due to the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine.
Regulatory action in Australia and New Zealand[edit]
In 2003, the Reserve Bank of Australia required that interchange fees be dramatically reduced, from about 0.95% of the transaction to approximately 0.5%.[citation needed] One notable result has been the reduced use of reward cards and increased use of debit cards. Australia also prohibited the "no surcharge" rule, a policy established by credit card networks like Visa and MasterCard to prevent merchants from charging a credit card usage fee to the cardholder. A surcharge would mitigate or even exceed the merchant discount paid by a merchant, but would also make the cardholder more reluctant to use the card as the method of payment. Australia has also made changes to the interchange rates on debit cards and has considered abolishing interchange fees altogether.
As of November 2006, New Zealand was considering similar actions, following a Commerce Commission lawsuit alleging price-fixing by Visa and MasterCard. In New Zealand, merchants pay a 1.8% fee on every credit card transaction.
Blocking payments to WikiLeaks[edit]
In December 2010, MasterCard blocked all payments to WikiLeaks due to claims that they engage in illegal activity.[28] In a response, a group of online activists calling themselves "Anonymous" organised a denial-of-service attack; as a result, the MasterCard website experienced downtime on December 8–9, 2010.[29] On December 9, 2010 the servers of MasterCard underwent a massive attack[30] as part of an Operation Avenge Assange for closing down payments of whistleblowing platform WikiLeaks. According to several news sites, security of thousands of credit cards was compromised during that attack due to a phishing-site set up by the attackers.[31] However, MasterCard denied this, stating that "cardholder account data has not been placed at risk".[32] WikiLeaks spokesman said: "We neither condemn nor applaud these attacks."[33] U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay said that closing down credit lines for donations to WikiLeaks "could be interpreted as an attempt to censor the publication of information, thus potentially violating WikiLeaks' right to freedom of expression".[34]
The company that enables WikiLeaks to accept credit and debit card donations[who?] said it would take legal action against Visa Europe and MasterCard.[35] Iceland-based IT firm DataCell said it would move immediately to try to force the two companies to resume allowing payments to the website.[citation needed] DataCell had earlier[when?] said that suspension of payments towards WikiLeaks is a violation of the agreements with their customers. On July 14, 2011 DataCell announced they had filed a complaint with the European Commission claiming the closure by Visa and MasterCard of Datcell‘s access to the payment card networks violated the competition rules of the European Community.[36]
On July 12, 2012 a Reykjavík court ruled that Valitor, Visa and MasterCard's partner in Iceland, had to start processing donations within fourteen days[37] on pain of daily fines to the amount of ISK 800,000 (some $6000) for each day after that time, to open the payment gateway. Valitor also had to pay DataCell's litigation costs of ISK 1,500,000.[38][39]
Corporate branding of all Nigerian ID Cards[edit]
In 2014, pursuant to an agreement between MasterCard and the Nigerian Government, acting through the National Identity Management Commission, the new Nigerian ID cards will bear MasterCard logo, contain personal database data and double as payment cards, irrevocably linking such payments to the individuals,[40] sparking criticism by the Civil Rights Congress alleging that it "represents a stamped ownership of a Nigerian by an American company ... reminiscent of the logo pasted on the bodies of African slaves transported across the Atlantic."[41]
Prepaid debit cards[edit]
MasterCard, Comerica Bank, and the U.S. Treasury Department teamed up in 2008 to create the Direct Express Debit MasterCard prepaid debit card. The federal government uses the Express Debit product to issue electronic payments to people who do not have bank accounts, who are often referred to collectively as the "unbanked". Comerica Bank is the issuing bank for the debit card.
The Direct Express cards give recipients a number of consumer protections.
In June 2013, MasterCard announced a partnership with British Airways to offer members the Executive Club Multi-currency Cash Passport, which will allow members to earn extra points and make multi-currency payments. The Passport card allows users to load up to ten currencies (euro, pound, U.S. dollar, Turkish Lira, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, New Zealand dollar, U.A.E. dirham and South African rand) at a locked-in rate. When used, the card selects the local currency to ensure the best exchange rate, and if the local currency is not already loaded onto the card, funds are used from other currencies.[citation needed]
Advertising[edit]
MasterCard's current advertising campaign tagline is "Priceless". The slogan associated with the campaign is "There are some things money can't buy. For everything else, there's MasterCard." The Priceless campaign in more recent iterations has been applicable to both MasterCard's credit card and debit card products. They also use the Priceless description to promote products such as their "priceless travel" site which features deals and offers for MasterCard holders,[42] and "priceless cities", offers for people in specified locations.[43]
The first of these Priceless ads was run during the 1997 World Series and there are numerous different TV, radio and print ads.[44] MasterCard registered Priceless as a trademark.[45] Actor Billy Crudup has been the voice in the US market; in the UK, actor Jack Davenport is the voice. The original idea and concept of the campaign stems from the advertising agency of McCann Erickson (as it was named in 1997).[46]
The purpose of the campaign is to position MasterCard as a friendly credit card company with a sense of humor, as well as responding to the public's worry that everything is being commodified and that people are becoming too materialistic.[47]
Many parodies have been made using this same pattern, especially on Comedy Central, though MasterCard has threatened legal action,[48] contending that MasterCard views such parodies as a violation of its rights under the federal and state trademark and unfair competition laws, under the federal and state anti-dilution laws, and under the Copyright Act. Despite these claims, however, noted US consumer advocate and presidential candidate Ralph Nader emerged victorious (after a four-year battle) in the suit MasterCard brought against him after he produced his own "Priceless" political commercials.[49] In the election ads Nader had criticized the corporate financing of both the Bush and Gore campaigns. Using the theme and some of the language behind the MasterCard "Priceless" campaign the election specified the dollar amounts contributed by corporate interests to both candidates and then summed it up with "finding out the truth ... priceless". MasterCard sued Nader's campaign committee and filed a temporary restraining order to stop the ads. The TRO was not granted and Nader defended the ads by claiming they were protected under the fair use doctrine.[50]
Litigation of "Priceless" ad campaign[edit]
In 1994 Argentinian born Edgardo Apestguia created in Paraguay an ad campaign for Bancard's credit card. Its slogan was "There are things money can't buy, but, for everything else, there is Bancard".[51] Plagiarism lawsuits were filed in Paraguay and Chile against MasterCard and their publicist McCann, who registered the "priceless" slogan ads in the US in 1999 and was represented in Paraguay by Nafta and Biedermann publicists at the time.
MasterCard MarketPlace[edit]
Through a partnership with an Internet company that specializes in personalized shopping, MasterCard introduced a Web shopping mall on April 16, 2010 that it said can pinpoint with considerable accuracy what its cardholders are likely to purchase.[52]
Sports sponsorships[edit]
MasterCard engages in the sponsorship of major sporting events throughout the world. These include the New Zealand All Blacks the country's rugby team,[53] Major League Baseball, the UEFA Champions League, the PGA Tour's Arnold Palmer Invitational Presented by MasterCard,[54] the Canadian Hockey League's Memorial Cup and recently announced a new sponsorship deal with Australian Cricket team. Previously it also sponsored FIFA World Cup but withdrew its contract after a court settlement and its rival Visa took up the contract in 2007.[55] In 1997, MasterCard was the main sponsor of the MasterCard Lola Formula One team, which withdrew from the 1997 Formula One season after its first race due to financial problems.

Mastercard Contactless[edit]





PayPass RFID chip from a Mastercard






Mastercard issued by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Semi-transparency shows PayPass antenna, connecting to RFID chip.


Mastercard Contactless (formerly branded Paypass[60]) is an EMV-compatible, "contactless" payment feature similar to American Express' ExpressPay, and Visa payWave. All three use the same symbol as shown on the right. It is based on the ISO/IEC 14443 standard that provides cardholders with a simpler way to pay by tapping a payment card or other payment device, such as a phone or key fob, on a point-of-sale terminal reader rather than swiping or inserting a card. PayPass can currently be used on transactions up to and including 30 GBP, 25 EUR, 50 USD, 100 CAD, 200 NOK, 80 NZD, 100 AUD, 1000 RUB or 2000 INR.
In 2003, Mastercard concluded a nine-month PayPass market trial in Orlando, Florida with JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, and MBNA. More than 16,000 cardholders and more than 60 retailer locations participated in the market trial.[needs update] In addition, Mastercard worked with Nokia, AT&T Wireless, and JPMorgan Chase to incorporate Mastercard PayPass into mobile phones using near-field communication technology, in Dallas, Texas. In 2011, Google and Mastercard launched Google Wallet, an Android application which allows a mobile device to send credit/debit card information directly to a Paypass-enabled payment terminal, bypassing the need for a physical card, up until the creation of Android Pay.
During late 2015, Citicards in the USA stopped issuing Paypass-enabled plastic, but the keyfob was still available upon request. Effective July 16, 2016, Citicards will stop supporting Paypass completely. While existing plastic and keyfobs will continue to work until their expiration date, no new Paypass-enabled hardware will be issued to US customers after that date.
QkR[edit]
QkR is a mobile payment app developed by MasterCard, for the purpose of ordering products and services through a smartphone with payments charged to the associated credit card. It is being deployed for use in large scale events, such as sport events, concerts, or movie theaters. Unlike other MasterCard mobile payment apps such as Pay Pass, QkR does not use NFC from the phone, but rather an Internet connection.
Users can open the app, scan a QR code located on the back of the seat in front of them, and place orders for refreshments of their choice.[61][62] The order is dispatched to a nearby concession stand, from where a runner delivers the items to the patrons' seats. It is already deployed in Australian movie theaters and is being tested in Yankee Stadium.
QkR is being marketed to vendors as a replacement for other mobile payment apps and a mobile ordering app, either distributed by the vendor (such as Starbucks's app, McDonald's' app, or Chipotle's mobile ordering app) or by a third party, such as Square, headed by Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey.
Banknet[edit]
MasterCard operates Banknet, a global telecommunications network linking all MasterCard card issuers, acquirers, and data processing centers into a single financial network. The operations hub is located in St. Louis, Missouri. Banknet uses the ISO 8583 protocol.
MasterCard's network differs significantly from Visa's. Visa's is a star-based system where all endpoints terminate at one of several main data centers, where all transactions are processed centrally. MasterCard's network is an edge-based, peer-to-peer network where transactions travel a meshed network directly to other endpoints, without the need to travel to a single point. This allows MasterCard's network to be much more resilient, in that a single failure cannot isolate a large number of endpoints.[63]

Mastercard Incorporated or Mastercard Worldwide is an American multinational financial services corporation headquartered in the MasterCard International Global Headquarters, Purchase, New York, United States,[1] in Westchester County. The Global Operations Headquarters is located in O'Fallon, Missouri, United States, a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri. Throughout the world, its principal business is to process payments between the banks of merchants and the card issuing banks or credit unions of the purchasers who use the "Mastercard" brand debit and credit cards to make purchases. Mastercard Worldwide has been a publicly traded company since 2006. Prior to its initial public offering, MasterCard Worldwide was a cooperative owned by the more than 25,000 financial institutions that issue its branded cards.
Mastercard, originally known as Interbank/Master Charge,[2] was created by several California banks as a competitor to the BankAmericard issued by Bank of America, which later became the Visa credit card issued by Visa Inc. From 1966 to 1979, Mastercard was called "Interbank" and "Master Charge".

The original banks behind MasterCard were United California Bank (later First Interstate Bank and subsequently merged into Wells Fargo Bank), Wells Fargo, Crocker National Bank (also subsequently merged into Wells Fargo), and the Bank of California (subsequently merged into the Union Bank of California).
In 1966, the aforementioned group of California banks formed the Interbank Card Association (ICA). With the help of New York's Marine Midland Bank (now HSBC Bank USA), these banks joined with the ICA to create "Master Charge: The Interbank Card". The card was given a significant boost in 1969, when First National City Bank joined, merging its proprietary Everything Card with Master Charge.
In 1968, the ICA and Eurocard started a strategic alliance, which effectively allowed the ICA access to the European market, and for Eurocard to be accepted on the ICA network. The Access card system from the United Kingdom joined the ICA/Eurocard alliance in 1972.
In 1979, "Master Charge: The Interbank Card" was renamed "MasterCard". In 1997, Mastercard took over the Access card; the Access brand was then retired.
In 2002, MasterCard International merged with Europay International, another large credit-card issuer association, of which Eurocard had become a part in 1992.
In mid-2006, MasterCard International changed its name to MasterCard Worldwide. This was done in order to suggest a more global scale of operations. In addition, the company introduced a new corporate logo adding a third circle to the two that had been used in the past (the familiar card logo, resembling a Venn diagram, remained unchanged). A new corporate tagline was introduced at the same time: "The Heart of Commerce".[3]
In August 2010, MasterCard expanded its e-commerce offering with the acquisition of DataCash, a UK-based payment processing and fraud/risk management provider.[4][5]
In March 2012, MasterCard announced the expansion of its mobile contactless payments program, including markets across the Middle East.[6]
In spring 2014, MasterCard acquired Australia's leading rewards program manager company Pinpoint for an undisclosed amount.[7]
MasterCard teamed with Apple in September 2014, to incorporate a new mobile wallet feature into Apple's new iPhone models, enabling users to more readily use their MasterCard, and other credit cards.[8]
IPO[edit]
The company, which had been organized as a cooperative of banks, had an initial public offering on May 25, 2006, selling 61.5 million shares at $39 each.[9] The stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol MA, with a market capitalization of $105.15 billion as of August 2016.[10]
Litigation[edit]
Anti-trust lawsuit by ATM operators[edit]
MasterCard, along with Visa, has been sued in a class action by ATM operators that claims the credit card networks' rules effectively fix ATM access fees. The suit claims that this is a restraint on trade in violation of federal law. The lawsuit was filed by the National ATM Council and independent operators of automated teller machines. More specifically, it is alleged that MasterCard's and Visa's network rules prohibit ATM operators from offering lower prices for transactions over PIN-debit networks that are not affiliated with Visa or MasterCard. The suit says that this price fixing artificially raises the price that consumers pay using ATMs, limits the revenue that ATM-operators earn, and violates the Sherman Act's prohibition against unreasonable restraints of trade. Johnathan Rubin, an attorney for the plaintiffs said, "Visa and MasterCard are the ringleaders, organizers, and enforcers of a conspiracy among U.S. banks to fix the price of ATM access fees in order to keep the competition at bay." [11]
Debit card swipe fee price fixing[edit]
Both MasterCard and Visa have paid approximately $3 billion in damages resulting from a class-action lawsuit filed by Hagens Berman in January 1996.[12] The litigation cites several retail giants as plaintiffs, including Wal-Mart, Sears, Roebuck & Co., and Safeway.[13]
Antitrust settlement with U.S. Justice Department[edit]
In October 2010, MasterCard and Visa reached a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department in another antitrust case. The companies agreed to allow merchants displaying their logos to decline certain types of cards (because interchange fees differ), or to offer consumers discounts for using cheaper cards.[14]
Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation[edit]
Main article: Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation
On November 27, 2012, a federal judge entered an order granting preliminary approval to a proposed settlement to a class-action lawsuit filed in 2005 by merchants and trade associations against MasterCard, Visa, and many credit card issuers. The suit was filed due to price fixing and other anti-competitive trade practices employed by MasterCard and Visa. A majority of named class plaintiffs have objected and vowed to opt out of the settlement. Opponents object to provisions that would bar future lawsuits and even prevent merchants from opting out of significant portions of the proposed settlement. Stephen Neuwirth, a lawyer representing Home Depot, said, "It’s so obvious Visa and MasterCard were prepared to make a large payment because of the scope of the releases being given. It’s all one quid pro quo and merchants like the Home Depot are being denied the chance to opt out of that quid pro quo and say this is a bad deal." [15]
Plaintiffs allege that Visa, MasterCard, and major credit card issuers engaged in a conspiracy to fix interchange fees, also known as swipe fees, that are charged to merchants for the privilege of accepting payment cards at artificially high levels. In their complaint, the plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unfairly interfere with merchants from encouraging customers to use less expensive forms of payment such as lower-cost cards, cash, and checks.[15]
The settlement provides for the cash equivalent of a 10 basis-point reduction (0.1 percent) of swipe fees charged to merchants for a period of eight months. This eight-month period would probably begin in the middle of 2013. The total value of the settlement will be about $7.25 billion.[15]
Criticism[edit]
Anti-trust issues in the United States[edit]
Few companies have faced more antitrust lawsuits both in the US and abroad.[16]
MasterCard, along with Visa, engaged in systematic parallel exclusion against American Express during the 1980s and 1990s. MasterCard used exclusivity clauses in its contracts and blacklists to prevent banks from doing business with American Express. Such exclusionary clauses and other written evidence were used by the United States Department of Justice in regulatory actions against MasterCard and Visa.[17] Discover has sued MasterCard for similar issues.[16]
In 1996 about 4 million merchants sued MasterCard in federal court for making them accept debit cards if they wanted to accept credit cards and dramatically increasing credit card swipe fees. This case was settled with a multibillion-dollar payment in 2003. This was the largest anti-trust award in history.[16]
In 1998, the Department of Justice sued MasterCard over rules prohibiting their issuing banks from doing business with American Express or Discover. The Department of Justice won in 2001 and the verdict withstood appeal. American Express also filed suit[16]
On August 23, 2001, MasterCard International Inc. was sued for violating the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.[18]
On November 15, 2004, MasterCard Inc. paid damages to American Express, due to anticompetitive practices that prevented American Express from issuing cards through U.S. banks,[19] and paid 1.8 billion dollars for settlement.[20]
Anti-trust investigations in Europe[edit]
The European Union has repeatedly criticised MasterCard for monopolistic trade practices. In April 2009, MasterCard reached a settlement with the European Union in an antitrust case, promising to reduce debit card swipe fees to 0.2 percent of purchases.[21] In December 2010, a senior official from the European Central Bank called for a break-up of the Visa/MasterCard duopoly by creation of a new European debit card for use in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).[22]
WikiLeaks published documents showing that American authorities lobbied Russia to defend the interests of Visa and MasterCard.[23] In response MasterCard blocked payments to WikiLeaks. Members of the European Parliament expressed concern that payments from European citizens to a European corporation could apparently be blocked by the United States, and called for a further reduction in the dominance of Visa and MasterCard in the European payment system.[24]
As of 2013, MasterCard is under investigation by the European Union for the high fees it charges tourists who use their cards in Europe, and other anti-competitive practices that could hinder electronic commerce and international trade, and high fees associated with premium credit cards. The EU's competition regulator said that these fees were of special concern because of the growing role of non-cash payments. MasterCard charges non-European tourists much more than customers using cards issued in Europe. MasterCard could be fined up to 10 percent of its 2012 revenue or around $740 million. MasterCard was banned from charging fees on cross-border transactions conducted wholly within the EU via a ruling by the European Commission in 2007.[25] The European Commission said that their investigation also includes large differences in fees across national borders. For instance, a 50-euro payment might cost 10 euro cents in the Netherlands but eight times that amount in Poland. The Commission argues that MasterCard rules that prohibit merchants from enjoying better terms offered in other EU countries may be against anti-trust law.
The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) praised the action against MasterCard. BEUC said interbank fees push up prices and hurt consumers. BEUC Director General Monique Goyens said, "So in the end, all consumers are hit by a scheme which ultimately rewards the card company and issuing bank." [25]
Sanctions of Russia[edit]
On December 27, 2014, Visa Inc. and MasterCard suspended servicing some Russian banks in Crimea:[26] Rossiya Bank, Sobinbank, SMP Bank and Investcapitalbank,[27] after the USA issued sanctions against the Russian government due to the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine.
Regulatory action in Australia and New Zealand[edit]
In 2003, the Reserve Bank of Australia required that interchange fees be dramatically reduced, from about 0.95% of the transaction to approximately 0.5%.[citation needed] One notable result has been the reduced use of reward cards and increased use of debit cards. Australia also prohibited the "no surcharge" rule, a policy established by credit card networks like Visa and MasterCard to prevent merchants from charging a credit card usage fee to the cardholder. A surcharge would mitigate or even exceed the merchant discount paid by a merchant, but would also make the cardholder more reluctant to use the card as the method of payment. Australia has also made changes to the interchange rates on debit cards and has considered abolishing interchange fees altogether.
As of November 2006, New Zealand was considering similar actions, following a Commerce Commission lawsuit alleging price-fixing by Visa and MasterCard. In New Zealand, merchants pay a 1.8% fee on every credit card transaction.
Blocking payments to WikiLeaks[edit]
In December 2010, MasterCard blocked all payments to WikiLeaks due to claims that they engage in illegal activity.[28] In a response, a group of online activists calling themselves "Anonymous" organised a denial-of-service attack; as a result, the MasterCard website experienced downtime on December 8–9, 2010.[29] On December 9, 2010 the servers of MasterCard underwent a massive attack[30] as part of an Operation Avenge Assange for closing down payments of whistleblowing platform WikiLeaks. According to several news sites, security of thousands of credit cards was compromised during that attack due to a phishing-site set up by the attackers.[31] However, MasterCard denied this, stating that "cardholder account data has not been placed at risk".[32] WikiLeaks spokesman said: "We neither condemn nor applaud these attacks."[33] U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay said that closing down credit lines for donations to WikiLeaks "could be interpreted as an attempt to censor the publication of information, thus potentially violating WikiLeaks' right to freedom of expression".[34]
The company that enables WikiLeaks to accept credit and debit card donations[who?] said it would take legal action against Visa Europe and MasterCard.[35] Iceland-based IT firm DataCell said it would move immediately to try to force the two companies to resume allowing payments to the website.[citation needed] DataCell had earlier[when?] said that suspension of payments towards WikiLeaks is a violation of the agreements with their customers. On July 14, 2011 DataCell announced they had filed a complaint with the European Commission claiming the closure by Visa and MasterCard of Datcell‘s access to the payment card networks violated the competition rules of the European Community.[36]
On July 12, 2012 a Reykjavík court ruled that Valitor, Visa and MasterCard's partner in Iceland, had to start processing donations within fourteen days[37] on pain of daily fines to the amount of ISK 800,000 (some $6000) for each day after that time, to open the payment gateway. Valitor also had to pay DataCell's litigation costs of ISK 1,500,000.[38][39]
Corporate branding of all Nigerian ID Cards[edit]
In 2014, pursuant to an agreement between MasterCard and the Nigerian Government, acting through the National Identity Management Commission, the new Nigerian ID cards will bear MasterCard logo, contain personal database data and double as payment cards, irrevocably linking such payments to the individuals,[40] sparking criticism by the Civil Rights Congress alleging that it "represents a stamped ownership of a Nigerian by an American company ... reminiscent of the logo pasted on the bodies of African slaves transported across the Atlantic."[41]
Prepaid debit cards[edit]
MasterCard, Comerica Bank, and the U.S. Treasury Department teamed up in 2008 to create the Direct Express Debit MasterCard prepaid debit card. The federal government uses the Express Debit product to issue electronic payments to people who do not have bank accounts, who are often referred to collectively as the "unbanked". Comerica Bank is the issuing bank for the debit card.
The Direct Express cards give recipients a number of consumer protections.
In June 2013, MasterCard announced a partnership with British Airways to offer members the Executive Club Multi-currency Cash Passport, which will allow members to earn extra points and make multi-currency payments. The Passport card allows users to load up to ten currencies (euro, pound, U.S. dollar, Turkish Lira, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, New Zealand dollar, U.A.E. dirham and South African rand) at a locked-in rate. When used, the card selects the local currency to ensure the best exchange rate, and if the local currency is not already loaded onto the card, funds are used from other currencies.[citation needed]
Advertising[edit]
MasterCard's current advertising campaign tagline is "Priceless". The slogan associated with the campaign is "There are some things money can't buy. For everything else, there's MasterCard." The Priceless campaign in more recent iterations has been applicable to both MasterCard's credit card and debit card products. They also use the Priceless description to promote products such as their "priceless travel" site which features deals and offers for MasterCard holders,[42] and "priceless cities", offers for people in specified locations.[43]
The first of these Priceless ads was run during the 1997 World Series and there are numerous different TV, radio and print ads.[44] MasterCard registered Priceless as a trademark.[45] Actor Billy Crudup has been the voice in the US market; in the UK, actor Jack Davenport is the voice. The original idea and concept of the campaign stems from the advertising agency of McCann Erickson (as it was named in 1997).[46]
The purpose of the campaign is to position MasterCard as a friendly credit card company with a sense of humor, as well as responding to the public's worry that everything is being commodified and that people are becoming too materialistic.[47]
Many parodies have been made using this same pattern, especially on Comedy Central, though MasterCard has threatened legal action,[48] contending that MasterCard views such parodies as a violation of its rights under the federal and state trademark and unfair competition laws, under the federal and state anti-dilution laws, and under the Copyright Act. Despite these claims, however, noted US consumer advocate and presidential candidate Ralph Nader emerged victorious (after a four-year battle) in the suit MasterCard brought against him after he produced his own "Priceless" political commercials.[49] In the election ads Nader had criticized the corporate financing of both the Bush and Gore campaigns. Using the theme and some of the language behind the MasterCard "Priceless" campaign the election specified the dollar amounts contributed by corporate interests to both candidates and then summed it up with "finding out the truth ... priceless". MasterCard sued Nader's campaign committee and filed a temporary restraining order to stop the ads. The TRO was not granted and Nader defended the ads by claiming they were protected under the fair use doctrine.[50]
Litigation of "Priceless" ad campaign[edit]
In 1994 Argentinian born Edgardo Apestguia created in Paraguay an ad campaign for Bancard's credit card. Its slogan was "There are things money can't buy, but, for everything else, there is Bancard".[51] Plagiarism lawsuits were filed in Paraguay and Chile against MasterCard and their publicist McCann, who registered the "priceless" slogan ads in the US in 1999 and was represented in Paraguay by Nafta and Biedermann publicists at the time.
MasterCard MarketPlace[edit]
Through a partnership with an Internet company that specializes in personalized shopping, MasterCard introduced a Web shopping mall on April 16, 2010 that it said can pinpoint with considerable accuracy what its cardholders are likely to purchase.[52]
Sports sponsorships[edit]
MasterCard engages in the sponsorship of major sporting events throughout the world. These include the New Zealand All Blacks the country's rugby team,[53] Major League Baseball, the UEFA Champions League, the PGA Tour's Arnold Palmer Invitational Presented by MasterCard,[54] the Canadian Hockey League's Memorial Cup and recently announced a new sponsorship deal with Australian Cricket team. Previously it also sponsored FIFA World Cup but withdrew its contract after a court settlement and its rival Visa took up the contract in 2007.[55] In 1997, MasterCard was the main sponsor of the MasterCard Lola Formula One team, which withdrew from the 1997 Formula One season after its first race due to financial problems.

Mastercard Contactless[edit]





PayPass RFID chip from a Mastercard






Mastercard issued by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Semi-transparency shows PayPass antenna, connecting to RFID chip.


Mastercard Contactless (formerly branded Paypass[60]) is an EMV-compatible, "contactless" payment feature similar to American Express' ExpressPay, and Visa payWave. All three use the same symbol as shown on the right. It is based on the ISO/IEC 14443 standard that provides cardholders with a simpler way to pay by tapping a payment card or other payment device, such as a phone or key fob, on a point-of-sale terminal reader rather than swiping or inserting a card. PayPass can currently be used on transactions up to and including 30 GBP, 25 EUR, 50 USD, 100 CAD, 200 NOK, 80 NZD, 100 AUD, 1000 RUB or 2000 INR.
In 2003, Mastercard concluded a nine-month PayPass market trial in Orlando, Florida with JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, and MBNA. More than 16,000 cardholders and more than 60 retailer locations participated in the market trial.[needs update] In addition, Mastercard worked with Nokia, AT&T Wireless, and JPMorgan Chase to incorporate Mastercard PayPass into mobile phones using near-field communication technology, in Dallas, Texas. In 2011, Google and Mastercard launched Google Wallet, an Android application which allows a mobile device to send credit/debit card information directly to a Paypass-enabled payment terminal, bypassing the need for a physical card, up until the creation of Android Pay.
During late 2015, Citicards in the USA stopped issuing Paypass-enabled plastic, but the keyfob was still available upon request. Effective July 16, 2016, Citicards will stop supporting Paypass completely. While existing plastic and keyfobs will continue to work until their expiration date, no new Paypass-enabled hardware will be issued to US customers after that date.
QkR[edit]
QkR is a mobile payment app developed by MasterCard, for the purpose of ordering products and services through a smartphone with payments charged to the associated credit card. It is being deployed for use in large scale events, such as sport events, concerts, or movie theaters. Unlike other MasterCard mobile payment apps such as Pay Pass, QkR does not use NFC from the phone, but rather an Internet connection.
Users can open the app, scan a QR code located on the back of the seat in front of them, and place orders for refreshments of their choice.[61][62] The order is dispatched to a nearby concession stand, from where a runner delivers the items to the patrons' seats. It is already deployed in Australian movie theaters and is being tested in Yankee Stadium.
QkR is being marketed to vendors as a replacement for other mobile payment apps and a mobile ordering app, either distributed by the vendor (such as Starbucks's app, McDonald's' app, or Chipotle's mobile ordering app) or by a third party, such as Square, headed by Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey.
Banknet[edit]
MasterCard operates Banknet, a global telecommunications network linking all MasterCard card issuers, acquirers, and data processing centers into a single financial network. The operations hub is located in St. Louis, Missouri. Banknet uses the ISO 8583 protocol.
MasterCard's network differs significantly from Visa's. Visa's is a star-based system where all endpoints terminate at one of several main data centers, where all transactions are processed centrally. MasterCard's network is an edge-based, peer-to-peer network where transactions travel a meshed network directly to other endpoints, without the need to travel to a single point. This allows MasterCard's network to be much more resilient, in that a single failure cannot isolate a large number of endpoints.[63]

Mastercard Incorporated or Mastercard Worldwide is an American multinational financial services corporation headquartered in the MasterCard International Global Headquarters, Purchase, New York, United States,[1] in Westchester County. The Global Operations Headquarters is located in O'Fallon, Missouri, United States, a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri. Throughout the world, its principal business is to process payments between the banks of merchants and the card issuing banks or credit unions of the purchasers who use the "Mastercard" brand debit and credit cards to make purchases. Mastercard Worldwide has been a publicly traded company since 2006. Prior to its initial public offering, MasterCard Worldwide was a cooperative owned by the more than 25,000 financial institutions that issue its branded cards.
Mastercard, originally known as Interbank/Master Charge,[2] was created by several California banks as a competitor to the BankAmericard issued by Bank of America, which later became the Visa credit card issued by Visa Inc. From 1966 to 1979, Mastercard was called "Interbank" and "Master Charge".

The original banks behind MasterCard were United California Bank (later First Interstate Bank and subsequently merged into Wells Fargo Bank), Wells Fargo, Crocker National Bank (also subsequently merged into Wells Fargo), and the Bank of California (subsequently merged into the Union Bank of California).
In 1966, the aforementioned group of California banks formed the Interbank Card Association (ICA). With the help of New York's Marine Midland Bank (now HSBC Bank USA), these banks joined with the ICA to create "Master Charge: The Interbank Card". The card was given a significant boost in 1969, when First National City Bank joined, merging its proprietary Everything Card with Master Charge.
In 1968, the ICA and Eurocard started a strategic alliance, which effectively allowed the ICA access to the European market, and for Eurocard to be accepted on the ICA network. The Access card system from the United Kingdom joined the ICA/Eurocard alliance in 1972.
In 1979, "Master Charge: The Interbank Card" was renamed "MasterCard". In 1997, Mastercard took over the Access card; the Access brand was then retired.
In 2002, MasterCard International merged with Europay International, another large credit-card issuer association, of which Eurocard had become a part in 1992.
In mid-2006, MasterCard International changed its name to MasterCard Worldwide. This was done in order to suggest a more global scale of operations. In addition, the company introduced a new corporate logo adding a third circle to the two that had been used in the past (the familiar card logo, resembling a Venn diagram, remained unchanged). A new corporate tagline was introduced at the same time: "The Heart of Commerce".[3]
In August 2010, MasterCard expanded its e-commerce offering with the acquisition of DataCash, a UK-based payment processing and fraud/risk management provider.[4][5]
In March 2012, MasterCard announced the expansion of its mobile contactless payments program, including markets across the Middle East.[6]
In spring 2014, MasterCard acquired Australia's leading rewards program manager company Pinpoint for an undisclosed amount.[7]
MasterCard teamed with Apple in September 2014, to incorporate a new mobile wallet feature into Apple's new iPhone models, enabling users to more readily use their MasterCard, and other credit cards.[8]
IPO[edit]
The company, which had been organized as a cooperative of banks, had an initial public offering on May 25, 2006, selling 61.5 million shares at $39 each.[9] The stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol MA, with a market capitalization of $105.15 billion as of August 2016.[10]
Litigation[edit]
Anti-trust lawsuit by ATM operators[edit]
MasterCard, along with Visa, has been sued in a class action by ATM operators that claims the credit card networks' rules effectively fix ATM access fees. The suit claims that this is a restraint on trade in violation of federal law. The lawsuit was filed by the National ATM Council and independent operators of automated teller machines. More specifically, it is alleged that MasterCard's and Visa's network rules prohibit ATM operators from offering lower prices for transactions over PIN-debit networks that are not affiliated with Visa or MasterCard. The suit says that this price fixing artificially raises the price that consumers pay using ATMs, limits the revenue that ATM-operators earn, and violates the Sherman Act's prohibition against unreasonable restraints of trade. Johnathan Rubin, an attorney for the plaintiffs said, "Visa and MasterCard are the ringleaders, organizers, and enforcers of a conspiracy among U.S. banks to fix the price of ATM access fees in order to keep the competition at bay." [11]
Debit card swipe fee price fixing[edit]
Both MasterCard and Visa have paid approximately $3 billion in damages resulting from a class-action lawsuit filed by Hagens Berman in January 1996.[12] The litigation cites several retail giants as plaintiffs, including Wal-Mart, Sears, Roebuck & Co., and Safeway.[13]
Antitrust settlement with U.S. Justice Department[edit]
In October 2010, MasterCard and Visa reached a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department in another antitrust case. The companies agreed to allow merchants displaying their logos to decline certain types of cards (because interchange fees differ), or to offer consumers discounts for using cheaper cards.[14]
Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation[edit]
Main article: Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation
On November 27, 2012, a federal judge entered an order granting preliminary approval to a proposed settlement to a class-action lawsuit filed in 2005 by merchants and trade associations against MasterCard, Visa, and many credit card issuers. The suit was filed due to price fixing and other anti-competitive trade practices employed by MasterCard and Visa. A majority of named class plaintiffs have objected and vowed to opt out of the settlement. Opponents object to provisions that would bar future lawsuits and even prevent merchants from opting out of significant portions of the proposed settlement. Stephen Neuwirth, a lawyer representing Home Depot, said, "It’s so obvious Visa and MasterCard were prepared to make a large payment because of the scope of the releases being given. It’s all one quid pro quo and merchants like the Home Depot are being denied the chance to opt out of that quid pro quo and say this is a bad deal." [15]
Plaintiffs allege that Visa, MasterCard, and major credit card issuers engaged in a conspiracy to fix interchange fees, also known as swipe fees, that are charged to merchants for the privilege of accepting payment cards at artificially high levels. In their complaint, the plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unfairly interfere with merchants from encouraging customers to use less expensive forms of payment such as lower-cost cards, cash, and checks.[15]
The settlement provides for the cash equivalent of a 10 basis-point reduction (0.1 percent) of swipe fees charged to merchants for a period of eight months. This eight-month period would probably begin in the middle of 2013. The total value of the settlement will be about $7.25 billion.[15]
Criticism[edit]
Anti-trust issues in the United States[edit]
Few companies have faced more antitrust lawsuits both in the US and abroad.[16]
MasterCard, along with Visa, engaged in systematic parallel exclusion against American Express during the 1980s and 1990s. MasterCard used exclusivity clauses in its contracts and blacklists to prevent banks from doing business with American Express. Such exclusionary clauses and other written evidence were used by the United States Department of Justice in regulatory actions against MasterCard and Visa.[17] Discover has sued MasterCard for similar issues.[16]
In 1996 about 4 million merchants sued MasterCard in federal court for making them accept debit cards if they wanted to accept credit cards and dramatically increasing credit card swipe fees. This case was settled with a multibillion-dollar payment in 2003. This was the largest anti-trust award in history.[16]
In 1998, the Department of Justice sued MasterCard over rules prohibiting their issuing banks from doing business with American Express or Discover. The Department of Justice won in 2001 and the verdict withstood appeal. American Express also filed suit[16]
On August 23, 2001, MasterCard International Inc. was sued for violating the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.[18]
On November 15, 2004, MasterCard Inc. paid damages to American Express, due to anticompetitive practices that prevented American Express from issuing cards through U.S. banks,[19] and paid 1.8 billion dollars for settlement.[20]
Anti-trust investigations in Europe[edit]
The European Union has repeatedly criticised MasterCard for monopolistic trade practices. In April 2009, MasterCard reached a settlement with the European Union in an antitrust case, promising to reduce debit card swipe fees to 0.2 percent of purchases.[21] In December 2010, a senior official from the European Central Bank called for a break-up of the Visa/MasterCard duopoly by creation of a new European debit card for use in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).[22]
WikiLeaks published documents showing that American authorities lobbied Russia to defend the interests of Visa and MasterCard.[23] In response MasterCard blocked payments to WikiLeaks. Members of the European Parliament expressed concern that payments from European citizens to a European corporation could apparently be blocked by the United States, and called for a further reduction in the dominance of Visa and MasterCard in the European payment system.[24]
As of 2013, MasterCard is under investigation by the European Union for the high fees it charges tourists who use their cards in Europe, and other anti-competitive practices that could hinder electronic commerce and international trade, and high fees associated with premium credit cards. The EU's competition regulator said that these fees were of special concern because of the growing role of non-cash payments. MasterCard charges non-European tourists much more than customers using cards issued in Europe. MasterCard could be fined up to 10 percent of its 2012 revenue or around $740 million. MasterCard was banned from charging fees on cross-border transactions conducted wholly within the EU via a ruling by the European Commission in 2007.[25] The European Commission said that their investigation also includes large differences in fees across national borders. For instance, a 50-euro payment might cost 10 euro cents in the Netherlands but eight times that amount in Poland. The Commission argues that MasterCard rules that prohibit merchants from enjoying better terms offered in other EU countries may be against anti-trust law.
The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) praised the action against MasterCard. BEUC said interbank fees push up prices and hurt consumers. BEUC Director General Monique Goyens said, "So in the end, all consumers are hit by a scheme which ultimately rewards the card company and issuing bank." [25]
Sanctions of Russia[edit]
On December 27, 2014, Visa Inc. and MasterCard suspended servicing some Russian banks in Crimea:[26] Rossiya Bank, Sobinbank, SMP Bank and Investcapitalbank,[27] after the USA issued sanctions against the Russian government due to the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine.
Regulatory action in Australia and New Zealand[edit]
In 2003, the Reserve Bank of Australia required that interchange fees be dramatically reduced, from about 0.95% of the transaction to approximately 0.5%.[citation needed] One notable result has been the reduced use of reward cards and increased use of debit cards. Australia also prohibited the "no surcharge" rule, a policy established by credit card networks like Visa and MasterCard to prevent merchants from charging a credit card usage fee to the cardholder. A surcharge would mitigate or even exceed the merchant discount paid by a merchant, but would also make the cardholder more reluctant to use the card as the method of payment. Australia has also made changes to the interchange rates on debit cards and has considered abolishing interchange fees altogether.
As of November 2006, New Zealand was considering similar actions, following a Commerce Commission lawsuit alleging price-fixing by Visa and MasterCard. In New Zealand, merchants pay a 1.8% fee on every credit card transaction.
Blocking payments to WikiLeaks[edit]
In December 2010, MasterCard blocked all payments to WikiLeaks due to claims that they engage in illegal activity.[28] In a response, a group of online activists calling themselves "Anonymous" organised a denial-of-service attack; as a result, the MasterCard website experienced downtime on December 8–9, 2010.[29] On December 9, 2010 the servers of MasterCard underwent a massive attack[30] as part of an Operation Avenge Assange for closing down payments of whistleblowing platform WikiLeaks. According to several news sites, security of thousands of credit cards was compromised during that attack due to a phishing-site set up by the attackers.[31] However, MasterCard denied this, stating that "cardholder account data has not been placed at risk".[32] WikiLeaks spokesman said: "We neither condemn nor applaud these attacks."[33] U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay said that closing down credit lines for donations to WikiLeaks "could be interpreted as an attempt to censor the publication of information, thus potentially violating WikiLeaks' right to freedom of expression".[34]
The company that enables WikiLeaks to accept credit and debit card donations[who?] said it would take legal action against Visa Europe and MasterCard.[35] Iceland-based IT firm DataCell said it would move immediately to try to force the two companies to resume allowing payments to the website.[citation needed] DataCell had earlier[when?] said that suspension of payments towards WikiLeaks is a violation of the agreements with their customers. On July 14, 2011 DataCell announced they had filed a complaint with the European Commission claiming the closure by Visa and MasterCard of Datcell‘s access to the payment card networks violated the competition rules of the European Community.[36]
On July 12, 2012 a Reykjavík court ruled that Valitor, Visa and MasterCard's partner in Iceland, had to start processing donations within fourteen days[37] on pain of daily fines to the amount of ISK 800,000 (some $6000) for each day after that time, to open the payment gateway. Valitor also had to pay DataCell's litigation costs of ISK 1,500,000.[38][39]
Corporate branding of all Nigerian ID Cards[edit]
In 2014, pursuant to an agreement between MasterCard and the Nigerian Government, acting through the National Identity Management Commission, the new Nigerian ID cards will bear MasterCard logo, contain personal database data and double as payment cards, irrevocably linking such payments to the individuals,[40] sparking criticism by the Civil Rights Congress alleging that it "represents a stamped ownership of a Nigerian by an American company ... reminiscent of the logo pasted on the bodies of African slaves transported across the Atlantic."[41]
Prepaid debit cards[edit]
MasterCard, Comerica Bank, and the U.S. Treasury Department teamed up in 2008 to create the Direct Express Debit MasterCard prepaid debit card. The federal government uses the Express Debit product to issue electronic payments to people who do not have bank accounts, who are often referred to collectively as the "unbanked". Comerica Bank is the issuing bank for the debit card.
The Direct Express cards give recipients a number of consumer protections.
In June 2013, MasterCard announced a partnership with British Airways to offer members the Executive Club Multi-currency Cash Passport, which will allow members to earn extra points and make multi-currency payments. The Passport card allows users to load up to ten currencies (euro, pound, U.S. dollar, Turkish Lira, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, New Zealand dollar, U.A.E. dirham and South African rand) at a locked-in rate. When used, the card selects the local currency to ensure the best exchange rate, and if the local currency is not already loaded onto the card, funds are used from other currencies.[citation needed]
Advertising[edit]
MasterCard's current advertising campaign tagline is "Priceless". The slogan associated with the campaign is "There are some things money can't buy. For everything else, there's MasterCard." The Priceless campaign in more recent iterations has been applicable to both MasterCard's credit card and debit card products. They also use the Priceless description to promote products such as their "priceless travel" site which features deals and offers for MasterCard holders,[42] and "priceless cities", offers for people in specified locations.[43]
The first of these Priceless ads was run during the 1997 World Series and there are numerous different TV, radio and print ads.[44] MasterCard registered Priceless as a trademark.[45] Actor Billy Crudup has been the voice in the US market; in the UK, actor Jack Davenport is the voice. The original idea and concept of the campaign stems from the advertising agency of McCann Erickson (as it was named in 1997).[46]
The purpose of the campaign is to position MasterCard as a friendly credit card company with a sense of humor, as well as responding to the public's worry that everything is being commodified and that people are becoming too materialistic.[47]
Many parodies have been made using this same pattern, especially on Comedy Central, though MasterCard has threatened legal action,[48] contending that MasterCard views such parodies as a violation of its rights under the federal and state trademark and unfair competition laws, under the federal and state anti-dilution laws, and under the Copyright Act. Despite these claims, however, noted US consumer advocate and presidential candidate Ralph Nader emerged victorious (after a four-year battle) in the suit MasterCard brought against him after he produced his own "Priceless" political commercials.[49] In the election ads Nader had criticized the corporate financing of both the Bush and Gore campaigns. Using the theme and some of the language behind the MasterCard "Priceless" campaign the election specified the dollar amounts contributed by corporate interests to both candidates and then summed it up with "finding out the truth ... priceless". MasterCard sued Nader's campaign committee and filed a temporary restraining order to stop the ads. The TRO was not granted and Nader defended the ads by claiming they were protected under the fair use doctrine.[50]
Litigation of "Priceless" ad campaign[edit]
In 1994 Argentinian born Edgardo Apestguia created in Paraguay an ad campaign for Bancard's credit card. Its slogan was "There are things money can't buy, but, for everything else, there is Bancard".[51] Plagiarism lawsuits were filed in Paraguay and Chile against MasterCard and their publicist McCann, who registered the "priceless" slogan ads in the US in 1999 and was represented in Paraguay by Nafta and Biedermann publicists at the time.
MasterCard MarketPlace[edit]
Through a partnership with an Internet company that specializes in personalized shopping, MasterCard introduced a Web shopping mall on April 16, 2010 that it said can pinpoint with considerable accuracy what its cardholders are likely to purchase.[52]
Sports sponsorships[edit]
MasterCard engages in the sponsorship of major sporting events throughout the world. These include the New Zealand All Blacks the country's rugby team,[53] Major League Baseball, the UEFA Champions League, the PGA Tour's Arnold Palmer Invitational Presented by MasterCard,[54] the Canadian Hockey League's Memorial Cup and recently announced a new sponsorship deal with Australian Cricket team. Previously it also sponsored FIFA World Cup but withdrew its contract after a court settlement and its rival Visa took up the contract in 2007.[55] In 1997, MasterCard was the main sponsor of the MasterCard Lola Formula One team, which withdrew from the 1997 Formula One season after its first race due to financial problems.

Mastercard Contactless[edit]





PayPass RFID chip from a Mastercard






Mastercard issued by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Semi-transparency shows PayPass antenna, connecting to RFID chip.


Mastercard Contactless (formerly branded Paypass[60]) is an EMV-compatible, "contactless" payment feature similar to American Express' ExpressPay, and Visa payWave. All three use the same symbol as shown on the right. It is based on the ISO/IEC 14443 standard that provides cardholders with a simpler way to pay by tapping a payment card or other payment device, such as a phone or key fob, on a point-of-sale terminal reader rather than swiping or inserting a card. PayPass can currently be used on transactions up to and including 30 GBP, 25 EUR, 50 USD, 100 CAD, 200 NOK, 80 NZD, 100 AUD, 1000 RUB or 2000 INR.
In 2003, Mastercard concluded a nine-month PayPass market trial in Orlando, Florida with JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, and MBNA. More than 16,000 cardholders and more than 60 retailer locations participated in the market trial.[needs update] In addition, Mastercard worked with Nokia, AT&T Wireless, and JPMorgan Chase to incorporate Mastercard PayPass into mobile phones using near-field communication technology, in Dallas, Texas. In 2011, Google and Mastercard launched Google Wallet, an Android application which allows a mobile device to send credit/debit card information directly to a Paypass-enabled payment terminal, bypassing the need for a physical card, up until the creation of Android Pay.
During late 2015, Citicards in the USA stopped issuing Paypass-enabled plastic, but the keyfob was still available upon request. Effective July 16, 2016, Citicards will stop supporting Paypass completely. While existing plastic and keyfobs will continue to work until their expiration date, no new Paypass-enabled hardware will be issued to US customers after that date.
QkR[edit]
QkR is a mobile payment app developed by MasterCard, for the purpose of ordering products and services through a smartphone with payments charged to the associated credit card. It is being deployed for use in large scale events, such as sport events, concerts, or movie theaters. Unlike other MasterCard mobile payment apps such as Pay Pass, QkR does not use NFC from the phone, but rather an Internet connection.
Users can open the app, scan a QR code located on the back of the seat in front of them, and place orders for refreshments of their choice.[61][62] The order is dispatched to a nearby concession stand, from where a runner delivers the items to the patrons' seats. It is already deployed in Australian movie theaters and is being tested in Yankee Stadium.
QkR is being marketed to vendors as a replacement for other mobile payment apps and a mobile ordering app, either distributed by the vendor (such as Starbucks's app, McDonald's' app, or Chipotle's mobile ordering app) or by a third party, such as Square, headed by Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey.
Banknet[edit]
MasterCard operates Banknet, a global telecommunications network linking all MasterCard card issuers, acquirers, and data processing centers into a single financial network. The operations hub is located in St. Louis, Missouri. Banknet uses the ISO 8583 protocol.
MasterCard's network differs significantly from Visa's. Visa's is a star-based system where all endpoints terminate at one of several main data centers, where all transactions are processed centrally. MasterCard's network is an edge-based, peer-to-peer network where transactions travel a meshed network directly to other endpoints, without the need to travel to a single point. This allows MasterCard's network to be much more resilient, in that a single failure cannot isolate a large number of endpoints.[63]

Mastercard Incorporated or Mastercard Worldwide is an American multinational financial services corporation headquartered in the MasterCard International Global Headquarters, Purchase, New York, United States,[1] in Westchester County. The Global Operations Headquarters is located in O'Fallon, Missouri, United States, a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri. Throughout the world, its principal business is to process payments between the banks of merchants and the card issuing banks or credit unions of the purchasers who use the "Mastercard" brand debit and credit cards to make purchases. Mastercard Worldwide has been a publicly traded company since 2006. Prior to its initial public offering, MasterCard Worldwide was a cooperative owned by the more than 25,000 financial institutions that issue its branded cards.
Mastercard, originally known as Interbank/Master Charge,[2] was created by several California banks as a competitor to the BankAmericard issued by Bank of America, which later became the Visa credit card issued by Visa Inc. From 1966 to 1979, Mastercard was called "Interbank" and "Master Charge".

The original banks behind MasterCard were United California Bank (later First Interstate Bank and subsequently merged into Wells Fargo Bank), Wells Fargo, Crocker National Bank (also subsequently merged into Wells Fargo), and the Bank of California (subsequently merged into the Union Bank of California).
In 1966, the aforementioned group of California banks formed the Interbank Card Association (ICA). With the help of New York's Marine Midland Bank (now HSBC Bank USA), these banks joined with the ICA to create "Master Charge: The Interbank Card". The card was given a significant boost in 1969, when First National City Bank joined, merging its proprietary Everything Card with Master Charge.
In 1968, the ICA and Eurocard started a strategic alliance, which effectively allowed the ICA access to the European market, and for Eurocard to be accepted on the ICA network. The Access card system from the United Kingdom joined the ICA/Eurocard alliance in 1972.
In 1979, "Master Charge: The Interbank Card" was renamed "MasterCard". In 1997, Mastercard took over the Access card; the Access brand was then retired.
In 2002, MasterCard International merged with Europay International, another large credit-card issuer association, of which Eurocard had become a part in 1992.
In mid-2006, MasterCard International changed its name to MasterCard Worldwide. This was done in order to suggest a more global scale of operations. In addition, the company introduced a new corporate logo adding a third circle to the two that had been used in the past (the familiar card logo, resembling a Venn diagram, remained unchanged). A new corporate tagline was introduced at the same time: "The Heart of Commerce".[3]
In August 2010, MasterCard expanded its e-commerce offering with the acquisition of DataCash, a UK-based payment processing and fraud/risk management provider.[4][5]
In March 2012, MasterCard announced the expansion of its mobile contactless payments program, including markets across the Middle East.[6]
In spring 2014, MasterCard acquired Australia's leading rewards program manager company Pinpoint for an undisclosed amount.[7]
MasterCard teamed with Apple in September 2014, to incorporate a new mobile wallet feature into Apple's new iPhone models, enabling users to more readily use their MasterCard, and other credit cards.[8]
IPO[edit]
The company, which had been organized as a cooperative of banks, had an initial public offering on May 25, 2006, selling 61.5 million shares at $39 each.[9] The stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol MA, with a market capitalization of $105.15 billion as of August 2016.[10]
Litigation[edit]
Anti-trust lawsuit by ATM operators[edit]
MasterCard, along with Visa, has been sued in a class action by ATM operators that claims the credit card networks' rules effectively fix ATM access fees. The suit claims that this is a restraint on trade in violation of federal law. The lawsuit was filed by the National ATM Council and independent operators of automated teller machines. More specifically, it is alleged that MasterCard's and Visa's network rules prohibit ATM operators from offering lower prices for transactions over PIN-debit networks that are not affiliated with Visa or MasterCard. The suit says that this price fixing artificially raises the price that consumers pay using ATMs, limits the revenue that ATM-operators earn, and violates the Sherman Act's prohibition against unreasonable restraints of trade. Johnathan Rubin, an attorney for the plaintiffs said, "Visa and MasterCard are the ringleaders, organizers, and enforcers of a conspiracy among U.S. banks to fix the price of ATM access fees in order to keep the competition at bay." [11]
Debit card swipe fee price fixing[edit]
Both MasterCard and Visa have paid approximately $3 billion in damages resulting from a class-action lawsuit filed by Hagens Berman in January 1996.[12] The litigation cites several retail giants as plaintiffs, including Wal-Mart, Sears, Roebuck & Co., and Safeway.[13]
Antitrust settlement with U.S. Justice Department[edit]
In October 2010, MasterCard and Visa reached a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department in another antitrust case. The companies agreed to allow merchants displaying their logos to decline certain types of cards (because interchange fees differ), or to offer consumers discounts for using cheaper cards.[14]
Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation[edit]
Main article: Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation
On November 27, 2012, a federal judge entered an order granting preliminary approval to a proposed settlement to a class-action lawsuit filed in 2005 by merchants and trade associations against MasterCard, Visa, and many credit card issuers. The suit was filed due to price fixing and other anti-competitive trade practices employed by MasterCard and Visa. A majority of named class plaintiffs have objected and vowed to opt out of the settlement. Opponents object to provisions that would bar future lawsuits and even prevent merchants from opting out of significant portions of the proposed settlement. Stephen Neuwirth, a lawyer representing Home Depot, said, "It’s so obvious Visa and MasterCard were prepared to make a large payment because of the scope of the releases being given. It’s all one quid pro quo and merchants like the Home Depot are being denied the chance to opt out of that quid pro quo and say this is a bad deal." [15]
Plaintiffs allege that Visa, MasterCard, and major credit card issuers engaged in a conspiracy to fix interchange fees, also known as swipe fees, that are charged to merchants for the privilege of accepting payment cards at artificially high levels. In their complaint, the plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unfairly interfere with merchants from encouraging customers to use less expensive forms of payment such as lower-cost cards, cash, and checks.[15]
The settlement provides for the cash equivalent of a 10 basis-point reduction (0.1 percent) of swipe fees charged to merchants for a period of eight months. This eight-month period would probably begin in the middle of 2013. The total value of the settlement will be about $7.25 billion.[15]
Criticism[edit]
Anti-trust issues in the United States[edit]
Few companies have faced more antitrust lawsuits both in the US and abroad.[16]
MasterCard, along with Visa, engaged in systematic parallel exclusion against American Express during the 1980s and 1990s. MasterCard used exclusivity clauses in its contracts and blacklists to prevent banks from doing business with American Express. Such exclusionary clauses and other written evidence were used by the United States Department of Justice in regulatory actions against MasterCard and Visa.[17] Discover has sued MasterCard for similar issues.[16]
In 1996 about 4 million merchants sued MasterCard in federal court for making them accept debit cards if they wanted to accept credit cards and dramatically increasing credit card swipe fees. This case was settled with a multibillion-dollar payment in 2003. This was the largest anti-trust award in history.[16]
In 1998, the Department of Justice sued MasterCard over rules prohibiting their issuing banks from doing business with American Express or Discover. The Department of Justice won in 2001 and the verdict withstood appeal. American Express also filed suit[16]
On August 23, 2001, MasterCard International Inc. was sued for violating the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.[18]
On November 15, 2004, MasterCard Inc. paid damages to American Express, due to anticompetitive practices that prevented American Express from issuing cards through U.S. banks,[19] and paid 1.8 billion dollars for settlement.[20]
Anti-trust investigations in Europe[edit]
The European Union has repeatedly criticised MasterCard for monopolistic trade practices. In April 2009, MasterCard reached a settlement with the European Union in an antitrust case, promising to reduce debit card swipe fees to 0.2 percent of purchases.[21] In December 2010, a senior official from the European Central Bank called for a break-up of the Visa/MasterCard duopoly by creation of a new European debit card for use in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).[22]
WikiLeaks published documents showing that American authorities lobbied Russia to defend the interests of Visa and MasterCard.[23] In response MasterCard blocked payments to WikiLeaks. Members of the European Parliament expressed concern that payments from European citizens to a European corporation could apparently be blocked by the United States, and called for a further reduction in the dominance of Visa and MasterCard in the European payment system.[24]
As of 2013, MasterCard is under investigation by the European Union for the high fees it charges tourists who use their cards in Europe, and other anti-competitive practices that could hinder electronic commerce and international trade, and high fees associated with premium credit cards. The EU's competition regulator said that these fees were of special concern because of the growing role of non-cash payments. MasterCard charges non-European tourists much more than customers using cards issued in Europe. MasterCard could be fined up to 10 percent of its 2012 revenue or around $740 million. MasterCard was banned from charging fees on cross-border transactions conducted wholly within the EU via a ruling by the European Commission in 2007.[25] The European Commission said that their investigation also includes large differences in fees across national borders. For instance, a 50-euro payment might cost 10 euro cents in the Netherlands but eight times that amount in Poland. The Commission argues that MasterCard rules that prohibit merchants from enjoying better terms offered in other EU countries may be against anti-trust law.
The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) praised the action against MasterCard. BEUC said interbank fees push up prices and hurt consumers. BEUC Director General Monique Goyens said, "So in the end, all consumers are hit by a scheme which ultimately rewards the card company and issuing bank." [25]
Sanctions of Russia[edit]
On December 27, 2014, Visa Inc. and MasterCard suspended servicing some Russian banks in Crimea:[26] Rossiya Bank, Sobinbank, SMP Bank and Investcapitalbank,[27] after the USA issued sanctions against the Russian government due to the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine.
Regulatory action in Australia and New Zealand[edit]
In 2003, the Reserve Bank of Australia required that interchange fees be dramatically reduced, from about 0.95% of the transaction to approximately 0.5%.[citation needed] One notable result has been the reduced use of reward cards and increased use of debit cards. Australia also prohibited the "no surcharge" rule, a policy established by credit card networks like Visa and MasterCard to prevent merchants from charging a credit card usage fee to the cardholder. A surcharge would mitigate or even exceed the merchant discount paid by a merchant, but would also make the cardholder more reluctant to use the card as the method of payment. Australia has also made changes to the interchange rates on debit cards and has considered abolishing interchange fees altogether.
As of November 2006, New Zealand was considering similar actions, following a Commerce Commission lawsuit alleging price-fixing by Visa and MasterCard. In New Zealand, merchants pay a 1.8% fee on every credit card transaction.
Blocking payments to WikiLeaks[edit]
In December 2010, MasterCard blocked all payments to WikiLeaks due to claims that they engage in illegal activity.[28] In a response, a group of online activists calling themselves "Anonymous" organised a denial-of-service attack; as a result, the MasterCard website experienced downtime on December 8–9, 2010.[29] On December 9, 2010 the servers of MasterCard underwent a massive attack[30] as part of an Operation Avenge Assange for closing down payments of whistleblowing platform WikiLeaks. According to several news sites, security of thousands of credit cards was compromised during that attack due to a phishing-site set up by the attackers.[31] However, MasterCard denied this, stating that "cardholder account data has not been placed at risk".[32] WikiLeaks spokesman said: "We neither condemn nor applaud these attacks."[33] U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay said that closing down credit lines for donations to WikiLeaks "could be interpreted as an attempt to censor the publication of information, thus potentially violating WikiLeaks' right to freedom of expression".[34]
The company that enables WikiLeaks to accept credit and debit card donations[who?] said it would take legal action against Visa Europe and MasterCard.[35] Iceland-based IT firm DataCell said it would move immediately to try to force the two companies to resume allowing payments to the website.[citation needed] DataCell had earlier[when?] said that suspension of payments towards WikiLeaks is a violation of the agreements with their customers. On July 14, 2011 DataCell announced they had filed a complaint with the European Commission claiming the closure by Visa and MasterCard of Datcell‘s access to the payment card networks violated the competition rules of the European Community.[36]
On July 12, 2012 a Reykjavík court ruled that Valitor, Visa and MasterCard's partner in Iceland, had to start processing donations within fourteen days[37] on pain of daily fines to the amount of ISK 800,000 (some $6000) for each day after that time, to open the payment gateway. Valitor also had to pay DataCell's litigation costs of ISK 1,500,000.[38][39]
Corporate branding of all Nigerian ID Cards[edit]
In 2014, pursuant to an agreement between MasterCard and the Nigerian Government, acting through the National Identity Management Commission, the new Nigerian ID cards will bear MasterCard logo, contain personal database data and double as payment cards, irrevocably linking such payments to the individuals,[40] sparking criticism by the Civil Rights Congress alleging that it "represents a stamped ownership of a Nigerian by an American company ... reminiscent of the logo pasted on the bodies of African slaves transported across the Atlantic."[41]
Prepaid debit cards[edit]
MasterCard, Comerica Bank, and the U.S. Treasury Department teamed up in 2008 to create the Direct Express Debit MasterCard prepaid debit card. The federal government uses the Express Debit product to issue electronic payments to people who do not have bank accounts, who are often referred to collectively as the "unbanked". Comerica Bank is the issuing bank for the debit card.
The Direct Express cards give recipients a number of consumer protections.
In June 2013, MasterCard announced a partnership with British Airways to offer members the Executive Club Multi-currency Cash Passport, which will allow members to earn extra points and make multi-currency payments. The Passport card allows users to load up to ten currencies (euro, pound, U.S. dollar, Turkish Lira, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, New Zealand dollar, U.A.E. dirham and South African rand) at a locked-in rate. When used, the card selects the local currency to ensure the best exchange rate, and if the local currency is not already loaded onto the card, funds are used from other currencies.[citation needed]
Advertising[edit]
MasterCard's current advertising campaign tagline is "Priceless". The slogan associated with the campaign is "There are some things money can't buy. For everything else, there's MasterCard." The Priceless campaign in more recent iterations has been applicable to both MasterCard's credit card and debit card products. They also use the Priceless description to promote products such as their "priceless travel" site which features deals and offers for MasterCard holders,[42] and "priceless cities", offers for people in specified locations.[43]
The first of these Priceless ads was run during the 1997 World Series and there are numerous different TV, radio and print ads.[44] MasterCard registered Priceless as a trademark.[45] Actor Billy Crudup has been the voice in the US market; in the UK, actor Jack Davenport is the voice. The original idea and concept of the campaign stems from the advertising agency of McCann Erickson (as it was named in 1997).[46]
The purpose of the campaign is to position MasterCard as a friendly credit card company with a sense of humor, as well as responding to the public's worry that everything is being commodified and that people are becoming too materialistic.[47]
Many parodies have been made using this same pattern, especially on Comedy Central, though MasterCard has threatened legal action,[48] contending that MasterCard views such parodies as a violation of its rights under the federal and state trademark and unfair competition laws, under the federal and state anti-dilution laws, and under the Copyright Act. Despite these claims, however, noted US consumer advocate and presidential candidate Ralph Nader emerged victorious (after a four-year battle) in the suit MasterCard brought against him after he produced his own "Priceless" political commercials.[49] In the election ads Nader had criticized the corporate financing of both the Bush and Gore campaigns. Using the theme and some of the language behind the MasterCard "Priceless" campaign the election specified the dollar amounts contributed by corporate interests to both candidates and then summed it up with "finding out the truth ... priceless". MasterCard sued Nader's campaign committee and filed a temporary restraining order to stop the ads. The TRO was not granted and Nader defended the ads by claiming they were protected under the fair use doctrine.[50]
Litigation of "Priceless" ad campaign[edit]
In 1994 Argentinian born Edgardo Apestguia created in Paraguay an ad campaign for Bancard's credit card. Its slogan was "There are things money can't buy, but, for everything else, there is Bancard".[51] Plagiarism lawsuits were filed in Paraguay and Chile against MasterCard and their publicist McCann, who registered the "priceless" slogan ads in the US in 1999 and was represented in Paraguay by Nafta and Biedermann publicists at the time.
MasterCard MarketPlace[edit]
Through a partnership with an Internet company that specializes in personalized shopping, MasterCard introduced a Web shopping mall on April 16, 2010 that it said can pinpoint with considerable accuracy what its cardholders are likely to purchase.[52]
Sports sponsorships[edit]
MasterCard engages in the sponsorship of major sporting events throughout the world. These include the New Zealand All Blacks the country's rugby team,[53] Major League Baseball, the UEFA Champions League, the PGA Tour's Arnold Palmer Invitational Presented by MasterCard,[54] the Canadian Hockey League's Memorial Cup and recently announced a new sponsorship deal with Australian Cricket team. Previously it also sponsored FIFA World Cup but withdrew its contract after a court settlement and its rival Visa took up the contract in 2007.[55] In 1997, MasterCard was the main sponsor of the MasterCard Lola Formula One team, which withdrew from the 1997 Formula One season after its first race due to financial problems.

Mastercard Contactless[edit]





PayPass RFID chip from a Mastercard






Mastercard issued by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Semi-transparency shows PayPass antenna, connecting to RFID chip.


Mastercard Contactless (formerly branded Paypass[60]) is an EMV-compatible, "contactless" payment feature similar to American Express' ExpressPay, and Visa payWave. All three use the same symbol as shown on the right. It is based on the ISO/IEC 14443 standard that provides cardholders with a simpler way to pay by tapping a payment card or other payment device, such as a phone or key fob, on a point-of-sale terminal reader rather than swiping or inserting a card. PayPass can currently be used on transactions up to and including 30 GBP, 25 EUR, 50 USD, 100 CAD, 200 NOK, 80 NZD, 100 AUD, 1000 RUB or 2000 INR.
In 2003, Mastercard concluded a nine-month PayPass market trial in Orlando, Florida with JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, and MBNA. More than 16,000 cardholders and more than 60 retailer locations participated in the market trial.[needs update] In addition, Mastercard worked with Nokia, AT&T Wireless, and JPMorgan Chase to incorporate Mastercard PayPass into mobile phones using near-field communication technology, in Dallas, Texas. In 2011, Google and Mastercard launched Google Wallet, an Android application which allows a mobile device to send credit/debit card information directly to a Paypass-enabled payment terminal, bypassing the need for a physical card, up until the creation of Android Pay.
During late 2015, Citicards in the USA stopped issuing Paypass-enabled plastic, but the keyfob was still available upon request. Effective July 16, 2016, Citicards will stop supporting Paypass completely. While existing plastic and keyfobs will continue to work until their expiration date, no new Paypass-enabled hardware will be issued to US customers after that date.
QkR[edit]
QkR is a mobile payment app developed by MasterCard, for the purpose of ordering products and services through a smartphone with payments charged to the associated credit card. It is being deployed for use in large scale events, such as sport events, concerts, or movie theaters. Unlike other MasterCard mobile payment apps such as Pay Pass, QkR does not use NFC from the phone, but rather an Internet connection.
Users can open the app, scan a QR code located on the back of the seat in front of them, and place orders for refreshments of their choice.[61][62] The order is dispatched to a nearby concession stand, from where a runner delivers the items to the patrons' seats. It is already deployed in Australian movie theaters and is being tested in Yankee Stadium.
QkR is being marketed to vendors as a replacement for other mobile payment apps and a mobile ordering app, either distributed by the vendor (such as Starbucks's app, McDonald's' app, or Chipotle's mobile ordering app) or by a third party, such as Square, headed by Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey.
Banknet[edit]
MasterCard operates Banknet, a global telecommunications network linking all MasterCard card issuers, acquirers, and data processing centers into a single financial network. The operations hub is located in St. Louis, Missouri. Banknet uses the ISO 8583 protocol.
MasterCard's network differs significantly from Visa's. Visa's is a star-based system where all endpoints terminate at one of several main data centers, where all transactions are processed centrally. MasterCard's network is an edge-based, peer-to-peer network where transactions travel a meshed network directly to other endpoints, without the need to travel to a single point. This allows MasterCard's network to be much more resilient, in that a single failure cannot isolate a large number of endpoints.[63]

Mastercard Incorporated or Mastercard Worldwide is an American multinational financial services corporation headquartered in the MasterCard International Global Headquarters, Purchase, New York, United States,[1] in Westchester County. The Global Operations Headquarters is located in O'Fallon, Missouri, United States, a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri. Throughout the world, its principal business is to process payments between the banks of merchants and the card issuing banks or credit unions of the purchasers who use the "Mastercard" brand debit and credit cards to make purchases. Mastercard Worldwide has been a publicly traded company since 2006. Prior to its initial public offering, MasterCard Worldwide was a cooperative owned by the more than 25,000 financial institutions that issue its branded cards.
Mastercard, originally known as Interbank/Master Charge,[2] was created by several California banks as a competitor to the BankAmericard issued by Bank of America, which later became the Visa credit card issued by Visa Inc. From 1966 to 1979, Mastercard was called "Interbank" and "Master Charge".

The original banks behind MasterCard were United California Bank (later First Interstate Bank and subsequently merged into Wells Fargo Bank), Wells Fargo, Crocker National Bank (also subsequently merged into Wells Fargo), and the Bank of California (subsequently merged into the Union Bank of California).
In 1966, the aforementioned group of California banks formed the Interbank Card Association (ICA). With the help of New York's Marine Midland Bank (now HSBC Bank USA), these banks joined with the ICA to create "Master Charge: The Interbank Card". The card was given a significant boost in 1969, when First National City Bank joined, merging its proprietary Everything Card with Master Charge.
In 1968, the ICA and Eurocard started a strategic alliance, which effectively allowed the ICA access to the European market, and for Eurocard to be accepted on the ICA network. The Access card system from the United Kingdom joined the ICA/Eurocard alliance in 1972.
In 1979, "Master Charge: The Interbank Card" was renamed "MasterCard". In 1997, Mastercard took over the Access card; the Access brand was then retired.
In 2002, MasterCard International merged with Europay International, another large credit-card issuer association, of which Eurocard had become a part in 1992.
In mid-2006, MasterCard International changed its name to MasterCard Worldwide. This was done in order to suggest a more global scale of operations. In addition, the company introduced a new corporate logo adding a third circle to the two that had been used in the past (the familiar card logo, resembling a Venn diagram, remained unchanged). A new corporate tagline was introduced at the same time: "The Heart of Commerce".[3]
In August 2010, MasterCard expanded its e-commerce offering with the acquisition of DataCash, a UK-based payment processing and fraud/risk management provider.[4][5]
In March 2012, MasterCard announced the expansion of its mobile contactless payments program, including markets across the Middle East.[6]
In spring 2014, MasterCard acquired Australia's leading rewards program manager company Pinpoint for an undisclosed amount.[7]
MasterCard teamed with Apple in September 2014, to incorporate a new mobile wallet feature into Apple's new iPhone models, enabling users to more readily use their MasterCard, and other credit cards.[8]
IPO[edit]
The company, which had been organized as a cooperative of banks, had an initial public offering on May 25, 2006, selling 61.5 million shares at $39 each.[9] The stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol MA, with a market capitalization of $105.15 billion as of August 2016.[10]
Litigation[edit]
Anti-trust lawsuit by ATM operators[edit]
MasterCard, along with Visa, has been sued in a class action by ATM operators that claims the credit card networks' rules effectively fix ATM access fees. The suit claims that this is a restraint on trade in violation of federal law. The lawsuit was filed by the National ATM Council and independent operators of automated teller machines. More specifically, it is alleged that MasterCard's and Visa's network rules prohibit ATM operators from offering lower prices for transactions over PIN-debit networks that are not affiliated with Visa or MasterCard. The suit says that this price fixing artificially raises the price that consumers pay using ATMs, limits the revenue that ATM-operators earn, and violates the Sherman Act's prohibition against unreasonable restraints of trade. Johnathan Rubin, an attorney for the plaintiffs said, "Visa and MasterCard are the ringleaders, organizers, and enforcers of a conspiracy among U.S. banks to fix the price of ATM access fees in order to keep the competition at bay." [11]
Debit card swipe fee price fixing[edit]
Both MasterCard and Visa have paid approximately $3 billion in damages resulting from a class-action lawsuit filed by Hagens Berman in January 1996.[12] The litigation cites several retail giants as plaintiffs, including Wal-Mart, Sears, Roebuck & Co., and Safeway.[13]
Antitrust settlement with U.S. Justice Department[edit]
In October 2010, MasterCard and Visa reached a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department in another antitrust case. The companies agreed to allow merchants displaying their logos to decline certain types of cards (because interchange fees differ), or to offer consumers discounts for using cheaper cards.[14]
Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation[edit]
Main article: Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation
On November 27, 2012, a federal judge entered an order granting preliminary approval to a proposed settlement to a class-action lawsuit filed in 2005 by merchants and trade associations against MasterCard, Visa, and many credit card issuers. The suit was filed due to price fixing and other anti-competitive trade practices employed by MasterCard and Visa. A majority of named class plaintiffs have objected and vowed to opt out of the settlement. Opponents object to provisions that would bar future lawsuits and even prevent merchants from opting out of significant portions of the proposed settlement. Stephen Neuwirth, a lawyer representing Home Depot, said, "It’s so obvious Visa and MasterCard were prepared to make a large payment because of the scope of the releases being given. It’s all one quid pro quo and merchants like the Home Depot are being denied the chance to opt out of that quid pro quo and say this is a bad deal." [15]
Plaintiffs allege that Visa, MasterCard, and major credit card issuers engaged in a conspiracy to fix interchange fees, also known as swipe fees, that are charged to merchants for the privilege of accepting payment cards at artificially high levels. In their complaint, the plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants unfairly interfere with merchants from encouraging customers to use less expensive forms of payment such as lower-cost cards, cash, and checks.[15]
The settlement provides for the cash equivalent of a 10 basis-point reduction (0.1 percent) of swipe fees charged to merchants for a period of eight months. This eight-month period would probably begin in the middle of 2013. The total value of the settlement will be about $7.25 billion.[15]
Criticism[edit]
Anti-trust issues in the United States[edit]
Few companies have faced more antitrust lawsuits both in the US and abroad.[16]
MasterCard, along with Visa, engaged in systematic parallel exclusion against American Express during the 1980s and 1990s. MasterCard used exclusivity clauses in its contracts and blacklists to prevent banks from doing business with American Express. Such exclusionary clauses and other written evidence were used by the United States Department of Justice in regulatory actions against MasterCard and Visa.[17] Discover has sued MasterCard for similar issues.[16]
In 1996 about 4 million merchants sued MasterCard in federal court for making them accept debit cards if they wanted to accept credit cards and dramatically increasing credit card swipe fees. This case was settled with a multibillion-dollar payment in 2003. This was the largest anti-trust award in history.[16]
In 1998, the Department of Justice sued MasterCard over rules prohibiting their issuing banks from doing business with American Express or Discover. The Department of Justice won in 2001 and the verdict withstood appeal. American Express also filed suit[16]
On August 23, 2001, MasterCard International Inc. was sued for violating the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.[18]
On November 15, 2004, MasterCard Inc. paid damages to American Express, due to anticompetitive practices that prevented American Express from issuing cards through U.S. banks,[19] and paid 1.8 billion dollars for settlement.[20]
Anti-trust investigations in Europe[edit]
The European Union has repeatedly criticised MasterCard for monopolistic trade practices. In April 2009, MasterCard reached a settlement with the European Union in an antitrust case, promising to reduce debit card swipe fees to 0.2 percent of purchases.[21] In December 2010, a senior official from the European Central Bank called for a break-up of the Visa/MasterCard duopoly by creation of a new European debit card for use in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).[22]
WikiLeaks published documents showing that American authorities lobbied Russia to defend the interests of Visa and MasterCard.[23] In response MasterCard blocked payments to WikiLeaks. Members of the European Parliament expressed concern that payments from European citizens to a European corporation could apparently be blocked by the United States, and called for a further reduction in the dominance of Visa and MasterCard in the European payment system.[24]
As of 2013, MasterCard is under investigation by the European Union for the high fees it charges tourists who use their cards in Europe, and other anti-competitive practices that could hinder electronic commerce and international trade, and high fees associated with premium credit cards. The EU's competition regulator said that these fees were of special concern because of the growing role of non-cash payments. MasterCard charges non-European tourists much more than customers using cards issued in Europe. MasterCard could be fined up to 10 percent of its 2012 revenue or around $740 million. MasterCard was banned from charging fees on cross-border transactions conducted wholly within the EU via a ruling by the European Commission in 2007.[25] The European Commission said that their investigation also includes large differences in fees across national borders. For instance, a 50-euro payment might cost 10 euro cents in the Netherlands but eight times that amount in Poland. The Commission argues that MasterCard rules that prohibit merchants from enjoying better terms offered in other EU countries may be against anti-trust law.
The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) praised the action against MasterCard. BEUC said interbank fees push up prices and hurt consumers. BEUC Director General Monique Goyens said, "So in the end, all consumers are hit by a scheme which ultimately rewards the card company and issuing bank." [25]
Sanctions of Russia[edit]
On December 27, 2014, Visa Inc. and MasterCard suspended servicing some Russian banks in Crimea:[26] Rossiya Bank, Sobinbank, SMP Bank and Investcapitalbank,[27] after the USA issued sanctions against the Russian government due to the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine.
Regulatory action in Australia and New Zealand[edit]
In 2003, the Reserve Bank of Australia required that interchange fees be dramatically reduced, from about 0.95% of the transaction to approximately 0.5%.[citation needed] One notable result has been the reduced use of reward cards and increased use of debit cards. Australia also prohibited the "no surcharge" rule, a policy established by credit card networks like Visa and MasterCard to prevent merchants from charging a credit card usage fee to the cardholder. A surcharge would mitigate or even exceed the merchant discount paid by a merchant, but would also make the cardholder more reluctant to use the card as the method of payment. Australia has also made changes to the interchange rates on debit cards and has considered abolishing interchange fees altogether.
As of November 2006, New Zealand was considering similar actions, following a Commerce Commission lawsuit alleging price-fixing by Visa and MasterCard. In New Zealand, merchants pay a 1.8% fee on every credit card transaction.
Blocking payments to WikiLeaks[edit]
In December 2010, MasterCard blocked all payments to WikiLeaks due to claims that they engage in illegal activity.[28] In a response, a group of online activists calling themselves "Anonymous" organised a denial-of-service attack; as a result, the MasterCard website experienced downtime on December 8–9, 2010.[29] On December 9, 2010 the servers of MasterCard underwent a massive attack[30] as part of an Operation Avenge Assange for closing down payments of whistleblowing platform WikiLeaks. According to several news sites, security of thousands of credit cards was compromised during that attack due to a phishing-site set up by the attackers.[31] However, MasterCard denied this, stating that "cardholder account data has not been placed at risk".[32] WikiLeaks spokesman said: "We neither condemn nor applaud these attacks."[33] U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay said that closing down credit lines for donations to WikiLeaks "could be interpreted as an attempt to censor the publication of information, thus potentially violating WikiLeaks' right to freedom of expression".[34]
The company that enables WikiLeaks to accept credit and debit card donations[who?] said it would take legal action against Visa Europe and MasterCard.[35] Iceland-based IT firm DataCell said it would move immediately to try to force the two companies to resume allowing payments to the website.[citation needed] DataCell had earlier[when?] said that suspension of payments towards WikiLeaks is a violation of the agreements with their customers. On July 14, 2011 DataCell announced they had filed a complaint with the European Commission claiming the closure by Visa and MasterCard of Datcell‘s access to the payment card networks violated the competition rules of the European Community.[36]
On July 12, 2012 a Reykjavík court ruled that Valitor, Visa and MasterCard's partner in Iceland, had to start processing donations within fourteen days[37] on pain of daily fines to the amount of ISK 800,000 (some $6000) for each day after that time, to open the payment gateway. Valitor also had to pay DataCell's litigation costs of ISK 1,500,000.[38][39]
Corporate branding of all Nigerian ID Cards[edit]
In 2014, pursuant to an agreement between MasterCard and the Nigerian Government, acting through the National Identity Management Commission, the new Nigerian ID cards will bear MasterCard logo, contain personal database data and double as payment cards, irrevocably linking such payments to the individuals,[40] sparking criticism by the Civil Rights Congress alleging that it "represents a stamped ownership of a Nigerian by an American company ... reminiscent of the logo pasted on the bodies of African slaves transported across the Atlantic."[41]
Prepaid debit cards[edit]
MasterCard, Comerica Bank, and the U.S. Treasury Department teamed up in 2008 to create the Direct Express Debit MasterCard prepaid debit card. The federal government uses the Express Debit product to issue electronic payments to people who do not have bank accounts, who are often referred to collectively as the "unbanked". Comerica Bank is the issuing bank for the debit card.
The Direct Express cards give recipients a number of consumer protections.
In June 2013, MasterCard announced a partnership with British Airways to offer members the Executive Club Multi-currency Cash Passport, which will allow members to earn extra points and make multi-currency payments. The Passport card allows users to load up to ten currencies (euro, pound, U.S. dollar, Turkish Lira, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, New Zealand dollar, U.A.E. dirham and South African rand) at a locked-in rate. When used, the card selects the local currency to ensure the best exchange rate, and if the local currency is not already loaded onto the card, funds are used from other currencies.[citation needed]
Advertising[edit]
MasterCard's current advertising campaign tagline is "Priceless". The slogan associated with the campaign is "There are some things money can't buy. For everything else, there's MasterCard." The Priceless campaign in more recent iterations has been applicable to both MasterCard's credit card and debit card products. They also use the Priceless description to promote products such as their "priceless travel" site which features deals and offers for MasterCard holders,[42] and "priceless cities", offers for people in specified locations.[43]
The first of these Priceless ads was run during the 1997 World Series and there are numerous different TV, radio and print ads.[44] MasterCard registered Priceless as a trademark.[45] Actor Billy Crudup has been the voice in the US market; in the UK, actor Jack Davenport is the voice. The original idea and concept of the campaign stems from the advertising agency of McCann Erickson (as it was named in 1997).[46]
The purpose of the campaign is to position MasterCard as a friendly credit card company with a sense of humor, as well as responding to the public's worry that everything is being commodified and that people are becoming too materialistic.[47]
Many parodies have been made using this same pattern, especially on Comedy Central, though MasterCard has threatened legal action,[48] contending that MasterCard views such parodies as a violation of its rights under the federal and state trademark and unfair competition laws, under the federal and state anti-dilution laws, and under the Copyright Act. Despite these claims, however, noted US consumer advocate and presidential candidate Ralph Nader emerged victorious (after a four-year battle) in the suit MasterCard brought against him after he produced his own "Priceless" political commercials.[49] In the election ads Nader had criticized the corporate financing of both the Bush and Gore campaigns. Using the theme and some of the language behind the MasterCard "Priceless" campaign the election specified the dollar amounts contributed by corporate interests to both candidates and then summed it up with "finding out the truth ... priceless". MasterCard sued Nader's campaign committee and filed a temporary restraining order to stop the ads. The TRO was not granted and Nader defended the ads by claiming they were protected under the fair use doctrine.[50]
Litigation of "Priceless" ad campaign[edit]
In 1994 Argentinian born Edgardo Apestguia created in Paraguay an ad campaign for Bancard's credit card. Its slogan was "There are things money can't buy, but, for everything else, there is Bancard".[51] Plagiarism lawsuits were filed in Paraguay and Chile against MasterCard and their publicist McCann, who registered the "priceless" slogan ads in the US in 1999 and was represented in Paraguay by Nafta and Biedermann publicists at the time.
MasterCard MarketPlace[edit]
Through a partnership with an Internet company that specializes in personalized shopping, MasterCard introduced a Web shopping mall on April 16, 2010 that it said can pinpoint with considerable accuracy what its cardholders are likely to purchase.[52]
Sports sponsorships[edit]
MasterCard engages in the sponsorship of major sporting events throughout the world. These include the New Zealand All Blacks the country's rugby team,[53] Major League Baseball, the UEFA Champions League, the PGA Tour's Arnold Palmer Invitational Presented by MasterCard,[54] the Canadian Hockey League's Memorial Cup and recently announced a new sponsorship deal with Australian Cricket team. Previously it also sponsored FIFA World Cup but withdrew its contract after a court settlement and its rival Visa took up the contract in 2007.[55] In 1997, MasterCard was the main sponsor of the MasterCard Lola Formula One team, which withdrew from the 1997 Formula One season after its first race due to financial problems.

Mastercard Contactless[edit]





PayPass RFID chip from a Mastercard






Mastercard issued by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Semi-transparency shows PayPass antenna, connecting to RFID chip.


Mastercard Contactless (formerly branded Paypass[60]) is an EMV-compatible, "contactless" payment feature similar to American Express' ExpressPay, and Visa payWave. All three use the same symbol as shown on the right. It is based on the ISO/IEC 14443 standard that provides cardholders with a simpler way to pay by tapping a payment card or other payment device, such as a phone or key fob, on a point-of-sale terminal reader rather than swiping or inserting a card. PayPass can currently be used on transactions up to and including 30 GBP, 25 EUR, 50 USD, 100 CAD, 200 NOK, 80 NZD, 100 AUD, 1000 RUB or 2000 INR.
In 2003, Mastercard concluded a nine-month PayPass market trial in Orlando, Florida with JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, and MBNA. More than 16,000 cardholders and more than 60 retailer locations participated in the market trial.[needs update] In addition, Mastercard worked with Nokia, AT&T Wireless, and JPMorgan Chase to incorporate Mastercard PayPass into mobile phones using near-field communication technology, in Dallas, Texas. In 2011, Google and Mastercard launched Google Wallet, an Android application which allows a mobile device to send credit/debit card information directly to a Paypass-enabled payment terminal, bypassing the need for a physical card, up until the creation of Android Pay.
During late 2015, Citicards in the USA stopped issuing Paypass-enabled plastic, but the keyfob was still available upon request. Effective July 16, 2016, Citicards will stop supporting Paypass completely. While existing plastic and keyfobs will continue to work until their expiration date, no new Paypass-enabled hardware will be issued to US customers after that date.
QkR[edit]
QkR is a mobile payment app developed by MasterCard, for the purpose of ordering products and services through a smartphone with payments charged to the associated credit card. It is being deployed for use in large scale events, such as sport events, concerts, or movie theaters. Unlike other MasterCard mobile payment apps such as Pay Pass, QkR does not use NFC from the phone, but rather an Internet connection.
Users can open the app, scan a QR code located on the back of the seat in front of them, and place orders for refreshments of their choice.[61][62] The order is dispatched to a nearby concession stand, from where a runner delivers the items to the patrons' seats. It is already deployed in Australian movie theaters and is being tested in Yankee Stadium.
QkR is being marketed to vendors as a replacement for other mobile payment apps and a mobile ordering app, either distributed by the vendor (such as Starbucks's app, McDonald's' app, or Chipotle's mobile ordering app) or by a third party, such as Square, headed by Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey.
Banknet[edit]
MasterCard operates Banknet, a global telecommunications network linking all MasterCard card issuers, acquirers, and data processing centers into a single financial network. The operations hub is located in St. Louis, Missouri. Banknet uses the ISO 8583 protocol.
MasterCard's network differs significantly from Visa's. Visa's is a star-based system where all endpoints terminate at one of several main data centers, where all transactions are processed centrally. MasterCard's network is an edge-based, peer-to-peer network where transactions travel a meshed network directly to other endpoints, without the need to travel to a single point. This allows MasterCard's network to be much more resilient, in that a single failure cannot isolate a large number of endpoints.[63]

What Could Visa Inc's New Product Mean To the Payments Industry?
Visa has launched a new product designed to make paying for purchases online as easy as swiping a card in the store. What will this mean to Visa and its rivals?











                Matthew Frankel
            

                (TMFMathGuy)



            
            Jul 20, 2014 at 10:00AM
            
            





Visa (NYSE:V) and its rivals realize that while online shopping can be much more convenient that driving to a store, no one has quite figured out a way to make paying by credit card online or in a mobile app as easy as swiping your card at a point-of-sale terminal.
It's a pain to have to take your credit card out of your wallet and type in the numbers, especially in mobile apps, not to mention the feeling of vulnerability that comes with typing your card number, expiration date, and security code.

Hoping to change that, Visa has introduced a new product called Visa Checkout, which is intended to be a digital representation of your Visa card.
The idea is that a seamless, quick and painless payment experience will make more customers choose to use Visa-branded cards when shopping. 
How will it compete with a similar product from rival MasterCard (NYSE:MA), and will American Express (NYSE:AXP) come up with something similar? And what company has the most to lose here?





The idea behind Visa Checkout Essentially, Visa's checkout is the most comprehensive way yet for customers to pay with a credit card in one single step.

Source: company
Customers create an account with Visa and store the information from their cards, as well as shipping information, so they literally will have to enter no personal information when shopping.
Then, when shopping on a participating merchant's website or app with the Visa Checkout button (above), all that is needed is a username and password, and Visa Checkout does the rest.





And security is a big priority for Visa.
When you check out, a thumbnail of your own Visa card shows up next to the checkout button for authentication. Visa's senior VP of digital solutions Sam Shrauger said the company will work hard to provide the best security possible to Visa Checkout users.
MasterCard and Amex's efforts Visa might be a little late to the party here.
 MasterCard recently launched its MasterPass product which is now up and running in 10 countries, and provides similar functions as Visa Checkout. In fact, MasterPass also seems more useful in some ways, as it is a "full digital wallet" while Visa Checkout is simply a digital representation of your credit card.





In addition to your credit card and shipping information, MasterPass also lets you store loyalty and rewards cards. And, it is worth noting, both companies' products work with any major credit cards, not just their own.
American Express has not come up with its own digital checkout service, but is definitely heading in that direction.
The company's recent partnership with car service Uber lets users pay for rides in Uber's mobile app with their American Express rewards points. So, it appears that American Express is experimenting with one-click payment solutions, but is yet to unveil anything like Visa and MasterCard's products.
What could it mean to the winners and losers? Obviously, this could mean a lot to Visa and MasterCard by capturing market share from rival card issuers and other payment processors.
While both Visa Checkout and MasterPass allow any credit cards to be linked, most of the users will likely register Visa and MasterCard credit cards with their corresponding products.
One the other hand, one company that stands to lose a lot from this is eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) PayPal, which until recently was the only widespread way to pay for online purchases by simply entering a username and password.
In fact, I think the biggest impact here will be a significant and gradual loss of fee revenue to PayPal, as the credit card companies have figured out how to offer a similar way to pay.
However, eBay has managed to stay ahead of the curve so far in the payment processing game, so it'll be interesting to see how PayPal responds to the increased competition.
In regards to whose product will be more successful, it's anyone's guess at this point. However, both Visa and MasterCard will be long-term winners here as more and more consumers adopt their payment solutions.

Mastercard welcomes UK court ruling to block $18 billion class action suit
Mastercard Inc.  on Friday welcomed a decision by a U.K. court to block a 14 billion pound ($18 billion) class action suit against the company that alleged it had overcharged more than 45 million Britons over a 16-year stretch. The Competition Appeal Tribunal sided with the card issuer, which argued that the claims were unsuitable to be brought under a collective actions regime. "We welcome the Competition Appeal Tribunal's judgment refusing certification for the proposed collective action," the company said in a statement. The suit was brought by law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP, and centered on interchange fees, which are charged to the banks of merchants that accept MasterCard debit and credit cards. The firm alleged that Mastercard had set fees at too high a level. Mastercard shares were up 0.6% and have gained 25% in 2017, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has gained 9%.

I'm wanting a card that will give me cash back or points(not sure how it works) mainly for airplane tickets, (I like Southwest Airlines the best)I want to be able to use the card on any purchase. I have great credit. We are wanting to eventually pay for all the tickets for my family to go on vacation. Which would be the best card?

The are a number of travel rewards credit cards that might be a good fit for you. The Chase Sapphire Preferred is one great option because you can transfer the points you earn with this card directly to your Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards account. A few other good choices for flexible travel rewards would be the Discover It Miles, Capital One Venture or BankAmericard Travel Rewards.

Which card is best for my daughter who wants to earn free airfare from NC to maui, and possibly asia.  We need to be able to earn this airfare quickly, as her trip is this september.  I have excellent credit, and I want to earn the most miles possible (even if we have to spend some money on the card).  As long as it's free the first year, it's fine.

The Capital One Venture and the Barclaycard Arrival Plus would both be great options for your situation. Both of these cards come with big sign up bonuses and offer flexible travel rewards!

One great choice for your situation would be the Discover It Cashback Match. This card comes with an extra long intro APR that would help you finance your home remodel interest free and there is also an excellent cash back rewards program so you can earn rewards on all of your purchases.

I'm retired but with a secure income and top rated credit.  I also pay off my balance every month.  What's the best cash back card for someone who spends about $1400 a month?

Picking the best cash back card for you will depend on how you spend your money. For example, if you spend a lot on groceries and gas, the Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express and BankAmericard Cash Rewards would both be excellent options as they offer bonus cash back on certain purchases. But if you would prefer and credit cards with a consistently high rewards rate on all purchases, the Citi Double Cash would be a great choice.

If you have no credit, you will probably need to start with a secured credit card. Secured cards work just like normal credit cards, but you have to put down a refundable security deposit to get approved. After a year or so of responsible use, you will have built up your credit enough to get approved to a standard, unsecured credit card. The Capital One Secured MasterCard and the Discover it Secured Credit Card are both great options.

Hello,
Right now I have a $5,000 dollar balance on a card with a 20.65% APR. and an annual fee that is billed monthly $3. I have a 732 Credit score and want to look in to a balance transfer to a card with a lower APR so I can get a more manageable credit card debt. Which card would you recommend?

The Chase slate card doesn't have the frills or points, but it is an excellent balance transfer card.

Must have extensive dental work. I am looking for a new card just for this. I would like no interest for max. months. Would the dental work be considered a purchase? The dentist doesn't offer terms. I have excellent credit-mid 800's. Cash back would be great, but not necessary.

If the merchant will allow you to pay with a credit card then the transaction should be considered a purchase. If you're looking for the longest possible intro APR, consider the Citi Simplicity or the Citi Diamond Preferred. These cards don't offer cash back, so if you'd like cash back plus a long intro period check out the Discover It Cashback Match.

Deciding which rewards card is best may vary based on how you usually spend your money. For example, if you spend a lot on groceries and gas, the Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express  is probably your best choice. But if you're simply looking for a credit card with a great flat rewards rate on every purchase, the Citi Double Cash is an excellent option.

I have the Citi 1% plus 1% card.  As I pay off my credit card each month I basically have a zero fee card that returns 2% on everything.  Can anyone beat that?

Unfortunately there is no way to know for certain what your credit limit will be before you apply for a credit card. Credit Card issuers base the amount you are give as a credit line on the information in your application as well as your overall credit history, so there is know way they could indicate a credit limit before you submit your application.

Discover is the best card, looks after what is charged as soon as it's charged than notifies you. You catch it right away, I have had Discover for 20 years it seems. only one I use







By: Dave Frey | Jul 17, 2017
The Capital One Venture card has immediate alerts on all purchases, I usually get the alert before the cashier gives me my receipt. The rewards are simple to redeem and they are very generous with them.

	0% Credit Cards & Interest Free Credit Cards

	Low interest rate (or 0%) credit cards can save you hundreds of dollars on balance transfers and on routine purchases carried over as credit card balances. Or you may simply want to be rewarded with a preferential interest rate as acknowledgement for good credit history and responsible debt management. Whatever your goals or motivation, zero percent or low interest credit cards can help you maintain the lowest rates available to individuals with excellent to good credit. You can find out more about credit score here.

	Keep in mind that there are two main categories of low rate credit cards, namely those that offer a Variable APR and those that give you a Fixed APR.  Just like with variable versus fixed rate mortgages, a fixed rate APR will remain relatively stable through the course of the loan. If your card company decides to raise it – which is somewhat rare – they will first notify you of that change according to Federal law requirements. With a variable rate, your APR is tied to a prevailing rate such as the Prime Interest Rate. If the prime rate increases then your APR will most likely follow in a similar fashion.

	Generally speaking, credit card companies and banks will extend either 6 or 21 month offers – within the 0% to 3.99% annual interest rate range. That can generate a considerable discount when normal APRs are averaging around 15% or higher. Once the introductory promotional period expires, the APR on a low interest credit card or interest free credit card may revert to the regular interest rate. Of course the ideal balance is a credit card that offers a great near term rate followed by an attractive, competitively priced low interest rate for the long term.

	The interest rate charged on your credit card is widely regarded as the single most important component of your card. That’s because it determines the major cost for you to borrow or roll over balances and pay them off over time instead of all at once or within the same month that you make purchases. That’s why getting a zero percent or low interest credit card can be huge financial boon, no matter what your credit card usage patterns or money management strategies may be.

I'm wanting a card that will give me cash back or points(not sure how it works) mainly for airplane tickets, (I like Southwest Airlines the best)I want to be able to use the card on any purchase. I have great credit. We are wanting to eventually pay for all the tickets for my family to go on vacation. Which would be the best card?

The are a number of travel rewards credit cards that might be a good fit for you. The Chase Sapphire Preferred is one great option because you can transfer the points you earn with this card directly to your Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards account. A few other good choices for flexible travel rewards would be the Discover It Miles, Capital One Venture or BankAmericard Travel Rewards.

Which card is best for my daughter who wants to earn free airfare from NC to maui, and possibly asia.  We need to be able to earn this airfare quickly, as her trip is this september.  I have excellent credit, and I want to earn the most miles possible (even if we have to spend some money on the card).  As long as it's free the first year, it's fine.

The Capital One Venture and the Barclaycard Arrival Plus would both be great options for your situation. Both of these cards come with big sign up bonuses and offer flexible travel rewards!

One great choice for your situation would be the Discover It Cashback Match. This card comes with an extra long intro APR that would help you finance your home remodel interest free and there is also an excellent cash back rewards program so you can earn rewards on all of your purchases.

I'm retired but with a secure income and top rated credit.  I also pay off my balance every month.  What's the best cash back card for someone who spends about $1400 a month?

Picking the best cash back card for you will depend on how you spend your money. For example, if you spend a lot on groceries and gas, the Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express and BankAmericard Cash Rewards would both be excellent options as they offer bonus cash back on certain purchases. But if you would prefer and credit cards with a consistently high rewards rate on all purchases, the Citi Double Cash would be a great choice.

If you have no credit, you will probably need to start with a secured credit card. Secured cards work just like normal credit cards, but you have to put down a refundable security deposit to get approved. After a year or so of responsible use, you will have built up your credit enough to get approved to a standard, unsecured credit card. The Capital One Secured MasterCard and the Discover it Secured Credit Card are both great options.

Hello,
Right now I have a $5,000 dollar balance on a card with a 20.65% APR. and an annual fee that is billed monthly $3. I have a 732 Credit score and want to look in to a balance transfer to a card with a lower APR so I can get a more manageable credit card debt. Which card would you recommend?

There are a number of great balance transfer offers that may be a good option for you. Check out our balance transfer credit cards page to see all the best options! There are cards with no intro balance transfer fee and others with 0% intro APR for up to 21 months!







By: Laura Hoffman | Jun 21, 2017
The Chase slate card doesn't have the frills or points, but it is an excellent balance transfer card.

Must have extensive dental work. I am looking for a new card just for this. I would like no interest for max. months. Would the dental work be considered a purchase? The dentist doesn't offer terms. I have excellent credit-mid 800's. Cash back would be great, but not necessary.

If the merchant will allow you to pay with a credit card then the transaction should be considered a purchase. If you're looking for the longest possible intro APR, consider the Citi Simplicity or the Citi Diamond Preferred. These cards don't offer cash back, so if you'd like cash back plus a long intro period check out the Discover It Cashback Match.

Deciding which rewards card is best may vary based on how you usually spend your money. For example, if you spend a lot on groceries and gas, the Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express  is probably your best choice. But if you're simply looking for a credit card with a great flat rewards rate on every purchase, the Citi Double Cash is an excellent option.

We applied for the Chase Sapphire Preferred card last year and it has become the best credit card that I have ever owned. Customer service is first class and you speak to a person when you call. I redeemed miles for a trip recently and though I could not get the exact departure date, the day earlier worked fine. When I try to book with another card on American, I can never get the dates that I want or I have to use extra miles. It became so frustrating and now I can say, I have found THE CARD that works for us.

I am planning a trip to South Africa next year and would be paying monthly bills with the CC to earn mileage credits. Which card would you suggest?  Does paying monthly bills/expenses count as purchases?

If you're interested in travel rewards, the Discover It Miles or the Chase Sapphire Preferred are both excellent options as the offer generous rewards rates and flexible redemption options.

The Chase Sapphire Preferred is one of the most popular travel rewards cards on the market, and for good reason! This card comes with one of the best sign up bonuses available and the point you earn can be redeemed in a number of ways to make sure you always get great bang for your buck.

I am most interested in international travel and am searching for a CC I can use as a business credit card (law practice) with the most airline travel benefit for my preferred locations. Have been considering Chase Ink Preferred. Any helpful thoughts?

The Ink Business Preferred Credit Card is certainly one of the best options for a business credit card with travel rewards. It offers one of the best sign up bonuses available and a very flexible travel rewards program. Another card to consider is the Capital One Spark Miles for Business.

Do you earn miles or travel rewards on any card for a balance transfer or only on new purchases?

Credit cards generally only offer rewards on net purchases (purchases minus returns). Transactions like balance transfers or cash advances will not earn rewards.

The Capital One Venture is an excellent credit card if you're looking for the most flexibile travel rewards. You earn double miles with every purchase and miles can be redeemed at any airline or hotel with no blackout dates!

The The Platinum Card from American Express offers complimentary access to their luxurious Centurian Lounges whenever you have a flight that same day. Another great option is the Citi Prestige which offers complimentary Priority Pass  membership as long as you carry the card!

	Choose the best travel credit card

	Those who travel by air – plus anyone who would like to be able to fly by getting free or discounted airfares by using their credit cards – are perfect candidates for airline credit cards. These are essentially awards or reward credit cards that let the cardholder rack up airline miles, points, or similar value which can then be converted into a free ticket to fly to a favorite destination.

	The best airline credit cards will often provide special features and amenities in addition to the free miles that are especially tailored to the needs and preferences of air travelers. Other travel rewards include free tickets for a fellow passenger, preferential rates on hotels and rental cars, double rewards points for dining, entertaining, and coupons that provide access to airline VIP lounges inside airports.

	Most airline credit cards have interest rates comparable to other credit cards, but many charge an annual fee that might range anywhere from $49-$125. You should examine the pros and cons of each card, comparing their benefits and features against their fees to calculate which one is the best fit and offers the most flexibility at the best price. Be sure to keep in mind that while some of these cards let you transfer your points or accumulated rewards to any airline, others restrict you to one or two specific air carriers. Your free miles might have a "catch" to them. Choose a flexible card that lets you apply your awards to any air carrier or one that will help you earn airline miles and perks on the flight that you use most of the time for personal travel or for business rewards.

4 Tips for Choosing the Best Credit Card

 

																									By: Alexandra Leslie


								Finance Contributor							





 
CardRates.com Guide: Best Credit Cards

With so many hundreds of credit cards available on the market, it may be hard to decide which piece of plastic is right for your wallet. Use these tips to help you choose the best credit card for your needs.





1.
Determine your goals



It’s important to understand why you want a credit card. Do you want to score free flights? Are you interested in earning cash back? Are you looking more for a safety net when cash is low? Or perhaps you want to consolidate high-interest debt from other cards?
Depending on your goals, and particularly whether you plan to carry a balance or not, your needs will be very different. Rewards cards have higher interest than non-rewards cards, making them less ideal for carrying balances, and they often have an annual fee.
If you are only interested in transferring a balance or plan to carry a large balance, you may be better off applying for a non-rewards card with no annual fee.





2.
Want rewards? Decide what kind



If you’ve decided to go with a rewards card, you have several options. There are cash back credit cards, where you earn a percentage of your spending back in cash. There are points cards, where you earn points based on the dollar amount you spent. These can usually be redeemed for cash back, gift cards, travel, merchandise, events and more. Then there are travel cards, where your rewards are free flights or hotel stays.
Get the type of card that will benefit you most. If you aren’t a frequent traveler, don’t go for a travel card just because there is a large bonus offer for applying.





3.
Consider introductory offers



Do you need to transfer a balance from a high-interest credit card to a low-interest card? Look for a credit card with an introductory APR offer of 0%. Thanks to the Credit CARD Act of 2009, these introductory offers must be at least six months long, though many introductory balance transfer offers are for a year or longer in an effort to be competitive. This gives you a generous window for making headway on paying off your balance without accruing more interest (temporarily). Pay close attention to balance transfer fees, however, to make sure it’s still a good deal.
Are you looking to make a big purchase such as a television or sofa, or do you plan to carry a large balance? You may want to apply for a card with a 0% introductory APR offer on purchases (though some cards offer an introductory period on both purchases and balance transfers). The same six-month minimum rule applies, though many offers are much longer, giving you plenty of time to pay down your debt before interest kicks in.





4.
Figure out the fees



It’s important to determine which credit card fees will be worth it for you. It is now common for rewards cards to have annual fees, though many now have two tiers of cards: one card with no annual fee and one card with a high annual fee (often close to $100) but better rewards. For example, you may find a credit card with no annual fee and three percent cash back on all purchases and then another tier with a $95 annual fee but six percent cash back on all purchases.


Before you get a card with an annual fee, do the math to make sure the rewards and benefits will add up enough that the fee is worth it. If you won’t be able to earn enough rewards to cover the cost of the annual fee, it isn’t worth it.
Additionally, if you plan to do a balance transfer with your new credit card, you should read the fine print and determine the balance transfer fee before you apply.

4 Tips for Choosing the Best Credit Card

 

																									By: Alexandra Leslie


								Finance Contributor							





 
CardRates.com Guide: Best Credit Cards

With so many hundreds of credit cards available on the market, it may be hard to decide which piece of plastic is right for your wallet. Use these tips to help you choose the best credit card for your needs.





1.
Determine your goals



It’s important to understand why you want a credit card. Do you want to score free flights? Are you interested in earning cash back? Are you looking more for a safety net when cash is low? Or perhaps you want to consolidate high-interest debt from other cards?
Depending on your goals, and particularly whether you plan to carry a balance or not, your needs will be very different. Rewards cards have higher interest than non-rewards cards, making them less ideal for carrying balances, and they often have an annual fee.
If you are only interested in transferring a balance or plan to carry a large balance, you may be better off applying for a non-rewards card with no annual fee.





2.
Want rewards? Decide what kind



If you’ve decided to go with a rewards card, you have several options. There are cash back credit cards, where you earn a percentage of your spending back in cash. There are points cards, where you earn points based on the dollar amount you spent. These can usually be redeemed for cash back, gift cards, travel, merchandise, events and more. Then there are travel cards, where your rewards are free flights or hotel stays.
Get the type of card that will benefit you most. If you aren’t a frequent traveler, don’t go for a travel card just because there is a large bonus offer for applying.





3.
Consider introductory offers



Do you need to transfer a balance from a high-interest credit card to a low-interest card? Look for a credit card with an introductory APR offer of 0%. Thanks to the Credit CARD Act of 2009, these introductory offers must be at least six months long, though many introductory balance transfer offers are for a year or longer in an effort to be competitive. This gives you a generous window for making headway on paying off your balance without accruing more interest (temporarily). Pay close attention to balance transfer fees, however, to make sure it’s still a good deal.
Are you looking to make a big purchase such as a television or sofa, or do you plan to carry a large balance? You may want to apply for a card with a 0% introductory APR offer on purchases (though some cards offer an introductory period on both purchases and balance transfers). The same six-month minimum rule applies, though many offers are much longer, giving you plenty of time to pay down your debt before interest kicks in.





4.
Figure out the fees



It’s important to determine which credit card fees will be worth it for you. It is now common for rewards cards to have annual fees, though many now have two tiers of cards: one card with no annual fee and one card with a high annual fee (often close to $100) but better rewards. For example, you may find a credit card with no annual fee and three percent cash back on all purchases and then another tier with a $95 annual fee but six percent cash back on all purchases.


Before you get a card with an annual fee, do the math to make sure the rewards and benefits will add up enough that the fee is worth it. If you won’t be able to earn enough rewards to cover the cost of the annual fee, it isn’t worth it.
Additionally, if you plan to do a balance transfer with your new credit card, you should read the fine print and determine the balance transfer fee before you apply.

4 Tips for Choosing the Best Credit Card

 

																									By: Alexandra Leslie


								Finance Contributor							





 
CardRates.com Guide: Best Credit Cards

With so many hundreds of credit cards available on the market, it may be hard to decide which piece of plastic is right for your wallet. Use these tips to help you choose the best credit card for your needs.





1.
Determine your goals



It’s important to understand why you want a credit card. Do you want to score free flights? Are you interested in earning cash back? Are you looking more for a safety net when cash is low? Or perhaps you want to consolidate high-interest debt from other cards?
Depending on your goals, and particularly whether you plan to carry a balance or not, your needs will be very different. Rewards cards have higher interest than non-rewards cards, making them less ideal for carrying balances, and they often have an annual fee.
If you are only interested in transferring a balance or plan to carry a large balance, you may be better off applying for a non-rewards card with no annual fee.





2.
Want rewards? Decide what kind



If you’ve decided to go with a rewards card, you have several options. There are cash back credit cards, where you earn a percentage of your spending back in cash. There are points cards, where you earn points based on the dollar amount you spent. These can usually be redeemed for cash back, gift cards, travel, merchandise, events and more. Then there are travel cards, where your rewards are free flights or hotel stays.
Get the type of card that will benefit you most. If you aren’t a frequent traveler, don’t go for a travel card just because there is a large bonus offer for applying.





3.
Consider introductory offers



Do you need to transfer a balance from a high-interest credit card to a low-interest card? Look for a credit card with an introductory APR offer of 0%. Thanks to the Credit CARD Act of 2009, these introductory offers must be at least six months long, though many introductory balance transfer offers are for a year or longer in an effort to be competitive. This gives you a generous window for making headway on paying off your balance without accruing more interest (temporarily). Pay close attention to balance transfer fees, however, to make sure it’s still a good deal.
Are you looking to make a big purchase such as a television or sofa, or do you plan to carry a large balance? You may want to apply for a card with a 0% introductory APR offer on purchases (though some cards offer an introductory period on both purchases and balance transfers). The same six-month minimum rule applies, though many offers are much longer, giving you plenty of time to pay down your debt before interest kicks in.





4.
Figure out the fees



It’s important to determine which credit card fees will be worth it for you. It is now common for rewards cards to have annual fees, though many now have two tiers of cards: one card with no annual fee and one card with a high annual fee (often close to $100) but better rewards. For example, you may find a credit card with no annual fee and three percent cash back on all purchases and then another tier with a $95 annual fee but six percent cash back on all purchases.


Before you get a card with an annual fee, do the math to make sure the rewards and benefits will add up enough that the fee is worth it. If you won’t be able to earn enough rewards to cover the cost of the annual fee, it isn’t worth it.
Additionally, if you plan to do a balance transfer with your new credit card, you should read the fine print and determine the balance transfer fee before you apply.

4 Tips for Choosing the Best Credit Card

 

																									By: Alexandra Leslie


								Finance Contributor							





 
CardRates.com Guide: Best Credit Cards

With so many hundreds of credit cards available on the market, it may be hard to decide which piece of plastic is right for your wallet. Use these tips to help you choose the best credit card for your needs.





1.
Determine your goals



It’s important to understand why you want a credit card. Do you want to score free flights? Are you interested in earning cash back? Are you looking more for a safety net when cash is low? Or perhaps you want to consolidate high-interest debt from other cards?
Depending on your goals, and particularly whether you plan to carry a balance or not, your needs will be very different. Rewards cards have higher interest than non-rewards cards, making them less ideal for carrying balances, and they often have an annual fee.
If you are only interested in transferring a balance or plan to carry a large balance, you may be better off applying for a non-rewards card with no annual fee.





2.
Want rewards? Decide what kind



If you’ve decided to go with a rewards card, you have several options. There are cash back credit cards, where you earn a percentage of your spending back in cash. There are points cards, where you earn points based on the dollar amount you spent. These can usually be redeemed for cash back, gift cards, travel, merchandise, events and more. Then there are travel cards, where your rewards are free flights or hotel stays.
Get the type of card that will benefit you most. If you aren’t a frequent traveler, don’t go for a travel card just because there is a large bonus offer for applying.





3.
Consider introductory offers



Do you need to transfer a balance from a high-interest credit card to a low-interest card? Look for a credit card with an introductory APR offer of 0%. Thanks to the Credit CARD Act of 2009, these introductory offers must be at least six months long, though many introductory balance transfer offers are for a year or longer in an effort to be competitive. This gives you a generous window for making headway on paying off your balance without accruing more interest (temporarily). Pay close attention to balance transfer fees, however, to make sure it’s still a good deal.
Are you looking to make a big purchase such as a television or sofa, or do you plan to carry a large balance? You may want to apply for a card with a 0% introductory APR offer on purchases (though some cards offer an introductory period on both purchases and balance transfers). The same six-month minimum rule applies, though many offers are much longer, giving you plenty of time to pay down your debt before interest kicks in.





4.
Figure out the fees



It’s important to determine which credit card fees will be worth it for you. It is now common for rewards cards to have annual fees, though many now have two tiers of cards: one card with no annual fee and one card with a high annual fee (often close to $100) but better rewards. For example, you may find a credit card with no annual fee and three percent cash back on all purchases and then another tier with a $95 annual fee but six percent cash back on all purchases.


Before you get a card with an annual fee, do the math to make sure the rewards and benefits will add up enough that the fee is worth it. If you won’t be able to earn enough rewards to cover the cost of the annual fee, it isn’t worth it.
Additionally, if you plan to do a balance transfer with your new credit card, you should read the fine print and determine the balance transfer fee before you apply.

Ok travel card but should have more flexibility to add travel alerts and foreign purchases. Should offer email and text alerts about potential fraud.

Advertising Practices
We strive to provide you with information about products and services you might find interesting and useful. Relationship-based ads and online behavioral advertising help us do that.
Here's how it works: We gather information about your online activities, such as the searches you conduct on our Sites and the pages you visit. This information may be used to deliver advertising on our Sites and offline (for example, by phone, email and direct mail) that's customized to meet specific interests you may have.
If you prefer that we do not use this information, you may opt out of online behavioral advertising. If you opt out, though, you may still receive generic advertising. In addition, financial advisors/Client Managers may continue to use information collected online to provide product and service information in accordance with account agreements.
Also, if you opt out of online behavioral advertising, you may still see ads when you sign in to your account, for example through Online Banking or MyMerrill. These ads are based on your specific account relationships with us.
To learn more about relationship-based ads, online behavioral advertising and our privacy practices, please review the Bank of America Online Privacy Notice and our Online Privacy FAQs.
