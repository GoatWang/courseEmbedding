Globally Harmonized System







It started out as a noble idea to make the world a safer place. What if everywhere you went in the world, hazardous chemical compounds were labeled according to a universal template so that workers handling those materials would never misinterpret a label because it was formatted differently?
This dream of a globally harmonized system came one step closer to reality in 2012 when the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) mandated a change in the enforceable standards known as HazCom, or Hazard Communication Standard 2012, or HCS. Thus began a gradual transition in the U.S. from the old provincial standards towards the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) that will continue to be incrementally deployed until it is officially complete by June of 2016.
Any undertaking of this magnitude is going to produce a lot of questions and a good deal of anxiety for businesses who have a healthy fear of regulatory agencies. Adding fuel to the anxiety is the confusing array of deadlines stretching from here to 2017. The good news for most HUB clients is there are really only two deadlines that specifically apply to you. Most of the deadlines are directed at the importers, producers and distributors of the chemical products and not at the end user, who are referred to in the standard as an employer.

Label Changes
Under HazCom 2012, OSHA prescribes label information based on six standardized elements:

Product identifier: Same identifier found on safety data sheet
Supplier information: Name, address and phone number of responsible party
Pictogram(s): Black hazard symbol on white background with red diamond border
Signal word: Must use either “Danger” or “Warning,” depending upon hazards
Hazard statement(s): Declarative statement regarding nature or degree of hazard
Precautionary statement(s): Descriptions of appropriate prevention, storage, response and spill measures


EMPLOYERS’ RESPONSIBILITIES:

They must train their employees to recognize and understand GHS compliant labels with all their elements, including pictograms, signal words, etc.
They must familiarize their employees with the new “Safety Data Sheet” format with its 16 sections and how to get needed information from the sheet to advise on proper use and recommended treatment in case of exposure or accident. These SDS replace MSDS.
As with earlier renditions of the HazCom standard, employers must have a written policy that outlines the company’s safety procedures and prescribed approach to dealing with the kinds of hazardous chemicals and products used by employees in their duties at the company. They must also collect Safety Data Sheets of all hazardous materials in use in their plant. All of this must be published in a form that is accessible at all times to all affected workers.
If you use bulk chemicals and transfer them into smaller containers at your jobsite or place of business, certain rules apply regarding the labeling of those containers. See references below for more information.

DEADLINES:
There are only two deadlines that matter to end users: NOW, and June. 1, 2016.

NOW: All the employer responsibilities mentioned above related to training are already enforceable. The requirement mentioned above to publish a written usage policy for employees and to collect safety data sheets has been in force for years. If you have been compliant in the past, all that is required is to revise your policy reflecting the GHS training requirements and update MSDS with SDS as they become available.
June 1, 2016: This end date is important for employers because enforcement will become more serious once the program is fully implemented. During the transition period, enforcement is going to hinge on whether you are making a “good faith effort” to comply in an environment where entities upstream of you may not have provided you with the elements that you need to be fully compliant.

The deadline for manufacturers to convert to SDS from MSDS has already passed as of June 30, 2015. Technically it is their responsibility to include any new or revised SDS with their next shipment to their downstream users. Even though the burden rests on them, it shows good faith to periodically review your library of safety sheets and request the missing SDS you may not have received.
WHAT HUB IS DOING TO HELP YOU:

We have added SDS sheets to products on our website. They are found on each product page.
We have many products available to assist your compliance efforts, including SDS binders and “need to know” stations that you can place on your 	shop floor where employees can access the information the HazCom requires.
We can answer questions you may have regarding HazCom or point you in the direction of someone who can.

Customer Quotes



Hubb is the best system that I have used thus far for our Call for Speakers process. It is a meeting planner's dream! Hubb is the next BIG up and coming software and I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking.Michelle Moore, CEM Senior Conference Manager LIGHTFAIR International.



Hubb allowed our conference to engage and interact with the attendees in a way we could never provide before. The platform made it easy for our attendees to schedule their sessions, setup 1 on 1 meetings with speakers, get up to date news and so much more. Without the tool our attendees would not of had an offline mobile version of their schedule or been able to dig deeper into a session. Hubb.me portal allowed us to take our conference to the next level.Trey Mayer, Logistics Coordinator Dog Food Conference



We managed a large conference this year and relied on Hubb to help us stay organized with multiple tracks and meeting rooms. Our attendees loved the ability to connect with other attendees and engage in real-time during a session with accessible speaker resources. Our speakers love it and our attendees love it; which means we love it!Product Marketing Manager, A Major Software Company
