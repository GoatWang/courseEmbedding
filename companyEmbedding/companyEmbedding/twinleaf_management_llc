Jeffersonia diphylla
Native to rich, shady woods from New York to Virginia, Twinleaf (Jeffersonia diphylla) is an uncommon perennial with a pleasant white bloom in spring. Hailed by Native Americans for a variety of medicinal purposes and protected today as an endangered plant species, Twinleaf is named in honor of Thomas Jefferson.

Twinleaf Management LLC is a Connecticut-based Investment Adviser dedicated to constructing concentrated, separately managed client portfolios that consist of overlooked, out-of-favor, misunderstood or mispriced publicly traded U.S. equities with under $2 billion of market capitalization. Our primary investment research is in technology, media and telecom.  We are especially focused on the digital revolution in media and technology that is creating investment opportunities in mobile and IP connectivity, SaaS platforms, data analytics, content creation, distribution and highly targeted advertising.  We occasionally identify compelling investment ideas in the consumer space.Market inefficiencies and a lack of quality research are most pronounced among small-cap stocks. Before others do, we seek to identify companies at which a catalyst for share price appreciation could become apparent. Perhaps it's an obscured asset, a new product launch, management change, shareholder-friendly capital allocation or an outright sale of the company.  The unconventional Twinleaf approach combines a strong element of patient, private equity-style investing with the benefits of the public market, principally trading liquidity.  Holding only a small handful of sizable positions can produce volatile results but it allows us to become expertly knowledgeable on our portfolio companies and their prospects.  Tax-efficient, long-term capital appreciation is our objective but we are are nimble enough to capitalize on fleeting opportunities.    We welcome an opportunity to discuss whether a small portion of your investable assets may be suited for an allocation to our investment strategy.We have a passion for uncovering actionable investment ideas.

For more information, please contact:  Spencer Grimes 203-594-1441 spencer@twinleafmanagement.comDisclaimer: While our investment decisions are rooted in detailed analysis, it is important to point out that actual results can differ significantly from those that we seek. We discuss a handful of individual companies herein; our opinions are current as of the date they were written but are subject to change.  Information herein may not be sufficient on which to base an investment decision and should not be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell any particular security. Equity investments are affected by market conditions and may be volatile. Twinleaf Management LLC invests in small- and mid-cap companies for client accounts.  Investing in smaller companies may be riskier and more volatile than investing in larger companies, in part because smaller companies may not have the scale, depth of resources or other assets of larger firms. Twinleaf accounts typically hold 10-12 stocks and therefore may be more volatile than a more diversified investment. Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks and fees before investing.

Manager Profile



Spencer Grimes

Spencer Grimes brings 20 years of private equity investing and investment analysis of public companies, primarily in the media and communications sector, to the founding of Twinleaf in January 2012. He began his career at Viacom, Inc. before moving to Wall Street.  From 1996 to 2000 Spencer was an equity research analyst at Salomon Smith Barney covering the cable television industry.  He was named an All-Star Analyst by the Wall Street Journal in 1999 with recognition for accuracy in earnings estimates and stock picking. In 2000, Spencer moved to TMT-focused private equity and helped deliver a positive return for fund investors with the sale of a group of data centers for $100+ million in 2008.  More recently, Spencer was a partner in Sequence LLC, a media software company that enabled content personalization and real-time ad insertion and was sold to R.R. Donnelley (Nasdaq: RRD) in 2011.  He also serves as an adjunct professor at the New School in New York, teaching graduate-level courses in Media Economics and Finance and Accounting for Media Managers.

Spencer applies a research-driven, private equity-type approach to TMT investing in the public markets.  Combining an investment in a misunderstood, out-of-favor and undervalued company with patience to allow the thesis to play out often yields a successful investment.  He spends his days speaking with company management, industry sources and other portfolio managers, reading SEC filings, product evaluations and customer reviews and thinking about M&A possibilities. He is a passionate and knowledgeable student of TMT and small-cap investing, industry trends, capital markets, fundamental analysis and macro events.

Spencer holds a BA from the University of Virginia and an MBA from Emory University's Gouizeta Business School.  In May 2017, he was elected to the board of directors of Truett-Hurst, Inc. (THST), a publicly traded wine company based in Sonoma County, California.

A Magnetometer Company
Twinleaf LLC was formed in 2007 to commercialize exciting new physics-based sensor technologies. We develop sensor systems under contracts from government, universities, and industry. Twinleaf is a woman-owned small business.
Management team
Thomas W. Kornack, Ph.D., Chief Scientist
Dr. Kornack is an expert in the design, fabrication and operation of magnetometers and gyroscopes, with over seven years of research in the field and authorship on groundbreaking publications. During graduate and postdoctoral work at Princeton University, he has worked on many important projects, including the development of the first SERF magnetometers. For his dissertation, he built a high-performance co-magnetometer to probe fundamental laws of physics and for use as a sensitive gyroscope. In 2007, Dr. Kornack founded Twinleaf to develop and commercialize these sensors for use in a wide variety of applications. Twinleaf's core technological basis is derived from his extensive experience building the world's most sensitive magnetic field sensors.

She received her doctorate from Princeton University for work on energetic neutral beam diagnostics and their unusual behavior in weaker magnetic fields.

Namesake
Twinleaf is the common name for Jeffersonia diphylla a beautiful and rare flowering plant that grows in forests in the eastern half of the United States. The plant is named after its leaves, which appear to be divided in half. The flower emerges in very early spring and is highly photosensitive, closing up unless sunny. With its unusual structure, it is classified almost alone in its genus, with only one other species in asia.  We wish to associate our products with a thing of such rare form and  beauty.
