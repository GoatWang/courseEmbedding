Licensing & CollaborationPalatin is focusing resources on clinical trials with bremelanotide for female sexual dysfunction.  Our research and technology has resulted in program opportunities outside our core clinical development strategy.  Palatin is seeking partners to advance these opportunities, and will consider a variety of licensing or collaboration arrangements.
Opportunities include:
Several series of patented and patent-pending highly selective melanocortin receptor 1 agonists for use as anti-inflammatory agents and dermatological indications.  Peptide series are highly specific (binding Ki at MCR1 as low as 0.01 nM) and selective (MCR1 to MCR4 Ki ratios of up to 10,000).  Potential utility for inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel disease, inflammatory lung diseases such as asthma and COPD, ocular indications such as dry eye and dermatological indications.
Specific and selective melanocortin 4 receptor agonist peptides and small molecules for indications outside the sexual dysfunction market.
Natriuretic peptide compounds, include high-affinity NPR-C ligand, NPR-B agonists and dual NPR-A and NPR-B agonists.

Bremelanotide for Female Sexual Dysfunction



Bremelanotide for female sexual dysfunctions in premenopausal women: a randomized, placebo-controlled dose-ranging trial
Women's Health, 12:325-337 (2016); Published online 16 May 2016
The aim was to evaluate efficacy/safety of bremelanotide, a melanocortin-receptor-4 agonist, to treat female sexual dysfunctions in premenopausal women.  In premenopausal women with female sexual dysfunctions, self-administered, as desired, subcutaneous bremelanotide was safe, effective, and well tolerated.


Drugs in early clinical development for the treatment of female sexual dysfunction
Expert Opin Investig Drugs.2015 Feb;24(2):159-67
There is growing recognition of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) as an important women's health concern. Despite an increased awareness of the pathophysiologic components to FSD, currently, there are no drugs approved for the most common sexual complaint in women-decreased sexual desire.


Melanocortin receptor agonists in the treatment of male and female sexual dysfunctions: results from basic research and clinical studies
Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2014 Nov;23(11):1477-83
Over the last 20 years, basic and clinical research activities studying the male and female sexual responses have led to several pharmacological options to treat male erectile dysfunction (ED) and female arousal and orgasmic disorders. 


Bremelanotide: an overview of preclinical CNS effects on female sexual function
J Sex Med. 2007 Nov;4 Suppl 4:269-79
Bremelanotide is an analogue of the naturally occurring peptide alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH). It stimulates erection in men and male rats, and is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.


Clinical application of CNS-acting agents in FSD
J Sex Med. 2007 Nov;4 Suppl 4:280-90
Human sexual response involves a complex sequencing of interrelated mind/body processes. Few treatment options exist that address the complex multilayered etiological determinants of female sexual dysfunction (FSD).


Melanocortins in the treatment of male and female sexual dysfunction
Curr Top Med Chem. 2007;7(11):1137-44
Melanocortinergic agents are currently being investigated for a possible therapeutic role in male and female sexual dysfunction. These investigations were sparked by findings that systemic administration of a synthetic analog of alpha-MSH, MT-II, causes penile erections in a variety of species, including humans.


An effect on the subjective sexual response in premenopausal women with sexual arousal disorder by bremelanotide (PT-141), a melanocortin receptor agonist
J Sex Med. 2006 Jul;3(4):628-38
Melanocortins affect multiple physiological responses, including sexual behaviors. Bremelanotide is a synthetic peptide melanocortin analog of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone that is an agonist at melanocortin receptors MC3R and MC4R.


Selective facilitation of sexual solicitation in the female rat by a melanocortin receptor agonist
Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Jul 6;101(27):10201-4
Disorders of sexual desire affect an estimated 30% of women in North America and Europe, with etiologies based on interpersonal, personal, and physiological factors.

PL-3994


In vitro and in vivo pharmacological profile of PL-3994, a novel cyclic peptide (Hept-cyclo(Cys-His-Phe-d-Ala-Gly-Arg-d-Nle-Asp-Arg-Ile-Ser-Cys)-Tyr-[Arg mimetic]-NH(2)) natriuretic peptide receptor-A agonist that is resistant to neutral endopeptidase and acts as a bronchodilator
Pulm Pharmacol Ther. 2013 Apr;26(2):229-38
The pharmacological and airways relaxant profiles of PL-3994 (Hept-cyclo(Cys-His-Phe-d-Ala-Gly-Arg-d-Nle-Asp-Arg-Ile-Ser-Cys)-Tyr-[Arg mimetic]-NH(2)), a novel natriuretic peptide receptor-A (NPR-A) agonist, were evaluated. PL-3994, a full agonist, has high affinity for recombinant human (h), dog, or rat NPR-As (K(i)s of 1, 41, and 10 nm, respectively), and produced concentration-dependent cGMP generation in human, dog and rat NPR-As (respective EC(50)s of 2, 3 and 14 nm).

					Full Description



Palatin Technologies, Inc., incorporated on November 21, 1986, is a biopharmaceutical company. The Company is engaged in developing targeted, receptor-specific peptide therapeutics for the treatment of diseases with significant unmet medical need and commercial potential. Its programs are based on molecules that modulate the activity of the melanocortin and natriuretic peptide receptor systems. The Company's primary product in clinical development is bremelanotide for the treatment of premenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), which is a type of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) defined as low desire with associated distress. Its other drug development programs include Melanocortin receptor-4 (MC4r), PL-3994 and Melanocortin receptor-1 (MC1r). In addition, it has drug candidates or development programs for obesity, erectile dysfunction, cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases, inflammatory diseases and dermatologic diseases.BremelanotideBremelanotide is a melanocortin agonist, a synthetic peptide analog of a naturally occurring hormone called alpha-MSH. The mechanism of action involves helping to activate internal pathways involved in the body's normal sexual responses. Bremelanotide is in Phase III clinical trials for a type of FSD with decreased sexual desire that is also known as HSDD.Melanocortin receptor-4MC4r is a compound used for treatment of obesity and diabetes. The Company is engaged in preclinical activities with MC4r compounds, and is evaluating pharmaceutical applications. It has selected an internal lead compound for obesity, designated PL-8905, which has over 100-fold functional selectivity for MC4r over MC1r with minimal effect on blood pressure and limited central nervous system penetration.PL-3994The Company's heart failure product candidate is PL-3994. PL-3994 is a subcutaneously injected guanylate-cyclase type A (GC-A) receptor agonist. It is in development for patients with heart failure to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization. PL-3994 is also being developed for heart failure patients with a loss-of-function corin mutation or other clinically meaningful natriuretic peptide system deficiencies, a patient population that is particularly resistant to the current standard of care. Its heart failure program is focused on the natriuretic peptide receptor system. It is developing synthetic mimetics of natural neuropeptide hormones, including mimetics of atrial natriuretic peptide and other natriuretic peptides.Melanocortin receptor-1MC1r agonist peptides are used for treatment of inflammatory and dermatologic disease indications. The Company is conducting preclinical animal studies with its MC1r peptide drug candidates for various indications, primarily inflammatory disease-related and autoimmune indications. The MC1r is upregulated in various diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, nephritis (inflammation of the kidneys), rheumatoid arthritis, ocular indications, such as uveitis and dry eye, and dermatologic indications.
