Red River Environmental Products,
LLC; Notice of Self-Certification of
Qualifying Status of a Cogeneration
Facility
December 13, 2007.

Take notice that on November 15,
2007, Red River Environmental
Products, LLC, 8100 Southpark Way,
Unit B, Littleton, CO 80120, filed with
the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission a notice of self-certification
of a facility as a qualifying cogeneration
facility pursuant to 18 CFR 292.207(a) of
the Commission’s regulations.
Red River Environmental Products,
LLC proposes to certify a new bottoming
cycle cogeneration facility near the town
of Armistead, Louisiana in Red River
Parish (Facility). The powdered
activated carbon (PAC) manufactured at
the Facility will be marketed for
injection into the flue gas stream of coalfired power plants as an effective means
of removing mercury emissions. The
process will produce PAC primarily
from coal (lignite) through a thermal
process. A small quantity of natural gas
will also be used to help control the
process temperature and emissions.
Waste heat from this process will be
captured and used to generate

approximately 19,500 kW of gross
electric power and 18,380 kW of net
electric power from each of two
production lines, for a total generating
capacity of approximately 39,000 kW
gross and 36,760 kW net. The electric
power in each production line will be
generated by two steam turbines: one
sized to generate 15,500 kW and another
sized to generate 4,000 kW of gross
power, resulting in total net power of
18,380 kW per production line.
Generators will be connected to a stepup transformer (GSU), which will step
up 13.8 kV to 115 kV. The electric
power generated by the Facility will be
used on site to power the PAC
manufacturing plant, and sold into the
wholesale market.
Cleco Power, LLC is the electric
utility with which the Facility expects
to interconnect, transmit or sell electric
energy to, or purchase supplementary,
standby, back-up and maintenance
power.
A notice of self-certification does not
institute a proceeding regarding
qualifying facility status; a notice of selfcertification provides notice that the
entity making filing has determined the
Facility meets the applicable criteria to
be a qualifying facility. Any person
seeking to challenge such qualifying
facility status may do so by filing a
motion pursuant to 18 CFR 292.207(d)
(1)(iii), with the appropriate filing fee.1
This filing is accessible on-line at
http://www.ferc.gov, using the
‘‘eLibrary’’ link and is available for
review in the Commission’s Public
Reference Room in Washington, DC.

        Take notice that on November 30, 2007, Philip R. Lochner, Jr. filed an Application for Authority to Hold Interlocking Positions, pursuant to Part 45 of Chapter 1 of Title 18 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 18 CFR 45 and section 305(b) of the Federal Power Act.
Any person desiring to intervene or to protest this filing must file in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211, 385.214).

Persons unable to file electronically should submit an original and 14 copies of the protest or intervention to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.
