Annuity to Form N-4 Registration Statement (333-122235 and 811-21703) filed on April�27, 2007 and any subsequent filings are hereby incorporated by reference. 


THE ADVISOR�S EDGE� NY  VARIABLE ANNUITY  Issued by Transamerica Financial Life Insurance Company  Supplement Dated December�31, 2007  to the  Prospectus dated May�1, 2007  The following
hereby amends, and to the extent inconsistent replaces, the corresponding FEE TABLE and EXAMPLE in the prospectus.  FEE TABLE(1)  The following table describes the fees and expenses that you will pay when buying, owning and surrendering the Policy. The first table describes the fees and expenses that you will pay at the time you buy the Policy,
surrender the Policy, or transfer Cash Value between investment choices. State premium taxes may also be deducted. For a complete discussion of Policy costs and expenses, see Section�5, �Expenses.�  �

 (1)
 The fee table applies only to the accumulation phase and reflects the maximum
charges unless otherwise noted. During the income phase, the fees may be different than those described in the fee table. See Section�5, �Expenses.�  �


 (2)
 TFLIC does not currently charge a fee for transfers among the Subaccounts,
although it reserves the right to charge a $10 fee for each Transfer in excess of 12�per Policy Year.  The next table
describes the fees and expenses that you will pay periodically during the time that you own the Policy, not including the investment portfolios� fees and expenses.  �

 (1)
 We may assess an Annual Policy Service Charge of up to $30 for policy
administration expenses (but no more than 2% of the Policy Value at the time of deduction). We will not assess this charge on a Policy if (1)�the sum of all Premium Payments less the sum of all withdrawals taken is at least $50,000 or
(2)�the Policy Value equals or exceeds $50,000.  This Prospectus Supplement must be accompanied or preceded
 by the Prospectus for the  Advisor�s Edge� NY Variable
Annuity dated May�1, 2007 




 (2)
 Total Annual Separate Account Expenses shown (0.75%) apply to the Annual Step-Up
to Age 81 Death Benefit option. This reflects a fee that is 0.15% and 0.20%�per year higher than the 0.60% and 0.55% corresponding total separate account expenses for the Return of Premium Death Benefit and Policy Value Death Benefit options,
respectively.  �


 (3)
 In some cases, riders to the policy are available that provide optional benefits
that are not described in detail in this prospectus. There are additional fees (each year) for those riders.  �


 (4)
 The fee is a percentage of the total withdrawal base. The total withdrawal base on
the rider date is the policy value (less any premium enhancement if the rider is added in the first policy year). After the rider date, the total withdrawal base is equal to the total withdrawal base on the rider date, plus subsequent premium
payments, less subsequent total withdrawal base adjustments.  The next item shows the lowest and highest total operating expenses
charged by the portfolio companies for the year ended December�31, 2006 (before any fee waiver or expense reimbursements). Expenses may be higher or lower in future years. More detail concerning each Portfolio�s fees and expenses is
contained in the prospectus for each Portfolio.  �

 (1)
 The fee table information relating to the Portfolios is for the year ending
December�31, 2006 (unless otherwise noted) and was provided to TFLIC by the underlying funds, their investment advisors or managers, and TFLIC has not and cannot independently verify the accuracy or completeness of such information. Actual
future expenses of the Portfolios may be greater or less than those shown in the Table.  EXAMPLE(1)  The
following example illustrates the highest fees and expenses of any of the Portfolios for the year ended December�31, 2006, and the highest combination of Separate Account expenses that you would incur on a $10,000 Premium Payment over various
periods, assuming (1)�a 5% annual rate of return, (2)�full surrender at the end of each period, and (3)�assuming the Architect Rider has been selected. As noted in the Fee Table, the Policy imposes no surrender or withdrawal charges
of any kind. Your expenses are identical whether you continue the Policy or withdraw the entire value of your Policy at the end of the applicable period as a lump sum or under one of the Policy�s Annuity Payment Options. The expenses reflect
different mortality and expense risk fees depending on which death benefit you select:  �

 Different fees and expenses not reflected in the example may be assessed during
the income phase of the Policy.  You should not consider this example to be a representation of past or future expenses or
performance. Actual expenses may be higher than those shown, subject to the guarantees in the Policy. In addition, your rate of return may be more or less than the 5% assumed in the example.  For information concerning compensation paid for sale of the Policies, see �Distribution of the Policies.�  The following text replaces the fifth sentence of the first paragraph under 7. ANNUITY PAYMENTS in the prospectus:  This date may be any date at least one year after the Policy Date and may not be later than the last day of the month following the month in which the Annuitant attains
age 95.  �

The following hereby amends the prospectus.  ARCHITECT GUARANTEED LIFETIME WITHDRAWAL BENEFIT  You may elect to purchase the optional Architect Guaranteed
Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit which provides you with a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit if you invest, subject to specified equity limits (�GLWB�), in certain designated investment choices. This rider is available during the
accumulation phase.  The Architect GLWB may vary for certain policies and may not be available for all policies. Please contact us at (800)�797-9177
for additional information regarding the availability of the Architect GLWB.  In addition, the tax rules for qualified policies may limit the value of this
rider. Please consult a qualified tax advisor before electing the Architect GLWB for a qualified policy.  Architect GLWB  This benefit is intended to provide a level of cash withdrawals regardless of the performance of the designated
investment choices you select. If you elect this benefit, we will provide a maximum annual withdrawal amount regardless of your policy value (your ability to change the frequency or amount of your withdrawal ceases if your policy value reaches
zero). Under this benefit, you can withdraw up to the maximum annual withdrawal amount each calendar year, starting with the calendar year immediately following the annuitant�s 59th birthday and lasting until the annuitant�s (or the annuitant�s surviving spouse if the joint life option is elected) death (unless your total withdrawal base is reduced to zero because of �excess
withdrawals�; see Total Withdrawal Base Adjustments, below). All withdrawals before the annuitant (or the annuitant�s surviving spouse if the joint life option is elected) is 59 are excess withdrawals; a penalty tax may be assessed on
amounts withdrawn from the policy before the owner reaches age 59�1/2.  Example. Assume you are the owner and annuitant and you make a single premium payment of $100,000 when you are 61 years old. Further assume that you do
not make any additional withdrawals or premium payments, but that after ten years your policy value has declined to $90,000 solely because of negative investment performance. You could withdraw up to $5,000.00, which is the applicable income benefit
percentage of (5.0%)�multiplied by the total withdrawal base of $100,000, each calendar year for the rest of your life (assuming that you take your first withdrawal when you are age 70 � 74, and that you do not withdraw more than the
maximum annual withdrawal amount in any one year.)  Of course, you can always withdraw an amount up to your policy value pursuant to your rights under
the policy at your discretion.  Example continued. Assume the same facts as above, but you withdraw $10,000 when you are 66 years old.
That excess withdrawal decreases your future maximum annual withdrawal amount to $4,210.53.  See the SAI for examples showing the effect of
hypothetical withdrawals in more detail.  �
3 


Please note:  �


�
�
�
 Any withdrawal in excess of the maximum withdrawal amount in any calendar year is an excess withdrawal.  �


�
�
�
 An excess withdrawal will impact the maximum annual withdrawal amount, and the total withdrawal base, on a greater than dollar-for-dollar basis.
 Like all withdrawals, withdrawals under this benefit also:  �


�
�
�
 reduce your policy value;  �


�
�
�
 reduce your base policy death benefit and other benefits;  �


�
�
�
 may be subject to income taxes and federal tax penalties; and  �


�
�
�
 may be limited or restricted under certain qualified policies.  Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount. You can withdraw up to the maximum annual withdrawal amount in any calendar year without causing an excess withdrawal. See �Total Withdrawal Base Adjustments� below.
 The maximum annual withdrawal amount is zero if the annuitant is not 59 years old on the rider date
(i.e., the date the rider is issued) and remains zero until the first day of the calendar year after the annuitant�s 59th birthday. If the annuitant
is at least 59 years old on the rider date, the maximum annual withdrawal amount in the calendar year during which the rider is elected is equal to the income benefit percentage of the total withdrawal base prorated based on the number of days from
the rider date to the end of the calendar year. Thereafter, the maximum annual withdrawal amount for each subsequent calendar year is equal to the income benefit percentage (see below) of the total withdrawal base.  For qualified policies: If the plan participant (generally the annuitant) is at least 70 �1/2 years old, the maximum annual withdrawal amount for that calendar year (and each subsequent calendar year) is
equal to the greater of:  �


�
�
�
 the maximum annual withdrawal amount described above; or  �


�
�
�
 an amount equal to a minimum required distribution amount calculated using only: (1)�the living annuitant�s age, (2)�the IRS Uniform Lifetime table
or, if applicable, the Joint Life and Survivor Expectancy table, (3)�the policy value of the base policy, (including the present value of any additional benefits provided under the policy to the extent required to be taken into account under
IRS guidance) and (4)�amounts from the current calendar year (no carry-over from past years). An amount not calculated as set forth above cannot be used as the maximum annual withdrawal amount.  Once your policy value reaches zero (by a combination of non-excess withdrawals and/or negative performance), you cannot make premium payments and all other policy
features, benefits, and guarantees (except those provided by this rider) are terminated. In order to receive withdrawals guaranteed by this rider after your policy value reaches zero, you must select the frequency of future withdrawals. Once
selected, the amount and frequency of future withdrawals after your policy value reaches zero cannot be changed.  Please note:  �


�
�
�
 The maximum annual withdrawal amount described above is based on calendar years, not rider or policy years.  �


�
�
�
 The maximum annual withdrawal amount is not cumulative; amounts not withdrawn in one calendar year are not carried over to the next or any subsequent calendar year
(i.e., your maximum annual withdrawal amount is not twice as high the next year).  �
4 




�
 �
�
 If the rider is added prior to the annuitant�s 59th birthday, the maximum annual withdrawal amount will be zero until the beginning of the calendar year (January 1st) after
the annuitant�s 59th birthday, however, you will still be charged a rider fee prior to this time. 
�


�
�
�
 Excess withdrawals may cause you to lose the benefit of the rider.  �


�
�
�
 All policy value must be allocated to a limited number of specified funds (See �Designated Investment Choices,� below).  Income Benefit Percentage. We use the income benefit percentage to calculate the maximum annual withdrawal
amount. The income benefit percentage is determined by the annuitant�s age at the time of the first withdrawal taken on or after the January�1st
immediately following the annuitant�s 59th birthday (or if the joint life option is elected, the 59th
 birthday of the younger of the annuitant or the annuitant�s spouse). The income benefit percentage is as follows:  �






 Age�at�time�of first�withdrawal
��

��

 59-64
��

��
6.0%

 85-89
��
6.5%

 90-94
��
7.0%

 �95
��
7.5%
 Please note that once established at the time of the first
withdrawal on or after the January�1st immediately following the 59th birthday of the annuitant (or if the joint life option is elected, of the younger of the annuitant or the annuitant�s spouse), the income benefit percentage will not increase even though the annuitant�s age
increases.  Total Withdrawal Base. We use the total withdrawal base to calculate the maximum annual withdrawal amount. The total
withdrawal base on the rider date is the policy value. After the rider date, the total withdrawal base is equal to the total withdrawal base on the rider date, plus subsequent premium payments, less subsequent Total Withdrawal Base Adjustments.
 Total Withdrawal Base Adjustments. Gross partial withdrawals up to the maximum annual withdrawal amount that are made in a single calendar year
will not reduce the total withdrawal base. Gross partial withdrawals in excess of the maximum annual withdrawal amount that are made in a single calendar year (�excess withdrawals�) will reduce the total withdrawal base (on the date of the
withdrawal) by the greater of the dollar amount of the excess withdrawal or a pro rata amount (in proportion to the reduction in the policy value), possibly to zero. See the SAI for examples showing the effect of hypothetical withdrawals in more
detail, including an excess withdrawal that reduces the total withdrawal base by a pro rata amount. Excess withdrawals may eliminate any guarantee offered by this rider.  �

5 


Please note:  �


�
�
�
 The total withdrawal base is generally equal to the policy value on the rider date. Consequently, purchasing this rider after the policy issue date may result in a
smaller maximum annual withdrawal amount (if the policy value decreases prior to the rider date) than what it would have been had the rider been purchased on the policy issue date.  �


�
�
�
 Upon the death of the annuitant, the Architect GLWB terminates and there are no more additional guaranteed withdrawals.  Designated Investment Choices. If you elect the Architect GLWB benefit, you must allocate 100% of your policy value to one or more of the following

 If you elect this rider, you may transfer amounts among the designated choices; however, you cannot transfer any
amount which would cause you to exceed your maximum equity percentage (discussed below) or to any other subaccount. Within 30 days after the first rider anniversary (i.e., the anniversary of the rider date), you can terminate this rider. Terminating
the rider will result in losing all your benefits under this rider. Starting the next business day you may transfer to a non-designated choice.  Maximum
Equity Percentage. You select either the 50%, 60%, or 70% maximum equity percentage at the time you elect the Architect GLWB. Your equity percentage is equal to the policy value in all �equity� investment choices divided by the total
policy value.  Asset Rebalancing. Monthly asset rebalancing is required at all times while the Architect GLWB is in effect. Your asset rebalancing
equity percentage cannot exceed your maximum equity percentage. If asset rebalancing is discontinued, if the asset rebalancing equity percentage exceeds the maximum equity percentage, or if you make a transfer which causes your policy equity
percentage to exceed your maximum equity percentage, then we will notify you of your failure to comply. You will have 30 days from the date we mail the notice to fix the problem or your rider will terminate.  �
6 


Upgrades. You can upgrade the total withdrawal base to the policy value after the first rider anniversary by
sending us written notice (we reserve the right to limit your upgrade election to a 30-day period following each rider anniversary) as long as you are younger than the maximum rider issue age. At this time the minimum remaining withdrawal amount and
maximum annual withdrawal amount will be recalculated. If an upgrade is elected, your current rider will terminate and a new rider will be issued with a new rider date and its own rider fee percentage (which may be higher than your current rider fee
percentage) and growth rate, if any. The new rider date will be the date the Company receives all necessary information.  Please Note: 
�


�
�
�
 Even if the rider fee percentage does not increase, the charge for the rider will increase because it would be based on a higher total withdrawal base.
 �


�
�
�
 If you upgrade while you are receiving systematic payouts of the maximum annual withdrawal amount, the dollar amount of the systematic payout of the maximum annual
withdrawal amount after the upgrade may decrease for the reminder of the calendar year, even though the total withdrawal base increases. This is generally because the maximum annual withdrawal amount for the remainder of the calendar year is
calculated based on the remaining partial year and the systematic payout is calculated on a yearly basis.  Annuitization. If you
have reached your maximum annuitization date, we will allow you to annuitize your policy and elect to receive lifetime annuity payments equal to your maximum annual withdrawal amount.  Architect GLWB � Joint Life Option  If you elect the Architect GLWB, you can also elect to postpone termination
of the rider until the later of the annuitant or annuitant�s spouse�s death. This allows the maximum annual withdrawal amount to be withdrawn until the death of the later of the annuitant or annuitant�s spouse (if the annuitant�s
spouse continues the policy).  Please note:  �


�
�
�
 The annuitant�s spouse must be either a joint owner along with the annuitant or the sole primary beneficiary (and there is no joint owner), if you elect this
option.  �


�
�
�
 If at the time of the annuitant�s death the spouse cannot continue to keep the policy in force under the tax code, then the rider will terminate and no
additional withdrawals under the rider are permitted.  �


�
�
�
 The annuitant�s spouse for purposes of this rider cannot be changed.  �
7 


Architect GLWB Fee  A
rider fee, which is a percentage of the total withdrawal base on each rider anniversary, is charged annually prior to annuitization. The percentage depends on the maximum equity percentage that you select, and on whether you select the joint life
option. The rider fee percentages are:  �








 Maximum Equity Percentage
��
 Single�Life�Option
��
 Joint�Life�Option

 50%
��
0.30%
��
0.45%

 60%
��
0.45%
��
0.65%

 70%
��
0.65%
��
1.00%
 We will also deduct the rider fee pro rata upon full surrender of the policy or other termination of the rider.
The rider fee is deducted from each investment choice in proportion to the amount of policy value in each investment choice.  Architect GLWB Issue
Requirements  The Company will not issue the Architect GLWB unless:  �


�
�
�
 the annuitant is not yet age 86 (lower if required by state law);  �


�
�
�
 the annuitant is also an owner (except in the case of non-natural owners);  �


�
�
�
 there are no more than two owners; and  �


�
�
�
 if the joint life option is elected, the annuitant�s spouse is not yet age 86 (lower if required by state law and (1)�a joint owner along with the
annuitant or (2)�the sole primary beneficiary (and there is no joint owner).  Termination  The Architect GLWB and any additional options will terminate upon the earliest of the following:  �


�
�
�
 the date we receive written notice from you requesting termination of the Architect GLWB provided that the request is made within 30 days after a rider anniversary;
 �


�
�
�
 the death of the annuitant (or if the joint life option was elected, the death of the annuitant�s spouse if that spouse continued the policy as the surviving
spouse);  �


�
�
�
 discontinuing asset rebalancing, changing your asset rebalancing so that the asset rebalancing equity percentage exceeds the maximum equity percentage, or making a
transfer which causes your policy equity percentage to exceed your maximum equity percentage, any of which is not corrected within 30 days from the date we mail you a notice of the problem;  �


�
�
�
 annuitization (however, if you have reached your mandatory annuitization date you may choose an annuitization option which guarantees you lifetime payments in an
amount equal to your maximum annual withdrawal amount); or  �


�
�
�
 termination of your policy.  Please note:
This feature terminates upon annuitization and there is a mandatory annuitization date.  This disclosure explains the material features of the Architect
GLWB. The application and operation of the Architect GLWB are governed by the terms and conditions of the rider itself. The Architect GLWB may vary for certain policies and may not be available for all policies.  �

THE ADVISOR�S EDGE� NY  VARIABLE ANNUITY  Issued by Transamerica Financial Life Insurance Company  Supplement Dated December�31, 2007  to the  Statement of Additional Information dated May�1, 2007  The following text replaces the definition of ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE in the statement of additional
information:  Annuity Commencement
Date � The date upon which annuity payments are to commence. This date may be any date at least one year after the policy date and may not be later than the last day of the policy month following the month in which the annuitant attains age 95,
except expressly allowed by TFLIC.  The following disclosure is hereby added to the Statement of Additional Information:  ARCHITECT GUARANTEED LIFETIME WITHDRAWAL BENEFIT TOTAL WITHDRAWAL BASE ADJUSTMENTS  Total Withdrawal Base. Gross partial withdrawals up to the maximum annual withdrawal amount that are made in a single calendar year will not reduce the total withdrawal base. Gross partial withdrawals in excess
of the maximum annual withdrawal amount that are made in a single calendar year will reduce the total withdrawal base by an amount equal to the greater of:  �


1)
the excess gross partial withdrawal amount; and  �


2)
a pro rata amount, the result of (A / B) * C, where:  �


�
A
is the excess gross partial withdrawal (the amount in excess of the maximum annual withdrawal amount remaining prior to the withdrawal);  �


�
B
is the policy value after the maximum annual withdrawal amount has been withdrawn, but prior to the withdrawal of the excess amount; and  �


�
C
is the total withdrawal base prior to the withdrawal of the excess amount.  The following demonstrates, on a purely hypothetical basis, the effects of partial withdrawals under the guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit.  When a withdrawal is taken, two parts of the guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit can be affected:  �


1.
Total withdrawal base (�TWB�)  �


2.
Maximum annual withdrawal amount (�MAWA�)  This Supplement must be accompanied or preceded  by the Statement of Additional Information for the  Advisor�s Edge� NY Variable
Annuity dated May�1, 2007 


Example 1 (�Non-Excess� Withdrawal):  Assumptions:  �


You
= Owner and Annuitant, or younger of annuitant and annuitant�s spouse if joint life option is elected for additional cost, age 55 on rider issue; age 65 at time withdrawals
begin, which means the Income Benefit Percentage is 4.5%.  TWB at rider issue = $100,000  TWB at time withdrawals begin = 100,000  4.5% withdrawal (�WD�)
beginning 10 years from the rider date would be $4,500 (4.5% of the then-current $100,000 total withdrawal base)  �


WD
= $4,500  Excess withdrawal (�EWD�) = None  Policy Value (�PV�) = ��������$90,000 in 10 years  Is any portion of the withdrawal greater than the maximum annual withdrawal amount?  No.
There is no excess withdrawal under the guarantee if no more than $4,500 is withdrawn.  Result. In this example, because no portion of the withdrawal was
in excess of $4,500, the total withdrawal base does not change.  Example 2 (Excess Withdrawal):  Assumptions:  �


You
= Owner and Annuitant, or younger of annuitant and annuitant�s spouse if joint life option is elected for additional cost, age 55 on rider issue; age 65 at time withdrawals
begin, which means the Income Benefit Percentage is 4.5%.  TWB at rider issue = $100,000  TWB at time withdrawals begin = $100,000  4.5% WD beginning 10 years from the
rider date would be $4,500 (4.5% of the then-current $100,000 total withdrawal base)  �


WD
= $10,000 


EWD
= $5,500 ($10,000 - $4,500) 


PV
= $90,000 in 10 years  Is any portion of the total withdrawal greater
than the maximum annual withdrawal amount?  Yes. $10,000 - $4,500 = $5,500 (the excess withdrawal amount)  NOTE. For the guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit, because there was an excess withdrawal amount, the total withdrawal base needs to be adjusted and a new
lower maximum annual withdrawal amount must be computed. Had the withdrawal for this example not been more than $4,500, the total withdrawal base would remain at $100,000 and the maximum annual withdrawal amount would be $4,500. However, because an
excess withdrawal has been taken, the total withdrawal base and, consequently, the maximum annual withdrawal amount, will decline.  �
2 


New total withdrawal base:  Step One. The total withdrawal base is reduced by the amount of the excess withdrawal or the pro rata amount, if greater.  Step Two. Calculate how
much the total withdrawal base is affected by the excess withdrawal.  �


1.
The formula is (EWD / (PV � 4.5% WD)) * TWB before any adjustments  �


2.
($5,500 / ($90,000 - $4,500)) * $100,000 = $6,432.75  Step Three. Which
is larger, the actual $5,500 excess withdrawal amount or the $6,432.75 pro rata amount?  $6,432.75 pro rata amount.  Step Four. What is the new total withdrawal base upon which the maximum annual withdrawal amount is based?  $100,000 - $6432.75 = $93,567.25  Result. The new total
withdrawal base is $93,567.25  New maximum annual withdrawal amount:  Because the total withdrawal base was adjusted (as a result of the excess withdrawal) we have to calculate a new
maximum annual withdrawal amount that will be available starting on the next January�1st. This calculation assumes no more activity prior to the next
January�1st.  Step One. What is the new
maximum annual withdrawal amount?  $93,567.25 (the adjusted total withdrawal base) * 4.5% = $4,210.53  �


Result.
Going forward, the maximum you can take out in a year is $4,210.53 without causing an excess withdrawal that would further reduce of the total withdrawal base.

Item�27.
Number of Contract Owners  � As of September 28, 2007, there were 37 Contract owners.  �


Item�28.
Indemnification  � The New York Code (Sections 721 et. seq.) provides for permissive indemnification in certain situations, mandatory indemnification in other situations, and prohibits indemnification in certain situations. The
Code also specifies procedures for determining when indemnification payments can be made.  � Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Depositor pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise,
the Depositor has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification
against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Depositor of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered), the Depositor will, unless in the opinion of its counsel
the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of
such issue.
