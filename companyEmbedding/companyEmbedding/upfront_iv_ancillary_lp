DSM buys Upfront's Rhobust chromatography tech

By Gareth MacDonald+Gareth MACDONALD 05-May-20102010-05-05T00:00:00ZLast updated on 05-May-2010 at 13:32 GMT2010-05-05T13:32:54Z

    XD, EBA, DSM, Upfront



 DSM Biologics says combining its XD platform with newly-acquired Rhobust chromatography platform will create high yield, low cost bio-manufacturing option.
 


 
The US-based DSM unit has had its eye on the platform since September 2007
 when it provided former owner, Danish purification technology specialist Upfront Chromatography, with funding to further its development.Financial terms of the acquisition have not been disclosed although it is understood that DSM will continue to work with customers that already use the technology.Rhobust is an expanded-bed absorption (EBA) technology in which cross-linked tungsten carbide and agarose beads create a purification surface designed to improve recovery yields during bio-processing.The enhanced purification capacity offered by Rhobust has significant application in the field of high density bio-production according to DSM VP of global technology Rolf Douwenga. He explained that the XD platform’s ability to operate at densities of 200m cells per ml and produce, for example, up to 27 grams of antibody per litre has created a need for downstream technologies able to match this capacity. “With the Rhobust technology we can address this issue, and we are constantly broadening our technology portfolio for an even more effective bio-manufacturing process."DSM Biologics president Karen King also stressed the benefits of the bringing the technologies together for the bio-processing industry.  


She suggested they “will provide an integral package combining high titre, high yield processing with efficient downstream processing leading to lower manufacturing costs." And, while King did not say where Rhobust will be applied, it is likely it will be used at contract bio-manufacturing plant DSM is developing in Queensland, Australia
, given that production at the facility will utilise the XD platform.
