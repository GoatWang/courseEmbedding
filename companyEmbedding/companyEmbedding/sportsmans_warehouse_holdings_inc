Buy the Top Fishing Gear You Need Here Find the Fishing Gear You Need Pulling in a trophy catch this summer is easy once you have the right fishing equipment. Tackling your next big trip is impossible without the proper planning, preparation, and fishing supplies. Whether you want to catch fish in the lake close to home or the deep sea, Sportsmanâs Warehouse has the fishing tools to ensure that youâre landing one right after another. With the largest supply of fishing accessories available, youâll always be prepared when heading out on the water. No matter what fishing gear youâre looking for, Sportsmanâs Warehouse has it. Fishing Rods Take on the biggest species or just opt to catch tonightâs dinner with the correct fishing pole. Sportsmanâs Warehouse offers spinning rods by the top manufacturers. Sort top fishing poles by brand, product type, or price point to discover the pole that best fits your style. If casting rods are more your speed, check out the wide selection of poles with advanced technology. The powerful yet sensitive rods allow you to detect steelhead and rainbow salmon the instant they nibble on your bait. And, with features like corrosion resistant stainless steel, aluminum oxide inserts, and specialized grips, youâre guaranteed top-of-the-line performance. Of course, you can always take a different approach by selecting a trolling rod or fly rod. Choose from individual rods or package deals when you pick out your new fishing gear from Sportsmanâs Warehouse. Bait As with any other fishing gear, having the right product adds to your success. Lipless baits, crankbaits, jigging spoons, and more are all available for bargain prices. Find a variety of inline spinners or just shop for top water baits. Whichever species youâre aiming for, Sportsmanâs Warehouse has the right rig for the occasion. Take advantage of the side-to-side lure action when fishing for walleyes, or grab an ice fishing piece for your trip during the chillier months. The scents and flavors of your newest pickup will leave you with more fish than you can handle. Fishing Accessories Packing up for a day on the ice or in the boat is about more than just your fishing equipment. Coolers, augers, tents, and cameras help to make your experience unforgettable. Sportsmanâs Warehouse delivers all the fishing gear necessary to keep you comfortable and successful for another long day out in the sun. From clothing to tackle storage, youâve got everything you need to be the expert in your fishing group. Boat Accessories Check out a new downrigger or invest in an electric line puller to make the most of your adventure. Your boat is safe from damage thanks to Short-Stop technology and stainless-steel construction. And, since fishing is the top priority, many downriggers even emit positive ions to neutralize suspicion and create an appealing atmosphere to all the underwater species. Fish finders, marine radios, and flashers are also available for the diehard anglers. Thereâs no such thing as having too much of an advantage. Navigate the lake on the prowl for another big trophy catch. The latest up-to-date maps and GPS chartplotting are just two more features that help turn your typical day on the water into a fish fest worthy of bragging about. Fishing Tools Everyone needs a basic set of pliers. Find your newest go-to pair and add a set of fish grips or scissors to your haul. Scales, fishing nets, and filet knives should also be considered must-haves for every weekend warrior. You wonât beat the durability and affordability of the fishing equipment at Sportsmanâs Warehouse. Get Started Today The water is waiting for you to find high-end fishing equipment at Sportsmanâs Warehouse this season. Pick up a new rod and reel and head to your favorite spot with confidence. Itâs never been easier thanks to an endless supply of the worldâs top fishing gear right at your fingertips. Select the brand and style you want for a basement price and join the fun today. Thereâs no better feeling than reeling in your first big catch of the year. Equip yourself with the proper fishing tools to make this year your best season ever. With a wide range of fishing gear, supplies, and tools, youâre never far away from bringing home a great catch.

Premier Ammo for Rifles, Shotguns, and HandgunsWhen you need to purchase ammo for your next hunting expedition, keep in mind what youâre hunting when choosing rounds. It can depend on the hunting environment and conditions, whether the animal you plan to hunt is a deer or much smaller birds, and their escape patterns from danger. Set the right tone for your hunting trips with high-quality ammunition that performs, so your only worry is your accuracy.Hunting With a RifleWith a rifle, youâll be hunting game from longer distances than one would with a shotgun or handgun, so each round is streamlined and thinner to travel further and intended to cleanly penetrate the intended target. The exact rifle ammunition you buy will depend upon the caliber of your gun, but the most common rifle ammo for hunting are hollow-point rounds, similar to these Hornady .223 bullets.Hollow-point rounds will humanely put down your target without going through and potentially hitting anything beyond. Select a caliber that you can handle, while at the same time being sufficiently high enough to hit and stop game youâre hunting.Another popular hunterâs choice is Federal; their line of ammo is suitable for both hunting and range practice. Federal rounds, especially .30-06 rounds, are renowned for having the power to stop game like deer from over 300 yards.For those wishing to practice before going out to hunt, we recommend using full metal jacket rounds. FMJ are best suited for target practice instead of hunting live game.Hunting With a ShotgunShotgun ammunition is available either in shot or slug form, with the one you use depending on the game. Shot pellets increase the chance youâll hit your relatively close target, but reduces the effective firing distance between you and any game. Shot is primarily used for skeet shooting and game fowl. We carry several high-performance shotshells from brand names such as Hornady, Winchester, and Kent.Sportsmanâs Warehouse also sells slug ammo, like the Winchester Super-X for .12 gauge. Slug shot is useful for hunting upland birds and larger game, like deer.Hunting With a HandgunHandguns are ideal for closer contact situations, usually with bigger game like deer or wild hogs, due to the increased caliber needed. Hunting with a handgun is about quietly getting much closer to your target and firing with accuracy to hit your quarry and put it down.Some hunters use handguns to increase challenge of hunting, since handguns lack long-range accuracy. HSM is a top brand that is known to not misfire or misfeed. Also, HSM doesnât foul up the chamber, even with multiple reloads, leaving your gun fairly clean. Â When it comes to handgun ammunition, look for accuracy and for one that packs a punch. Just remember that very few semi-automatic handguns are well-suited for hunting, typically lacking both the power necessary and proper sightline. Specially designed hunting handguns are available that feature elongated barrels.Some of the more powerful semi-automatic pistols have been used for hunting medium to large game, particularly 10mm Auto, .41 Magnum, .44 Magnum, and .50 AE.If you are keen to continue practicing before your big hunting trip, CCI works well for practice or recreational shooting. This ammo offers consistent performance at a competitive price, along with reloadable, newly manufactured brass cases, non-corrosive primers, and full metal jacket rounds.Keep Your Ammo SafeOnce youâre stocked up on ammo, you need a place to keep it all safe and out of the elements until youâre ready to use it. Buy an ammo box and ensure that each round is kept in perfect condition during transport and storage. We offer boxes that can hold a variety of ammo together, or a bunch of the same size rounds.Buy Premier Ammo NowSportsmanâs Warehouse only sells premier, brand name ammunition that will perform flawlessly time after time. We offer shipping all over the U.S., including Hawaii and Alaska. Stock up on the ammo you need for your rifle, shotgun, or handgun and never run low right before a big trip. Call 800-286-3076 or email us if you have any questions about our products.

        MIDVALE, Utah, July 18, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sportsman's Warehouse (NASDAQ:SPWH) is expanding its operations to include new retail stores in the following two locations:

          Sheridan, Wyoming;
        

          Walla Walla, Washington
        

        The location in Sheridan, Wyoming will be the fifth Sportsman's Warehouse store in the state of Wyoming and will be located at the intersection of Brundage Lane and Wetlands Drive in Sheridan.  The store in Walla Walla, Washington will be located in the Walla Walla Town Center and will be the twelfth location in the state of Washington. Both of these locations will be our smaller format stores. It is anticipated that these stores will open in the first half of 2018.  After these planned openings Sportsman's Warehouse will operate 89 stores in 22 states. 
      

        These stores will feature an extensive selection of hunting, fishing and camping gear, as well as a wide range of apparel and footwear.  As with all Sportsman's Warehouse locations, the store will also feature instruction, seminars and special events related to outdoor activities.
      

        'We are excited to further expand our presence in states we know very well. These new markets have a large user base that is currently under served through existing retailers,' noted John Schaefer, Sportsman's Warehouse CEO. 'The additions of these stores keep with our business plan, promoting stable growth that will benefit our company, our vendors, and most importantly, our loyal customers for many years to come.  To further expand in existing states, signifies our continued strength in the west. Each of these areas has a strong outdoor heritage, and we plan to become an active, contributing partner in each of these great communities.'
      

        Sportsman's Warehouse serves outdoor enthusiasts, casual users and first time participants with quality brand-name hunting, fishing, camping and shooting merchandise within a convenient shopping environment, serviced by passionate, knowledgeable associates to create a memorable outdoor experience. To find the Sportsman's Warehouse nearest you or to shop online, visit us on the Web at www.sportsmanswarehouse.com.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.
