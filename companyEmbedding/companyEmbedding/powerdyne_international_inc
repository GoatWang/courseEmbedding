PDI Power Solutions









PDI Power Solutions

Every PDI Power Solution will be a customized generator set that is designed to meet the client’s unique power requirements including the option for cogeneration (CHPC) and also has the ability to run independent of the grid thus forming an onsite microgrid.
This is accomplished by using a modular design for the integration of all the components of each system. The typical PDI Power Solution is composed of a (gaseous) engine, a high efficiency alternator, a controller for remote diagnostics, monitoring and control of a parallel generator system and a modified cooling system, (options heat exchanger or chiller). All of this is packaged in a secure weather proof/sound attenuated enclosure.


PDI genset also allows application flexibility. These will include:


 Emergency & standby power
 Continuous duty prime power
 Peaking power
 Distributed power – system sited at the user facility
 Cogeneration/CHP
 Energy Management System (EMS)
                                        

For cogeneration capabilities CHPC (combination heat/power/cooling) a closed loop cooling system is added to the generators with the addition of a heat exchanger and/or chiller. The heat exchanger produces hot water which allows for the preheating of hot water and or steam for heat. The chillers provide the cooling for support of air conditioning or refrigeration needs.
PDI will acquire all the components needed to make a PDI Power Solution and either have them assembled at the generator manufacturing facility or integrated at the client’s site. The modular design approach and interchangeable components allow any element to be switched out as newer more cost effective technology becomes available. PDI believes this gives it the competitive advantage by upgrading a PDI Power Solution with new technology at the customer’s facility without the need of replacing the entire system.

About Powerdyne International Inc.

Powerdyne International Inc. (PDI) is a publicly traded corporation and was organized to provide independent, cost efficient primary electrical power. PDI will materially reduce the complexities of electric power requirements with focus on cost savings and a guarantee of power quality for the user.
Powerdyne International Inc. leases self-contained electrical generation units, the PDI Power Solution. Every PDI Power Solution is a customized green generator set designed to meet the client’s unique power requirements including the options for cogeneration (CHPC) and micro grids.
PDI is staffed by individuals with experience in manufacture, marketing and sales of quality, renewable power systems. In addition for compliance and greater market acceptance the PDI Genset would use only gaseous fuels – natural gas and propane would dominate.


PDI Power Solutions marketability extends into multiple markets that include:


 Healthcare
 Manufacturing – light and heavy, i.e. paralleled units
 Commercial
 Government
 Transportation centers, i.e., airports
 Data Centers – multimegawatt systems
                                        

The electrical power market is vast and grid power dominates it. However, there are avenues open to providers such as PDI to bypass the grid and thousands of substations. There are users who have an interest in reducing dependency upon and/or elimination of the grid entirely. PDI enters as the total primary power provider, including flexibility with product customization and jointly acceptable long term power purchase agreements.

Powerdyne International, Inc: Producing Primary Electrical Power  Using Its Own Proprietary Technology  - Small Cap Reporter | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Small Cap Reporter's Bloglong/short equity, nano-cap, micro-cap, techSend Message|SmallCapReporterPlease Note: Blog posts are not selected, edited or screened by Seeking Alpha editors.Powerdyne International, Inc: Producing Primary Electrical Power  Using Its Own Proprietary Technology Apr.  8, 2014  5:15 PM ET|Includes: Powerdyne International, Inc. (PWDY)
The last five years have brought much more attention on the energy issues that the global economy faces. Certainly "alternatives" like solar, wind, and even ion power are options to take advantage of, in addition to their sustainability factor. But what if there was a way to have on-­‐ demand energy that's self-­‐sustained and off the grid so that anyone could turn on a light switch despite what the rest of a city, or even what the rest of a country encounters as far as power supply; or lack thereof?
With this next company, that can actually become a reality. Powerdyne International Inc. (OTC: OTCPK:PWDY) has a proprietary technology offering an independent electric utility to provide primary electric power, off the grid to mid sized and large commercial consumers. Powerdyne's product is a self-­‐contained generator that utilizes a modified radial air-­‐cooled aircraft engine to drive a 1-­‐ megawatt (MW) generator. This generator works off of almost any gaseous fuel source including propane, methane, ethane and even hydrogen.
Domestically, many cities have come accustomed to those summer months where the increased demand for power creates brownouts or even blackouts. In fact, a new report from the Wall Street Journal sites that the entire US power grid could be shut down for more than a month if just 9 of the over 55,000 electric substations placed throughout the nation were sabotaged by terrorists or other criminals. This report comes on the heels of several events that have occurred over the last year, most notably the sniper attack last April on the substation in San Jose, California knocked out 17 transformers. Many feared it could have been a sophisticated "dress rehearsal" for a more large-­‐scale attack.
The government has stated that it still needs stronger authority to regulate the power grid on a national level but regardless of regulation, the threat is real and The Journal's report is only the first time that these results of the study have been made public. More significantly, these substations are not required to be protected. In a CNN article, Jon Wellinghoff, former chairman to the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission had reportedly urged Congress "to fill a void in federal law that he says doesn't empower any federal agency to demand better security around electrical substations". According to Wellinghoff, these stations only have chain-­‐link fences and cameras for "protection"; what's more is that these cameras don't capture details outside of the fence.
"We need to have a national coordinated plan, and we have to have a federal agency that is in charge," Wellinghoff said.
As Washington fights for more regulation, the threat still remains and for Powerdyne's product, this becomes a huge offset to combat grid vulnerability. The company states, that its basic PDI unit produces
1MW of power 24/7 and has an expected operational life of 20,000 hours before rebuild or replacement of the prime mover; that's more than 2 years of power at a constant rate of usage. As far as ease of installation and transport, one unit (which measures 6 feet in diameter and 12 feet long) can be fitted comfortably inside a standard 8' x 8' x 40' shipping container box. This houses the unit on site for easy handling, as well as transport and delivery anywhere in the world.
There are several other competitors in this space including, Cummins (NYSE:CMI), Kohler, Detroit Diesel, and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) all of which manufacture generator sets. In an interview in September of last year, CEO of Powerdyne, Dale P. Euga expressed that though there is competition in the generator space, Powerdyne holds several advantages over its much more bulky competition. Not only do these competitors' typical units weigh more than 6 times that of Powerdyne's PDIGenset (90,000 pounds vs 14,000 pounds), these generators are much larger, measuring 18-­‐24 ft long, 8ft high, and 8ft wide (nearly the same size as PWDY's enclosure for it's generator).
Moreover, Mr. Euga stated that a special performance characteristic of the PDIGenset is that it can perform very efficiently in extreme cold temperatures and at high altitudes where-­‐as other technologies, especially diesel, find a deterioration in capability starting at altitudes over 4,000 feet. Most mining applications in South America for example, are above 5,000 feet and require multiple engines to drive one generator. Powerdyne is able to generate power at an inexpensive rate and at reduced costs to the client because the client does not have to buy any equipment; they just pay for the electricity.
In conjunction with this, Powerdyne has identified its client base as commercial users, mines, manufacturers and medical centers that have a minimum electrical base of 1MW or more. According to the company, the electricity produced by the PDIGenset is consumed in parallel with the main electrical source, usually the grid, and is used to augment total consumption, thus resulting in a savings of 20%-­‐50% annually compared to traditional means of power consumption.
I see military applications as a big niche for the company as well. Not only has this product been shown to be more compact and much lighter compared to its competition, but its versatility within various terrains also allows military clients to send this product on a multitude of missions including those in remote destinations.
In a recent Bloomberg article, the editor cites that defense spending or military expenditure will increase this year for the first time since 2009 mainly in Russia, Asia, and the Middle East. Over the last fiscal year of 2013, however, the United States remained the top spender with an estimated $582.4 billion spent. Major US defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp, and Boeing, lead this pack but what about the support systems and infrastructure needed to maintain military camps and bases? More importantly, these funds are not directed solely to wartime efforts either; from disaster relief, to humanitarian efforts, and self-­‐sustaining power for the developing world, the PDIGenset can provide a source of continuous, inexpensive energy which puts Powerdyne at the forefront of a brand new solution to an age old issue.
With such a vast array of uses, certainly PWDY has the product and the technology to provide opportunities for inexpensive, off-­‐grid energy. For many companies, that is half the battle. The second half is the leadership to push this to market and for Powerdyne, the team championing these efforts has a wealth of experience and industry foresight.
CEO and Chairman of the Board, Mr. Dale P. Euga has experience in the military, serving with the US Army's Special Forces A-­‐Team and
has a background in architecture with a degree from Boston Architectural College. These leadership qualities lead Mr. Euga to become the founder, builder, and manager of a successful architectural firm. Euga even formed ComVest International Inc. in 1988 to organize and manage international construction projects.
Mr. Euga also directly arranged acquisition and construction financing as well as oversaw the development of industrial, manufacturing and resort facilities in Panama, Netherlands, Belize, Bermuda and Spain; Euga also worked as the coordinator and overseer for the lenders. Powerdyne's CEO is incredibly versed in construction and knows the necessary components needed to complete a successful project. From 2002 until the formation of Powerdyne Inc., Mr. Euga had focused on independently developing the underlying product concepts related to the PDIGenset.
Operations Manager James O'Rourke brings more than thirty-five years of manufacturing experience to the rapidly-growing, development-stage, electrical generator manufacturer. His background in international heavy manufacturing is a good fit for Powerdyne, which sees huge potential in the foreign marketplace.
Lead Engineer and Vice President of Production Stephen L. Caromile, has a wealth of experience in the engineering field. He and Euga are currently designing Powerdyne's Series 3 prototype prime mover.
Caromile designed and engineered many of the PDIGenset's parts and drafted the master plans and specifications for the it's construction. Mr. Caromile's background in Process, Mechanical, Civil and Aeronautical Engineering (in which he was the Cell Manager overseeing the repair of aeronautical jet turbine components) brings first-hand knowledge of radial engines, as prime movers in electrical generators, to Powerdyne's stable of talent.
In conclusion, Powerdyne has a unique technology that allows for a compact, inexpensive, efficient solution not only to a problem and but even to an impending threat that the US faces. Moreover, the company has also identified that it can reach far beyond its domestic capabilities and aid developing areas in supplying a viable source of power that was once unattainable by any other means because the PDIGenset is easily accessible in many diverse locations. The company's leadership has an incredible wealth of industry expertise that should grant it to successfully push this product to market and continue to implement future enhancement allowing for the PDIGenset to remain at the forefront of off--‐grid power generation advancements.

Powerdyne International, Inc. in Final Negotiations for Lease Agreement


WARWICK, RI--(Marketwired - February 02, 2017) - Powerdyne International, Inc. (OTC PINK: PWDY) announced that it is in final negotiations with Energex Services, Inc. ("Energex") an energy company which explores and develops oil and gas fields. 
Powerdyne's management is currently finalizing an agreement to fulfill power requirements for certain Energex' projects. Once signed, the Company will release the agreement's details.
"We have come a very long way and are seeing all of our team's hard work come to fruition," said Powerdyne International's CEO, James O'Rourke. "We expect that this will be one of several projects Powerdyne will be involved in during 2017." 
Energex is an independent, integrated, crude oil and natural gas company with oil and gas wells in the continental United States. The company's strategy is to maximize the rate of return on investment of its capital by controlling capital and operating costs and maximizing reserve recoveries of oil and natural gas. Energex focuses on cost-effective use of advanced technology associated with four-dimensional seismic and micro-seismic data, the development of reservoir simulation models, the use of improved drill bits, mud motors and mud additives for horizontal drilling, formation evaluation and horizontal completion methods. These advanced technologies reduce the investment risks associated with oil and gas exploration, development and exploitation.
About Powerdyne International, Inc.:
Powerdyne International, Inc. (www.powerdyneinternational.com) provides power solutions designed to be installed in virtually any location worldwide. The Company's target customer typically uses the PDI Power Solution to produce its own primary or supplemental power which is useful in any situation where reliable and cost effective power is needed. 
Powerdyne is founded on the ability to produce primary and supplemental power using custom-built gas generators which produces electricity cheaper than existing means. The Company expects that the difference between its costs of generating electricity versus its customer's current cost will result in a substantial savings.

This release may contain "forward-looking statements" that are within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements reflect the Company's current expectations about its future plans and performance, including statements concerning the impact of marketing strategies, new product introductions and innovation, deliveries of product, sales, earnings and margins and include statements regarding the expected savings from generating electricity, the future revenue to be sufficient to fund its financing needs, . These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions and estimates which could be inaccurate and which are subject to risks and uncertainties including the risk that the revenue generated from operations is less than anticipated and not enough to fund the Company's financing needs. Actual results could vary materially from those anticipated or expressed in any forward-looking statement made by the Company. Please refer to the Company's most recent Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a further discussion of these risks and uncertainties.

Powerdyne International announces letter to the shareholders Warwick, RI – September 10, 2014 – Powerdyne International, Inc. (Ticker: PWDY) Dear Valued Shareholders, Since recently assuming the mantle of CEO at Powerdyne International, Inc., I am writing to personally update you about our company. We are quickly transitioning to better supply the immediate needs of the electrical power market; refocusing Powerdyne to emphasize sales versus development will position us to capture our share of a $50 billion plus dollar market. Our industry requires delivery of the highest quality, cost effective electricity both domestically and globally. Also, an ever increasing market demand for greener, more reliable electrical power is of paramount importance to our customers. To this end, Powerdyne offers a unique power solution that is both cost effective and proven for medium and large consumers of power, by utilizing independent power generation and cogeneration of heat, power and cooling (CHPC) as well as establishing micro-grid capabilities. These solutions can be offered at virtually no capital cost for power generating equipment which will be very attractive to companies with limited capital budgets. Building a sales channel is paramount. This will be achieved by establishing a very focused marketing and sales force. It is imperative that marketing and sales will be customer specific as the cost of delivered electricity varies greatly from state-to-state, city-to-city and even within cities. Our marketing studies have identified the following territories which have higher electrical costs and reliability issues. We will extensively focus our marketing and sales efforts on New England, California and the Caribbean Basin, quickly followed up by Alaska and Northern Canada. Powerdyne is in the process of bringing on experienced Product Representatives which already have established customer bases in these territories, enabling us to quickly begin marketing, educating, and selling the PDI Power Solution. In addition, we know that diesel generator sets are now being replaced by more environmentally friendly and efficient gas generators in this rapidly growing market. We are effectively positioned to seize this opportunity to enter the custom-built $50 billion plus dollar gas powered generator market using custom-built generators manufactured to PDI’s specifications. This will quickly give Powerdyne the ability to mitigate utility outages by selling electricity directly to the customer giving them stability and cost savings. The Company will continue its R&D efforts to evaluate other technologies such as the radial, rotary and turbine prime movers as well as other emerging technologies including alternative fuel types in order to gauge their viability and potential cost effectiveness. I want to thank each you for your continued support of Powerdyne International, Inc. Now is the time where we will begin to build a fully operational and profitable company. The next few months will be very exciting and I am confident that your belief in our vision of providing greener more reliable and cost effective power for the 21st Century will be greatly rewarded.
