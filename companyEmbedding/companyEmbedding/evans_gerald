WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--HanesBrands (NYSE: HBI), a leading marketer of everyday branded basic 
      apparel, today announced that it has promoted Gerald W. Evans Jr. to 
      chief operating officer effective Aug. 1, 2013.
    


      Evans, 54, who has served as the company’s co-chief operating officer 
      since 2011, will have responsibility for the day-to-day running of the 
      company with direct oversight of all global commercial and supply chain 
      operations. Evans, whose leadership assignments during a 30-year career 
      at HanesBrands has spanned the organization in marketing, sales and 
      general management, has been instrumental in the development of the 
      company’s Innovate-to-Elevate strategy that leverages the company’s 
      powerful brands, product innovation and global low-cost supply chain to 
      enhance margins.
    

      “I am pleased to announce Gerald’s promotion to COO,” said Hanes 
      Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard A. Noll. “Gerald has 
      widespread experience in the apparel industry, a proven global track 
      record of achievement, and immense respect as a leader within our 
      organization. We are looking forward to continuing our success under his 
      operating leadership.”
    

      Each of the company’s commercial business segments and its global supply 
      chain will report to Evans. In a newly created position to focus on 
      international performance and growth with worldwide retailers, William 
      J. Nictakis will report to Evans as chief commercial officer, 
      international businesses and global retailers. Other direct reports to 
      Evans include W. Howard Upchurch, president, innerwear; John T. Marsh, 
      president, activewear; and Michael E. Faircloth, president, chief global 
      operations officer.
    

      Evans’ career at HanesBrands began in 1983 in L’eggs marketing, and he 
      has since held leadership positions of increasing responsibility across 
      the organization in marketing, sales, and general management. Early in 
      his career, he served assignments leading the L’eggs sales function and 
      companywide Walmart selling team, and he then successfully held general 
      management roles in the 1990s, including serving as president of the 
      company’s hosiery and intimate apparel business in Australia while based 
      in that country. In the early 2000s, his assignments included running 
      the company’s U.S. activewear, knit underwear and sock businesses.
    

      After the company’s spinoff in 2006, Evans led the reconfiguration of 
      the company’s global supply chain into a low-cost operation balanced 
      across the Western Hemisphere and Asia. He also ran Asia commercial 
      business development. Before becoming co-chief operating officer in 
      2011, he served as co-operating officer, president international. Evans 
      earned his bachelor’s degree and MBA from the University of South 
      Carolina. He serves on the executive committee of the American Apparel & 
      Footwear Association’s board of directors.

Description

                    This textbook presents methodologies and applications associated with multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA), especially for those students with an interest in industrial engineering. With respect to methodology, the book covers (1) problem structuring methods; (2) methods for ranking multi-dimensional deterministic outcomes including multiattribute value theory, the analytic hierarchy process, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), and outranking techniques; (3) goal programming,; (4) methods for describing preference structures over single and multi-dimensional probabilistic outcomes (e.g., utility functions); (5) decision trees and influence diagrams; (6) methods for determining input probability distributions for decision trees, influence diagrams, and general simulation models; and (7) the use of simulation modeling for decision analysis.
This textbook also offers: * Easy to follow descriptions of how to apply a wide variety of MCDA techniques * Specific examples involving multiple objectives and/or uncertainty/risk of interest to industrial engineers * A section on outranking techniques; this group of techniques, which is popular in Europe, is very rarely mentioned as a methodology for MCDA in the United States * A chapter on simulation as a useful tool for MCDA, including ranking & selection procedures. Such material is rarely covered in courses in decision analysis * Both material review questions and problems at the end of each chapter . Solutions to the exercises are found in the Solutions Manual which will be provided along with PowerPoint slides for each chapter. The methodologies are demonstrated through the use of applications of interest to industrial engineers, including those involving product mix optimization, supplier selection, distribution center location and transportation planning, resource allocation and scheduling of a medical clinic, staffing of a call center, quality control, project management, production and inventory control,and so on.
Specifically, industrial engineering problems are structured as classical problems in multiple criteria decision analysis, and the relevant methodologies are demonstrated.show more
