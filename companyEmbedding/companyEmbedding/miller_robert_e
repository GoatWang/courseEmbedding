Miller Products





And the more you learn about our manufacturing process, the more you'll see that no other heating and cooling manufacturer compares to Miller's product quality. While other companies test products at random, we use 100% computer-automated testing on every Miller product to eliminate human error in the final analysis of product quality. We are the only heating and cooling manufacturer to be certified in Demand Flow Technology™. With more than 90 years of experience in the manufactured housing industry, it is easy to see why most new manufactured homes are built with Miller heating systems, and when applicable, are equipped with Miller cooling systems, too.

Welcome
Miller R/C Products offers precision-engineered starting products for model airplanes, helicopters and boats.  Miller R/C is known world-wide for outstanding performance and enduring quality. 

For more than 30 years Miller R/C Products has been the answer to starting problems for thousands of demanding hobbyists around the world.
          
The outstanding performance of our starting inserts is the foundation of our success. Our inserts will not mar or damage your nose cones and will last 100 times longer than any other insert worldwide. 

Our Persuader Belt Reduction units are designed to start those big cubic inch engines. Big Grip starting cup and insert is engineered for larger nose cones (for the hobbyist to build their own starter or adapt to your purchased starter). Our ½ A Starter is used to start those small engines like .049, .051, and .09. Helicopter extension inserts and mounting back rubber inserts are available to fit different starters and different helicopter extensions. Miller R/C Products also has many miscellaneous inserts and products that have been developed through the years. 
If what you need is not available from Miller R/C Products, chances are we can custom-make it for you. See your favorite hobby dealer or contact Hap and Nancy Miller direct.            
We invite you to see for yourself what sets us apart.
