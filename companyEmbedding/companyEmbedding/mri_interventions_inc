Industry Partners





In April 2011, we entered into a co-development and distribution agreement with Brainlab, a leader in the image-guided surgery field.  Under the agreement, Brainlab serves as a co-distribution partner for the ClearPoint® system in the United States and Europe.  Brainlab’s well-established sales and support infrastructure in these territories expands the commercial reach of our ClearPoint products.  In addition, we established an exclusive relationship with Brainlab in the field of MRI-guided neurological drug delivery.
About Brainlab - Brainlab develops, manufactures and markets software-driven medical technology that supports targeted, less-invasive treatment. Brainlab technology drives collaboration between hospitals and clinicians from a wide variety of subspecialties—from neurosurgery and oncology to orthopedics, ENT, CMF and spine & trauma. This integration delivers better access to improved and more efficient treatment. Founded in 1989, the privately held Brainlab group has 5,260 systems installed in over 80 countries. Based in Munich, Germany, Brainlab employs 950 people, including 240 R&D engineers on the product development team, in 16 offices worldwide.





In May 2009, we entered into an exclusive co-development agreement with Siemens, the global market leader in MRI scanners, related to the development of hardware and software needed for MRI-guided, catheter-based ablation procedures to treat cardiac arrhythmias. In February 2014, we announced a significant new agreement with Siemens related to our ClearTrace® system. We believe our exclusive relationship with Siemens secures an important strategic market position for the ClearTrace system once product development is completed.
About Siemens Healthcare - Siemens Healthcare is one of the world's largest suppliers to the healthcare industry and a trendsetter in medical imaging, laboratory diagnostics, medical information technology and hearing aids. Siemens offers its customers products and solutions for the entire range of patient care from a single source – from prevention and early detection to diagnosis, and on to treatment and aftercare. By optimizing clinical workflows for the most common diseases, Siemens also makes healthcare faster, better and more cost-effective. Siemens Healthcare employs some 51,000 employees worldwide and operates around the world. In fiscal year 2011 (to September 30), the Siemens Healthcare Sector posted revenue of 12.5 billion euros and profit of around 1.3 billion euros.





In connection with our research and development efforts for our ClearPoint and ClearTrace systems, we developed technologies that we believe can improve the MRI-safety profile of implantable medical leads, such as those used with cardiac pacemakers.  In 2005 and 2008, we entered into exclusive licensing and development agreements with Boston Scientific to enable it to incorporate these technologies into its neuromodulation and cardiac pacemaker products.  
About Boston Scientific - Boston Scientific is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties.

Strategic Alliance with Brainlab in MRI-Guided Drug Delivery
In April 2011, Brainlab and MRI Interventions announced a collaboration aimed at integrating our ClearPoint® product line with Brainlab’s iMRI product line, with particular focus on local delivery of drugs and other therapeutic agents to precision targets in the brain under MRI guidance. We and Brainlab both believe the integration of these technologies could, subject to appropriate regulatory clearance or approval, enable patient-specific treatment planning, simplified clinical workflows and optimal delivery of drugs to the brain.  
In connection with the announcement, Dr. Krystof Bankiewicz, Vice Chair and Professor, Department of Neurosurgery and Director of the NeuroTherapeutics Delivery Center at the University of California San Francisco made the following comment: “Direct, image-guided delivery of therapeutic agents into the brain provides the next generation platform for delivering a wide range of promising therapies for patients suffering from CNS disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and malignant brain tumors.  This collaboration between two important players in the field is welcome news to pharmaceutical companies, biotech companies and researchers with therapeutic agents that need to be delivered in a targeted, patient-specific, image-guided fashion.”
SmartFlow® Neuro Ventricular Cannula
In January 2011, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for our SmartFlow neuro ventricular cannula. Our SmartFlow cannula, which is compatible with our ClearPoint system, is an MRI-compatible injection and aspiration cannula. It is indicated for use in the injection of Cytarabine, which is a chemotherapy drug, or the removal of cerebrospinal fluid from the ventricles of the brain during an intracranial procedure. The SmartFlow cannula is a disposable device intended for single patient use only and is not intended for implant.

MRI Interventions Announces Record Second Quarter ClearPoint® System Procedures, And a 79% Year-Over-Year Revenue Increase
Jul 11, 2017
OTC Disclosure & News Service

                            
                                - 
IRVINE, Calif., July  11, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MRI Interventions, Inc. (OTCQB:MRIC) (the “Company”), today announced preliminary results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2017.
Reflecting accelerating utilization and an increasing number of ClearPoint sites, total revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was $2.0 million, compared with $1.1 million for the same period in 2016, a year-over-year increase of $872,000, or 79%. The Company also reported its ninth consecutive quarter of record procedures, at 162 ClearPoint Neuro Navigation System procedures for the second quarter, a 30% increase. This compares with 146 in the first quarter and 125 in the year-ago second quarter. ClearPoint disposable product sales were $1.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared with $1.0 million for the same period in 2016, representing an increase of $406,000, or 39%. ClearPoint reusable product sales were $457,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared with $36,000 for the same period in 2016. Reusable products consist primarily of computer hardware and software sales and historically have fluctuated from period to period. Frank Grillo, President and Chief Executive Officer of MRI Interventions, Inc., said: “We are very pleased to report further acceleration in the utilization of the ClearPoint System, leading to 162 procedures in the second quarter. This is our ninth consecutive quarter of record patient procedures. We also secured an additional three ClearPoint System sales, leading to a 79% increase in total revenue year-over-year as we further expand our penetration in the neurosurgery market. With an installed base of 50 sites and a strong new account pipeline, we remain focused on increased utilization of the ClearPoint System. We are finding strong success in a number of applications where ClearPoint offers compelling benefits to both surgeons and patients, including growing treatment markets such as laser ablation and deep brain stimulation.  “Also during the quarter, we completed a $13 million private placement, for which the registration statement was recently declared effective. We believe this offering funds the Company to cash flow break-even, as well as the commercialization efforts of our entry into new markets with unmet medical needs. These include the treatment of intra-cranial hemorrhagic stroke through our joint development agreement with Mayo Clinic, and the treatment of nonresectable pancreatic cancer tumors through our license and co-development agreement with Acoustic MedSystems.  Overall, we are very pleased with the results this quarter and we remain very excited about the future of the Company.”   The Company anticipates reporting its full second quarter results in early to mid-August. About MRI Interventions, Inc.Building on the imaging power of magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”), MRI Interventions is creating innovative platforms for performing the next generation of minimally invasive surgical procedures in the brain.  The ClearPoint Neuro Navigation System, which has received 510(k) clearance and is CE marked, utilizes a hospital’s existing diagnostic or intraoperative MRI suite to enable a range of minimally invasive procedures in the brain.

Overview

Nature, December 1977, highlights Dr. Paul Bottomley and colleagues' ground-breaking work in "Zeugmatography", later known as MRI.
Reprinted by permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd: Nature Magazine (Vol. 270 No. 5638) Copyright 1977

MRI Interventions, Inc. is a medical device company that develops and commercializes innovative platforms for performing minimally invasive surgical procedures in the brain and heart under direct, intra-procedural magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI guidance. Since our inception in 1998, we have focused on research and product development in the field of interventional MRI. From 1998 to 2002, we deployed significant resources to fund our efforts to develop the foundational capabilities for enabling MRI-guided interventions and to build an intellectual property position. In 2003, our focus shifted to identifying and building out commercial applications for the technologies we developed in prior years.
We have two product platforms. Our ClearPoint® system, which is in commercial use, is used to perform minimally invasive surgical procedures in the brain. Our ClearTrace system, which is still in development, will be used to perform minimally invasive surgical procedures in the heart. Both systems utilize intra-procedural magnetic resonance imaging to guide the procedures. Both systems are designed to work in a hospital’s existing MRI suite.
Our products are designed to provide a new, minimally invasive surgical approach for the benefit of large patient populations. Our ClearPoint system is designed to enable the delivery of therapies to treat certain neurological diseases. Our ClearTrace system is designed to deliver therapies to treat certain cardiac diseases. We believe that our two product platforms, subject to appropriate regulatory clearance and approval, will provide better patient outcomes, enable physicians and hospitals to treat more patients, and reduce costs to the healthcare system.
Advancing Patient Care.  Our product platforms are designed to enable physicians to see the target site, guide the surgical instrument to the site, deliver the therapy, monitor for adverse events and complications and confirm the desired results of the procedure, all under high resolution, intra-procedural magnetic resonance imaging. 
Providing Care for More Patients. We believe that our ClearPoint system may enable physicians to treat patients who otherwise may not be treated utilizing current surgical techniques.  In addition, by providing direct, intra-procedural visualization, we believe our ClearPoint system could reduce the amount of time needed to perform procedures and enable physicians to treat more patients in a given period of time.
Improving Utilization of Resources. We believe that use of our products may result in more efficient utilization of healthcare resources and physician time. Our product platforms are designed to work in a hospital’s existing MRI suite, which adds additional utility for an infrastructure investment that has already been made by the hospital. Further, we believe our intra-procedural visualization capabilities and streamlined workflows may increase procedure efficiencies.

MRI Interventions, Inc. Announces 2016 First Quarter Results
Company Sets Quarterly Records in Number of ClearPoint® Procedures and Disposable Product Revenues



















April 28, 2016 16:05 ET

 | Source: MRI Interventions, Inc.






IRVINE, Calif., April  28, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MRI Interventions, Inc. (OTCQB:MRIC) today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Revenues were $1.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, and $1.0 million for the same period in 2015, an increase of $384,000, or 38%, attributable to increases in the Company’s ClearPoint® system reusable and disposable products. ClearPoint disposable product sales for the three months ended March 31, 2016 were $1.1 million, compared with $840,000 for the same period in 2015, representing an increase of $264,000, or 31%. This increase was due primarily to a greater number of procedures performed using the ClearPoint system within a larger installed base for ClearPoint in the three months ended March 31, 2016, relative to the same period in 2015. ClearPoint reusable product sales for the three months ended March 31, 2016 were $262,000, compared with $137,000 for the same period in 2015.  Reusable products consist primarily of computer hardware and software bearing sales prices that are appreciably higher than those for disposable products and historically have fluctuated from quarter to quarter.   Gross margin on product revenues was 49% for the three months ended March 31, 2016, compared to 61% for the same period in 2015.  The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to: (a) an increase in the three months ended March 31, 2016, relative to the same period in 2015, in the allocation of indirect labor to production activities, commensurate with the Company’s transition from a focus on research and development to commercial activities; and (b) an unfavorable product mix related to reusable product sales. Research and development costs were $657,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, compared to $528,000 for the same period in 2015, an increase of $129,000, or 25%. The increase was due primarily to increases in the three months ended March 31, 2016, relative to the same period in 2015, in: (a) software development costs incurred in connection with the Company’s development of the next generation of the ClearPoint operating system; (b) compensation and recruiting costs related to new personnel; (c) project research costs undertaken in connection with government grants; and (d) licensing fees.  These increases were partially offset by: (i) an increase in the three months ended March 31, 2016, relative to the same period in 2015, in the allocation of research and development personnel costs to manufacturing in connection with the Company’s transition from a focus on research and development to that commercial activities; and (ii) a reduction in travel costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $2.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, compared to $2.3 million in the same period in 2015, a decrease of $314,000, or 14%. This decrease was attributable primarily to decreases in: (a) compensation costs, both cash and stock-based; and (b) professional fees.  Also contributing to the decrease was the allocation of costs, in the three months ended March 31, 2016, to manufacturing in connection with the Company’s transition from a research and development focus to commercial activities. These fluctuations were partially offset by an increase in other general and administrative costs such as public company and investor relations expenses.  During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company recorded a gain of $160,000, and during the same period in 2015, the Company recorded a loss of $783,000, from changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities associated with certain warrants the Company issued in the 2012 and 2013 private placement transactions. The Company’s operating loss for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $1.9 million, as compared with $2.9 million for the same period in 2015, an improvement of $1.0 million, or 34%. Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $2.0 million, as compared with $3.9 million for the same period in 2015, an improvement of $1.9 million, or 48%. Management’s Comments “We had another strong quarter of growth,” said Frank Grillo, President and Chief Executive Officer of MRI Interventions.  “Our technology was utilized in 122 procedures, and our disposable product revenue reached a new high of more than $1.1 million.  With two capital sales and an additional three sites starting evaluations, our installed base now consists of 45 hospitals, and interest continues to grow.  Word is out among surgeons and neurologists regarding our more patient friendly approach to deep brain stimulation, better accuracy during laser ablation, and precision in biopsy.  “Our efforts to reduce our cash utilization continue to payoff.  Our operating loss declined 34% from the first quarter of 2015, and our use of cash for operations declined 43%.  We continue to focus on growing our business efficiently, and we are achieving our goals. “This coming quarter, we have two of our largest trade shows of the year, where we will have the opportunity to show our technology to surgeons in hands-on workshops, in sponsored lectures and on the exhibit floor.  We believe these events will be a great opportunity to educate more surgeons regarding our technology and its positive impact on patient care. “With 31% growth in disposable revenue, adoption is clearly on the rise, and momentum continues to build. We believe our customers are realizing the benefits our technology brings to hospitals, physicians and their patients.” Teleconference Information Investors and analysts are invited to listen to a live broadcast review of the Company's 2016 first quarter financial results today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (1:30 p.m. Pacific Time) that may be accessed by visiting the Company's website at www.mriinterventions.com and selecting “Investors” / “News” / “IR Calendar.” The conference call may also be accessed at http://mriinterventions.equisolvewebcast.com/q1-2016.

MRI Interventions, Inc. Announces 2017 First Quarter ResultsDownload PDF
Company Achieves Quarterly Records for Revenue and ClearPoint® System Procedures
IRVINE, Calif., April  27, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MRI Interventions, Inc. (OTCQB:MRIC) (the “Company”) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.
2017 First Quarter and Recent Highlights Frank Grillo, President and CEO of MRI Interventions stated: “We are very pleased to begin 2017 with another quarter of record results. In addition to 44% revenue growth over the first quarter of 2016, we achieved: 
A record 146 procedures in the first quarter, our eighth quarter in a row of growth in procedure volume;
Two systems sales closed, three new systems evaluations initiated, and four accounts completed their first procedures with ClearPoint;
Installed base reached 49 accounts; and
Continued expense control and leverage of our resources, resulting in a 16% decrease in our use of cash to fund operations
 “This momentum has carried into the second quarter, where we see continued strength in neurosurgery procedure growth at our existing centers, and our pipeline for new accounts remains on track. We believe we have increased our market opportunities with two exciting new relationships. These relationships are intended to leverage and expand our MRI guided surgical platform into additional unmet medical needs, which include: 
Jointly with Mayo Clinic, designing and developing MRI-guided, minimally invasive therapies for stroke. The initial focus of the collaboration is the development and commercialization of a novel, MRI-guided product for the treatment of intra cerebral hemorrhage (“ICH”).
Jointly with Acoustic Medsystems, developing an innovative ablation technology and procedure for the treatment of locally advanced, non-resectable pancreatic cancer.
 “We believe continued growth in our core neuro-navigation business and these two new technology development agreements hold tremendous promise for our company. We look forward to further increasing utilization and broadening our product line to include additional therapeutic treatments where the power of MRI-guided imaging can bring value to patients, surgeons and hospitals.” Financial Results – Quarter Ended March 31, 2017 Total revenues were $2.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $613,000, or 44%, compared with $1.4 million for the same period in 2016. This increase was due primarily to an increase in the Company’s disposable product sales. ClearPoint disposable product sales increased $559,000, or 51%, to $1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared with $1.1 million for the same period in 2016. This growth in disposable sales reflected a record 146 ClearPoint Neuro Navigation System procedures performed in the 2017 first quarter. ClearPoint reusable product sales were $259,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared with $262,000 for the same period in 2016. Reusable products consist primarily of computer hardware and software bearing sales prices that are appreciably higher than those for disposable products and historically have fluctuated from period to period. Gross margin on product revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was 61%, compared to gross margin of 49% for the same period in 2016. The increase in gross margin was due primarily to product mix differences between the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 in the equipment configuration of hardware and software in ClearPoint systems sold during those respective periods. The increase in gross margin also reflected greater production efficiencies achieved during the three months ended March 31, 2017 due to higher sales and production volumes relative to the same period in 2016. Research and development costs were $558,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $657,000 during the same period in 2016, a decrease of $99,000, or 15%. The decrease was due primarily to decreases in personnel costs, professional fees and product development costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $2.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared with $2.0 million during the same period in 2016, an increase of $76,000, or 4%. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in personnel costs associated with additions to the Company’s clinical specialist group, and increased professional fees, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation costs. The Company’s operating loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 declined $580,000, or 30%, to $1.4 million, as compared with $1.9 million for the same period in 2016. During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded a loss of $93,000 and a gain of $160,000, respectively, resulting from changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, such derivative liabilities related to: (a) the issuance of warrants in connection with 2012 and 2013 private placement transactions; and (b) an amendment, in June 2016, of the Company’s note payable to Brainlab AG (“Brainlab”) to add contingent conversion terms and potential down round pricing protection of warrants issued in connection with that note as discussed further below. For the three months ended March 31, 2016, derivative liabilities were limited to the issuance of warrants in connection with the 2012 and 2013 private placement transactions. Net interest expense during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $213,000 and $345,000, respectively, a decrease of $132,000, or 38%. This decrease was due to the reduction of principal balances of the note payable to Brainlab, resulting from the restructuring of that note, and to holders of junior secured notes payable that were issued in 2014 (the “2014 Junior Secured Notes”), resulting from the conversion into equity of certain of those notes, both as described below. Reflecting the effects of these non-cash items, net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $1.7 million, as compared with $2.0 million for the same period in 2016. In April 2016, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with Brainlab under which a note payable to Brainlab in the principal amount of $4.3 million (the “Brainlab Note”) was restructured and, among other items, the Company: (i) entered into a patent and technology license agreement with Brainlab for software relating to the Company’s SmartFrame® device, in consideration for the cancellation of $1.0 million of the principal amount of the Brainlab Note; and (ii) issued to Brainlab, in consideration for the cancellation of approximately $1.3 million of the principal amount of the Brainlab Note, equity units, consisting of shares of the Company’s common stock and warrants to purchase shares of common stock. The restructured note matures on December 31, 2018. On June 30, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) with Brainlab, with respect to the Brainlab Note, under which the parties agreed that, in the event the Company closes a qualified public offering: (i) $500,000 of the principal balance of the note, plus all unpaid accrued interest on that amount, will automatically convert into the security offered in the qualified public offering; and (ii) the exercise price for 34,957 shares of common stock underlying warrants issued in connection with the note will be reduced as provided in the Amendment. On August 31, 2016, the Company entered into amendments with the two holders of the 2014 Junior Secured Notes that provided, in the event the Company were to close a private equity offering, for: (a) the conversion to equity of an aggregate of $1.75 million of principal based on the private offering price; and (b) a reduction in the exercise price for shares of common stock that may be purchased upon exercise of warrants issued in connection with the issuance of such notes based the private offering’s terms for warrant exercise pricing. On September 2, 2016, the Company completed a private equity offering, resulting in the principal conversion and reduction of the warrant exercise price described above. Reverse Stock Split As previously announced, on July 21, 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a 1-for-40 reverse stock split of its issued common stock, which was effectuated on July 26, 2016. All disclosure of common shares and per share data in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the reverse stock split for all periods presented.
