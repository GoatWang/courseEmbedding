(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is intended to help you understand Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure Investors LLC (the "Company"). The Company's MD&A should be read in conjunction with its consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, and with Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Statements" included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview We own and acquire high quality infrastructure and related equipment that is essential for the transportation of goods and people globally. We target assets that, on a combined basis, generate strong cash flows with potential for earnings growth and asset appreciation. We believe that there are a large number of acquisition opportunities in our markets, and that our Manager's expertise and business and financing relationships, together with our access to capital, will allow us to take advantage of these opportunities. We are externally managed by FIG LLC (the "Manager"), an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC ("Fortress"), which has a dedicated team of experienced professionals focused on the acquisition of transportation and infrastructure assets since 2002. As of December 31, 2016, we had total consolidated assets of $1.5 billion and total equity of $1.2 billion. In May 2015, the remaining capital commitments of the investors of the Onshore Fund, Offshore Fund and Master GP were called. Through a series of transactions, the Master GP contributed its rights to previously undistributed incentive allocations pursuant to the Partnership Agreement in exchange for the limited partnership interests in the Onshore Fund and the Offshore Fund equal to the amount of any such undistributed incentive allocations and 53,502,873 common shares were issued to the Onshore Fund and Offshore Fund based on their relative interests in the Company. In November 2015, the Onshore Fund and the Offshore Fund each distributed to their respective limited partners the common shares allocated to their limited partners in accordance with their respective limited partnership agreements. On May 20, 2015, we completed an IPO of 20 million common shares at a price to the public of $17.00 per share. On June 15, 2015, the underwriters exercised their overallotment option, pursuant to which we issued an additional 2.2 million shares to such underwriters at the IPO price. The Company has used and intends to use the net proceeds from the IPO, together with other sources of capital and liquidity, for the acquisition of new assets in the sectors the Company currently invests in, as well as to opportunistically acquire assets across the entire transportation and transportation-related infrastructure and equipment market. In addition, the Company may use such net proceeds for follow-on investments in existing assets, working capital and other general purposes. While our strategy permits us to acquire a broad array of transportation-related assets, we are currently active in four sectors where we believe there are meaningful opportunities to deploy capital to achieve attractive risk adjusted returns: aviation, energy, intermodal transport and rail. Commercial air travel and air freight activity have historically been long-term growth sectors and are tied to the underlying demand for passenger and freight movement. We continue to see strong demand for aviation related assets.   Within the energy infrastructure and transportation equipment market, we are focused on two sub-sectors: land-based infrastructure and offshore energy service equipment. Land-based infrastructure refers to facilities that enable the storage, unloading, loading and movement of crude oil and refined products from producers to end users, such as refineries. Customers of land-based infrastructure typically purchase capacity on a take-or-pay basis, and the economics of these assets directly relate to the volume of throughput. Offshore energy service equipment refers to vessels supporting the extraction, processing and transportation of oil and natural gas from deposits located beneath the sea floor. The recent oil price decline has led to oil and gas companies reducing and deferring spending decisions, creating an oversupply of offshore energy assets, and in turn, lower day-rates, utilization and earnings for offshore service companies. The intermodal transport market includes the efficient movement of goods throughout multiple modes of transportation, making it possible to move cargo from a point of origin to a final destination without repeated unpacking and repacking. Over the last year, the significant drop in commodity prices has led to a decline in new container prices which has led to lower lease rates and residual values. Rail refers to the railroad industry, which has increased its share of freight ton-miles compared to other forms of freight transportation over the past quarter century. This infrastructure, most of which was originally established over 100 years ago, represents a limited supply of assets and a difficult-to-replicate network. We continue to see increased volumes and efficiencies on our network since our investment in CMQR in 2014.

Investment Strategy
Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure Investors LLC invests across a number of major sectors within the transportation industry, including aviation, energy, intermodal transport and rail, and may pursue acquisitions in other areas as and when they arise in the future. In general, FTAI seeks to own a diverse mix of high quality infrastructure and equipment within its target sectors that generate predictable cash flows, in markets that we believe provide the potential for strong long-term growth and attractive returns on deployed capital. We believe that by investing in a diverse mix of assets across sectors, we can select from among the best risk-adjusted investment opportunities, while avoiding overconcentration in any one segment, further adding to the stability of its business. FTAI targets total returns, or IRRs, of 15% to 25% with the use of what we believe to be reasonable leverage.
Our broad investment mandate allows us to invest across the entire transportation and transportation-related infrastructure market while our permanent capital base allows us to be a buy-and-hold investor with very long term investment time horizons.
Our portfolio currently consists of assets in the aviation, energy, intermodal transport and rail market sectors.
Jefferson Terminal



As of March 31, 2017, FTAI owns approximately 60% of a multi-modal crude oil and refined products terminal in Beaumont, Texas called Jefferson Energy Company (“Jefferson Terminal”) which includes rail, truck, ship, storage and pipeline infrastructure. The Company’s Jefferson Terminal is currently capable of handling free-flowing crude oil and heavy bitumen, and is developing infrastructure to handle and store ethanol and refined products.



Aviation



To date, FTAI’s activity in the aviation sector has been focused on the commercial jet engine leasing market. FTAI has acquired engines either directly or in connection with the acquisition of commercial aircraft.
As of March 31, 2017, FTAI’s aviation portfolio includes 31 commercial passenger aircraft and 78 commercial jet engines.



Offshore Energy



Within the energy infrastructure and transportation equipment market, FTAI is focused on two sub-sectors: land-based infrastructure and offshore energy service equipment. Land-based infrastructure refers to facilities that enable the storage, unloading, loading and movement of crude oil and refined products or gas from producers to end users, such as refineries.
Offshore energy equipment refers to the assets used to support the production, processing and transportation of oil and natural gas from offshore (subsea) reserves. FTAI is currently targeting energy service equipment investments within this market, including inspection, maintenance and repair-related opportunities in countries that have a strong national oil company presence.
FTAI has three offshore energy investments, including one remote operated vehicle (“ROV”) support vessel, one Anchor Handling Tug Supply (“AHTS”) vessel, and one construction support vessel ("CSV").



Shipping Containers



The Intermodal Transport, or containerized, market includes the infrastructure and equipment that enables the efficient movement of goods via shipping containers throughout multiple modes of transportation, including trucking, shipping and rail. The Intermodal market includes infrastructure such as container seaports and inland terminals as well as equipment such as containers, chassis or trailers, generators sets, containerships, cranes and other loading equipment. To date, the Company has focused its investment activity on acquiring container boxes but it also considers other related opportunities across the sector, including in container seaports and terminals. As of March 31, 2017, FTAI’s intermodal portfolio includes 72,000 shipping containers and related intermodal equipment.



Central Maine & Quebec Railway



As of March 31, 2017, FTAI owns transportation infrastructure in the rail and energy sectors, including a multi-modal crude oil and refined products terminal in Beaumont, Texas with 300 tank railcars and a short line railroad that operates from Maine to Montreal.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

"Hannibal, an approximately 1600-acre property, is strategically located on the Ohio River in Monroe County, Ohio in the heart of the Marcellus/Utica region.  Like our other port and terminal assets, Jefferson and Repauno, Hannibal offers multiple logistics options including rail, truck and water and is located in a region with an abundance of low-cost gas.  FTAI is currently exploring a number of development options at Hannibal, including a combined cycle gas turbine electricity power generation plant and natural gas liquids storage, distribution and processing," said Joe Adams, FTAI's CEO.

Morgan will be the administrative agent and Barclays the syndication agent. The facility will be used for general corporate purposes including the funding of additional investments.  The facility matures in June of 2020 and bears interest at a variable rate on any drawn balance at the London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) plus 3.00%. The facility is currently undrawn.

WHY CHOOSE RESEARCH AND MARKETS?



WORLD'S LARGEST SELECTION




TRUSTED BY THE BEST




CUSTOMER FOCUSED




SAFE & SECURE







When I was placing my order I was unsure if my Visa card was authorised for the transaction and was unsure

                         if my payment would be successful.
One minute after I inserted the VISA for payment I had a call from Claire from Research and Markets outlining there was a problem with my card and offering me different solutions to overcome that issue.

It was a great customer experience that clearly surprised me in a very positive way. I shared the experience with some of my colleagues at the office. thanks for your quick and efficient service!
