	RISK FACTORS




	     

	An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You
	should consider the following risk factors carefully before deciding to purchase
	shares of our common stock.





	Risks Related to Our Business






	We have incurred significant losses



	.



	If we are unable to improve our financial
	performance, the price of our common stock will suffer.





	     We incurred losses of $61.1 and $19.9 million for the years ended December
	31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Although we have undertaken aggressive
	efforts to improve our profitability and increase our cash flows, it is
	possible that the steps we have taken will not be successful or of sufficient
	impact for us to achieve an acceptable level of profitability or positive cash
	flow. If we fail to do so, the price of our common stock will suffer.





	We expect our results of operations to vary from quarter to quarter and, as a
	result, we may not meet the expectations of our investors and stock analysts,
	which could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate or decline.





	     Our revenues and results of operations have fluctuated significantly in
	the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future. Accordingly,
	we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may
	be misleading. You should not rely upon the results of one quarter as an
	indication of future performance. Our revenue and operating results may fall
	below the expectations of securities analysts or investors in some future
	quarter or quarters. Our failure to meet these expectations could cause the
	market price of our common stock to decline.



	     Our quarterly revenue and operating results may vary depending on a number of factors, including:






	 




	




	 




	the type, timing and size of orders and shipments for major customers;






	 






	 




	




	 




	demand for and acceptance of our new product offerings, and
	returns or warranty costs from new product failures that exceed our
	established reserves;






	 






	 




	




	 




	delays in the implementation and delivery of our products and
	services, which may impact the timing of our recognition of revenue;






	 






	 




	




	 




	write-offs of receivables in excess of reserves;






	 






	 




	




	 




	variations in product mix and margins during any period;






	 






	 




	




	 




	inventory obsolescence;






	- 3 -








	Table of Contents








	 




	




	 




	development of new relationships and maintenance and
	enhancement of existing relationships with customers and strategic
	partners;






	 






	 




	




	 




	manufacturing or production difficulties;

	industry and economic conditions, including competition,
	industry standards, product certification requirements, trade
	restrictions and other regulations.








	The loss of one or more of our key customers could significantly reduce our revenues and profits.





	     We have derived, and believe that we may continue to derive, a significant
	portion of our revenues from a limited number of large customers. For the
	fiscal year ended December 31, 2002, our two largest customers accounted for
	17.7% of our net revenue and our five largest customers accounted for 29.7% of
	our net revenue. As of December 31, 2002, three customers represented 58%, or
	$45.0 million, of our total backlog of $77.4 million. Our customers may buy
	less of our products or services depending on their own technological
	developments and internal budget cycles. A major customer in one year may not
	purchase any of our products or services in another year, which may negatively
	affect our financial performance.





	Our products may contain defects that may be difficult or even impossible to
	correct. Product defects could result in sales delays, lost sales, delays in
	our collection of receivables and claims against us.





	     We offer technically complex products which, when first introduced or
	released in new versions, may contain software or hardware defects that are
	difficult to detect and correct. The existence of defects and delays in
	correcting them could result in negative consequences, including the following:






	 




	




	 




	delays in shipping products;






	 






	 




	




	 




	loss of market acceptance for our products;






	 






	 




	




	 




	product returns;






	 






	 




	




	 




	additional warranty expenses;






	 






	 




	




	 




	diversion of resources from product development;






	 






	 




	




	 




	loss of credibility with distributors and customers; and






	 






	 




	




	 




	lost sales.






	     Even though we test all of our products, defects may continue to be
	identified after products are shipped. In past periods, we have experienced
	various issues in connection with product launches, including the need to
	rework these products and stabilize product designs. Correcting defects can be
	a time-consuming and difficult task. Software errors may take several months
	to correct, and hardware errors may take longer. Such issues may result
	in sales delays, delays in the collection of receivables, and cancellation of
	orders, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial
	condition, and future business.

	Table of Contents







	We may accumulate excess or obsolete inventory that could result in
	unanticipated price reductions and write downs and adversely affect our
	financial condition.





	     Managing the proper inventory levels for components and finished products
	is challenging. In formulating our product offerings, we have focused our
	efforts on providing to our customers products with greater capacity and
	functionality, which requires us to develop and incorporate the most current
	technologies in our products. This approach tends to increase the risk of
	obsolescence for products and components we hold in inventory and may compound
	the difficulties posed by other factors that affect our inventory levels,
	including the following:






	 




	




	 




	the need to maintain significant inventory of components that are in limited supply;






	 






	 




	




	 




	buying components in bulk for the best pricing;






	 






	 




	




	 




	responding to the unpredictable demand for products; and






	 






	 




	




	 




	responding to customer requests for quick delivery schedules.






	     If we accumulate excess or obsolete inventory, price reductions and
	inventory write downs may result, which could adversely affect our business and
	financial condition.





	If we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary technology, our
	competitors may develop products substantially similar to our products and use
	similar technologies, which may result in the loss of customers.





	     We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as
	confidentiality, licensing and other contractual arrangements, to establish and
	protect the proprietary aspects of our products. Our efforts may result in
	only limited protection, and our competitors may develop, market and sell
	products substantially equivalent to our products, or utilize technologies
	similar to those we use. If we are unable to adequately protect our
	proprietary technology, these third parties will be able to compete more
	effectively against us, which could result in the loss of customers
	and adversely affect
	our business.





	Our products and other proprietary rights may infringe on the proprietary
	rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation.





	     Although we believe that our products do not infringe on any third partys
	patents, we cannot be certain that we will not become involved in litigation
	involving patents or proprietary rights. Patent and proprietary rights
	litigation entails substantial legal and other costs, and there can be no
	assurance that we will have the necessary financial resources to defend or
	prosecute our rights in connection with any such litigation. Responding to,
	defending or bringing claims related to our intellectual property rights may
	require our management to redirect our human and monetary resources to address
	these claims.





	A disruption in the manufacturing capabilities of our third-party manufacturers
	or suppliers would negatively impact our ability to meet customer demands.





	     We rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture and assemble our
	products. We also depend upon third-party suppliers to deliver components that
	are free from defects, competitive in functionality and cost and in compliance
	with our specifications and delivery schedules. Since we generally do not
	maintain large inventories of our products or components, any termination of,
	or significant disruption in, our relationship with our third-party
	manufacturers or suppliers may prevent us from filling customer orders in a
	timely manner.



	     We have occasionally experienced, and may in the future experience, delays
	in delivery of products and delivery of products of inferior quality from
	third-party manufacturers. Although alternate manufacturers and suppliers are
	available to produce our products and product components, the number of
	manufacturers or suppliers of some of our products and components is limited,
	and qualifying a replacement manufacturer or supplier could take several
	months. In addition, our use of third-party manufacturers reduces our direct
	control over product quality, manufacturing timing, yields and costs.
	Disruption of the manufacture or supply of our products and



	- 5 -








	Table of Contents





	components, or a third-party manufacturers or suppliers failure to
	remain competitive in functionality, quality or price, could delay or interrupt
	our ability to manufacture or deliver our products to customers on a timely
	basis, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.





	Force Majeure events, such as terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or war,
	and health epidemics may affect the markets in which our common stock trades,
	the markets in which we operate and our profitability.





	     Recent terrorist attacks and the war in Iraq have caused instability in
	the global financial markets, and contributed to downward pressure on
	securities prices of United States publicly traded companies.
	Future terrorist attacks or armed conflict, and epidemics, such as SARS, could
	result in economic, political and other uncertainties that could adversely
	affect our revenues and operating results, and further depress securities
	prices, including the price of our common stock. Terrorist attacks have
	disrupted the global insurance and reinsurance industries, and we may
	experience delays in renewing some insurance policies and may not be able to
	obtain insurance at historical levels for all of our facilities. Future
	terrorist attacks, armed conflicts and epidemics could affect our domestic and
	international sales, disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to produce
	and deliver our products. Such events could directly impact our physical
	facilities or those of our suppliers or customers, both in the United States
	and elsewhere. Our primary facilities include administrative, sales and R&D
	facilities in the United States, and manufacturing facilities in China. Acts
	of terrorism, wars and epidemics may make transportation of our supplies and
	products more difficult or cost prohibitive. Any impairment of our financial
	performance as a result of such events would increase the risk of
	non-compliance with the financial covenants under our senior secured credit
	facility and other lending arrangements, resulting in events of default and the
	possible acceleration of our indebtedness.





	Our results of operations could be harmed if our operating expenses do not
	correspond with the timing of our revenue.





	     Most of our operating expenses, such as employee compensation,
	manufacturing, and rental expense for properties, are either relatively fixed
	in the short-term or incurred in advance of sales. Moreover, our spending
	levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue. As a
	result, if revenue for a particular quarter is below expectations, we may not
	be able to proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter. A
	shortfall in revenue, therefore, could have a disproportionate effect on our
	expected operating results for that quarter and could cause the trading price
	of our common stock to decline.





	If we cannot manage the additional challenges presented by our international
	operations, our revenues and profitability may suffer.





	     We derived approximately 59% of our total net revenues from sales outside
	the United States, principally in Latin America and Europe, for the year ended
	December 31, 2002. We expect that international sales will continue to account
	for a significant percentage of our net revenue in the foreseeable future.
	Because a substantial percentage of our revenues are derived from foreign
	customers, we face numerous risks associated with conducting international
	operations, any of which could negatively affect our financial performance and
	results of operations. These risks include the following:






	 




	




	 




	we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that may change without notice;






	 






	 




	




	 




	our expenses related to sales and marketing and research and development may increase;






	 






	 




	




	 




	we are subject to various import/export restrictions, and
	import/export licenses may not always be available;






	 






	 




	




	 




	we are subject to foreign tariffs and other trade barriers;






	 






	 




	




	 




	some of the foreign countries that we deal with suffer from political and economic instability;






	- 6 -








	Table of Contents








	 




	




	 




	some of the foreign currencies that we deal with fluctuate
	significantly and are subject to inflationary pressures;






	 






	 




	




	 




	we may have difficulty staffing and managing our foreign
	operations;






	 






	 




	




	 




	there is a tendency for international payment cycles to be
	longer than for our North American operations;






	 






	 




	




	 




	we may have difficulty collecting accounts receivable; and






	 






	 




	




	 




	we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which
	may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that
	are not subject to similar regulations.
















	We are dependent on current management and key personnel. The loss of certain
	of these individuals could cause material harm to the operation and future
	prospects of our business.





	     Christopher Alexander, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive
	Officer, John W. Smolak, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and
	Administrative Officer, and Jairo Gonzalez, President of Hypercom Transactions
	Systems Group, are instrumental in the development, growth and operations of
	Hypercom. The loss of any of these key executives could have a material
	adverse effect on the operation and future prospects of our business.



	     We also believe our future success will depend largely upon our ability to
	attract and retain highly-skilled hardware and software engineers, managerial,
	and sales and marketing personnel. We compete against numerous companies,
	including larger, more established companies, for our personnel. We do not
	know if we will be successful in attracting or retaining skilled personnel.
	Further, the loss of certain key employees or our inability to attract and
	retain other qualified employees could negatively affect our financial
	performance.





	We have in the past and may in the future make acquisitions and strategic
	investments, which will involve numerous risks. We may not be able to address
	these risks without substantial expense, delay or other operational or
	financial problems.





	     We may acquire or make substantial investments in related businesses,
	technologies, products or services in the future. These acquisitions or
	investments involve various risks, such as:






	 




	




	 




	the difficulty of assimilating the technologies, operations
	and personnel of the acquired business, technology, product or
	service;






	 






	 




	




	 




	the potential disruption of our ongoing business, including
	the diversion of management attention;






	- 7 -








	Table of Contents








	 




	




	 




	the possible inability to obtain the desired financial and
	strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment;






	 






	 




	




	 




	the loss of key employees of an acquired business; and






	 






	 




	




	 




	the possibility of our entering markets and offering products
	or services with which we have limited prior experience.






	     Future acquisitions and investments could also result in substantial cash
	expenditures, potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, our
	incurring of additional debt and contingent liabilities, and amortization
	expenses related to other intangible assets that could adversely affect our
	business, operating results and financial condition. Our prior acquisitions
	have consumed and will continue to consume management attention and company
	resources, and will continue to require significant efforts and involve ongoing
	risks in the integration of these operations. To date, we have not achieved
	expected results from certain of our acquisitions. We will be dependent on the
	retention and performance of these businesses existing management and
	employees for the day-to-day management and future operating results of these
	businesses.




	Risks Related to the Industry






	The markets in which we compete are highly competitive, maturing, and subject
	to price erosion.





	     The markets in which we operate are maturing and highly competitive.
	Increased competition from manufacturers or distributors of products similar to
	or competitive with our products, or from service providers that provide
	services similar to our services, could result in price reductions, reduced
	margins and a loss of market share or could render our products obsolete.



	     We expect to continue to experience significant and increasing levels of
	competition in the future. With respect to our POS payment system products, we
	compete primarily on the basis of ease-of-use, product performance, price,
	features, quality, the availability of application software programs, the
	number of third-party network host and telecommunication system certifications
	we have obtained for our products and application programs, rapid development,
	release and delivery of software products and customer support and
	responsiveness. Software products compete on the basis of functionality,
	scalability, quality and support.






	 




	




	 




	In the POS terminal segment, our global competitors are
	Ingenico, a France-based company, VeriFone, Inc., a privately-held
	domestic company, and Lipman, an Israel-based company. In any
	particular market, we may also find ourselves in competition with
	local or regional manufacturers and distributors.






	 






	 




	




	 




	In the electronic cash register market, we compete with
	companies such as IBM, Siemens, NCR, ICL and Micros.






	 






	 




	




	 




	In the specialty network products niche of the marketplace,
	our primary competitors are Cisco, 3Com, Motorola and Suntec all of
	which are U.S.-based.






	 














	     We often face additional competitive factors in foreign countries,
	including preferences for national vendors and difficulties in obtaining
	necessary certifications and in meeting the requirements of government
	policies. Some of our competitors and potential competitors are more
	established, benefit from greater name recognition and have significantly
	greater resources than we do. Moreover, there are limited barriers to entry
	that could keep our competitors from developing products or services and
	technology similar to ours or from selling competing products or services in
	our markets.

	We are subject to industry and technology changes and are dependent on
	development and market acceptance of new products. If we are unable to
	adequately respond to these changes and to market demands in a timely manner,
	our business will not be successful.





	     The industry in which we operate is characterized by rapid changes in
	technology and numerous new product introductions. Our success, particularly
	in this industry, depends to a large degree upon our continued ability to offer
	new products and enhancements to our existing products to meet changing market
	and industry requirements. The introduction of new products and technologies
	by third parties could have an adverse effect on the sales of our existing
	products and technologies. We cannot be certain of our ability to
	successfully:






	 




	




	 




	identify, develop, or manufacture new products and technologies;






	 






	 




	




	 




	market or support these new products and technologies;






	 






	 




	




	 




	eliminate defects in new products;






	 






	 




	




	 




	control delays in introducing new products;






	 






	 




	




	 




	gain market acceptance for the new products and technologies; or






	 






	 




	




	 




	respond to technological changes, new industry standards, and
	announcements of new products by competitors.






	     Developing new products and technologies is a complex, uncertain process
	requiring innovation and accurate anticipation of technological and market
	trends. When changes to the product line are announced, we will be challenged
	to manage possible shortened life cycles for existing products, continue to
	sell existing products and prevent customers from returning existing products.
	Our inability to respond effectively to any of these challenges may have a
	material adverse effect on our business and financial success. We may suffer
	other business and financial losses if we are not successful in marketing new
	products and responding to industry changes and new product introductions or
	enhancements by our competitors.





	We are subject to extensive industry standards and government regulations. Our
	failure to properly comply with these standards and regulations could adversely
	affect our production and sales.





	     Our product sales are subject to a substantial and complex array of
	industry driven standards and governmental regulation, both domestic and
	foreign, including:






	 




	




	 




	industry standards imposed by EuroPay International,
	Mastercard International, VISA International, and others;






	 






	 




	




	 




	certification standards required for connection to some public telecommunications networks;






	 






	 




	




	 




	Federal Communications Commission regulations; and






	 






	 




	




	 




	Underwriters Laboratories regulations.






	     Our failure to properly comply with these standards and regulations could
	result in lost product sales, significant costs associated with required
	remedial measures or production stoppages, any of which could have a material
	adverse effect on our financial condition and future prospects.

	Risks Related to Our Common Stock






	Our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile. Your purchase of our
	stock will subject you to that volatility and to the risk of a substantial loss
	of your investment.









	     The market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue
	to be, volatile. When we or our competitors announce new customer orders or
	services, change pricing policies, experience quarterly fluctuations in
	operating results, announce strategic relationships, acquisitions or
	dispositions, change
	earnings estimates, experience government regulatory actions or suffer from
	generally adverse economic conditions, our stock price is often affected.
	Recently, companies similar to ours have experienced extreme price
	fluctuations, often for reasons unrelated to their performance.









	We are subject to anti-takeover effects of certain charter and bylaw provisions
	and Delaware law.





	     We have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which:






	 




	




	 




	make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control
	of us, and discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us;






	 






	 




	




	 




	may limit the price some investors are willing to pay for our common stock;






	 






	 




	




	 




	enable us to issue preferred stock without a vote of our stockholders or other stockholder action;






	 






	 




	




	 




	provide for a classified Board of Directors and regulate nominations for the Board of Directors;






	 






	 




	




	 




	make it more difficult for stockholders to take certain corporate actions; and






	 






	 




	




	 




	may delay or prevent a change of control.






	     These and other provisions of our charter documents, as well as certain
	provisions of Delaware law, could delay or make more difficult certain types of
	transactions involving a change of control of Hypercom or our management. As a
	result, the price of our common stock may be adversely affected.





	Our stock price could be affected because a substantial number of shares of our
	common stock are available for sale.









	     As of
	October 15, 2003, we had 49,822,048 shares of our common stock
	outstanding, all of which were eligible for trading on the New York Stock
	Exchange. We also had outstanding, as of October 15, 2003, options and warrants
	to acquire an additional 11,175,363 shares of our common stock. All of the
	shares underlying the outstanding options and warrants have been registered for
	resale. Future public sales of such common stock, or the availability of such
	shares for sale, including the shares subject to outstanding options and
	warrants, and the shares registered under this transaction, could adversely
	affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and impair our ability
	to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.









	We do not plan to pay any dividends on our common stock.





	     We do
	not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Our credit agreements restrict
	our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock.



	- 10 -








	Table of Contents






	Risks Related to Our Indebtedness






	Our indebtedness and the restrictions imposed by the terms of our debt could
	adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to respond to changes
	in our business.





	     As a result of the terms of our senior secured credit facility:






	 




	




	 




	our vulnerability to adverse general economic conditions and competitive pressures is heightened;






	 






	 




	




	 




	we are and will continue to be governed by restrictive
	covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios and
	limit our ability to, among other things, borrow additional funds,
	make capital expenditures, pay dividends, make investments, purchase
	our stock, consummate asset sales or conduct mergers and
	acquisitions;






	 






	 




	




	 




	our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in
	our business and industry will be limited;






	 






	 




	




	 




	we are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates because
	some of our debt obligations are subject to variable interest rates;
	and






	 






	 




	




	 




	our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for
	working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general
	corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired.






	     We cannot assure you that our leverage and such restrictions will not
	materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or
	capital needs or to engage in other business activities. In addition, we
	cannot assure you that additional financing will be available when required or,
	if available, will be on terms satisfactory to us. Further, even if we were
	able to obtain additional financing, we may be required to use proceeds to
	repay a portion of our debt.





	Our loan agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants and, if we are
	unable to comply with these covenants, we will be in default. A default could
	result in the acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness, which would have an
	adverse effect on our business and the price of our common stock.





	     Our senior secured credit facility contains customary covenants that
	require us to maintain certain specified financial ratios and consolidated net
	worth and restrict our ability to make certain distributions with respect to
	our capital stock, prepay other debt, or undertake various other corporate
	activities. For example, our senior secured credit facility contains covenants
	that, subject to specified exceptions, prohibit us from:






	 




	




	 




	incurring any additional indebtedness;






	 






	 




	




	 




	incurring or permitting to exist any additional liens on our assets;






	 






	 




	




	 




	engaging in a change of control transaction or other
	fundamental change, such as a merger, recapitalization or
	liquidation;






	 






	 




	




	 




	disposing of our assets, including equipment and inventory,
	outside the ordinary course of business;






	 






	 




	




	 




	prepaying or modifying the terms of our existing
	indebtedness, except in connection with a permitted refinancing;






	 






	 




	




	 




	redeeming or paying dividends or other distributions on our capital stock;






	 






	 




	




	 




	engaging in certain transactions with our affiliates;






	- 11 -








	Table of Contents








	 




	




	 




	failing to maintain specified levels of EBITDA and tangible
	net worth and ratios of senior debt and total debt to EBITDA; and






	 






	 




	




	 




	issuing or selling any prohibited preferred stock.






	     If we are unable to comply with any of these covenants, we will be in
	default, which could cause cross-defaults under other loans or agreements. A
	default, if not waived by our lenders, could result in the acceleration of our
	outstanding indebtedness and cause our debt to become immediately due and
	payable. If we were required to obtain waivers of defaults, we may incur
	significant fees and transaction costs. If waivers of defaults are not
	obtained and acceleration occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt and we
	may not be able to borrow sufficient additional funds to refinance this debt.
	Even if new financing is made available to us, it may not be available on
	acceptable terms.

	USE OF PROCEEDS




	     All net proceeds from the sale of the common shares covered by this
	prospectus will go to the selling stockholders who offer and sell their shares.
	We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common shares by the
	selling stockholders.












	SELLING STOCKHOLDERS




	     On August 18, 2003, George Wallner, a former director and affiliate of
	Hypercom, completed a private placement of 7,000,000 shares of our common stock
	to the selling stockholders named below. We agreed to register the resale of
	the shares of our common stock purchased in this private placement and bear the
	expenses incident to this registration. In connection with this agreement, we
	are registering for resale the shares of our common stock purchased by the
	selling stockholders in the private placement. The shares covered by this
	prospectus may be offered from time to time by the selling stockholders. The
	selling stockholders may sell all, some or none of their shares in this
	offering. See Plan of Distribution. The term selling stockholders
	includes donees, pledges, transferees or other successors in interest selling
	shares of common stock or interests therein received after the date of this
	prospectus from a selling stockholder as a gift, pledge, partnership
	distribution or other transfer.



	     In connection with this offering, we will pay the registration and filing
	fees, printing expenses, listing fees, blue sky fees, if any, and fees and
	disbursements of our counsel, but the selling stockholders will pay any selling
	commissions and similar expenses relating to the sale of the shares. In
	addition, we and Mr. Wallner have agreed to indemnify the selling stockholders,
	and certain affiliated parties against certain liabilities, including
	liabilities under the Securities Act, in connection with this offering. The
	selling stockholders have agreed to indemnify us and our directors and
	officers, as well as any person that controls us, against certain liabilities,
	including certain liabilities under the Securities Act.







	     The table below lists the selling stockholders and information regarding
	the beneficial ownership of our common stock by each of the selling
	stockholders. The amounts of shares set forth under Shares Beneficially Owned
	Before Sale Under This Prospectus and Shares Offered By This Prospectus are
	based on information obtained from the selling stockholders. Percentages are
	based upon 49,822,048 shares of our common stock outstanding as of
	October 15,
	2003. The amounts and percentages under Shares Beneficially Owned After Sale
	Under This Prospectus assume that all shares registered on behalf of the
	selling stockholders will be sold prior to completion of this offering, and
	that the selling stockholders will not acquire any additional shares of our
	common stock prior to the completion of this offering.







	     To our knowledge, none of the selling stockholders has had a material
	relationship with us within the past three years other than as a result of the
	ownership of our common stock.

	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION




	     The shares of common stock covered by this prospectus may be sold from
	time to time directly by the selling stockholders or, alternatively, through
	underwriters, broker-dealers or agents who may receive discounts, concessions
	or commissions from the selling stockholders or the purchasers of such shares.
	The shares covered by this prospectus may be sold in one or more transactions
	at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, at prices
	relating to the prevailing market prices at the time of sale, at varying prices
	determined at the time of sale, or at negotiated prices. Such sales may be
	effected in transactions (which may involve crosses or block transactions):






	 




	




	 




	on any national securities exchange or quotation service on
	which the Registered Securities may be listed or quoted at the time
	of sale;






	 






	 




	




	 




	in the over-the-counter market;






	 






	 




	




	 




	in transactions otherwise than on such exchanges or services or in the over-the-counter market;






	 






	 




	

	through the settlement of short sales.






	     In connection with sales of shares covered by this prospectus or
	otherwise, the selling stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with
	broker-dealers or other financial institutions, which may in turn engage in
	short sales of the common stock in the course of hedging the positions they
	assume. The selling stockholders may also sell the common stock short and
	deliver shares of common stock to close out such short positions, or loan or
	pledge shares of common stock to broker-dealers that in turn may sell such
	shares.



	     Information as to whether any underwriter that the selling stockholders
	may select, or any other broker-dealer, is acting as principal or agent for the
	selling stockholders, the compensation to be received by any underwriter that
	the selling stockholders may select or by any broker-dealer acting as principal
	or agent for the selling stockholders, and the compensation to be paid to other
	broker-dealers, in the event the compensation of such other broker-dealers is
	in excess of usual and customary commissions, will, to the extent required, be
	set forth in a supplement to this prospectus. Any dealer or broker
	participating in any distribution of the shares covered by this prospectus may
	be required to deliver a copy of this prospectus, including a prospectus
	supplement, if any, to any person who purchases any of the shares from or
	through such dealer or broker.



	     We have advised the selling stockholders that, during such time as they
	may be engaged in a distribution of the shares covered by this prospectus, they
	are required to comply with Regulation M promulgated under the Securities
	Exchange Act. With certain exceptions, Regulation M precludes any selling
	stockholder, any affiliated purchasers and any broker-dealer or other person
	who participates in such distribution from bidding for or purchasing, or
	attempting to induce any person to bid for or purchase any security that is the
	subject of the distribution until the entire distribution is complete.
	Regulation M also prohibits any bids or purchases made in order to stabilize
	the price of a security in connection with the distribution of that security.
	All of the foregoing may affect the marketability of the common stock.

	ITEM 15. Indemnification of Directors and Officers.



	     The Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides
	that a director of the Company shall not be personally liable to the
	Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
	duty as a director, except for liability for: (i) any breach of the directors
	duty of loyalty to the Company or its stockholders; (ii) acts or omissions not
	in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of
	law; (iii) liability for payments of dividends or stock purchases or
	redemptions in violation of Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation
	Law; or (iv) any transaction from which the director derived an improper
	personal benefit. In addition, the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate
	of Incorporation provides that the Company shall to the fullest extent
	authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may
	hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the
	extent that such amendment permits the corporation to provide broader
	indemnification rights than such law permitted the corporation to provide prior
	to such amendment), indemnify and hold harmless any person who was or is a
	party, or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any
	threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
	criminal, administrative or investigative by reason of the fact that such
	person is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving
	at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
	another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
	including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an
	Indemnitee) against expenses, liabilities and losses (including attorneys
	fees, judgments, fines, excise taxes or penalties paid in connection with the
	Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and amounts paid
	in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such Indemnitee in connection
	therewith; provided, however, that except as otherwise provided with respect to
	proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Company shall indemnify
	any such Indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated
	by such Indemnitee only if such proceeding or part thereof was authorized by
	the board of directors of the Company.



	     The right to indemnification set forth above includes the right to be paid
	by the Company the expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in defending
	any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however,
	that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law requires, an advancement of
	expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in his capacity as a director or officer
	(and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such
	Indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan)
	shall be made only upon delivery to the Company of an undertaking, by or on
	behalf of such Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall
	ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is not
	further right to appeal that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified
	for such expenses under this section or otherwise. The rights to
	indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred herewith are
	contract rights and continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a
	director, officer, employee or agent and inures to the benefit of the
	Indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators.



	     The Delaware General Corporation Law provides that indemnification is
	permissible only when the director, officer, employee, or agent acted in good
	faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
	interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or
	proceeding, had no reasonable cause

	to believe the conduct was unlawful. The Delaware General Corporation Law
	also precludes indemnification in respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to
	which an officer, director, employee, or agent shall have been adjudged to be
	liable to the Company unless and only to the extent that the court of Chancery
	or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine that,
	despite such adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of
	the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnify for such
	expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.

	ITEM 17. Undertakings.



	     The registrant hereby undertakes:



	     (1)  To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a
	post-effective amendment to this registration statement:












	 




	     (i) to include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3)
	Securities Act;






	 






	 




	     (ii) to reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after
	the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent
	post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the
	aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in
	the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase
	or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of
	securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any
	deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering
	range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the SEC
	pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and
	price represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum aggregate
	offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table
	in the effective registration statement; and






	 






	 




	     (iii) to include any material information with respect to the plan
	of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or
	any material change to such information in the registration statement;






	II - 2








	Table of Contents














	 





	provided, however

	, that paragraphs (l)(i) and (l)(ii) do not apply if the
	registration statement is on Form S-3 or Form S-8, and the information
	required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs
	is contained in periodic reports filed by the registrant pursuant to
	Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
	Exchange Act) that are incorporated by reference in the registration
	statement;






	     (2)  That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the
	Securities Act, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new
	registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the
	offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona
	fide offering thereof;



	     (3)  To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any
	of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of
	this offering;



	     (4)  That, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities
	Act of 1933, each filing of the registrants annual report pursuant to section
	13(a) or section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that is
	incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be deemed to be a
	new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the
	offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona
	fide offering thereof; and



	     (5)  Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the
	Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling
	persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise,
	the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and
	Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed
	in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for
	indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the
	registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling
	person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or
	proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in
	connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in
	the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling
	precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether
	such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and
	will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again.
