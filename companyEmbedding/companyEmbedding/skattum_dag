Investment Banking | Revolving Door 
Dag Skattum Is Set to Return to JPMorgan as a Vice Chairman

LONDON — Dag Skattum, the former co-head of global mergers and acquisitions at JPMorgan Chase, is expected to rejoin the bank in January as vice chairman for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
According to an internal memorandum seen by DealBook, Mr. Skattum will be based in London and will report to Carlos Hernandez and Jeff Urwin, JPMorgan’s co-heads of global banking.
Mr. Skattum will act as chairman of a new global investment banking strategic advisory council within JPMorgan. He also will work closely with Sjoerd Leenart, JPMorgan’s head of its operations in the Middle East and North Africa, to coordinate client strategy in sub-Saharan Africa.
“Dag’s expertise will be critical in helping us continue the evolution of the firm’s growing business in the region,” Daniel E. Pinto, the chief executive of JPMorgan’s corporate and investment bank, said in the memo.
A JPMorgan spokeswoman confirmed Monday that Mr. Skattum would be rejoining the bank next year.
Mr. Skattum joined JPMorgan in 1986 and worked for the bank for 21 years in a variety of roles in New York and in London, including as co-head of global mergers and acquisitions.
He left the bank in 2007 to join the private equity firm TPG Capital. He most recently headed the London office of One Thousand & One Voices, a social investment fund focused on sub-Saharan Africa.

Event: Climbing Kilimanjaro

Charity Registration No. 1112404








Story


The year 2011 turned out to be both more challenging and inspiring than the Skattum family could have imagined.
  
As most of you know, last year I was diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma: a form of cancer of the plasma cells. From my initial surprise diagnosis we ran the gauntlet of visits to specialists in the UK and the USA, researched the internet endlessly, and spoke with a multitude of incredibly helpful people from all walks of life---all of which culminated in my 3 month stay in Little Rock, Arkansas.  In Little Rock  we learned that this disease, which is frequently misunderstood and has long been considered incurable, can be effectively managed and cured over the long term. I left Little Rock with a revised diagnosis, an innocuous treatment regime and an even more positive outlook for an active and healthy life. But much work still needs to be done to develop a curative treatment for high risk Myeloma and we hope you will join our family in rising to the challenges ahead.
 
Our journey over the last year gave us a profound respect for and appreciation of the smarts, compassion and dedication of people involved in treating, counseling and tirelessly working to cure cancer. It also made us realize that those of us in a position to help others less able should do so, as life is short and one never knows what’s around the corner.
 
With this in mind, we want to give something back in appreciation of all the care and support we received from family, friends and colleagues. In April, I will climb Mt Kilimanjaro together with Julie and our three boys: Lars, Erik and Nils. Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa (19,340 ft, 5,895 meters above sea level) and one of the highest free-standing mountains in the world.  Although Nils is disappointed not to set the record as the youngest climber, we suspect the challenge nonetheless will be formidable, at least for the 50+ member of the family (and that’s not Julie!).
 
We’d like to invite our friends around the world to participate in our family “Kili Challenge”. Our aim in climbing is to raise funds for three organizations that make a positive difference in the lives of individuals, families and communities throughout the world.
 
Here is the challenge: our family has committed £150,000 to the effort and with everyone's help, we hope to double or triple that amount – approximately £3-5 per foot per person climbed.
 
The three organizations we’re supporting: the international children’s charity, Right to Play, Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy and Myeloma UK – embody innovation, compassion, dedication and commitment to a better future.
  
Right To Play (www.righttoplay.org.uk / www.righttoplay.com) was founded by Johann Koss, a multiple gold winner in the 1994 winter Olympics in Norway. Johann was the first Olympian to donate his winnings to what was then Olympic Aid. Over the years, Olympic Aid morphed into Right To Play - an organization that leverages sport and play for the development of children in warn torn or otherwise troubled parts of the world.
  
As a family we are privileged to have witnessed first-hand the impact Right To Play has in the local communities in which it operates.  After our climb, we will witness the impact of your support on programmes with children in the slums of Dar es Salaam and the towns of Morogoro and Dodoma. These programmes help vulnerable children protect themselves from malaria and HIV/AIDs, and acquire crucial leadership skills. Click here for a story from our Dar es Salaam projects.
  
With funds raised through the Skattum Family Challenge, we can give almost 10,000 children living in these communities the chance to fulfil their potential and access sport and play opportunities that we take for granted every day.
  
For children such as Grace Alupo, your support will make a profound difference to their lives:
  
“malaria prevents us from achieving our goals at school. We had been falling sick and did not understand why. Now we have played Right To Play games, we know about malaria’s symptoms, effects and how it can be prevented.”
  
Her friend Godfrey feels just as strongly: “when leading the games, I feel empowered to make decisions. I can make right choices in my life. I have made my destiny.  I have been able to learn a lot through leading my fellow children. I love it when children follow what I tell them, we learn together”.
  
Should you, like us, be inspired be inspired to give, know you will be making a real difference in the lives of many individuals and in communities throughout the world. If not, we appreciate the chance to connect and tell you about some incredible people and organizations that are making a real impact in our world.
