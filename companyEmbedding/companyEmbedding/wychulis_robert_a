In 2013 he was awarded WellPoint's Pinnacle Award, the company's highest management award. In the same year, HealthPlus was the most profitable of the 20 WellPoint government program plans, while maintaining an upper tier quality and outcome ranking, and achieving NCQA accreditation status for the plan.
Prior to joining WellPoint/Amerigroup, Mr. Wychulis served as President and CEO of the Florida Association of Health Plans; where he grew the Association from 8 to 26 plans in four years.
