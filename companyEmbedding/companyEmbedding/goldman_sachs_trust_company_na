Goldman Sachs Asset Management to Launch New Stable Value Fund | Business Wire


























































Goldman Sachs Asset Management to Launch New Stable Value Fund




Seeking to meet plan sponsor demand for pooled stable value funds






June 21, 2013 08:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. (GSAM) announced today that it has 
      reached an agreement with Fifth Third Bank for eligible plan investors 
      in the Fifth Third Stable Value Fund to transition to the Goldman Sachs 
      Stable Value Collective Trust (Fund), a new stable value fund expected 
      to be formed by The Goldman Sachs Trust Company, N.A. The transaction 
      reflects GSAM’s commitment to the defined contribution (DC) 
      investment-only business and reinforces the importance of stable value 
      as an investment option for retirement plan participants.
    


      “The new Fund enables GSAM and its affiliates to expand access to stable 
      value solutions to an even greater number of retirement plans and their 
      participants,” said Eric S. Lane and Timothy J. O’Neill, global co-heads 
      of the Investment Management Division at Goldman Sachs, in a formal 
      statement. “Stable value continues to be an important asset class for DC 
      plans and our new Stable Value Collective Trust will be an opportunity 
      to respond to strong demand in the marketplace.”
    

      GSAM built on its historically strong fixed income capabilities with the 
      acquisition of Dwight Asset Management Company LLC (Dwight) in May 2012. 
      The Dwight stable value portfolio management team has been advising the 
      Fifth Third Stable Value Fund since 1998 and will be adviser in respect 
      of the stable value contracts for the Fund. The Goldman Sachs Trust 
      Company, N.A. will act as trustee for the Fund, and GSAM and Dwight will 
      be the investment advisers for the Fund’s investment portfolio.
    

      Currently, stable value is offered in approximately half of all 401(k) 
      plans1. GSAM has over $34 billion in stable value assets as 
      part of over $55 billion in DC assets under supervision (AUS)2. 
      This agreement is GSAM’s latest step in delivering capabilities that 
      help meet the needs of DC plan sponsors.
    

      The transaction with Fifth Third is expected to close by the fourth 
      quarter of 2013, at which time we anticipate the launch of the Goldman 
      Sachs Stable Value Collective Trust.
    

      Goldman Sachs Asset Management is the asset management arm of The 
      Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS), which manages $860 billion as of 
      March 31, 2013. Goldman Sachs Asset Management has been providing 
      discretionary investment advisory services since 1988 and has investment 
      professionals in all major financial centers around the world. The 
      company offers investment strategies across a broad range of asset 
      classes to institutional and individual clients globally. Founded in 
      1869, Goldman Sachs is a leading global investment banking, securities 
      and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial 
      services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes 
      corporations, financial institutions, governments and high-net-worth 
      individuals.
    

      The Goldman Sachs Stable Value Collective Trust (the Fund) has not been 
      launched yet. This press release is delivered solely for informational 
      purposes with respect to the Fund, an investment product that Goldman 
      Sachs may offer in the future.
    

      This information is provided for informational purposes only and is not 
      an offer or solicitation to invest in any Goldman Sachs product. Any 
      offers in the future will be made by the Goldman Sachs Trust Company, 
      N.A. solely to certain eligible trusts, certain government plans, and 
      certain insurance company separate accounts for which such an investment 
      would be considered suitable and would be lawful and which can afford to 
      invest in investment vehicles having the risks, objectives and prospects 
      of the Fund.
    

      Views and opinions are current as of the date of this presentation and 
      may be subject to change, they should not be construed as investment 
      advice.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
