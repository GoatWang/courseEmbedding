New York property sales database










You
        have "found" the names you searched for, however this is only
        one of a large number of data bases.   This site is an index
        of recent real estate sales in this New York County.  It includes
        the date of sale  and names of buyers and sellers.  These
        properties have been sold; they are no longer  for sale.  For
        properties for sale, you should contact a real estate broker in your
        area.  Realtors are licensed, and their agents can serve the buyer
        or the seller, but not both.  

Almost all Realtors have web sites;
        you can contact the broker that seems to have the most recent sales, or
        the most homes for sale.  Almost all Real Estate offices use the
        Multiple Listing Service, and can show you properties for sale even if
        the property is listed with another broker.  






Or CLICK
        HERE  to search the 

FINDERINO 
        data base, which contains information on more than 600,000 real estate
        sales in New York State (2004 to present).
The full data base contains the property
        address, sale price, buyers  and sellers names

                    Product description
                    
                 


DESCRIPTION: The Protecta LP rat bait station is a triangular shaped bait station that fits in corners and along walls where rodents travel. Its “Low Profile” makes it ideal to use indoors under pallets and in other tight baiting locations. The Protecta LP rat bait station locks automatically when closed and uses a special 2-prong key to open. One key is included 1 key per order or 1 every 6 Stations, with each case. Extra keys are available for purchase. Dimensions: 13" across by 9" Deep by 3 and 3/8" High USE: Place station near baseboards, corners, or in spaces where rodents are likely to travel. Rodents will enter stations out of curiosity, and the presence of rodenticide baits placed inside the station. Protecta stations do not come with baits. We recommend purchasing Contrac Blox Rodenticide baits for use in the Protecta stations.

This is it! I'm not so sure I like having to use a special key, but it will certainly do the job.Just be sure you use it with the older style rat bait. You can tell by reading the package. If it says Vitamin K is the antidote, then you have the right stuff. If your animals eat it, the vet can save them. On the other hand, if you use the newer, neurologic poison, you can kiss them goodbye!Read more22 comments|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse3.0 out of 5 starsNo vertical bait support rods and no instructionsByLSon November 12, 2014Verified PurchaseI am disappointed that these boxes do NOT include any metal standing rods to hold up the bait chunks.  There is a horizontal rod suspended across the bait area (see pic).  I figured the bait is supposed to be skewered like a rat barbecue.  2nd pic is exactly as the box arrived.  Did I mention zero instructions included on how to use the key to open or place the bait?  I only received the boxes.  Hope it works.Read more

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse3.0 out of 5 starsGoodbye, rats (5+ in the house) - but expect to scavenge!ByNinjaon April 6, 2015Verified PurchaseExperience: When looking for solutions to get rid of my rat situation, I decided on purchasing this bait station. I originally had 2 rats or so living in my house, and then they multiplied into 5+. I used this bait station alongside the "Farnam Home & Garden 3005449 16-oz. Just One Bite II Bar - Quantity 1" poison, and it progressively worked. My primary concern however, was that the rats would take the poison back to their little hide-outs, and would die there. It definitely would have been more convenient if the rats would have died inside of the bait station.Pros:- Sturdy- Effective- Animal and baby-proofCons:- Somewhat aesthetically displeasing to be used in the house (being nit-picky, as it probably should be used outdoors anyways).- Key: the fact that we are forced to use a key to open this bait station is quite annoying. According to a few reviewers, the company gives you quite a difficult time if you lose the "oh-so-magical" key.- No trap or incentive for the rat to remain inside. I had rats dying around my house.Read more0Comment|

I emailed the distributor, but it's absolutely rediculous that neither one would come with a key.Update: I discovered the key was inside a plastic bag, locked inside the trap. I was able to shake the bag out eventually. Some written indication that this is the case (or making the bag more accessible) would have made sense.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsA great price for a very capable product. Love themByStephen Johnstonon December 10, 2016Verified PurchaseThese were a great price. My Pest Exterminator was charging me the price of all 3 to "loan" 1 of his. Sadly, rats in your neighborhood does NOT mean your house is dirty. They reproduce rapidly and search out bird feed tables etc. If they're in your area, better to bait them than let them find there way into the walls or attics and chew through wiring which at the least is expensive and the worst, can cause fires. These bait stations are ideal and come with a couple of methods of baiting as well as a key to open the traps (so kids can't get into them). Also, the way the bait is held inside, no cat or dog can reach in and get the bait either. The pesky rat has to enter the station and work its way deep inside and the bait is held solidly in a compartment. You cannot reach in and touch it. None the less, common sense should always prevail when working with the poison, both handling it (always wear gloves), and making sure there's no temptation for the kids to play with the stations. Very pleased with the quality. You should be able to buy the bait at your local Hardware Store. The blue/green stuff seems to work best.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse3.0 out of 5 starsAccessories shown are not included. It's a plastic box.ByAmazon Customeron October 2, 2015Verified PurchaseDidn't come with the accessories listed, only had one horizontal metal bait bar, no vertical bars as are shown in the photo. Otherwise it's a plastic box that you put rat bait in. Like heavy-duty plastic food storage container; I don't get the $20 price tag.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsSolid productByRoy Fineon November 13, 2014Verified PurchaseGreat product.  My first experience with this product was from a local exterminator who installed 2 with a sampling of the Tomcat rodent bait blocks. They worked well, but his price was way over the top.  A few months later I noticed a few more rodents in other areas, so I decided to get a few more stations.  I looked them up on Amazon and found exact same product at a fraction of the cost..  I ordered straight away, they came within a couple of days. I loaded them up with bait blocks and out them in service. For now I'm happy to report 'problem solved'.These stations are a bigger than many that I looked at, and not suitable for living areas (aesthetics) - but are perfect for the attic and in the yard and out buildings.Read more0Comment|

Rock Music from Amazon.comRock music might have busted onto the scene in the 1950s, but it has roots in countless musical genres. Explosive sounds from electric guitars, fuzzy feedback loops, and powerful vocals all characterize this diverse and innovative genre. From Pete Townsend’s classic windmill guitar playing to The Beatles’ first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, rock music has never failed to catch listeners by surprise.With everything from breakneck percussion to twangy, lyric-driven songs and power chords and rootsy rhythm sounds, Amazon.com can help you find your favorite rock music and artists, whether you love Tool, Deep Purple, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Rolling Stones, and many more. Our wide range of sub-genres includes blues, country, folk, jam bands, Latin, oldies and retro, power pop, progressive, rap, guitarists, roots, singer-songwriters, and funk rock. From Top 40 and beyond, you can find your favorite catchy songs.To help you take your favorite rock music wherever you go, Amazon.com offers a unique program called AutoRip. AutoRip automatically makes the hard copy of AutoRip-eligible albums you’ve just purchased available on your Amazon.com Cloud Player. Now you can have physical forms for your own personal collection, and you can listen to your favorite songs wherever you can access your Cloud Player. Whether you’re looking for new Black Sabbath, John Fogerty, or Boz Scaggs albums or classics like Rodriguez, the Velvet Underground, or Bread, you can purchase AutoRip-ready vinyl and CDs so you don’t have to wait to listen to your favorite songs.If you’d rather rock out to vinyl records, we offer a wide selection of easily searchable LPs so you can get everything from The Who, Jim Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Big Star, and more. We also offer a huge selection of CDs, DVD audio, cassettes, and MP3s. You can even filter our rock music selection for new releases so you can pre-order upcoming records and browse new releases from the last 30 or 90 days. We also offer a handy edition filter so you can search for main albums, singles and EPs, live albums, imports, limited editions, box sets, and compilations.The Velvet Underground once said that life is saved by rock ‘n’ roll. With rock music from Amazon.com, you can tap into those “life-changing sounds.”

Halpern and Rosen firms break ground in Mamaroneck

A rendering of the proposed development.
A former junkyard site in a flood-prone area of the village of Mamaroneck was too tempting to pass up.
On June 16, Halpern Real Estate Ventures and Rosen Development Group broke ground on a $35 million, 100-unit apartment complex in the village.
“I grew up nearby in Harrison,” said project director Joel Halpern, the fourth generation of his family to develop real estate in Westchester. “I know its value.”
Some of the value is obvious. The 2.7-acre property at 270 Waverly Ave. is next to a Metro-North Railroad station and at the center of a picturesque village. Residents will be able to step on trains in less than five minutes and commute to Grand Central Terminal in 35 to 47 minutes or to Stamford in 24 to 38 minutes.
If Mamaroneck were merely desirable, developers would be clamoring to build there. Yet the Halpern-Rosen project is the first large-scale residential development in about 20 years.
“There are high barriers to entry,” Halpern said.
First, land for large developments is scarce.
Second, the village’s approval process can be lengthy. In this case, planning began more than 10 years ago and the Halpern firm is the second developer trying to convert the site to residences.
“That’s a factor that pushes a lot of developers out,” Halpern said.
Blood Brothers auto wrecking occupied the property for 50 years. Ofer Attia of New Rochelle acquired the property a decade ago, got it rezoned, put it through an extensive environmental review and attained site plan approval for condominiums.
But an anti-development movement was afoot. In 2008, the village denied him a building permit. Attia had borrowed heavily, and by 2012 he was on the hook for nearly $14 million.
He filed for bankruptcy and the court authorized a real estate auction.
Halpern Real Estate Ventures and Rosen Development Group gained control of the site for $3.5 million.
Rosen is based in Harrison and has experience on smaller projects in Mamaroneck. It is currently building seven condominiums across the street from Harbor Island Park.
Joel Halpern’s great grandfather, Harry, built apartments in lower Westchester and the Bronx in the 1950s and 1960s. His grandfather, also named Joel, built Tarrytown Corporate Center in the 1970s.
His father, Jon, took over the family’s Westchester operations in the late 1980s.
Growing up, Joel Halpern spent weekends with his dad at the office buildings and construction sites.
Jon Halpern sold the family’s real estate assets to Reckson Associates in the early 2000s. He founded Halpern Real Estate Ventures in 2011.
The Mamaroneck property was supposedly shovel ready, Joel Halpern said. But it is in a flood zone of the Sheldrake River, so the developers decided to increase the elevation.
They also paid the village $125,000 for surplus land. The money will be used to improve the Waverly Avenue bridge.
Last fall, the county Industrial Development Agency approved $1.1 million in tax exemptions and a purchase leaseback deal.
Papp Architects designed the project with an industrial look that fits its surroundings.
“It will look like a Brooklyn warehouse transported to Mamaroneck,” Halpern said.
Three low-rise buildings will include 96 loft-style apartments and a fourth building will have four townhouses.
The exteriors will feature brick work, zinc clad façade and floor-to-ceiling steel casement windows. The apartments will have condo-level finishes, such as tiling, hardwood flooring and quartz countertops. Every unit will have a washer and dryer. Among the amenities will be a gym and an outdoor deck with grilling area and fire pits.
Halpern said the apartments should appeal to a wide range of tenants: young professionals, young families and empty nesters.
“It’s hard to say exactly what demographic group will predominate.”
He declined to disclose the range of rents.
The project has been referred to locally as Sheldrake Station, after the name of the Halpern and Rosen development company. Halpern said a formal name for the project has not been chosen yet.
AMEC LLC of Norwalk is the general contractor. The work is expected to be done by fall 2018.
“It’s exciting to be building something new,” Halpern said.
“What thrills us is to create something that will have a lasting impact on the village of Mamaroneck.”
