The book of Genesis is foundational to the whole Bible, and to every human life. Genesis tells us who God is, who we are, how things went wrong, and the plan that God has put in place to return the earth to the way it was meant to be.

Pastor Mitchell Kim explores the beginning of the Bible in this 12-week Bible study through the book of Genesis.




Description


The Knowing the Bible series is a new resource designed to help Bible readers better understand and apply God’s Word. Each 12-week study covers one book of the Bible and is made up of four basic components: (1) Reflection questions designed to help readers engage the text at a deeper level; (2) “Gospel Glimpses” highlighting the gospel of grace throughout the book; (3) “Whole-Bible Connections” showing how a given passage connects to the Bible’s overarching story of redemption culminating in Christ; and (4) “Theological Soundings” identifying how historic orthodox doctrines are taught or reinforced throughout Scripture. With contributions from a wide array of influential pastors and church leaders, these gospel-centered studies will help Christians cherish the message of God’s grace on each and every page of the Bible. In this study of Genesis, pastor Mitchell Kim leads readers through the first book of the Bible, uncovering the meaning of the text while exploring important applications for everyday life. From explaining the true significance of the creation account to investigating God’s gracious calling of the nation of Israel, this book highlights how the storyline of Genesis foreshadows and connects to the good news about Jesus, the long-awaited “seed of the woman.” With penetrating exegetical insights and thought-provoking application questions, Kim has crafted an invaluable guide for those seeking to better understand this foundational book.

“Very good booklet ”
The good book company have so many great resources for great topics.Recently I bought this product as children in my kids clubs had become Christians. It is really good as it answers questions in very simple form for any child or indeed any new Christian to understand. Covering different verses from The Bible. Great wee booklet!!!

12/11/2012









“Excellent”
Purchased for Sunday School children who expressed an interest in becoming a Christian.  Leaflets were easy for them to understand and answered questions they had.  An excellent purchase.




14/03/2012

“Excellant”
The booklet is very good and I bought them to pass onto others for free




28/09/2007









“Fantastic!”
'How do I know I'm a Christian' is a question that many children (and adults) ask and in my opinion this tract/booklet gives a straight answer. I've found the whole 'How' series to be a great resource. They appeal to children while giving strong, clear Biblical answers and explinations.




28/05/2007









“both clear and engaging”
Helpfully this is written with both the christian and non-christian child in mind.Very clear with no assumed back ground knowledge.Pictures and gaps to fill in to hold attention.A great resource.

"That's what it's all about. God has given me an international sound that will change this generation."The veteran singer-songwriter who's known for his popular Grammy-nominated gospel song "Nobody Greater," believes his international sound can raise the bar even higher by impacting people all over the world."I purposely wanted to create an international sound that can be sung all over the world. 'Nobody Greater' and things like that can get picked up all over the world, but I purposely wanted this music, this sound that's being recorded to become international," he told CP. "[My other records] were more focused on songs and not sounds."Aside from just another high energy and encouraging project, Mitchell believes his decision to record in South Africa with artists from the region made each song quite an experience."It's a body of music to encourage and inspire this generation, but because it's live in South Africa its actually even more blessed. We did it live and the experience in the room, I believe, added to the experience of the project," he said. "Whenever I talk about it, I talk about the experience and not just the songs, because each song has a life of its own. I'm looking forward to sharing this with the world."Along with some African artists, Mitchell also welcomed famous faces in the industry BeBe Winans and Tasha Cobbs to record with him."People don't have to be nice to be honest. I was humbled and honored for their support. Bebe Winans is my mentor, of course, and Tasha Cobbs is like a sister to me, I've produced her records. And so this is more relationship than anything else."While Winans has been his mentor, Cobbs has become a close friend to Mitchell. When he decided to remake the classic "Nobody Greater" on his album, both contributed to a remixing of the record that is nothing short of a spiritual experience for the singers.It's been two years since Mitchell's last album, but that doesn't mean he has taken a break from the industry. Even though people may not hear the worship leader-turned-gospel music singer's voice on a song, that doesn't mean he's not hard at work in the industry.Since his 2014 album Unstoppable, Mitchell has been working behind the scenes producing records for the likes of Cobbs. The continuous industry work outside of his own album may be what's keeping him connected to God in a way that inspires his own music."While I'm preparing or while I'm not preparing [for my own album], I'm trying to get to that secret place between me and God where I can hear what to do and what not to do," he said. "It's always movement when you're doing work in the Lord and I think that that's where it comes to me."Mitchell is constantly working to tap into the sound that God has called him to create, but it took some time and tough lessons for the Chicago native to be obedient. During a time when he spent the same amount of time in clubs as he did in church, a 20-year-old Mitchell ended up in jail.It was there that Mitchell was able to recognize the importance of becoming serious about his walk with God."I had to spend a few days in the county jail in Chicago. I was driving on a suspended license," he revealed. "I was still directing the choir in my church and I was traveling. I heard God clearly say, 'You're either going to live for me or abort your destiny.'"Mitchell decided to take the road paved by God."From that day forth I began to purposely turn my life around. It was life changing just to have that experience and to understand there are different roads we can take," he said. "Our future is dependent on the road we choose."Now, 20 years later, Mitchell is working hard to do his part in an industry that many believe is not thriving as it once was. But for the singer-songwriter, it's important to continue to push through to create sounds of worship."I would look at it and say the gospel music industry is exactly where it's supposed to be today. As we continue to change, we find success today is not what it was 10 years ago," he said. "If success is selling a lot of records and that's what our goal is then that's what we do. But if the success of it is making sure we try to put out great gospel music that is changing lives, then that's what we do as well."For more information about VaShawn Mitchell, click here.Free sign up cp newsletter!Sign upRelated2016 GMA Dove Award Nominees: Hillsong, Lecrae, Lauren Daigle Up for Artist of the Year (List) WOW Gospel 2016 Is No. 1 on Billboard Top Gospel Albums Chart Fred Hammond Reveals His Inspiration for 52-City 'Festival of Praise' Gospel Music Tour (Interview) Tina Campbell Credits YouVersion Bible App for Saving Her Life, Marriage Tye Tribbett on Why He Wrote Gospel Song for Fantasia's Secular Album    Share on facebook Share on twitter   Share  Email Print Share Tweet Pin Linkedin Google+ Reddit  Free sign up cp newsletter!Sign up        Most Popular   Christian Grandma Florist Fined for Not Working Gay Wedding Takes 'Last Stand' at Supreme Court      Bride-to-Be Justine Damond Shot Dead by Police After She Called 911 About Possible Assault      Would Jesus Bake a Gay Wedding Cake?

From the creators of God's Not Dead! When a local pastor is shaken to the core by the visible faith of an elderly street-corner preacher, he's reminded that true belief always requires action. His response ignites a faith-fueled journey that powerfully impacts everybody it touches in ways that only God can orchestrate.  Rated PG-13. Dove approved (12+). Approx. 120 minutes.

 From the studio that brought you War Room and Miracles from Heaven comes a captivating new film!  All Saints is based on the inspiring true story of salesman-turned-pastor Michael Spurlock (John Corbett, My Big Fat Greek Weeding), the tiny church he was ordered to shut down, and a group of refugees from Southeast Asia. Together, they risked everything to plant seeds for a future that might just save them all. Look for it in theaters nationwide August 25!
