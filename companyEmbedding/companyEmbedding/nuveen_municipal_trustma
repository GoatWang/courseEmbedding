1 In U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2016. Source Ameriprise Q2 Earnings Release. Includes all assets managed by entities in the Columbia and Threadneedle group of companies. Contact us for more current data.
2Source: ICI as of December 31, 2016 for Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC.
3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.

1 In U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2016. Source Ameriprise Q2 Earnings Release. Includes all assets managed by entities in the Columbia and Threadneedle group of companies. Contact us for more current data.
2Source: ICI as of December 31, 2016 for Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC.
3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.

Fund Family

Nuveen
The Nuveen Family of Funds delivers excellence across every major asset class through focused teams of independent investment affiliates backed by Nuveen’s financial strength, infrastructure and resources.









Fund Description


		A high yield strategy that invests primarily in non-investment-grade and unrated municipal bonds that under normal market conditions,
		will maintain a weighted average maturity in excess of ten years and seeks to provide high current income exempt from regular federal
		income taxes. Some income may be subject to state and local taxes and to the federal alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, are
		subject to tax. The Fund opportunistically employs leverage through the use of inverse floating rate securities issued in tender option
		bond transactions to try to enhance yield and duration.
	





Key Features

Rigorous Credit Research: Large, experienced team of credit analysts is dedicated to identifying attractively valued investment opportunities that the general public may have overlooked
Institutional Trade Execution:  Size and established relationships gives access to multiple inventories and the ability to find bonds in appropriate sizes at attractive prices
Economic Trend Analysis:  Portfolio managers and investment professionals regularly assess the interest rate environment, credit cycle conditions, and other municipal bond market trends









					Who Should Invest
				
Investors Seeking:



Monthly, tax-free income* from a long-term, high-yield portfolio
Attractive after-tax returns
To increase income potential and are willing to accept a greater degree of credit risk
To diversify with fixed income

							A Word On Risk

							Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. Debt or fixed income securities such as those held by the Fund, are subject to market risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, call risk, tax risk, political and economic risk, and income risk. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall. Credit risk refers to an issuers ability to make interest and principal payments when due.

	The Fund concentrates in non-investment-grade and unrated bonds with long maturities and durations which carry heightened credit risk, liquidity risk, and potential for default. In addition, the Fund oftentimes engages in a significant amount of portfolio leverage and in doing so, assumes a high level of risk in pursuit of its objectives. Leverage involves the risk that the Fund could lose more than its original investment and also increases the Fund's exposure to volatility, interest rate risk and credit risk.

						








  Returns quoted represent past performance which is no guarantee of future performance.  Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that when shares are redeemed, they may be worth more or less than their original cost. Income is generally exempt from regular federal income taxes. Some income may be subject to state and local taxes and to the federal alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, are subject to tax. Due to market conditions, current performance may be higher or lower than the data shown. Returns without sales charge do not reflect the imposition of the maximum sales charge, which would reduce returns. Total returns for a period of less than one year are cumulative.             Performance assumes the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Class A shares have a 4.2% maximum sales charge. Class C and C2 shares have a 1% CDSC for redemptions within less than one year, which is not reflected in the one-year total return. Class I shares have no sales charge and may be purchased under limited circumstances or by specified classes of investors. Class R6 shares have no sales charge and are available to certain qualified retirement plans and other investors as set forth in the statement of additional information.        Distribution Rate is the most recent dividend per share (annualized) divided by the respective price per share. The SEC 30-Day Yield is computed under an SEC standardized formula and is based on the maximum offer price per share as of the date specified. The Distribution Rate also differs from the SEC 30-Day Yield because the Fund may be paying out more or less than it is earning and it may not include the effect of amortization of bond premium. Subsidized yields reflect fee waivers in effect. Without such waivers, yields would be reduced. Unsubsidized yields do not reflect fee waivers in effect.                   The fund employs high yield strategies, including significant investment in below investment grade bonds and opportunistic use of portfolio leverage during certain periods through investment in inverse floating rate securities, which other funds in its Lipper classification may not have used to the same extent.  The index does not include floating rate securities, and may differ in credit quality from the fund. As a result, performance comparisons may be less meaningful.           Expense ratios are based on the Fund's most recent fiscal year end. The net expense ratio excludes credits earned on the Fund's cash on deposit with the custodian bank but includes interest expense on borrowings and interest and related expenses on self-deposited inverse floaters held by the Fund, if any. Class R6 shares other expenses are estimated for the current fiscal year.

Example  The
following example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then either redeem or do
not redeem your shares at the end of a period. The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Funds operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these
assumptions your costs would be:

 Portfolio Turnover  The Fund
pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or turns over its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held
in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Funds performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Funds portfolio turnover rate was 20% of the average
value of its portfolio.  Principal Investment Strategies  Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of the sum of its net assets and the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes in municipal bonds that pay interest that is exempt from regular
federal personal income tax. These municipal bonds include obligations issued by U.S. states and their subdivisions, authorities, instrumentalities and corporations, as well as obligations issued by U.S. territories (such as Puerto Rico, the U.S.
Virgin Islands and Guam) that pay interest that is exempt from regular federal personal income tax. The Fund may invest without limit in securities that generate income subject to the alternative minimum tax. The Fund generally invests in bonds with
short-to intermediate-term maturities. The Fund will attempt to maintain the weighted average maturity of its portfolio securities at three to seven years under normal market conditions.  Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in investment grade municipal bonds rated BBB/Baa or higher at the time of purchase by at least one independent rating agency, or, if
unrated, judged by the Funds sub-adviser to be of comparable quality. The Fund may invest up to 20% of its net assets in below investment grade municipal bonds, commonly referred to as high yield or junk bonds.
 The Fund may invest in all types of municipal bonds, including general obligation bonds, revenue bonds and participation interests in municipal leases.
The Fund may invest in zero coupon bonds, which are issued at substantial discounts from their value at maturity and pay no cash income to their holders until they mature.  The Fund may invest up to 15% of its net assets in municipal securities whose interest payments vary inversely with changes in short-term tax-exempt interest rates (inverse floaters). Inverse
floaters are derivative securities that provide leveraged exposure to underlying municipal bonds. The Funds investments in inverse floaters are designed to increase the Funds income and returns through this leveraged exposure. These
investments are speculative, however, and also create the possibility that income and returns will be diminished.  The Fund may utilize the following
derivatives: futures contracts; options on futures contracts; swap agreements, including interest rate swaps, and options on swap agreements. The Fund may use these derivatives in an attempt to manage market risk, credit risk and yield curve risk,
and to manage the effective maturity or duration of securities in the Funds portfolio.  The Funds sub-adviser uses a value-oriented strategy
and looks for higher-yielding and undervalued municipal bonds that offer above-average total return. The sub-adviser may choose to sell municipal bonds with deteriorating credit or limited upside potential compared to other available bonds.
 Principal Risks  The price and yield of this
Fund will change daily. You could lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The principal
risks of investing in the Fund, listed alphabetically, include:

NUVEEN


Alternative Minimum Tax RiskThe Fund has no limit as to the amount that can be invested in alternative
minimum tax bonds. Therefore, all or a portion of the Funds otherwise exempt-interest dividends may be taxable to those shareholders subject to the federal alternative minimum tax.  Call RiskIf an issuer calls higher-yielding debt instruments held by the Fund, performance could be adversely impacted.  Credit RiskCredit risk is the risk that an issuer of a debt security may be unable or unwilling to make interest and principal payments when due and the related risk that the value of a debt security
may decline because of concerns about the issuers ability or willingness to make such payments. The Funds investments in inverse floaters will increase the Funds credit risk.  Credit Spread RiskCredit spread risk is the risk that credit spreads (i.e., the difference in yield between securities that is due to differences in their credit quality) may increase when the market
believes that bonds generally have a greater risk of default. Increasing credit spreads may reduce the market values of the Funds debt securities. Credit spreads often increase more for lower rated and unrated securities than for
investment grade securities. In addition, when credit spreads increase, reductions in market value will generally be greater for longer-maturity securities.  Cybersecurity RiskCybersecurity breaches may allow an unauthorized party to gain access to Fund assets, customer data, or proprietary information, or cause the Fund and/or its service providers to
suffer data corruption or lose operational functionality.  Derivatives RiskThe use of derivatives involves additional risks and transaction
costs which could leave the Fund in a worse position than if it had not used these instruments. Derivative instruments can be used to acquire or to transfer the risk and returns of a security or other asset without buying or selling the security or
asset. These instruments may entail investment exposures that are greater than their cost would suggest. As a result, a small investment in derivatives can result in losses that greatly exceed the original investment. Derivatives can be highly
volatile, illiquid and difficult to value. An over-the-counter derivative transaction between the Fund and a counterparty that is not cleared through a central counterparty also involves the risk that a loss may be sustained as a result of the
failure of the counterparty to the contract to make required payments. The payment obligation for a cleared derivative transaction is guaranteed by a central counterparty, which exposes the Fund to the creditworthiness of the central counterparty.
 High Yield Securities RiskHigh yield securities, which are rated below investment grade and commonly referred to as junk bonds,
are high risk investments that may cause income and principal losses for the Fund. They generally have greater credit risk, are less liquid and have more volatile prices than investment grade securities. 
Income RiskThe Funds income could decline during periods of falling interest rates or when the Fund experiences defaults on debt securities it
holds. Also, if the Fund invests in inverse floaters, the Funds income may decrease if short-term interest rates rise.  Interest Rate
RiskInterest rate risk is the risk that the value of the Funds portfolio will decline because of rising interest rates. The Fund may be subject to a greater risk of rising interest rates than would normally be the case due to the
current period of historically low rates and the effect of potential government fiscal policy initiatives and resulting market reaction to those initiatives. When interest rates change, the values of longer-duration debt securities usually change
more than the values of shorter-duration debt securities. Interest rate risk may be increased by the Funds investment in inverse floaters because of the leveraged nature of these investments. 
Inverse Floaters RiskThe use of inverse floaters by the Fund creates effective leverage. Due to the leveraged nature of these investments, they will
typically be more volatile and involve greater risk than the fixed rate municipal bonds underlying the inverse floaters. An investment in certain inverse floaters will involve the risk that the Fund could lose more than its original principal
investment. Distributions on inverse floaters bear an inverse relationship to short-term municipal bond interest rates. Thus, distributions paid to the Fund on its inverse floaters will be reduced or even eliminated as short-term municipal interest
rates rise and will increase when short-term municipal interest rates fall. Inverse floaters generally will underperform the market for fixed rate municipal bonds in a rising interest rate environment. 
Municipal Bond Market Liquidity RiskInventories of municipal bonds held by brokers and dealers have decreased in recent years, lessening their ability
to make a market in these securities. This reduction in market making capacity has the potential to decrease the Funds ability to buy or sell bonds, and increase bond price volatility and trading costs, particularly during periods of economic
or market stress. In addition, recent federal banking regulations may cause certain dealers to reduce their inventories of municipal bonds, which may further decrease the Funds ability to buy or sell bonds. As a result, the Fund may be forced
to accept a lower price to sell

a security, to sell other securities to raise cash, or to give up an investment opportunity, any of which could have a negative effect on performance. If the Fund needed to sell large blocks of
bonds to raise cash (such as to meet heavy shareholder redemptions), those sales could further reduce the bonds prices and hurt performance. 
Municipal Lease Obligations RiskParticipation interests in municipal leases pose special risks because many leases and contracts contain
non-appropriation clauses that provide that the governmental issuer has no obligation to make future payments under the lease or contract unless money is appropriated for this purpose by the appropriate legislative body. 
Municipal Securities RiskThe values of municipal securities held by the Fund may be adversely affected by local political and economic conditions and
developments. Adverse conditions in an industry significant to a local economy could have a correspondingly adverse effect on the financial condition of local issuers.  Tax RiskIncome from municipal bonds held by the Fund could be declared taxable because of, among other things, unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service
or state tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer. Investments in certain derivatives utilized by the Fund may cause the Fund to have taxable investment income.  Valuation RiskThe debt securities in which the Fund invests typically are valued by a pricing service utilizing a range of market-based inputs and assumptions, including readily available market
quotations obtained from broker-dealers making markets in such instruments, cash flows and transactions for comparable instruments. There is no assurance that the Fund will be able to sell a portfolio security at the price established by the
pricing service, which could result in a loss to the Fund. Pricing services generally price debt securities assuming orderly transactions of an institutional round lot size, but some trades may occur in smaller, odd lot
sizes, often at lower prices than institutional round lot trades. Different pricing services may incorporate different assumptions and inputs into their valuation methodologies, potentially resulting in different values for the same securities. As a
result, if the Fund were to change pricing services, or if the Funds pricing service were to change its valuation methodology, there could be a material impact, either positive or negative, on the Funds net asset value. 
Zero Coupon Bonds RiskZero coupon bonds do not pay interest on a current basis and may be highly volatile as interest rates rise or fall. In addition,
while such bonds generate income for purposes of generally accepted accounting standards, they do not generate cash flow and thus could cause the Fund to be forced to liquidate securities at an inopportune time in order to distribute cash, as
required by tax laws.  Fund Performance  The
following bar chart and table provide some indication of the potential risks of investing in the Fund. The Funds past performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future. Updated
performance information is available at www.nuveen.com/performance or by calling (800) 257-8787.  The bar
chart below shows the variability of the Funds performance from year to year for Class A shares. The bar chart and highest/lowest quarterly returns that follow do not reflect sales charges, and if these charges were reflected, the returns
would be less than those shown.  Class A Annual Total Return*

The performance of the other share classes will differ due to their different expense structures.  During the ten-year period ended December 31, 2016, the Funds highest and lowest quarterly returns were 3.81% and -2.79%, respectively, for the quarters ended
September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2016.

The table below shows the variability of the Funds average annual returns and how they compare over the time
periods indicated with those of a broad measure of market performance and an index of funds with similar investment objectives. All after-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual
federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. After-tax returns are shown for Class A shares only; after-tax returns for
other share classes will vary. Your own actual after-tax returns will depend on your specific tax situation and may differ from what is shown here.  Both the bar chart and the table assume that all distributions have been reinvested. Performance reflects fee waivers, if any, in effect during the periods presented. If any such waivers had not been in place,
returns would have been reduced.  Prior to February 10, 2014, Class C2 shares were designated Class C shares. 
Performance is not shown for Class T shares, which have not been offered for a full calendar year.

          OPINION
          AMBRO, Circuit Judge.
         This case is on appeal to us for the second time. It arises from a loan transaction between Appellant Nuveen Municipal Trust ("Nuveen"), on behalf of its "Nuveen High Yield Municipal Bond Fund, " and Bayonne Medical Center ("Bayonne"). In connection with the transaction, Bayonne provided Nuveen with an audit report authored by Bayonne's accounting firm, Appellee WithumSmith+Brown, P.C. ("Withum"), and an opinion letter authored by Bayonne's counsel, Appellee Lindabury, McCormick, Estabrook & Cooper P.C. ("Lindabury"). Soon after the transaction, Bayonne filed a petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §§ 101 et seq. Nuveen contends that the audit report and opinion letter concealed problem aspects of Bayonne's financial condition, and had it known about these financial issues, it would not have entered into the transaction.
         Nuveen filed this action against Withum and Lindabury, asserting fraud (as to Withum only), negligent misrepresentation, and malpractice (as to Lindabury only), and representing that the District Court had diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332. The Court dismissed the action with prejudice based on Nuveen's noncompliance with New Jersey's Affidavit of Merit statute, N.J. Stat. Ann. §§ 2A:53A-26 et seq. (the "AOM Statute" or "Statute"), which requires the timely filing of an affidavit of merit attesting to the viability of claims in certain actions against professionals.
         On initial appeal to us, Nuveen brought to our attention Emerald Investors Trust v. Gaunt Parsippany Partners, 492 F.3d 192 (3d Cir. 2007), which held that, for purposes of diversity jurisdiction, the citizenship of a trust is determined by the citizenship of its beneficial shareholders. Because Nuveen may be considered a trust, Emerald called into question the District Court's previously asserted basis for jurisdiction. We granted Nuveen's unopposed motion to remand the case to allow the District Court to reconsider its jurisdiction.
         On remand, Withum and Lindabury raised a new basis for jurisdiction—that the action was "related to" Bayonne's bankruptcy proceeding, and thus that the District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1334(b). The Court accepted this basis for jurisdiction and re-entered its order dismissing the action with prejudice. Both the jurisdictional decision and its dismissal of the action are on appeal to us now. Nuveen also raises two new choice-of-law arguments on appeal: that the AOM Statute is a procedural pleading requirement that conflicts with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 such that the Statute cannot be applied in federal court, as federal procedural rules preempt conflicting state ones; or that certain provisions to protect plaintiffs with respect to the Statute are substantive state law that must be applied by a federal court under Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), and its progeny.
         We agree that the District Court had "related to" jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1334(b). We further hold that the AOM Statute can be applied by a federal court without conflicting with Rule 8, and that the protections Nuveen identifies are procedural under Erie, thus not requiring a federal court to follow them. If the AOM Statute applies to the action, we believe that Nuveen's noncompliance with it calls for the action's dismissal, but question whether this action is subject to the Statute. Because the New Jersey Supreme Court has not addressed key issues regarding the application of the Statute, we reserve deciding whether the District Court was correct to dismiss the action with prejudice and certify two questions of law regarding the Statute to the New Jersey Supreme Court.
         I. Factual and Procedural Background
         In the attempt to salvage its action from dismissal purely based on its counsel not filing timely affidavits of merits, Nuveen's arguments fall into four broad categories: (i) jurisdiction; (ii) the AOM Statute's application in federal court under Erie and its progeny; (iii) the Statute's application to its action as a legal matter; and (iv) whether its noncompliance with the Statute can be excused. To decide these issues, we detail the history of the loan transaction, Bayonne's bankruptcy proceeding, this action, the Statute, and the proceedings in and decisions of the District Court.
         A. Loan Transaction and Bayonne's Bankruptcy
         In October 2006, Nuveen, on behalf of one of its bond funds, purchased a $10 million Bond Anticipation Note ("BAN") from Bayonne. In connection with the transaction, Bayonne provided Nuveen with an audit report prepared by Withum regarding Bayonne's company-prepared 2005 financial statements. As Bayonne's counsel in the transaction, Lindabury provided Nuveen with an opinion letter addressing Bayonne's ability to repay the BAN. It included the typical opinion that Bayonne had the power and authority to enter into the BAN transaction and that, other than one disclosed investigation not relevant here, there were no investigations or suits that "could reasonably be expected to . . . materially [and] adversely affect the capability of [Bayonne] to comply with its obligations under [the BAN], or materially [and] adversely affect the transactions contemplated to be consummated on the part of [Bayonne] as described in the [BAN]."
         Six months later, in April 2007, Bayonne filed its Chapter 11 petition in the Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. In October 2007, the Bank of New York, master trustee, filed a proof of claim on behalf of Nuveen and other secured creditors totaling $46, 673, 886.79. Nuveen's portion of the claim was for $10, 533, 989.84 (including approximately $10, 000, 000 principal on the BAN, $436, 136.98 in interest, and $97, 852.86 for Nuveen's fees and expenses).
         As a prelude to this action, in May 2008 Nuveen requested that Bayonne provide it with documents to determine whether it had a cause of action against Bayonne's officers, directors, and "pre-petition professionals" for misrepresentations or other conduct that induced Nuveen to purchase the BAN. Bayonne did not respond, and Nuveen served a subpoena on it and then filed a motion to compel. Notably, in the materials accompanying its motion to compel, Nuveen represented that any amounts it recovered from such actions would reduce its claim against Bayonne's bankruptcy estate. It also specifically identified potential suits against Withum and Lindabury.
         No doubt partially in response to Nuveen's (and possibly other creditors') requests for documents, Bayonne made a global settlement agreement among it, the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, and certain secured creditors that included Nuveen (the "Settlement Agreement"). Approved by the Bankruptcy Court in September 2008, the Settlement Agreement provided that it would be implemented by a plan of liquidation. In the event the confirmed plan did not conform to the Settlement Agreement, or Bayonne's bankruptcy case was converted or dismissed, the Agreement would control and survive.1 It further provided that the secured creditors would not pursue claims against any of Bayonne's former officers, directors or trustees, but preserved the secured creditors' right to bring claims against any third parties (i.e., Withum and Lindabury) retained by, or who had rendered services to, Bayonne.
         The Settlement Agreement granted the secured creditors a general unsecured claim in the amount of $46, 673, 886.79 (the dollar amount asserted in the master trustee's proof of claim), which would be reduced "dollar for dollar" for sums received by the secured creditors through certain distributions defined in the Agreement. Thus it effectively fixed Nuveen's claim against Bayonne's estate as a secured claim in an amount to be determined based on funds in Bayonne's estate and an unsecured claim to be paid pro rata with other unsecured claims.
         B. District Court Complaint
         In accordance with the Settlement Agreement, Nuveen filed this action against Withum...

1 In U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2016. Source Ameriprise Q2 Earnings Release. Includes all assets managed by entities in the Columbia and Threadneedle group of companies. Contact us for more current data.
2Source: ICI as of December 31, 2016 for Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC.
3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.

1 In U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2016. Source Ameriprise Q2 Earnings Release. Includes all assets managed by entities in the Columbia and Threadneedle group of companies. Contact us for more current data.
2Source: ICI as of December 31, 2016 for Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC.
3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.

History[edit]
Founded in 1898, Nuveen Investments began as John Nuveen & Company, when founder John Nuveen, Sr. created the firm as an investment banking company specializing in the underwriting and distribution of municipal bonds. John Nuveen formed the company in 1898. The first bond it underwrote was for a Minnesota water company. After World War II, John Nuveen, Jr. helped with the Marshall Plan administration.
In 1969, it was purchased by Investors Diversified Services (IDS). In 1974, the company was sold to The St. Paul Companies. It was privatised in 2007 after being acquired by Private Equity Group led by Madison Dearborn Partners for $5.4 Billion.[2]
The company is also known for a commercial it aired in 2000 during the Super Bowl which, through the aid of computer animation, featured Christopher Reeve "walking" along with several other sufferers of spinal paralysis.
Auction rate securities[edit]
Nuveen came under criticism during 2008 for its involvement in the auction rate securities auction failures,[3] during which assets held in Nuveen's closed-end funds, totaling $15 billion, became illiquid.[4][5] Those funds had two share classes: auction-rate preferred shares that hold first claim on the underlying assets (and pay income at rates set in weekly auctions), and common shares that typically pay higher income in exchange for greater risk of loss of principal. During the auction failures, while common shareholders suffered worse than preferred shareholders in terms of principal losses, they were able to sell their shares on the NYSE while preferred shareholders had no market in which to sell.[4] In response, Nuveen posted a "Nuveen Auction Rate Preferred Resource Center" to inform its investors of its plans to borrow money to pay them back.[6] The company later set refinancing for $2.7 Billion in taxable auction-rate preferred shares and has placed $500 Million of VRDP refinancing for its municipal auction rate preferred shares.[7][8]

Nuveen, formerly Nuveen Investments, is a division of TIAA, operating in asset management. Nuveen was founded in Chicago, Illinois in 1898 and was previously named The John Nuveen Co., after founder John Nuveen. In October 2014, TIAA-CREF completed their purchase of Nuveen.
Nuveen started in the municipal bond underwriting business and remains active in municipal bond market. Nuveen sells services including separately managed accounts, retail mutual funds and closed-end funds. Nuveen has $882 billion in assets under management.[1]

History[edit]
Founded in 1898, Nuveen Investments began as John Nuveen & Company, when founder John Nuveen, Sr. created the firm as an investment banking company specializing in the underwriting and distribution of municipal bonds. John Nuveen formed the company in 1898. The first bond it underwrote was for a Minnesota water company. After World War II, John Nuveen, Jr. helped with the Marshall Plan administration.
In 1969, it was purchased by Investors Diversified Services (IDS). In 1974, the company was sold to The St. Paul Companies. It was privatised in 2007 after being acquired by Private Equity Group led by Madison Dearborn Partners for $5.4 Billion.[2]
The company is also known for a commercial it aired in 2000 during the Super Bowl which, through the aid of computer animation, featured Christopher Reeve "walking" along with several other sufferers of spinal paralysis.
Auction rate securities[edit]
Nuveen came under criticism during 2008 for its involvement in the auction rate securities auction failures,[3] during which assets held in Nuveen's closed-end funds, totaling $15 billion, became illiquid.[4][5] Those funds had two share classes: auction-rate preferred shares that hold first claim on the underlying assets (and pay income at rates set in weekly auctions), and common shares that typically pay higher income in exchange for greater risk of loss of principal. During the auction failures, while common shareholders suffered worse than preferred shareholders in terms of principal losses, they were able to sell their shares on the NYSE while preferred shareholders had no market in which to sell.[4] In response, Nuveen posted a "Nuveen Auction Rate Preferred Resource Center" to inform its investors of its plans to borrow money to pay them back.[6] The company later set refinancing for $2.7 Billion in taxable auction-rate preferred shares and has placed $500 Million of VRDP refinancing for its municipal auction rate preferred shares.[7][8]

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".

We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
