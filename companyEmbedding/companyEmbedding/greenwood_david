Confirmation Bias – Sales Gems – MediumHomepageSales GemsFollowSign in / Sign upDavid GreenwoodBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingCyber Security, Product Psychology, Behavioural EconomicsJul 23Confirmation BiasWe tend to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms our preconceptions.This is a draft chapter of Sales Gems: Using Behavioural Economics and Consumer Psychology to Smash Your Target. Preorder it here.When we have made a decision or build an opinion, we will actively seek things which will confirm our decision or opinion. We will also avoid things which will disconfirm them.According to the Flat Earth model of the universe, the sun and the moon are the same size. The Earth does not orbit around them, as it does not orbit; instead, the sun and moon move in rotating spheres some 2,500 miles above us.The Flat Earth model also finds the North Pole at the center, and, at the outer limits, Antarctica. What most think of as the southernmost continent, is an ice wall wrapped around the Earth’s perimeter like a frame. Flat Earth believers contend that this ice wall “keeps the water in”.You’ll find credible looking mathematical models that argue the theory, photographs taken from a plane showing a flat horizon, and queries about how the seas could ever be round. You won’t find calculations from Eratosthenes who is credited for discovering the Earth was round, photographs taken from space of a round planet, or the widely known force, gravity, which holds the water in the seas.Anything that supports their claim may be grasped hold of and added to stoke the fire of their fervent belief, while evidence that goes against their hypotheses may be brushed aside or even used to fuel a new conspiracy theory.Confirmation Bias isn’t limited to conspiracy theorists. It causes us to vote for politicians, investors to make poor decisions, businesses to focus on the wrong areas, and almost certainly led you to buy this book.Amazon WishlistsThink for a moment; what was the underlying reason you bought this book? Forget the well-crafted blurb or the cover art. Think about the decision you made when walking into the bookstore, or more likely, the words you entered into the search bar.It is almost certain that you believe in the very predictable nature of human psychology and wanted to learn more. Check any Amazon Wish List, and you will find people rarely seek books which challenge their notions of how things are or should be.During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Valdis Krebs, analysed purchasing trends on Amazon. People who already supported Obama were the same people buying books which painted him in a positive light. People who already disliked Obama were the ones buying books painting him in a negative light.People weren’t buying books for the information, they were buying them for the confirmation.Numerical SequenceOne of the most popular ways of teaching the Confirmation Bias demonstrates that people are indeed biased towards confirming their existing beliefs and pragmatically assess the costs of being wrong.29 participants were told that the three numbers “2–4–6“, conformed to a simple relational rule and that their task was to discover the rule by making up successive sets of three numbers (Watson, 1960).For every three numbers the participants tried, the experimenter will tell them whether it satisfies the rule or not. For example, the participant might guess the next three numbers to be “8–10–12“, and the researcher would confirm or deny if this sequence fit the rule.There was no limit to the number combinations each participant was allowed to try until they felt sure about what the rule was and stopped to submit it. However, they were explicitly told to discover the rule citing as few number combinations as possible.The rule researchers used was; the numbers must be in ascending order. That is, any series of increasing numbers will conform to the rule. “1–29–30”, “6,7,8”, or “50,100,1000” would all fit the rule. “10,9,8” would not.Only 20.7% (6) of the participants actually submitted the correct rule. Some of the most common incorrect rules submitted were; increasing intervals of two, multiples of first number, and consecutive even numbers.Almost all subjects tried number combinations that proved the rule they submitted. Take those who believed the rule was “Increasing intervals of two”. They tried sequences like “6–8–12”, then “20–22–24” before submitting their rule. Very few actually tried to make up a number sequence that might disprove their hypothesis. The participants formed a positive test strategy.The subjects did not ask questions to falsify their hypothesis because as much as possible, they do not want to break their own rules. Generally, people indeed find this difficult to do, for they do not want to face the possibility that their beliefs could be wrong.Job SuitabilityThe past is an important aspect of our current and future beliefs. Another group of researchers wanted to understand how Confirmation Bias can affect the way we remember things.33 participants were asked to read 4.5 pages about a week in the life of an imaginary woman named Jane (Synder & Cantor, 1978). Jane did things that showed she could be extroverted in some situations (e.g. socialising during her coffee break) and introverted in a similar number of other situations (e.g. remained shy and timid at the supermarket).Two days later the participants returned. Researchers divided the people into groups and asked them to help decide if Jane would be suited for a particular job. One group was asked if she would be a suited to a job as a Research Librarian and explicitly told the best Research Librarians had introverted traits. The other group was asked if she would be suited to a job as a Real Estate Salesperson and explicitly told the best Real Estate Salespersons had extroverted traits.Participants were then asked to write down all of Jane’s’ personal traits from the story that they considered relevant to assessing how well suited Jane was for the job in question.Researchers found that half the participants considering Jane for the position of Real Estate Salesperson (extroverted job type) saw her more as an extrovert, remembering her more of her extroverted traits (4.03) than introverted ones (1.00). However, participants considering Jane for a Research Librarian position (introverted job type) saw her as introvert, remembering almost twice as many of her introverted traits (2.56) than extroverted ones (1.28). Participants recall was heavily influenced by information they learned about each job.All participants were then asked to report their judgments of Jane’s suitability for the job of Real Estate Salesperson Salesperson or Research Librarian on a 6-point scale from 1 (extremely unsuited) to 6 (extremely well suited).Those that reported Jane to have more extroverted traits believed she would make an above average Real Estate Salesperson (4.41), a job well suited to extroverts, but a below average Research Librarian (2.50), a job more suited to introverted. In doing so they were confirming their belief Jane was an extrovert. Similarly, those that reported Jane to have more introverted believed the opposite. While they reported here a being well suited as a Research Librarian (5.00) they believed she would make a worse Real Estate Agent (3.29)The study suggests our memories fall prey to confirmation bias, recalling those things that support even recently-arrived-at beliefs and forgetting those things that contradict them.HiringThe Job Suitability experiment report has real implications to the way hiring managers make decisions. In many cases, bad ones. The researchers were able to clearly demonstrate when hiring.25 participants were asked to prepare two lists of the traits that they would want to know about a candidate applying for the position of Research Librarian and for a Real Estate Salesperson (Synder & Cantor, 1978). In essence they were crafting two job descriptions. Participants were then asked to rate if the traits they listed made someone “suited” or “unsuited” to the job. For example, they might want to know if the Real Estate Salesperson candidate could drive (suited) or had no experience selling homes (unsuited).The participants wrote down significantly more suited attributes (4.89 for Real Estate Salesperson / 3.67 for Research Librarian) than unsuited attributes (0.11 for Real Estate Salesperson / 0.24 for Research Librarian). Again, they were using a positive test strategy to craft their perfect candidates.Researches also examining 7415 “Help wanted ads” in local newspapers alongside this study. They found only 33 of them informed prospective candidates of attributes that would make them unsuited for the job being advertised. The Confirmation Bias can result in neglect of attributes of inconsistent with our beliefs.Political ViewsThe Confirmation Bias is perhaps most apparent in supporters of opposing political parties, and is the reason why many voters support the same party for their entire lives.In one experiment, 156 participants were asked to respond to 17 questions about different political issues (Knobloch-Westerwick, 2009). Issues included gun ownership and abortion. The participants rated their support for each issue on an 11 point scale from –5 (strongly opposing) to 5 (strongly supporting).6 weeks later, participants returned and were asked to browse an online news magazine. Four political issues chosen from the 17 original issues were covered in eight articles, with two articles featuring opposing perspectives to those of the participant.The participants were much more likely to choose an article with a message consistent with their beliefs (57.5%) versus one that contradicted them (42.5%).Participants also spent 152 seconds on average looking at articles consistent with their beliefs whilst only 112 seconds on opposing articles. Put another way, the participants spent 40 seconds more time (36%) on articles that confirmed their attitudes, than those that challenged them! We are much more likely to select and spend time on material that aligns to our current beliefs, when compared with information that opposes our beliefs.The Colbert ReportResearchers wondered how we processed events that conform or challenge our existing beliefs.To examine their hypothesis, researchers conducted an experiment that saw 332 participants analyse the political satire in a late-nate US comedy talk-show, The Colbert Report (LaMarre, Landreville, Beam, 2009).Each participant was shown the same 3-minute video in which Colbert interviews liberal talk radio host Amy Goodman from Democracy Now!. In the clip, Colbert introduces Goodman as a “super liberal lefty.” and argues the conservatives are “right” on a number of issues, including the Iraq War, and the liberals are “wrong”.Participants were than asked to rate their own political ideology on a 7-point scale from 1 (liberal) to 7 (conservative). Similarly the participants were asked to rate the perceived political ideology and affiliation of Colbert on a 5-point scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).There was a significant positive relationship between individual level political conservatism and perceptions of Colberts beliefs (B = 0.37). Conservatives were more likely to report that Colbert only pretends to be joking and genuinely meant what he said while liberals were more likely to report that Colbert used satire and was not serious when offering political statements.The ambiguous deadpan political satire offered by Stephen Colbert is interpreted by audiences in a manner that best fits with their individual political beliefs.Product GemsStay open-mindedWhen there are disagreements, conduct a non-emotional discussion or debate with those who offer up opposing views and see how they came up with their belief. This can be especially useful in prospect or customer focused meetings. Sharing experiences and reasoning might open one party’s mind to the others way of thinking.Be careful with your researchProduct designers should be careful when researching new features. Make sure any research covers a diverse set of participants. Set yourself a goal to invalidate your hypotheses and recognise when your ego is influencing your work.Push teams to prove assumptions wrongWarren Buffett, one of the most successful investors of our time is well aware of Confirmation Bias and one of his first actions before making an investment decision is to voice to opinions that contradict his own. At one annual investor meeting, Buffett invited hedge fund trader Doug Kass to participate. Kass is a critic of Buffett and his investment style, and is actually betting against Berkshire Hathaway stock by shorting it.Prototype and test aggressively (and plan for refinement)When we understand that our first assumptions will not be correct and plan for failure, we allow teams to find the correct answer instead of going with the simple and easy hypothesis.Ask better questionsOne of the most worthless questions to ask a customer is “How do we do?” It’s worthless because you’ll never get any constructive feedback. A much better question is, “What could we have done differently to make it better?” By changing the question ever so slightly, you’ll be shocked at the honest advice you’ll hear.Think about market biasesConsider how the market view some of your messaging, especially for highly innovative products. You might hear people talk about products that were “too early for the market”. If there are existing confirmation biases in your target customer base, it can be an expensive and time consuming task to get consumer eyeballs if you’re introducing a proposition that tests their existing beliefs. This is especially true if you are shaping a sales strategy to steal customers from a market incumbent who has told them for years “how it should be done”.Data helps, but it is by no means certainQualitative measures are much better to use in arguments due to their inherent factual nature. However, you should make it clear how data points should be interpreted. A 2013 study found that confirmation bias can affect the way that people view statistics (Kahan et.al., 2013). Its authors report that people have a tendency to infer information from statistics that supports their existing beliefs, even when the data support an opposing view.Surround yourself with a diverse group of peopleTry to build a diverse team of individuals. Don’t hire because you think you’ve got an idea of the perfect candidate. Discuss your thoughts with your existing team and don’t be afraid to foster to dissenting views. Seek out people that challenge your opinions, perhaps someone in a different team, or assign someone on your team to play “devil’s advocate” for major decisions.This is a draft chapter of Sales Gems: Using Behavioural Economics and Consumer Psychology to Smash Your Target.

From what you'll eat to whether you should buy a new car, research suggests that there are a number of cognitive biases that can effect the way we make a decision.
Product Gems explores 30 of the most common biases from the point-of-view of a product owner to show you how to build products that will sell, and more importantly be adored by consumers.
In each chapter you'll find clear explanations of experiments that have been conducted for a cognitive bias, and a breakdown of powerful techniques - or Product Gems - you can implement from their outcome.
