The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

 NIGHTWATCH® is the first equine distress & wellness monitor (patent protected) designed to continuously analyze real-time data on a horse’s vital signs and behaviors, and alert caretakers via SMS/text, phone call, and/or email at the early signs of danger/distress (eg, colic, being cast), and other conditions where intervention may be warranted (eg, foaling).Horse owners, caretakers, and veterinarians alike can gain meaningful insight into a horse’s wellness, including that animal’s Equine Distress Index (EDI™) score―an objective measure of relative distress, anytime from the convenience of a smartphone or web dashboard.







The system’s smart technology is non-invasively embedded within the soft leather crown of a either a specially-designed breakaway halter or safety collar making NIGHTWATCH® safe and comfortable for round-the-clock use on horses in stalls, in pastures, and while in transit.  Strategic PartnersProtequus® is proud to offer NIGHTWATCH® for horses domiciled in the United States and Canada (other countries in late 2017), and is aggressively working in collaboration with several strategic partners to deliver unprecedented results and value.

April 20, 2015—Protequus LLC, an Austin-based biomedical engineering firm, is pleased to announce the late-stage development of NIGHTWATCH™ (www.nightwatch24.com), the first and only equine distress & wellness monitor (patent pending).NIGHTWATCH™ is an innovative smart halter/collar designed to continuously analyze real-time data on a horse’s biometrics (ie, vital signs) and behaviors (ie, activities, motions, and posture), and send a wireless notification to a caretaker on their mobile device when abnormalities or novel events indicative of distress are detected. All technology is embedded within the soft leather crown of either a breakaway halter or safety collar making NIGHTWATCH™ safe and comfortable for round-the-clock use on horses in stalls, in pastures, and while in transit.For the first time equine enthusiasts can rest easy knowing their horse is being monitored 24/7. Horse owners, caretakers, and veterinarians alike can gain meaningful insight anytime into a horse's well-being, including that animal’s Equine Distress Index™ (EDI) score―an objective measure of relative distress, from the convenience of a smartphone or web dashboard. To maximize precision and benefit, proprietary algorithms are continuously being updated as each NIGHTWATCH™ halter/collar learns that horse’s unique biometric parameters and behavioral patterns.NIGHTWATCH™ is among a new and growing class of IoT (Internet of Things)-enabled devices, which are devices embedded with electronics, software, and sensors that interoperate within the existing internet infrastructure. The enhanced ability for NIGHTWATCH™ to communicate over both cellular and Wi-Fi networks allows for maximum coverage within the United States, while GPS technology tracks and pinpoints the location.Protequus is committed to making NIGHTWATCH™ available for preorder in the United States starting late 2015, and is aggressively working in collaboration with several strategic partners to deliver unprecedented results and value. Each partner is a recognized leader within their respective fields of veterinarian medicine & equine health, electrical engineering & artificial intelligence, and leather craftsmanship. These partners include Hagyard Equine Medical Institute (Lexington, KY), Rochester Institute of Technology (Rochester, NY), and Freedman’s (Toronto, Canada).###About Protequus Protequus LLC (www.protequus.com) is a premier biomedical engineering firm based in Austin, TX dedicated to equine health & safety. Founded in 2013 by Jeffrey R. Schab, a two-time World Champion equestrian and biomedical engineer, Protequus is comprised of advanced degree science and technology professionals who share a relentless commitment to excellence and a passion for horses. Their pursuit to find a solution to combat the devastating impact of equine colic has put Protequus on the fast-track for success.

 For Every Problem There is a Solution 




























 

Here at Protequus®, we are passionate about horses and working day and night to tackle some of the most significant ailments afflicting horses of all disciplines. Born from respect for these majestic animals and frustration with the status quo, we are dedicated to the ideation, creation, and commercialization of value-add solutions for the protection of horses. Our first solution, NIGHTWATCH®, not only has the potential to save the lives of many horses, but also transform how we think about health & wellness monitoring in companion animals and livestock.

THE PROBLEM: Equine Distress   Nearly 40% of the estimated 9.2 million horses in the United States are used for performance (ie, racing and showing), which means more than 3.5 million horses are at increased risk for developing colic, getting cast, or experiencing other forms of distress. Unfortunately, signs of distress can be elusive and transient, and often occur overnight or at remote locations when/where caretakers are not present resulting in delayed intervention. Delayed intervention is a negative prognostic factor that has dire impact on survival and quality of life outcomes.  To address this problem Protequus has developed NIGHTWATCH®, a revolutionary smart halter/collar that remotely monitors horses and alerts caretakers via text, phone call, and/or email for early intervention when danger/distress is detected. NIGHTWATCH®  removes all guesswork by acquiring, analyzing, and presenting empirical evidence of equine distress & wellness.
