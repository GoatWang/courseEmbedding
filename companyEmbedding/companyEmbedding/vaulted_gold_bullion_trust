(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Overview  The Vaulted Gold Bullion Trust (the "Trust") issues Depositary Receipts ("Gold Deposit Receipts") representing an undivided beneficial ownership in a fixed quantity of unencumbered, allocated, physical gold bullion ("Gold Bullion"). The Trust was initially formed on December 10, 2013. The Trust is governed by the Amended and Restated Depositary Trust Agreement, dated June 29, 2016 (the "Depositary Trust Agreement"), by and among The Bank of New York Mellon, as "Trustee," BNY Trust of Delaware, as "Delaware Trustee," Bank of Montreal, as "Initial Depositor," and BMO Capital Markets Corp., as "Underwriter." The Trust is not a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Trust is not a commodity pool for purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act, and the Initial Depositor is not subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a commodity pool operator, or a commodity trading advisor.  One Gold Deposit Receipt represents the undivided beneficial ownership of one troy ounce of Gold Bullion. The Trustee performs only administrative and ministerial acts. The property of the Trust consists of the Gold Bullion and all monies or other property, if any, received by the Trustee. The Initial Depositor sells Gold Bullion to the Trust. The Gold Bullion is held for the benefit of holders of Gold Deposit Receipts in an account operated by the Initial Depositor at the Royal Canadian Mint.  The Trust is not managed like a corporation or an active investment vehicle. It does not have any officers, directors, or employees and is administered by the Trustee pursuant to the Depositary Trust Agreement. The expenses of the Trust are borne by the Initial Depositor. There were 166 Gold Deposit Receipts outstanding as of January 31, 2017.  The fiscal year end for the Trust is October 31.  Gold Industry  The participants in the gold industry may be classified in the following sectors: (1) mining and producer; (2) banking; (3) official; (4) investment; and  Mining and Producer Sector. This group includes mining companies that specialize in gold and silver production; mining companies that produce gold as a byproduct of other production (such as a copper or silver producer); scrap merchants; and recyclers.  Banking Sector. Bullion banks provide a variety of services to the gold industry and its participants, thereby facilitating interactions between other parties. Services provided by the bullion banking community include traditional banking products as well as mine financing, physical gold purchases and sales, hedging and risk management, inventory management for industrial users and consumers, and gold deposit and loan instruments.  The Official Sector. The official sector encompasses the activities of the various central banking operations of gold-holding countries. In September 1999, a group of 15 central banks acting to clarify their intentions with respect to their gold holdings signed the Central Bank Gold Agreement commonly called the "Washington Agreement on Gold." The signatories included the European Central Bank (the "ECB") and the central banks of Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and England. The original agreement limited incremental sales by the 15 signatories to 400 tonnes per annum over the ensuing five-year period. The original Washington Agreement on Gold expired in September 2004, and was renewed by almost all of the original signatories for a second five-year period (England did not renew in 2004). The second Washington Accord Agreement expired in September 2009 and was renewed again by all signatories of the second agreement for a third agreement to last another five-year period. In addition, the central banks of Cyprus, Greece, Malta, Slovakia and Slovenia signed in 2009. The annum limit on gold sales under the third agreement was 400 tonnes, with total sales not to exceed 2,000 tonnes in the five-year period. In May 2014, before the third agreement was set to expire in September 2014, a fourth agreement was reached between the ECB and the central banks of Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, which will expire after a five-year period. The signatories have agreed to, among other things, continue to coordinate their gold transactions to avoid disturbances to the gold market and have acknowledged that they each do not have plans to sell significant amounts of gold.  The Investment Sector. This sector includes the investment and trading activities of both professional and private investors and speculators. These participants range from large hedge and mutual funds to day-traders on futures exchanges and retail-level coin collectors.  The Manufacturing Sector. The fabrication and manufacturing sector represents all the commercial and industrial users of gold for whom gold is a daily part of their business. The jewelry industry is a large user of gold. Other industrial users of gold include the electronics and dental industries.

Investors, however, should also be aware that past movements in the gold price are not indicators of future movements.  The following chart provides historical background on the price of gold. The chart illustrates movements in the price of gold in U.S. dollars per ounce over the period from October 2006 to January 2017, and is based on the LBMA (PM) Gold Price, an offering of ICE Benchmark Administration.  [[Image Removed]]  Source: The London Bullion Market Association (accessed January 2017)  After a rapid rise starting in the second half of 2005 through mid-2006, there was a period of short decline and volatility in the price of gold lasting through the end of that year. In May 2006, the peak was $725 per ounce. Until about August of 2007, prices were below that high, but since have moved up strongly, reaching a new high of $1,011.25 on March 17, 2008, and ending at $869.75 per ounce on December 30, 2008. Gold prices were quite volatile between the March 2008 high and the end of December 2008 with run-ups and falls of over $150 in each direction. The significant price movements reflect the battles between inflationary and deflationary pressures, U.S. Dollar strengthening against many major currencies and global economic uncertainty going into 2009.  The price of gold continued its upward trend in 2009. After rallying to $1,212.50 per ounce in early December 2009, it fell back down to $1,087.50 per ounce to close the year following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. This still resulted in a gain of over 25 percent for 2009. Upward price movement for gold price continued in 2010, reaching a new pre-inflation adjusted record high of $1,421.00 per ounce on November 9, 2010 and closing at $1,405.50 per ounce on December 30, 2010. In August 2011, the price of gold experienced a notable increase partially due to the first U.S. downgrade by Standard & Poor's, reaching a high of $1895.00 per ounce on September 5, 2011. By December 29, 2011, the price of gold had fallen to $1,531.00 per ounce. The annual average price of gold in 2012 was 6.2 percent higher than 2011, reaching a high of $1,791.75 on October 4, 2012. In particular, uncertainty over U.S. monetary policy became an increasingly significant driver of market appetite towards the end of 2012, and on December 28, 2012, the price of gold had fallen slightly to $1,657.50 per ounce.  In 2013, the twelve-year bull run of gold ended. 2013 opened near the annual high, and the price declined approximately 29 percent over the year to $1,204.50 per ounce on December 30, 2013. For 2013, the price of gold was impacted, in part, by improving sentiment towards the U.S. economy, which contributed to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar and equities, luring investors away from gold in the process. During 2014, the underlying driver behind investor sentiment of gold was global monetary policy. On one end, the improving economic conditions in the United States (along with the announcement of the Federal Reserve Board's tapering measures at the end of 2013) diminished demand for gold for U.S. investors, while loosening of monetary policy in other advanced and emerging markets enhanced demand for gold globally, causing gold prices to fluctuate between a low of $1,132.00 and a high of $1,392.00 per ounce. Gold prices deteriorated throughout 2015, in part as a result of the Federal Reserve Board's announcement that it would raise interest rates as well as a significant rally of the U.S. dollar index, falling to $1,060.00 per ounce on December 30, 2015. However, the price of gold rebounded during the first half of 2016. In July 2016, gold prices experienced a rapid increase following the United Kingdom's referendum held on June 23, 2016 to leave the European Union (i.e., "Brexit"), reaching a 28-month high of $1,366.25 per ounce on July 6, 2016. The initial market volatility and negative sentiment in connection with Brexit has somewhat subsided and gold prices have receded from the high prices displayed during July 2016, leveling off at prices similarly exhibited during the beginning of 2016.  As of March 15, 2017, the price of gold was $1,198.00 per ounce.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The Trust is not aware of any trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs. In exchange for the Initial Depositor's fee, the Initial Depositor has agreed to assume the expenses incurred by the Trust.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  The Trust has no off-balance sheet arrangements.  Critical Accounting Policies  The Trust prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  The Trust has adopted the provisions of Topic 946, Investment Companies, and follows specialized accounting. As a result of the adoption of this provision, the Trust records its investment in gold at fair value and expects that there will be fluctuations in the value of investments based on changes in the price of gold.

BMO GOLDRs® are issued by the Vaulted Gold Bullion Trust (the "Trust"). The objective of the Trust is to provide a secure, convenient and transparent way for investors to invest in unencumbered, allocated, physical gold bullion ("Gold Bullion") on a spot basis. BMO GOLDRs® are not issued by (or guaranteed by) Bank of Montreal and are not bank deposits.
BMO GOLDRs® are not listed on a securities exchange and are continuously offered through BMO Capital Markets Corp., acting as underwriter. BMO Capital Markets Corp. will enter into dealer agreements with certain third parties that are registered broker-dealers, or banks or trust companies regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and/or one or more state banking regulators that are either direct or indirect DTC participants ("Authorized Participants"). Only Authorized Participants will be involved in the distribution of BMO GOLDRs®. BMO GOLDRs® may be redeemed through Authorized Participants or through a registered broker-dealer or similar entity that is not an Authorized Participant. Under no circumstances can any purchase of BMO GOLDRs® be made with borrowed funds or leverage from, or on margin provided by, an Authorized Participant. While BMO currently intends to repurchase Gold Bullion for cash upon the request of holders based on the market price for the Gold Bullion, it is under no obligation to do so, and may cease such repurchases at any time. Physical delivery of Gold Bullion may be suspended by the Trust in certain circumstances and is only available in certain states. A holder will be required to pay a delivery fee and applicable taxes to receive physical gold.
BMO GOLDRs® are issued by the Trust. The Trust is neither an investment company registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940 nor a commodity pool for purposes of the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act. The Trust is not actively managed. BMO GOLDRs® are not interests in, nor obligations of, Bank of Montreal. An investment in BMO GOLDRs® may not be appropriate for all investors and is subject to significant risks and investors should carefully consider the risk factors contained in the prospectus prior to making an investment decision. Investors can review the prospectus, including "Risk Factors" beginning on page 14, by clicking here.
BMO GOLDRs® will be issued pursuant to a registration statement that was previously filed with, and declared effective by, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Before you invest, you should read the final prospectus that has been filed with the SEC for more complete information about the offering. Any offer will be made only by means of a prospectus, which may be obtained for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the Trust will arrange to send you the prospectus if you request it by calling toll-free 1-844-266-4537 or emailing bmo.gold@bmo.com.
This website does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of the BMO GOLDRs® in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.
U.S. Sales Restrictions and Notices

BMO GOLDRs® may be sold to institutional investors in any state or Puerto Rico. Retail investors should familiarize themselves with the below restrictions.

The term "institutional investor" is understood to mean:

a) An investment adviser registered either with the SEC under Section 203 of the Investment Advisers Act or with a state securities commission (or any agency or office performing like functions),

b) Any other person (whether a natural person, corporation, partnership, trust, or otherwise) with total assets of at least $50 million, or

c) A bank, savings and loan association, insurance company or registered investment company with the SEC.
BMO GOLDRs® are not approved for sale and should not be sold to residents of the states of Alabama, Arizona or Tennessee, other than to institutional investors. All sales in the states of Arkansas, North Carolina and Texas will only be made by a broker-dealer registered in such state. California investors must be able to evidence either (a) $65,000 annual gross income and $250,000 liquid net worth (as defined below) or (b) $500,000 liquid net worth. Oregon and Oklahoma investors must be able to evidence a liquid net worth (as defined below) of $250,000 or more to invest in this offering.

Arkansas and Massachusetts investors must be able to evidence either (a) $100,000 annual net income and $100,000 liquid net worth or (b) $250,000 liquid net worth. It shall be unsuitable for a retail investor’s aggregate investment in BMO GOLDRs® to exceed ten percent (10%) of his, her, or its liquid net worth. "Liquid net worth" shall be defined as that portion of net worth (total assets exclusive of home, home furnishings, and automobiles minus total liabilities) that is comprised of cash, cash equivalents, and readily marketable securities. Please consult your financial and tax adviser.
Canadian Sales Restrictions and Notices

The Gold Deposit Receipts may be sold only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal that are accredited investors, as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or Subsection 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), and are permitted clients, as defined in National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations.

Why BullionVault was set up
BullionVault was set up to solve two problems that made it very difficult for private individuals to buy, store and sell gold in a simple, safe and cost-effective way.

Read more









									The problems


Private individuals didn't have access to the professional bullion market.
The best prices for gold and silver are available on the professional bullion market, where dealers, refiners, government agencies and bullion banks trade.
But this market only deals gold in 400 oz good delivery bars, which cost around $500,000 each. (The silver bars weigh 1,000 oz.)
This puts the best prices out of reach of most private individuals.


Private individuals didn't have access to professional vaults.
Good delivery bars are stored in accredited vaults.
The vaults have a high minimum monthly charge, so you would need about 15 of these 400 oz gold bars, worth around $7,000,000, to make it economic for you to open an account yourself.
The large starting balance tends to make the system inaccessible to private customers.



									The solution

With BullionVault you can access the professional market and buy part of a good delivery bar - or even whole bars.
You'll benefit from the same low costs for buying and storing as the professionals, and you'll be participating in the deepest pool of physical gold and silver liquidity in the world.


Whether buying or selling you get the best professional bullion market prices.
All BullionVault gold and silver is good delivery, which is the purest and most trusted form of bullion. It commands the highest prices when you sell.


BullionVault metal is held fully allocated to BullionVault users. It is insured, and stored in your choice of location. The bullion is your legal, physical property.
No-one matches our dealing or storage charges.

Cut the cost of buying gold and silver

BullionVault is the world's biggest online bullion market. Economies of scale mean you can buy, sell and store gold and silver at close to wholesale prices.
The professional good delivery system gets you big savings, and so too does the internet. BullionVault connects buyers and sellers from all over the world. They can all quote prices to each other when they wish to buy or sell; and so can you. Like any exchange this price competition forces everyone - including BullionVault itself - to quote highly competitive prices, and you always get the best quoted price, from whoever is quoting it.





Lowest costs





Saving on insurance too





Avoiding the high cost of currency conversion





How do our storage rates compare?






The cost of ownership for the average BullionVault user who buys gold through our order board and owns it for 5 years works out at 0.32% per annum - which includes all dealing, storage and insurance costs.
The ownership cost for larger users ($1m) works out at just 0.17% per annum over the same five year period.


It's tempting to think something is only safe when we look after it ourselves. But insurers rate privately held gold as very high risk, so arranging insurance is both difficult and expensive.
According to the insurance actuaries who evaluate them the professional bullion vaults are the safest place in the world to store gold, so insurance costs much less. We include it in your storage fee, which saves you money and a great deal of time.


Most banks charge 3 to 4 percent when buying or selling foreign currency.
At BullionVault, there is deep gold liquidity in Dollars, Pounds Sterling, Euros and Yen. This means you'll get the best price no matter which currency you prefer.


The annual management cost of the major ETFs is 0.4%, which is over 3 times higher than BullionVault's 0.12% storage rate for gold.
Allocated storage at a bank would usually cost around 10 times our allocated storage rate.

Why are BullionVault prices so much better than the competition?







You'll have seen the current prices for buying gold, and selling, on our front page. At the moment, in ounces, it’s about [Sell]  –  [Buy]. Where do our gold, silver and platinum prices come from? They come from other BullionVault users, just like you.BullionVault offers a marketplace exchange in accredited, pre-vaulted, privately owned, professional market bullion. You get to deal directly with another user who wants to sell when you want to buy, and vice-versa. You both save money by cutting out the middleman, both when you buy and when you sell.It’s easy too. You'll check the price on a price chart, choose your own dealing limit price, and enter your order.The more competitive the price you post the higher your chance of doing a deal, and if you offer to pay the price at which somebody is already offering (the ‘Buy‘ price, or ‘Best Offer‘ - here ) you'll deal straight away.There is 24/7 competition between users to offer each other the best price. That’s why BullionVault prices are genuinely ‘competitive’.Our website makes using an exchange very simple and safe for you, and people from all over the world have quickly got the hang of it and empowered themselves to deal gold cheaper. Open exchanges and competing quotes get you better prices. That's why we do it this way. But if you're a bit nervous just call us. We're more than happy to help you through your deal on the telephone.











How deep is BullionVault's liquidity?







BullionVault offers you exceptionally reliable and deep liquidity through four complementary channels.The best price is usually offered by another BullionVault user. You deal direct with them, cutting out the middleman to your mutual advantage. This direct client-to-client dealing accounts for about 65% of trading volume on BullionVault.However clients aren't forced to quote great prices, so about 35% of the time our own price is better for you. That means you'll trade directly with BullionVault itself – via one of our robots.'Robots' are computer programs which receive an electronic price feed and use it to quote prices on the BullionVault Order Board in just the same way as you and other clients do. Ours manage BullionVault's own $40 million inventory. Robots are subject to the same limitations as you, which means they can only sell what they already own physically in the vault, or buy with their cleared cash balance. You buy from them, or sell to them, just like you would directly with another client, but only while they offer a better price. It's as simple as that.BullionVault's robots usually quote prices in larger quantities than most clients do; sufficient to deal $2m worth instantaneously when world bullion markets are open. In normal circumstances they quote prices 24/7 and offer the most dependable and instantly accessible medium-size liquidity of any bullion trading environment anywhere in the world.Clients with an interest in computer programming often develop robots for themselves and use them to trade like professional dealers. This brings yet more liquidity to the marketplace.Sometimes, like on the day Lehman Brothers went bust, clients acquire all the immediately available stock from our robots. Although we immediately buy new stock to replace what was sold it takes 48 hours to be delivered, and because the gold is not yet in the vault the robots have no stock to sell.At such times you benefit enormously from the access BullionVault gives you to the liquidity of the full depth of the London market. You can enter an order to buy or sell at the benchmark prices published by the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA). These prices represent the deepest daily pool of bullion market liquidity in the world – typically restricted just to professionals, which is why you access it through us.We allow you to buy or sell as much gold as you want at the daily price, and we take onto our own stock the rounded up fraction of a 400 oz bar.The London Prices published by the LBMA are used widely all around the world.Finally we offer a special service for larger clients. They can telephone deal through us directly on the London Spot Market. During the London trading day they can deal whole bars of gold (400 oz multiples), half pallets of silver (16,000 oz multiples) or a minimum of 16 kg of platinum at the world market price.You might not realise how this service for wealthy customers contributes to your liquidity; but it does.Suppose a wealthy client had 400 oz of gold in BullionVault already, but with heavy demand from buyers there were few offers on the Order Board. The cheapest gold on BullionVault would start to drift above the world market price, as bidders bid over the world price. But the wealthy client can execute a spot market order to buy at the world market price, and offer the gold they already own in the vault to other BullionVault users for a small but easy profit.That's natural market forces being used to keep liquidity flowing at fair prices – and it works on BullionVault because anyone who can make settlement to the main market, in whole bars, can use the main market as a source or sink of bullion.We believe the best way to offer you highly reliable and fairly priced liquidity is to open channels to the largest number of market participants and back it up with access to the deepest markets. Most of our competitors provide you with a single counterparty – themselves – and this reflects in their pricing. So if reliable liquidity at fair prices is what you are looking for, then BullionVault sets the standard.Main market trades in options 3 and 4 incur a two business day settlement delay and have a different fee structure. Please see the tariff.











Is BullionVault open- or closed-ended?







BullionVault is open-ended. An inbound or outbound armoured delivery is run whenever there are several bars to collect or deliver. Usually this is about twice a week.BullionVault itself is the main user of this open-ended structure, which lets us manage our own inventory to act as a buffer between the smaller investment sizes typical of retail investors, and the larger settlement quanta of the professional bullion market.However any BullionVault user who wishes to make or take delivery of 1 bar of gold (400 oz), a half pallet of silver (16,000 oz) or a minimum of 16 kg of platinum can use the same open-ended nature of the system by settling their professional spot market trades directly into or out of the vault.











How does BullionVault compare to coins/bars and ETFs?







Compared to coins and small barsCoins and small bars are normally 7% more expensive than gold on BullionVault. Dealers also tend to buy back at a discount of about 1%. BullionVault prices can be compared reliably against the published spot price. Our gold buying and selling prices are usually well within 0.2% of spot, and silver and platinum within 1%.Although storing coins and small bars at home is free, it is not usually the wise geopolitical option. You will probably need to arrange your own insurance. For gold this is likely to be 10 times as much as BullionVault's combined storage and insurance fee of 0.12% for gold.Compared to ETFs (Exchange-traded funds)With ETFs, you never actually own physical gold. According to their trust deeds some ETFs are not even backed by gold; they are designed to track the gold price using complex derivatives. At BullionVault, we don't make something complex out of something simple. You own your gold.With ETFs, you would pay a storage fee of around 0.40%, and most ETF gold is not insured, even within that fee. At BullionVault, storage and insurance costs just 0.12% per annum for gold.The huge majority of ETF gold is stored in London and New York. The ETF manager chooses the jurisdiction – you don't. At BullionVault, we believe a choice of storage jurisdictions is important – as is the ability to switch. We let you choose. About 75% of our users choose Zurich, in Switzerland.ETFs are traded on major stock exchanges, which tend to be open 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. They settle to your stockbroker in two or three days, who then settles with you. At BullionVault, we are open for dealing 24/7 with instantaneous settlement to your BullionVault account. A requested withdrawal to your bank account will usually be sent and arrive the following business day.















Who manages BullionVault?







Acting through the Chief Executive the BullionVault Board directs company policy to be implemented by the management team.The management team is:Paul TustainChairmanRobert GlynneChief ExecutiveJustina PrytulaFinance DirectorDavid HemmingsCTO (Chief Technology Officer)Adrian AshResearch DirectorMaria VengutHead of Customer ServicesDaniel JayMarketing DirectorJohnny StewartProduct & Operations DirectorIn total the company employs 32 people at its London office.











Is BullionVault a safe organisation to do business with?







Having first won The Queen's Award for Enterprise, for Innovation, in 2009, BullionVault again won in 2013 for International Trade.  The award is conferred by the UK's Prime Minister on behalf of the Queen.Both BullionVault and its vault operators are full members of the London Bullion Market Association, [LBMA]. The LBMA forms the largest marketplace in the world for physical gold bullion.BullionVault is also a member of the London Platinum and Palladium Market, [LPPM]. The LPPM is a trade association that acts as the markets principal point of contact with regulators and other official bodies, such as HM Revenue and Customs.BullionVault is ranked number 11 in the 2012 Sunday Times TopTrack 250 league table of Britain's leading private companies.BullionVault operates without gearing and carries sufficient surplus shareholders funds - held as cash and available at short notice - to operate with zero revenue for five years. For full financial figures please download the latest audited financial statements.BullionVault publishes up-to-date Bar Lists from the vault operators it uses and publishes on-line the daily reconciliation of those bar lists to the daily register of bullion owners – which includes your holding listed under your private alias.BullionVault publishes up-to-date Client Money Bank Statements and publishes on-line the daily reconciliation of those statements to the daily register of client money owners – which includes your holding listed under your private alias.BullionVault's independent assayers are Alex Stewart International who annually inspect and reconcile the physical metal in the vault to the bar list, and report directly to BullionVault's auditors Albert Goodman, who publish that report on their own website.Although we communicate with the world via the internet BullionVault is a bricks-and-mortar business which welcomes your visit.  Come to our offices at Landmark House (12th Floor), Blacks Road, Hammersmith, London, W6 9DP, UK.  You don't need an appointment, although it would likely save you some waiting time.











What would happen if BullionVault failed?







Your ownership and title would not be affected, although there would likely be a short delay before you could realise its value, while a liquidator was appointed.A liquidator could not claim title to your bullion. That’s because you are the legal owner of all gold, silver and platinum that you buy through BullionVault. BullionVault is acting as a custodian, which is a status that's very different from your bank, and immeasurably safer for you.With a bank account, you transfer ownership of your money to the bank when you make a deposit. Your money then appears on the bank's balance sheet, and you become its creditor. The bank would become insolvent (and fail) if there were insufficient assets to meet the liabilities owed to all its creditors, and that tends to happen to banks periodically because their business is to lend your money for profit, not simply keep it in a vault.You have not made a deposit of gold to BullionVault. You are not BullionVault's creditor and do not appear on its balance sheet. Technically your gold, silver and platinum is the subject of a bailment - a legal status through which physical property remains yours while it is in the care of another. A liquidator cannot consider it an asset of the company, so would have no claim over it and must return it to you in full.BullionVault's finances are very strong. Very few companies maintain debt free cash and bullion reserves - available at short notice - sufficient to cover the gross costs of running their operation for five years without any revenue. The standard equivalent requirement for the banking industry is 3 months.











How can I be sure of the quality of the bullion?







Good delivery bars are manufactured by accredited refiners who are regularly subjected to double-blind tests by independent assayers. The bars spend their lives in accredited storage facilities and are transported only by accredited couriers.They are the only form of gold automatically trusted upon receipt by professional buyers.Once a year we send in independent specialist assayers who inspect the bullion and report to our auditors, who then publish the report on their own website for your inspection.We are completely confident regarding the quality of the bullion in our care, and provide a full, permanent, 100% guarantee of its quality.BullionVault gold bars are all of known weight and purity, which exceeds 99.5%. As with the rest of the professional bullion market only the pure gold content (gross weight * purity) is traded and recorded. The gold in your BullionVault account is therefore 100% pure.Silver and platinum are different. Good delivery silver and platinum bars are refined to 99.9% purity or better for silver and 99.95% purity or better for platinum and traded at gross weight. The good delivery silver and platinum in your account is at least 99.9% or 99.95% pure, respectively.











How can I be sure the gold and silver is in the vault?







Your gold and silver is stored in formally recognised bullion storage facilities, managed by specialist vault operators who are leading providers of precious metal vault services and secure transportation around the world.Professional market vault operators produce what is called a Bar List. It's a bit like a bank statement, listing the account holder's stock of bars, and showing both gold and silver content of each bar and the total amount of bullion held. We publish the bar lists produced by the vault operators for BullionVault users' gold and silver.BullionVault maintains the ownership records of all that bullion. Each day we publish online our daily register of owners, although we hide your identity by listing your holding against your alias. We also publish the total, and naturally the total matches the total on the bar list.No other bullion business provides this daily and independent client-by-client proof that the right amounts of gold, silver and platinum are in the vault.











Is there any counterparty exposure?







No. BullionVault settles immediately.Your gold, silver and platinum are already safely in your chosen vault when you go online to buy. You pay the seller immediately with the cleared funds that you previously deposited into the BullionVault Client Money trust account. Your money becomes theirs, and their gold becomes yours. BullionVault guarantees that the deal, payment, and receipt of gold happen together, or not at all.With this speed of settlement you gain enormously in flexibility if ever you need to act quickly - for example to move your property urgently across international borders. On BullionVault you can switch your tangible property between vaults in seconds. Thats much faster than your bank.











Couldn't BullionVault's management suddenly authorise the removal of all the gold?







No. There are powerful controls.First there are private protocols. We don't publish the details of those but they involve authorisation by several people from multiple companies.There is also a transparent public protocol. For a removal to occur a 'Withdrawal Declaration' must be published on the BullionVault website's front page 24 hours before the bullion moves. This declaration identifies by alias the holder who is making the withdrawal. Any user can then check the published register to see that the withdrawing user has at least the quantity of gold which is being declared for withdrawal.The vault operators are not allowed to complete a removal of bullion without confirming the validity of the public declaration for themselves.Additionally under no circumstances can an amount exceeding the larger of 25 kg, or 5% of the total stored, be removed from the operator's control on any one day.











How do I know your website is secure?







BullionVault uses a highly secure and encrypted system architecture in wide use across industry and government. But we all realise these systems are imperfect, so BullionVault goes further to protect your property even if someone were to gain access to your account.‘Burglar alarm’: In the form of an SMS message sent to your mobile phone your Burglar Alarm can be set to sound whenever your account is accessed, or an order placed. It will always sound when a withdrawal request is entered, and before we wire your money. (A nominal charge of $0.20 per SMS applies.)Your linked bank account: When you transfer funds from your bank account to BullionVault the two accounts are linked together. Outbound funds only go to your linked bank account, which can only be changed with a written endorsement from your new banker. Even if a third party were able to access your BullionVault account, they could only sell gold at the market price, and send the money back to you.















What are the tax liabilities?







We regret we cannot offer tax advice specific to your circumstances. The following is general.BullionVault operates from the UK where no taxes apply on the purchase of investment gold, silver or platinum bought for storage within the professional vaulting system.Depending upon your tax jurisdiction if you sell your bullion at a profit it is likely that you'd be liable to a form of capital gains tax. For example, if a UK resident made profits exceeding £10,000 on gold in any one tax year - and no matter which jurisdiction they had traded in - they would be liable to a self-declared liability of 28% on profits above the £10,000 allowance. Many other western countries have similar systems, with an allowance and a tax on gains thereafter payable at a flat rate.Users often arrange to sell some of their bullion each year, but ensure that any profit they make stays within their allowance. While prices are rising this has the effect of providing tax free growth.











Do I have to pay VAT/sales tax on my gold, silver or platinum?







No, sales tax is not due on gold, silver or platinum purchases.BullionVault gold, silver and platinum are all VAT (sales tax) free - for as long as they are held in accredited vaults. If you choose to withdraw your gold it remains exempt, but 20% VAT will apply if you choose to withdraw your silver or platinum bullion.















take physical possession of the gold, silver or platinum?







Yes - you can.The vast majority of users keep their metal safely in the vault. When they sell, they receive cash in their BullionVault account which can then be withdrawn back to their bank account.But you can also withdraw the metal. The fees vary according to the circumstances.Where you cannot reasonably be paid safely by bank transfer we reduce our fee to just 1%, plus transport and insurance costs, regardless of the size of your withdrawal.Where the normal bank transfer could be used, but you elect a physical withdrawal:GoldFor whole, standard 400 oz gold bars the cost is 2.5% plus insured shipping.Smaller standard 100g bars cost about 3-5% - depending on the location they are going to. This includes shipping and insurance.We also allow withdrawal of non-standard amounts (e.g. smaller bars) but these cost 7.5% as we have to buy these products in to meet your request. The minimum withdrawal is 50g.SilverWe only support withdrawal of whole 1,000 oz bars of silver bullion. The fee is 10%.PlatinumWe only support withdrawal of whole kilograms of platinum. The fee is 10%.BullionVault gold, silver and platinum are all VAT (sales tax) free - for as long as they are held in our vaults. Upon physical withdrawal gold remains exempt, but 20% VAT then applies on silver and platinum.











hold bullion in an IRA or SIPP using BullionVault?







													Yes. See our IRA and SIPP information pages to learn how.











get a certificate?







It is very important that we do not provide you with a certificate! Why not?A formal certificate changes the legal status of what you own from physical gold, to a security evidenced by a certificate which purports to be backed by gold. Suddenly the law has to consider what would happen if there were more certificates in issue than there was gold backing them.Title to BullionVault Client gold derives from the register which modern technology (the internet) allows us to put in the public domain.You will receive a monthly statement which reflects the register. You can view the register online whenever you want. This evidences your ownership every day, with a new electronic advice confirming your register entry. It's a bit like a certificate which lasts for one day, but it is not a true certificate. BullionVault is structured for you to own gold, not a security.











choose any vault location?







Yes. You can choose whichever you prefer, although note that we don't store silver or platinum in every location.We allow you to spread your holdings across multiple locations, and it has no cost implication for you. Your charges are worked out as if all the bullion was stored in the same place.Lots of people choose to store their bullion in an overseas jurisdiction because they see this as a wise precaution against the re-imposition of capital controls at some stage in the future.











deposit any amount?







You can deposit any amount. Our users have invested between $100 and $8,000,000.You may choose to try the system with a small deposit and purchase before making a larger investment.Please note that we recommend avoiding overall investments below $2,000. That's because the minimum monthly storage charge - $4 for gold and $8 for silver or platinum - may make your investment inefficient below this level.See an example of commission and storage fees using our cost calculator.











link more than one bank account to my BullionVault account?







Linking your bank account with your BullionVault account gives you a very high level of security.Of course, we understand that it's not always possible to transfer funds from your BullionVault account to your original bank account.For example, the original bank may fail, or your country of residence may impose restrictions that force you to leave and collect your money independently of your bank account. (In fact, it is for precisely these circumstances that many users want to buy gold for overseas storage.)In exceptional circumstances, you can link your BullionVault account to a new bank account. When doing so, we will of course need to go through a strict security process to ensure the safety of your account.











just talk to someone?







Yes, of course. We offer a very friendly and knowledgeable telephone support service. Call us on weekdays during London office hours. All our support staff speak English and we also offer French, German, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Hindi, Polish, Russian and Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese). Our contact numbers are immediately below this answer.

US East coast banks can usually get money to us within 2 - 3 hours if they are instructed early in the morning.  From later in the day on the East coast, or from the West coast, your money will usually arrive at our bank the following business day.

A message from Paul Tustain : Founder, Chairman, Customer



On our front page you'll start to see why so many people trust BullionVault. Our themes are plain English, low prices, transparent controls, credible partners, responsiveness and personal accountability. We are ready for you to start holding us to account on all these themes.
We expect to be your cheapest option for investing in gold, but it counts for nothing if we are not the right organisation too, because your first bullion purchase will start a business relationship which we believe will be one of the most important in your financial life.
I look forward to introducing you to my Board and my team in our FAQ section below.

BullionVault's objective is to operate the world's most cost-effective, secure and accessible market in professional grade bullion for private investors. We do this because:

We believe there is a deficit of financial responsibility in many modern governments and financial institutions.
We believe that modern currencies and other paper-based value systems will inhibit savers from retaining their domestic and worldwide purchasing power.
We believe that using gold to provide protection from this problem is a strategy which has been inaccessible to individuals at a fair price.
We believe that we are uniquely well qualified to provide that accessibility and to manage the service in a way which maximises security, accessibility and value for our customers.

Good Delivery


The best bullion prices in the world are available where the liquidity is deepest - on the international physical bullion market. Centred in London, this is where central banks, bullion banks, investing institutions, gold miners and refiners trade what are called "good delivery" bars.
These bars are a standard size: 400 ounces (12.4 kg) for gold, 1,000 ounces (31.1 kg) for silver, and between 1 to 6 kg (32.2 to 192.9 oz) for platinum. They are made by accredited refiners and kept in accredited vaults. Their movement, by accredited couriers, is carefully documented.
Because these bars' entire life is auditable, and because they have never been in private hands, a professional buyer accepts them as "good delivery" by the seller. So the seller achieves the international spot market price and gets paid quickly and efficiently.
BullionVault allows private investors access to the professional market. And that means you pay the same low costs as the professionals for buying, selling and storing large bar gold, even though most clients never own anything like a whole bar.
Coins and small bars don't come under the good delivery system, so they cannot be sold on the professional market.  BullionVault only acquires coins and small bars exceptionally, to meet the specific withdrawal requests of clients.

Allocated Gold


We believe allocated, insured, overseas storage is your safest way to own gold. Many people disagree with us, and they frequently buy coins to keep at home, but we believe history shows them to be making a serious mistake.
Allocated gold is held as your personal property in explicit physical form.  It is not used to support a lending program, or any other financial device.  It is held away from company balance sheets under a safekeeping, or custody program, so it could not be accessed by a liquidator in the event of company failure by us or the vault operator, because you are the owner, not a creditor. We like allocated gold because it is very well protected from default.
Allocated gold should be insured, because it is yours. Curiously, because it is not yours, you do not need to insure unallocated gold, because you would not necessarily have suffered a loss if it were stolen. You suffer a loss with unallocated gold if your supplier becomes insolvent, which is a separate issue.
We like holding gold overseas because history clearly shows that gold is at its most relevant during currency crises. These correlate closely to the imposition of exchange controls, which are used by governments to retain gold and currency inside a country in crisis. It's better to store outside the country before a crisis develops.
We offer you a choice: Zurich (Switzerland), London (UK), New York (USA), Toronto (Canada) and Singapore. Switzerland is the most popular, though if you wish you can spread your gold to multiple locations without paying an extra storage charge.

At a bank


Banks generally prefer you to store your gold 'unallocated', so that it becomes formally their property. Because gold qualifies as a liquid reserve asset, which underpins the bank's ability to lend, what you think of as your gold will actually permit the bank to expand its balance sheet.
It does this by taking more short term cash deposits, and lending them long. It's the ability of your gold to convert quickly into cash (to repay short term depositors in a hurry) which allows the bank to do this.
Banks can expand their lending by about eight dollars for every dollar of their reserve, so they make a lot more money out of doing this than they do out of renting you vault space. That's why they tend to offer you 'free' unallocated storage, but very costly allocated storage, at something like 10 times the wholesale rate for vault space.
Of course with unallocated storage it would be your gold (technically their gold) which would be sold for the benefit of the bank's short term creditors during a bank run. Not many gold owners would elect for that option if they understood it better.
Commercial vaults - including those used by BullionVault - have no banking licence and no motivation to over-price allocated storage.

Changing Your Linked Bank Account


Linking your bank account with your BullionVault account gives you a very high level of security.
Of course, we understand that it's not always possible to transfer funds from your BullionVault account to your original bank account.
For example, the original bank may fail, or your country of residence may impose restrictions that force you to leave and collect your money independently of your bank account. (In fact, it is for precisely these circumstances that many clients want to buy gold for overseas storage.)
In exceptional circumstances, you can link your BullionVault account to a new bank account. When doing so, we will of course need to go through a strict security process to ensure the safety of your account.
