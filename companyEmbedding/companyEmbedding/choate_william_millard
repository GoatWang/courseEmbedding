Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

Wm. Millard Choate Receives “Outstanding Georgia Citizen” Award from Georgia Secretary of State










Atlanta, GA (June 23, 2016) – Choate Construction Company founder and President, Wm. Millard Choate, has been selected as recipient of the “Outstanding Georgia Citizen” award by Georgia Secretary of State, Brian P.  Kemp.  This honor is awarded to Georgians who go above and beyond in their dedication to the well-being of the state. The award states: “May this Outstanding Citizen be afforded every courtesy as a Goodwill Ambassador from Georgia in his travels to other states, to nations beyond the borders of the United States of America, or wherever he may hereafter travel or reside. Thank you for your service to our State.” 
Wm. Millard Choate is the President of Choate Construction Company, one of the largest commercial building contractors in the southeastern United States. With over four decades of contracting experience, Millard founded the company in 1989 and has grown the company from his home basement to now employing over 400 full-time employees. Choate Construction is consistently ranked in ENR’s Top 400 National Contractors and Top Southeast Contractor lists.
Wm. Millard Choate was recognized for being a business executive known for his high level of integrity and ethics, his positive economic impact and the job creation Choate Construction has had in the community, as well as his extensive philanthropic efforts.
Active in several organizations, Millard serves as a Director on the Board of Fidelity Bank, is an active member in the Business Executives for National Security (BENS), and is a member of the Atlanta Rotary. He supports many philanthropic organizations such as the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, The Shepherd Center, HomeStretch, and other military family support charities, to name a few. He has previously been chosen as an Entrepreneur of the Year, sponsored by Ernst & Young, Inc. Magazine, and Merrill Lynch, Volunteer of the Year by Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and was inducted into Clemson University’s Construction Science & Management Department Hall of Fame.
