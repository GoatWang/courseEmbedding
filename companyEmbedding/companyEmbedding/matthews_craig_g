Home > Employee Stock Ownership Plan


Markertek is an ESOP Company
Employee Owned, Managed and Operated.You're Dealing with Actual Owners!
At Markertek, we have always done things differently than the rest of the industry! That is why we decided in 2016 to make our employees actual equity stake owners in 100% of the company.We believe our employees should share in the success of our company in a tangible manner. This is the ultimate way to reward employees for their contributions to our ongoing success and growth. That’s why we created an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”). Participating in the ESOP program means employees are actual part owners of the company and benefit financially from a job well done. In this way, there is direct incentive for employees to work hard and take pride in what they do. It is also why we lead the broadcasting industry with the most energetic and knowledgeable employee-owners under the sun!Markertek Employees Share in the Success and Vision of the Company.
