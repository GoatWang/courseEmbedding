Historical[edit]
In 1973, Carpets International was founded by Ray Anderson. In the same decade, Interface introduced GlasBac, a patented structured backing system that has become the industry standard for high-performance modular backings. They also introduced Intersept, a proprietary antimicrobial preservationsless.

In 1982, Carpets International becomes Interface Flooring Systems, Inc, and Compact Carpet of Canada was acquired and named Interface Flooring Systems Canada, Inc.
In 1994, Interface began designing products utilizing a "Less is More" philosophy, and reduces average consumption of fiber by 10% per square yard in just 12 months. That year founder Ray Anderson read Paul Hawken's book The Ecology of Commerce, and then delivered his first environmental speech, which began Interface's journey to sustainability. Interface then launched ReEntry, a carpet reclamation program.
In 1998, Interface introduced a carpet tile product made with 100% recycled nylon face fiber and a layer of 100% recycled vinyl material in the backing. The company also introduced NexStep polyurethane cushion backing. Interface introduces the Portable Creel System, resulting in yarn savings of one million dollars per year.
In 1999, Interface introduced the first online product catalog for carpet - TheSampleCenter.com.
In 2003, Interface becomes the first carpet company to receive Environmentally Preferable Product (EPP) certification for its products and the first company to introduce Climate Neutral product offering through its Cool Carpet program. The company also announced a partnership with Tricycle Inc. to dematerialize their product development and sampling processes on a global basis.
In 2008, Interface sold its commercial upholstery fabrics division and took a huge write-down.

Company information[edit]
Interface sells commercial and residential carpets. Its founder and chairman, Ray Anderson, was featured in the documentary film The Corporation discussing environmental sustainability in modern business. Interface's initial innovation was manufacturing "the first free-lay carpet tiles in America".2 Then, starting in 1994, Interface focused on environmental sustainability, especially in reducing the use of petroleum.[5] Since 1996, Interface chose to adopt an innovation-based green strategy.[6] In a short period, it managed to reduce its impact on the environment by one third[citation needed]. In 2006, Interface announced a program called Mission Zero with a goal of eliminating any negative impact the company may have on the environment by 2020.[7]
On May 9, 2007, Interface was recognized as Recyclers of the Year by the Carpet America Recovery Effort (CARE).[8] Interface was voted number one in Globespan's survey of environmentally sustainable businesses.[9] They are also the recipient of a Queen’s Award for Sustainable Development.[10]
Consumer advocate Ralph Nader has heralded Ray Anderson and Interface for their sincere commitment to sustainability and protecting the planet's natural resources.[11]

In computing, an interface is a shared boundary across which two or more separate components of a computer system exchange information. The exchange can be between software, computer hardware, peripheral devices, humans and combinations of these. Some computer hardware devices, such as a touchscreen, can both send and receive data through the interface, while others such as a mouse or microphone may only provide an interface to send data to a given system.[1]

Hardware interfaces[edit]
Main article: hardware interface
Hardware interfaces exist in many of the components, such as the various buses, storage devices, other I/O devices, etc. A hardware interface is described by the mechanical, electrical and logical signals at the interface and the protocol for sequencing them (sometimes called signaling).[2] A standard interface, such as SCSI, decouples the design and introduction of computing hardware, such as I/O devices, from the design and introduction of other components of a computing system, thereby allowing users and manufacturers great flexibility in the implementation of computing systems.[2] Hardware interfaces can be parallel with several electrical connections carrying parts of the data simultaneously, or serial where data is sent one bit at a time.
Software interfaces[edit]
See also: application binary interface and application programming interface
A software interface may refer to a wide range of different types of interface at different "levels": an operating system may interface with pieces of hardware. Applications or programs running on the operating system may need to interact via streams, and in object oriented programs, objects within an application may need to interact via methods.
Software interfaces in practice[edit]
A key principle of design is to prohibit access to all resources by default, allowing access only through well-defined entry points, i.e. interfaces.[3] Software interfaces provide access to computer resources (such as memory, CPU, storage, etc.) of the underlying computer system; direct access (i.e. not through well designed interfaces) to such resources by software can have major ramifications—sometimes disastrous ones—for functionality and stability.
Interfaces between software components can provide: constants, data types, types of procedures, exception specifications and method signatures. Sometimes, public variables are also defined as part of an interface.
The interface of a software module A is deliberately defined separately from the implementation of that module. The latter contains the actual code of the procedures and methods described in the interface, as well as other "private" variables, procedures, etc. Another software module B, for example the client to A, that interacts with A is forced to do so only through the published interface. One practical advantage of this arrangement is that replacing the implementation of A by another implementation of the same interface should not cause B to fail—how A internally meets the requirements of the interface is not relevant to B, which is only concerned with the specifications of the interface. (See also Liskov substitution principle.)
Software interfaces in object-oriented languages[edit]
Main articles: protocol (object-oriented programming) and concept (generic programming)
In object-oriented languages, the term interface is often used to define an abstract type that contains no data or code, but defines behaviors as method signatures. A class having code and data for all the methods corresponding to that interface is said to implement that interface.[4] Furthermore, a class can implement multiple interfaces, and hence can be of different types at the same time.[5]
An interface is thus a type definition; anywhere an object can be exchanged (for example, in a function or method call) the type of the object to be exchanged can be defined in terms of its interface rather than specifying a particular class. This approach means that any class that implements that interface can be used. For example, a dummy implementation may be used to allow development to progress before the final implementation is available. In another case, a fake or mock implementation may be substituted during testing. Such stub implementations are replaced by real code later in the development process.
Usually a method defined in an interface contains no code and thus cannot itself be called; it must be implemented by non-abstract code to be run when it is invoked. An interface called "Stack" might define two methods: push() and pop(). It can be implemented in different ways, for example, FastStack and GenericStack—the first being fast, working with a stack of fixed size, and the second using a data structure that can be resized, but at the cost of somewhat lower speed.
Though interfaces can contain many methods they may contain only one or even none at all. For example, the Java language defines the interface Readable that has the single read() method; various implementations are used for different purposes, including BufferedReader, FileReader, InputStreamReader, PipedReader, and StringReader. Marker interfaces like Serializable contain no methods at all and serve to provide run-time information to generic processing using Reflection.[6]
Programming to the interface[edit]
The use of interfaces allows for a programming style called programming to the interface. The idea behind this approach is to base programming logic on the interfaces of the objects used, rather than on internal implementation details. Programming to the interface reduces dependency on implementation specifics and makes code more reusable.[7]
Pushing this idea to the extreme, inversion of control leaves the context to inject the code with the specific implementations of the interface that will be used to perform the work.
User interfaces[edit]
Main article: user interface
A user interface is a point of interaction between a computer and humans; it includes any number of modalities of interaction (such as graphics, sound, position, movement, etc.) where data is transferred between the user and the computer system.

Historical[edit]
In 1973, Carpets International was founded by Ray Anderson. In the same decade, Interface introduced GlasBac, a patented structured backing system that has become the industry standard for high-performance modular backings. They also introduced Intersept, a proprietary antimicrobial preservationsless.

In 1982, Carpets International becomes Interface Flooring Systems, Inc, and Compact Carpet of Canada was acquired and named Interface Flooring Systems Canada, Inc.
In 1994, Interface began designing products utilizing a "Less is More" philosophy, and reduces average consumption of fiber by 10% per square yard in just 12 months. That year founder Ray Anderson read Paul Hawken's book The Ecology of Commerce, and then delivered his first environmental speech, which began Interface's journey to sustainability. Interface then launched ReEntry, a carpet reclamation program.
In 1998, Interface introduced a carpet tile product made with 100% recycled nylon face fiber and a layer of 100% recycled vinyl material in the backing. The company also introduced NexStep polyurethane cushion backing. Interface introduces the Portable Creel System, resulting in yarn savings of one million dollars per year.
In 1999, Interface introduced the first online product catalog for carpet - TheSampleCenter.com.
In 2003, Interface becomes the first carpet company to receive Environmentally Preferable Product (EPP) certification for its products and the first company to introduce Climate Neutral product offering through its Cool Carpet program. The company also announced a partnership with Tricycle Inc. to dematerialize their product development and sampling processes on a global basis.
In 2008, Interface sold its commercial upholstery fabrics division and took a huge write-down.

Products[4][edit]

Company information[edit]
Interface sells commercial and residential carpets. Its founder and chairman, Ray Anderson, was featured in the documentary film The Corporation discussing environmental sustainability in modern business. Interface's initial innovation was manufacturing "the first free-lay carpet tiles in America".2 Then, starting in 1994, Interface focused on environmental sustainability, especially in reducing the use of petroleum.[5] Since 1996, Interface chose to adopt an innovation-based green strategy.[6] In a short period, it managed to reduce its impact on the environment by one third[citation needed]. In 2006, Interface announced a program called Mission Zero with a goal of eliminating any negative impact the company may have on the environment by 2020.[7]
On May 9, 2007, Interface was recognized as Recyclers of the Year by the Carpet America Recovery Effort (CARE).[8] Interface was voted number one in Globespan's survey of environmentally sustainable businesses.[9] They are also the recipient of a Queen’s Award for Sustainable Development.[10]
Consumer advocate Ralph Nader has heralded Ray Anderson and Interface for their sincere commitment to sustainability and protecting the planet's natural resources.[11]
InterfaceFLOR[edit]
InterfaceFLOR manufactures carpet squares or carpet tiles. The squares are unlike conventional rolled carpeting, as they can be easily removed or replaced.[12]
Heuga Home Flooring[edit]
Heuga Home Flooring is a European carpet company and a division of Interface. The company is headquartered in Scherpenzeel, Gelderland.[13]

A software interface may refer to a wide range of different types of interface at different "levels": an operating system may interface with pieces of hardware. Applications or programs running on the operating system may need to interact via streams, and in object oriented programs, objects within an application may need to interact via methods.
Software interfaces in practice[edit]
A key principle of design is to prohibit access to all resources by default, allowing access only through well-defined entry points, i.e. interfaces.[3] Software interfaces provide access to computer resources (such as memory, CPU, storage, etc.) of the underlying computer system; direct access (i.e. not through well designed interfaces) to such resources by software can have major ramifications—sometimes disastrous ones—for functionality and stability.
Interfaces between software components can provide: constants, data types, types of procedures, exception specifications and method signatures. Sometimes, public variables are also defined as part of an interface.
The interface of a software module A is deliberately defined separately from the implementation of that module. The latter contains the actual code of the procedures and methods described in the interface, as well as other "private" variables, procedures, etc. Another software module B, for example the client to A, that interacts with A is forced to do so only through the published interface. One practical advantage of this arrangement is that replacing the implementation of A by another implementation of the same interface should not cause B to fail—how A internally meets the requirements of the interface is not relevant to B, which is only concerned with the specifications of the interface. (See also Liskov substitution principle.)
Software interfaces in object-oriented languages[edit]
Main articles: protocol (object-oriented programming) and concept (generic programming)
In object-oriented languages, the term interface is often used to define an abstract type that contains no data or code, but defines behaviors as method signatures. A class having code and data for all the methods corresponding to that interface is said to implement that interface.[4] Furthermore, a class can implement multiple interfaces, and hence can be of different types at the same time.[5]
An interface is thus a type definition; anywhere an object can be exchanged (for example, in a function or method call) the type of the object to be exchanged can be defined in terms of its interface rather than specifying a particular class. This approach means that any class that implements that interface can be used. For example, a dummy implementation may be used to allow development to progress before the final implementation is available. In another case, a fake or mock implementation may be substituted during testing. Such stub implementations are replaced by real code later in the development process.
Usually a method defined in an interface contains no code and thus cannot itself be called; it must be implemented by non-abstract code to be run when it is invoked. An interface called "Stack" might define two methods: push() and pop(). It can be implemented in different ways, for example, FastStack and GenericStack—the first being fast, working with a stack of fixed size, and the second using a data structure that can be resized, but at the cost of somewhat lower speed.
Though interfaces can contain many methods they may contain only one or even none at all. For example, the Java language defines the interface Readable that has the single read() method; various implementations are used for different purposes, including BufferedReader, FileReader, InputStreamReader, PipedReader, and StringReader. Marker interfaces like Serializable contain no methods at all and serve to provide run-time information to generic processing using Reflection.[6]
Programming to the interface[edit]
The use of interfaces allows for a programming style called programming to the interface. The idea behind this approach is to base programming logic on the interfaces of the objects used, rather than on internal implementation details. Programming to the interface reduces dependency on implementation specifics and makes code more reusable.[7]
Pushing this idea to the extreme, inversion of control leaves the context to inject the code with the specific implementations of the interface that will be used to perform the work.
User interfaces[edit]
Main article: user interface
A user interface is a point of interaction between a computer and humans; it includes any number of modalities of interaction (such as graphics, sound, position, movement, etc.) where data is transferred between the user and the computer system.

Retrieved 2011-08-03. Once you depend on interfaces only, you're decoupled from the implementation. That means the implementation can vary, and that is a healthy dependency relationship. For example, for testing purposes you can replace a heavy database implementation with a lighter-weight mock implementation. Fortunately, with today's refactoring support you no longer have to come up with an interface up front. You can distill an interface from a concrete class once you have the full insights into a problem. The intended interface is just one 'extract interface' refactoring away. ...

The Design Workflow












We begin new projects with a meeting, where we actively listen to your ideas, determine your requirements and gather information about your objectives and timeframe. Next we will prepare a price quote, which outlines the scope of work, before moving forward.




This is a dynamic phase where we get creative. We’ll take what we’ve learned and generate several ideas, usually in the form of computer sketches or 3D models. Concepts are ‘loose’ while we explore various possibilities. The client reviews the ideas and works closely with us to choose a final direction.




Now the overall design is developed further and begins to take shape. For new products we often create a working prototype to validate the details. Final artwork or control drawings are prepared for use in the next phase (Deliver) by a vendor to create the finished design.




If everyone is satisfied with the final design, we move to this final step. Completed control drawings are handed off to the appropriate vendor who will produce the finished items. As first article samples arrive, we check them for quality assurance. And, we deliver on deadline and on budget of course.

            Net-Works is the first step in creating a truly restorative loop in carpet tile production, cleaning up oceans and beaches while also creating financial opportunities for some of the poorest people in the world. The Net-Works program is not just about beach cleanup, though that is a vital piece. Net-Works is also helping the villagers establish new financial opportunities.

Business Lessons from a Radical Industrialist is an updated follow up to Ray’s 2009 book published by St. Martin’s Press. Called both a “how to” and a “why to” on sustainability, the book debunks the myth that financial success and environmental success are mutually exclusive and tells the Interface story, as only Ray could tell it. The Foreword from Ray is available as a free download.

Interface (computing)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

This article is about points of interaction of computer systems. For other uses, see interface (disambiguation) § computing.





This article needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (May 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


In computing, an interface is a shared boundary across which two or more separate components of a computer system exchange information. The exchange can be between software, computer hardware, peripheral devices, humans and combinations of these. Some computer hardware devices, such as a touchscreen, can both send and receive data through the interface, while others such as a mouse or microphone may only provide an interface to send data to a given system.[1]

Hardware interfaces[edit]
Main article: hardware interface
Hardware interfaces exist in many of the components, such as the various buses, storage devices, other I/O devices, etc. A hardware interface is described by the mechanical, electrical and logical signals at the interface and the protocol for sequencing them (sometimes called signaling).[2] A standard interface, such as SCSI, decouples the design and introduction of computing hardware, such as I/O devices, from the design and introduction of other components of a computing system, thereby allowing users and manufacturers great flexibility in the implementation of computing systems.[2] Hardware interfaces can be parallel with several electrical connections carrying parts of the data simultaneously, or serial where data is sent one bit at a time.
Software interfaces[edit]
See also: application binary interface and application programming interface
A software interface may refer to a wide range of different types of interface at different "levels": an operating system may interface with pieces of hardware. Applications or programs running on the operating system may need to interact via streams, and in object oriented programs, objects within an application may need to interact via methods.
Software interfaces in practice[edit]
A key principle of design is to prohibit access to all resources by default, allowing access only through well-defined entry points, i.e. interfaces.[3] Software interfaces provide access to computer resources (such as memory, CPU, storage, etc.) of the underlying computer system; direct access (i.e. not through well designed interfaces) to such resources by software can have major ramifications—sometimes disastrous ones—for functionality and stability.
Interfaces between software components can provide: constants, data types, types of procedures, exception specifications and method signatures. Sometimes, public variables are also defined as part of an interface.
The interface of a software module A is deliberately defined separately from the implementation of that module. The latter contains the actual code of the procedures and methods described in the interface, as well as other "private" variables, procedures, etc. Another software module B, for example the client to A, that interacts with A is forced to do so only through the published interface. One practical advantage of this arrangement is that replacing the implementation of A by another implementation of the same interface should not cause B to fail—how A internally meets the requirements of the interface is not relevant to B, which is only concerned with the specifications of the interface. (See also Liskov substitution principle.)
Software interfaces in object-oriented languages[edit]
Main articles: protocol (object-oriented programming) and concept (generic programming)
In object-oriented languages, the term interface is often used to define an abstract type that contains no data or code, but defines behaviors as method signatures. A class having code and data for all the methods corresponding to that interface is said to implement that interface.[4] Furthermore, a class can implement multiple interfaces, and hence can be of different types at the same time.[5]
An interface is thus a type definition; anywhere an object can be exchanged (for example, in a function or method call) the type of the object to be exchanged can be defined in terms of its interface rather than specifying a particular class. This approach means that any class that implements that interface can be used. For example, a dummy implementation may be used to allow development to progress before the final implementation is available. In another case, a fake or mock implementation may be substituted during testing. Such stub implementations are replaced by real code later in the development process.
Usually a method defined in an interface contains no code and thus cannot itself be called; it must be implemented by non-abstract code to be run when it is invoked. An interface called "Stack" might define two methods: push() and pop(). It can be implemented in different ways, for example, FastStack and GenericStack—the first being fast, working with a stack of fixed size, and the second using a data structure that can be resized, but at the cost of somewhat lower speed.
Though interfaces can contain many methods they may contain only one or even none at all. For example, the Java language defines the interface Readable that has the single read() method; various implementations are used for different purposes, including BufferedReader, FileReader, InputStreamReader, PipedReader, and StringReader. Marker interfaces like Serializable contain no methods at all and serve to provide run-time information to generic processing using Reflection.[6]
Programming to the interface[edit]
The use of interfaces allows for a programming style called programming to the interface. The idea behind this approach is to base programming logic on the interfaces of the objects used, rather than on internal implementation details. Programming to the interface reduces dependency on implementation specifics and makes code more reusable.[7]
Pushing this idea to the extreme, inversion of control leaves the context to inject the code with the specific implementations of the interface that will be used to perform the work.
User interfaces[edit]
Main article: user interface
A user interface is a point of interaction between a computer and humans; it includes any number of modalities of interaction (such as graphics, sound, position, movement, etc.) where data is transferred between the user and the computer system.

Retrieved 2011-08-03. Once you depend on interfaces only, you're decoupled from the implementation. That means the implementation can vary, and that is a healthy dependency relationship. For example, for testing purposes you can replace a heavy database implementation with a lighter-weight mock implementation. Fortunately, with today's refactoring support you no longer have to come up with an interface up front. You can distill an interface from a concrete class once you have the full insights into a problem. The intended interface is just one 'extract interface' refactoring away. ...

Historical[edit]
In 1973, Carpets International was founded by Ray Anderson. In the same decade, Interface introduced GlasBac, a patented structured backing system that has become the industry standard for high-performance modular backings. They also introduced Intersept, a proprietary antimicrobial preservationsless.

In 1982, Carpets International becomes Interface Flooring Systems, Inc, and Compact Carpet of Canada was acquired and named Interface Flooring Systems Canada, Inc.
In 1994, Interface began designing products utilizing a "Less is More" philosophy, and reduces average consumption of fiber by 10% per square yard in just 12 months. That year founder Ray Anderson read Paul Hawken's book The Ecology of Commerce, and then delivered his first environmental speech, which began Interface's journey to sustainability. Interface then launched ReEntry, a carpet reclamation program.
In 1998, Interface introduced a carpet tile product made with 100% recycled nylon face fiber and a layer of 100% recycled vinyl material in the backing. The company also introduced NexStep polyurethane cushion backing. Interface introduces the Portable Creel System, resulting in yarn savings of one million dollars per year.
In 1999, Interface introduced the first online product catalog for carpet - TheSampleCenter.com.
In 2003, Interface becomes the first carpet company to receive Environmentally Preferable Product (EPP) certification for its products and the first company to introduce Climate Neutral product offering through its Cool Carpet program. The company also announced a partnership with Tricycle Inc. to dematerialize their product development and sampling processes on a global basis.
In 2008, Interface sold its commercial upholstery fabrics division and took a huge write-down.

Company information[edit]
Interface sells commercial and residential carpets. Its founder and chairman, Ray Anderson, was featured in the documentary film The Corporation discussing environmental sustainability in modern business. Interface's initial innovation was manufacturing "the first free-lay carpet tiles in America".2 Then, starting in 1994, Interface focused on environmental sustainability, especially in reducing the use of petroleum.[5] Since 1996, Interface chose to adopt an innovation-based green strategy.[6] In a short period, it managed to reduce its impact on the environment by one third[citation needed]. In 2006, Interface announced a program called Mission Zero with a goal of eliminating any negative impact the company may have on the environment by 2020.[7]
On May 9, 2007, Interface was recognized as Recyclers of the Year by the Carpet America Recovery Effort (CARE).[8] Interface was voted number one in Globespan's survey of environmentally sustainable businesses.[9] They are also the recipient of a Queen’s Award for Sustainable Development.[10]
Consumer advocate Ralph Nader has heralded Ray Anderson and Interface for their sincere commitment to sustainability and protecting the planet's natural resources.[11]
InterfaceFLOR[edit]
InterfaceFLOR manufactures carpet squares or carpet tiles. The squares are unlike conventional rolled carpeting, as they can be easily removed or replaced.[12]
Heuga Home Flooring[edit]
Heuga Home Flooring is a European carpet company and a division of Interface. The company is headquartered in Scherpenzeel, Gelderland.[13]
