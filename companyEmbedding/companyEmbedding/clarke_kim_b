Kim B. Clark joined the Harvard faculty in 1978 and served as Dean of the Faculty at Harvard Business School from 1995 to 2005.  He received the B.A. (1974), M.A. (1977), and Ph.D. (1978) degrees in economics from Harvard University.
Professor Clark's research has focused on modularity in design and the integration of technology and competition in industry evolution, with a particular focus on the computer industry. He and Carliss Baldwin are co-authors of a book on the topic entitled Design Rules: The Power of Modularity (MIT Press, 2000). Earlier research focused on the areas of technology, productivity, product development, and operations strategy; publications on these topics include Leading Product Development: The Senior Manager's Guide to Creating and Shaping the Enterprise (with S.C. Wheelwright, Free Press, 1995); The Perpetual Enterprise Machine: Seven Keys to Corporate Renewal through Successful Product and Process Development (co-edited with H.K. Bowen, C. Holloway, and S.C. Wheelwright, Oxford University Press, 1994) and Revolutionizing Product Development (with S.C. Wheelwright, The Free Press, 1992). A comprehensive study on product development in the world auto industry (with T. Fujimoto), Product Development Performance, was published in 1991 by HBS Press. Other books include Dynamic Manufacturing (with R.H. Hayes and S.C. Wheelwright, Free Press, 1988) and Industrial Renaissance (with W.J. Abernathy and A.M. Kantrow, Basic Books, 1983). Additional publications include 'Managing in an Age of Modularity' (with C.Y. Baldwin, Harvard Business Review, September-October 1997),'Development Projects: The Engine of Renewal' (with H.K. Bowen, C.A. Holloway, and S.C. Wheelwright, Harvard Business Review, September-October 1994), 'Organizing and Leading 'Heavyweight' Development Teams' (with S.C. Wheelwright, California Management Review, Spring 1992), 'Capabilities and Capital Investment: New Perspectives on Capital Budgeting' (with C.Y. Baldwin, Journal of Applied Corporate Finance, 1991), and 'The Power of Product Integrity' (with T. Fujimoto, Harvard Business Review, November-December 1990).Print Entire ProfileLess

Workplace Safety at Alcoa (A)
Kim B. Clark and Joshua D. Margolis
Examines the challenge facing the managers of a large aluminum manufacturing plant in its drive to improve workplace safety. The CEO of the company has made safety a top priority. The plant has made good progress in reducing the injury rate, but now confronts the need to accelerate its improvement. Doing so requires the safety director to consider progress to date and analyze the opportunities for improvement, many of which involve fundamental changes in behavior at all levels of the organization. Progress has not been uniform throughout the plant and past approaches may not be adequate in meeting the challenge. As the case comes to a close, these issues come to a head because a superintendent wants to fire a supervisor who has failed to adhere to safety procedures. Designed to introduce students to the issues of safety in its operating context. Students have information available that allows them to analyze underlying causes and identify major opportunities for improvement. However, the interactions between safety and other dimensions of manufacturing performance are evident in developing and implementing a plan for improvement.

Ceramics Process Systems Corp. (B)
Kim B. Clark and Brent D. Barnett
Ceramics Process Systems (CPS) is an advanced ceramics company facing problems with lead time in product/process development, and late delivery of prototype parts to its customers. Engineering is confronted with difficult technical problems and multiple objectives (i.e., meet customer requirements for prototype parts, build technical capability). Kathryn Sundback, head of development for molded products, must deal with the lead time and delivery problems on current products while making choices about and allocating resources to several new projects that marketing has developed. The case gives students the opportunity to examine engineering capacity, the nature of the development process, managing the set of projects as a whole (i.e., mix of project type, resource allocation) and customer interaction in a dynamic, technical, and market environment. May be used with Ceramics Process Systems Corp. (A).

Sun Microsystems, Inc. (B)
Kim B. Clark
Dissects the manufacturing process and procedures of a high-end computer manufacturer. The main issue is how to introduce new products and ramp them up quickly in a competitive environment where time-to-market is crucial. Focuses on engineering change orders--how they are proposed, documented, approved, and implemented--and raises questions about how the procedure might be made more efficient. The case also allows students to grapple with other issues, such as how to organize pilot production most effectively and how to organize the process flow in a plant where many products are assembled on the same line.

Early life and education[edit]
Kim B. Clark was born on March 20, 1949, in Salt Lake City, Utah. He and his family lived in Salt Lake City until 1960, when his father's new job required them to move to Spokane, Washington. Clark matriculated at Harvard University in 1967 as a pre-med major and left after his freshman year to serve as a missionary for the LDS Church in Germany. Following his mission, Clark enrolled for a time at Brigham Young University. In 1971, he resumed his studies at Harvard, where he received B.A. (1974), MA (1977), and Ph.D. (1978) degrees in economics.[3][4]
Clark joined the Harvard faculty in 1978 and served as Dean of the HBS from 1995 to 2005.[5]
As a professor at the HBS, Clark's research focused on modularity in design and the integration of technology and competition in industry evolution, particularly within the computer industry. He has published several articles in the Harvard Business Review and other peer-reviewed academic journals. A few of his papers were co-authored with former HBS associate dean and former BYU-Hawaii president Steven C. Wheelwright.[3]
In 2005, Clark left the HBS when LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley appointed him president of BYU–Idaho.[6]
On January 27, 2015, it was announced that effective April 13, 2015, Clark would be succeeded by Clark Gilbert as the president of BYU–Idaho.[7]
LDS Church service and family[edit]
Clark has served in various assignments in the LDS Church, including bishop, scoutmaster, elders quorum president, Sunday School teacher, and counselor in a stake mission presidency. From 2007 to 2014, Clark served as an area seventy in the church's Idaho Area. On April 4, 2015, Clark was sustained as a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy.[8] On August 1, 2015, he succeeded Paul V. Johnson as the Commissioner of Church Education.[2]
Clark and his wife, Sue, have seven children.[5]
Awards[edit]

Eagle Scout Award by the Boy Scouts of America[9]
Distinguished Eagle Scout Award by the National Eagle Scout Association[9]

ClarkSimon and Schuster, Jun 15, 1992 - Business & Economics - 364 pages 2 Reviewshttps://books.google.com/books/about/Revolutionizing_Product_Development.html?id=s3Ivkou-BVcCToday, a company's capability to conceive and design quality prototypes and bring a variety of superior products to market quicker than its competitors is increasingly the focal point of competition, contend leading product development experts Steven Wheelwright and Kim Clark. Drawing on six years of in-depth, systematic, worldwide research, they present proven principles for developing the critical capabilities for speed, efficiency, and quality that have worked again and again in scores of successful Japanese, American, and European fast-cycle firms.The authors argue that to survive, let alone succeed, today's companies must construct a new "platform" -- with new methodologies -- on which they can compete. Using their model for development strategies, Wheelwright and Clark show that firms can create a solid architecture for the integration of marketing, manufacturing, and design functions for problem solving and fast action -- particularly during the critical design-build-test cycles of prototype creation.They demonstrate further how successful firms such as Honda in automobiles, Compaq in personal computers, Applied Materials in semi-conductors, Sony in audio equipment, The Limited in apparel, and Hill-Rom in hospital beds have employed recent methodologies to bring new products to market at break-neck speed. Such innovations include design for manufacturability, quality function deployment, computer-aided design, and computer-aided engineering.Finally, Wheelwright and Clark emphasize the importance of learning in the organization. Companies that consistently "design it right the first time" and follow a path of continuous improvement in product and process development have a formidable edge in the crucial race to market.  Preview this book » What people are saying - Write a reviewUser Review -  Flag as inappropriateTHE BOOK! gestão de programa de inovação, com foco em desenvolvimento de produtos.

                           Using the computer industry as an example, Carliss Y. Baldwin and Kim B. Clark develop a powerful theory of design and industrial
                              evolution. They argue that the industry has experienced previously unimaginable levels of innovation and growth because it
                              embraced the concept of "modularity", building complex products from smaller sub-systems that can be designed independently
                              yet function together as a whole. Modularity freed designers to experiment with different approaches, so long as they obeyed
                              the established "design rules". Drawing upon the literatures of industrial organization, real options and computer architecture,
                              the authors provide insight into the forces of change that drive today's economy

                              Abstract: This paper presents the results of a study of productivity growth and R & D in the 1970s using data on narrowly
                                 defined 'business units within a firm. Estimates are developed under different assumptions about technology, industry effects,
                                 and changes in the return to R & D over time. The R & D data are broken down into process and product expenditures, and some
                                 information is available on past success in developing proprietary technology, andontheincidenceofma3or changes in technology
                                 in the recent past. The results suggest a significant relationship between R & D and the growth of productivity; in versions
                                 using total factor productivity as the dependent variable, the estimated rate of return to R & D investment is about 20 percent.
                                 We find some evidence that R & D has its biggest effect on productivity in those markets where major changes in technology
                                 have occurred in the recent past. Previous success in developing proprietary process technology affects total factor productivity
                                 directly, but appears to have little effect on estimated returns to R & D. The notion that the productivity of R & D declined
                                 in the l970sfinds Little support in this data. Irrespective of model specification, trends in the R & D coefficient are substantively
                                 arid statistically insignificant. Our calculations suggest that reduced investment in R & D may have accounted for at least
                                 10 percent of the decline in total factor productivity growth in the l970s

                              This paper examines the impact of unionization on profit- ability, growth and productivity using time series data on over
                                 900 product line businesses in the North American manufacturing sector (predominantly U.S.). The first section of the paper
                                 develops a simple theoretical framework for studying the effect of the union on firm performance. A key result of this analysis
                                 is that information about union wage and productivity effects is not sufficient to permit prediction of the sign (or magnitude)
                                 of consequent changes in the rate of return on capital; one must know the parameters of production and demand. Expanding the
                                 model to allow for the effects of market structure and alternative bargaining regimes establishes the need to examine several
                                 indicators of firm performance in assessing the impact of the union. The empirical analysis reveals sizeable negative union
                                 effects on profitability, but growth, productivity and the capital-labor ratio appear to be little affected by unionization
                                 in this data. The data are thus consistent with a model of union-firm interaction in which collective bargaining affects the
                                 distribution of profits, but leaves real magnitudes unchanged. The evidence suggests, however, that unionization may have
                                 longer term implications for efficiency since the impact on profitability appears to fall most heavily on firms with relatively
                                 little market power

                              Mike and Amy Smith are nervous about moving from their nice house in Boston to a dilapidated old mansion in Falton, New Hampshire.
                                 They know they?ll have to start the sixth and seventh grade not knowing anyone, and their new house is just plain creepy.
                                 While searching their dusty attic, Mike and Amy uncover an old wooden chest with a mysterious lock. Inside, they find magical
                                 red shirts that give them special powers. Together with a new friend, Sam, Mike and Amy must figure out how to harness their
                                 newfound gifts while keeping them secret from their parents. As their powers grow, they begin a search for two kids who had
                                 gone missing in the summer, pitting them against a powerful adversary with mystical powers of his own. Will Mike and Amy be
                                 able to unlock the ancient mystery of the shirts? And will they be able to find the missing children before it is too late?

                              This paper examines the relative importance of timing and persistence elements in explaining cyclical fluctuations in labor
                                 supply. Data from the natural experiment provided by World War I1 and cross-sectional data on American local labor markets,
                                 as well as aggregate time-series data are used in the empirical work. We find little evidence that timing effects play an
                                 important role in labor market dynamics. The evidence suggests that views emphasizing persistence are more accurate, and that
                                 previous employment tends to raise the probability of subsequent employment

                              This paper reports preliminary estimates of an econometric simulation model capable of a comprehensive evaluation of the effects
                                 of unemployment insurance on measured and actual employment, unemployment and non-participation. The data are longitudinal
                                 comprising information on 75,000 households sampled in the Current Population Surveys of March and April 1978. The simulation
                                 model is constructed from multi- nomial logit equations characterizing individuals' labor force transitions. These equations
                                 provide estimates of the effects of UI on job loss, labor force exit, and entry into the labor force, as well as the effect
                                 of UI on unemployment duration and temporary layoffs. The results are rather inconclusive, but suggest the importance of further
                                 research on I21 and transitions in and out of the labor force

                              The effect of unionization on productivity is examined in this paper using time-series data on selected establishments in
                                 the U.S. cement industry. The analysis combines statistical estimation of the union impact and interviews with union and management
                                 officials to forge a link between econometric estimation and the traditional institutional analysis of union policy and management
                                 adjustment. The econometric analysis primarily deals with the problem of identifying the impact of the union in the face of
                                 firm specific effects and adjustments in labor quality. The case studies are designed to shed light on the question of how
                                 unionization affects productivity. The empirical results support the conclusion that unionization leads to productive changes
                                 in the operation of the enterprise. Evidence from the case studies suggests that much of the gain in productivity derives
                                 from a series of extensive changes in management personnel and procedure. These adjustments are a management response to changes
                                 in the employment contract which follow unionization

                              This paper challenges conventional views of unemployment. Its results suggest that failure to examine closely labor force
                                 transitions has led to a misleading picture of unemployment and the way the labor market functions in general. There are four
                                 main conclusions. First, labor force transitions are the principal determinant of fluctuations in employment and unemployment.
                                 We find that the vast majority of those newly employed come not from unemployment but from outside the labor force. Likewise,
                                 most spells of employment end with labor force withdrawal rather than unemployment. Second, traditional estimates of the duration
                                 of unemployment and the ease of job finding are seriously flawed by failure to take account of the 45 percent of all unemployment
                                 spells which end in labor force withdrawal. Third, re-entrant unemployment is to a large extent the result of job-ending followed
                                 by a brief spell outside the labor force. Many re-entrants would almost certainly be better classified as job losers and leavers
                                 completing long spells of unemployment rather than as entrants starting a new spell of unemployment. Fourth, it appears that
                                 many of those counted as out of the labor force are functionally indistinguishable from the unemployed

GET DETAILSClickFIND A STORELeading Product Development: The Senior Manager's Guide To Creating And Shaping The Enterpriseby Wheelwright, Steven C./ Clark, Kim B.In their groundbreaking book Revolutionizing Product Development, Steven C. Wheelwright and Kim B. Clark demonstrated how project leaders for product development could apply new innovations to bring products to market at breakneck speed. Now, in their new work, they address the general manager's role in leading product development efforts -- at the functional, unit, group, and corporate levels. Up to now, senior managers have merely approved or rejected proposals at the beginning of a project and rushed in at the end to resolve problems. This traditional approach to product development no longer works, the authors contend. A fundamental shift in the role of senior management is taking place: the entire spectrum of new product development is now the responsibility of the general manager -- from pre-project planning to completion. Wheelwright and Clark draw on their combined consulting experience and numerous examples -- such as Kodak, Honda, Hewlett-Packard, and Gillette -- to explain how this new role can be successfully executed in today's competitive arena.  The authors show how the margin for error in new product development has become razor thin. Pre-project planning, they show, takes the guesswork out of development so that projects run smoothly from start to finish. Second, they describe how to choose a set of projects that match a company's specific strategic objectives, resources, and "organizational horsepower" -- enabling the development of consistently successful products and capabilities over time. Finally, they reveal how to create a plan for action: how to determine project sequence, what measurements and incentives are crucial, and, most important, how to capture project learning and integrate it back into the ongoing stream of product development. Wheelwright and Clark conclude that the opportunity for rapid, significant development lies in managerial leadership of pre-project planning and commitment to improvement at every step of the product's life cycle. They provide managers with the tools needed to master these processes, making this book necessary reading for every manager who wants the upper hand in bringing timely, efficient, high-quality new products to market.Industrial Management, Production & Operations ManagementCondition: Used - GoodHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

 Product Description 

            From dean of the Harvard Business School to president of BYU-Idaho, Kim B. Clark has had a career filled with pressures of one kind or another. He describes a particularly stressful time: "One night, I awoke from what must have been a nightmare. I felt very anxious, worried, beset with strange thoughts and feelings of dread and darkness. . . . I rolled out of bed onto my knees and asked Heavenly Father to help me. . . . As I got up, a phrase of scripture came into my mind. It was just a fragment, but it was the key I needed: 'For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world . . .' (Ephesians 6:12)." The author's personal quest, born that night, to understand the armor of God became this thought-provoking and uniquely helpful book.

          





 About the Author 

 Kim B. Clark

 President Kim B. Clark completed his freshman year at Harvard University before serving a two-year mission in the South German Mission. He then studied for one year at Brigham Young University, where he met his wife, Sue. They married in 1971 and returned to Cambridge, where he completed his education at Harvard University--earning bachelor's, master's, and Ph.D. degrees in economics. In 1978 Kim joined the Harvard Business School faculty; he was named dean of the School in 1995. He served in that capacity until summer 2005, when he left to become the president of Brigham Young University--Idaho. Kim and Sue are the parents of seven children and the grandparents of nine.

  A Sleeper and a KeeperBy Jana, Submitted on 2015-02-25I bought this book on a huge sale, so I'm assuming it was a "Sleeper." I have loved reading the book. It spoke to me even though my life experiences have been very different from the author's, which denotes to me he is speaking with Spirit. It's easy to be intimidated by President Clark at first notice, but he truly reveals himself, weaknesses and all, in the book and shows how we can be safe and progress in these latter days. Loved it.
