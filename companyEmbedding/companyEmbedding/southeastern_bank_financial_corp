COLUMBIA, S.C. & AUGUSTA, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--South State Corporation (NASDAQ:SSB) and Southeastern Bank Financial 
      Corporation (OTCQB:SBFC) jointly announced today the signing of a 
      definitive merger agreement. The combination of these two companies 
      creates a premier franchise in the Carolinas and Georgia.
    


      Founded in 1989 and headquartered in Augusta, Georgia, Southeastern is 
      the holding company for Georgia Bank & Trust Company of Augusta and also 
      operates as Southern Bank & Trust in Aiken County, South Carolina. 
      Augusta is the second largest MSA in GA and Georgia Bank & Trust is the 
      largest bank headquartered in the Augusta metro market, where it is 
      ranked second in market share. This opportunity combines two 
      organizations that have a similar culture, offer the same four lines of 
      business and allow for all 12 banking branches to remain open.
    

      “We are pleased to announce this partnership with Georgia Bank & Trust. 
      As the leading bank in the Augusta and Aiken markets, the company has a 
      great reputation and a great team of bankers,” said Robert R. Hill, Jr., 
      CEO of South State Corporation. “Our teams and our company cultures are 
      very similar and we look forward to enhancing customer relationships and 
      continuing the legacy of service in these communities.”
    

      As of March 31, 2016, Southeastern Bank Financial Corporation had 
      approximately $1.9 billion in assets, $1.6 billion in deposits and $1.0 
      billion in loans. Upon completion of the transaction, the combined 
      company will have approximately $10.5 billion in total assets, $8.7 
      billion in total deposits, $7.2 billion in total loans and a network of 
      133 branches in the Carolinas and Georgia.
    

      “We are pleased to be merging with a high-performing regional bank that 
      has similar company values and culture for our employees, customers and 
      shareholders,” said R. Daniel Blanton, CEO of Southeastern Bank 
      Financial Corporation. “We are excited to join with a like-minded 
      regional bank that can build on our success and take it to a higher 
      level for the good of our community and customers. Together, we will 
      strengthen our position as a premier bank in the Southeast.”
    

      The merger agreement has been unanimously approved by the board of 
      directors of each company. Pending regulatory and shareholder approvals, 
      the closing and system conversion is scheduled to occur in the first 
      quarter of 2017. At the closing, Southeastern Bank Financial Corporation 
      will be merged into South State Corporation, and Southeastern’s bank 
      subsidiary, Georgia Bank & Trust Company of Augusta, will be merged into 
      South State’s bank subsidiary, South State Bank.
    

      Under the terms of the agreement, shareholders of Southeastern Bank 
      Financial Corporation will receive 0.7307 shares of SSB common stock for 
      each share of SBFC common stock. The stock issuance is valued at 
      approximately $335 million in the aggregate, based on 6,746,897 shares 
      of SBFC common stock outstanding and on South State’s June 15, 2016 
      closing stock price of $67.68.
    

      SSB will host a conference call to discuss the transaction at 10:00 a.m. 
      EST on Friday, June 17, 2016. Callers wishing to participate may call

CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS


      Statements included in this communication which are not historical in 
      nature are intended to be, and are hereby identified as, forward looking 
      statements for purposes of the safe harbor provided by Section 27A of 
      the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange 
      Act of 1934. The words “may,” “will,” “anticipate,” “should,” “would,” 
      “believe,” “contemplate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “continue,” “may,” and 
      “intend,” as well as other similar words and expressions of the future, 
      are intended to identify forward looking statements. South State 
      Corporation (“SSB”) cautions readers that forward looking statements are 
      subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual 
      results to differ materially from anticipated results. Such risks and 
      uncertainties, include, among others, the following possibilities: the 
      occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give 
      rise to right of one or both of the parties to terminate the definitive 
      merger agreement between SSB and Southeastern Bank Financial Corporation 
      (“SBFC”); the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted 
      against SSB or SBFC; the failure to obtain necessary regulatory 
      approvals (and the risk that such approvals may result in the imposition 
      of conditions that could adversely affect the combined company or the 
      expected benefits of the transaction), and shareholder approvals or to 
      satisfy any of the other conditions to the transaction on a timely basis 
      or at all; the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the 
      transaction are not realized when expected or at all, including as a 
      result of the impact of, or problems arising from, the integration of 
      the two companies or as a result of the strength of the economy and 
      competitive factors in the areas where SSB and SBFC do business; the 
      possibility that the transaction may be more expensive to complete than 
      anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events; 
      diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business operations and 
      opportunities; potential adverse reactions or changes to business or 
      employee relationships, including those resulting from the announcement 
      or completion of the transaction; SSB’s ability to complete the 
      acquisition and integration of SBFC successfully; credit risk associated 
      with an obligor’s failure to meet the terms of any contract with the 
      bank or otherwise fail to perform as agreed; interest risk involving the 
      effect of a change in interest rates on both the bank’s earnings and the 
      market value of the portfolio equity; liquidity risk affecting the 
      bank’s ability to meet its obligations when they come due; price risk 
      focusing on changes in market factors that may affect the value of 
      traded instruments in “mark-to-market” portfolios; transaction risk 
      arising from problems with service or product delivery; compliance risk 
      involving risk to earnings or capital resulting from violations of or 
      nonconformance with laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or 
      ethical standards; strategic risk resulting from adverse business 
      decisions or improper implementation of business decisions; reputation 
      risk that adversely affects earnings or capital arising from negative 
      public opinion; terrorist activities risk that results in loss of 
      consumer confidence and economic disruptions; cybersecurity risk related 
      to SSB’s dependence on internal computer systems and the technology of 
      outside service providers, as well as the potential impacts of 
      third-party security breaches, subjects the company to potential 
      business disruptions or financial losses resulting from deliberate 
      attacks or unintentional events; economic downturn risk resulting 
      changes in the credit markets, greater than expected noninterest 
      expenses, excessive loan losses and other factors and the implementation 
      of federal spending cuts currently scheduled to go into effect; and 
      other factors that may affect future results of SSB and SBFC. Additional 
      factors that could cause results to differ materially from those 
      described above can be found in SSB’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
      year ended December 31, 2015 and in its subsequent Quarterly Reports on 
      Form 10-Q, including for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, each of which 
      is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and 
      available in the “Investor Relations” section of SSB’s website, http://www.southstatebank.com, 
      under the heading “SEC Filings” and in other documents SSB files with 
      the SEC, and in SBFC’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 
      December 31, 2015 and in its subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, 
      including for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, each of which is on file 
      with the SEC and in other documents SBFC files with the SEC.
    

      All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made 
      and are based on information available at that time. Neither SSB nor 
      SBFC assumes any obligation to update forward-looking statements to 
      reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the 
      forward-looking statements were made or to reflect the occurrence of 
      unanticipated events except as required by federal securities laws. As 
      forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, 
      caution should be exercised against placing undue reliance on such 
      statements.

Southeastern Bank Financial Corp. Reports Positive Earnings For The Fourth Quarter And Year-End 2012






GlobeNewswire



Jan 25, 2013 11:42 AM EST













 


















































  "We significantly reduced our provision for loan losses due to the growing strength and stability of our loan portfolio," said Blanton. "We will continue to monitor our assets closely, however, keeping in line with our conservative approach to banking."   About Southeastern Bank Financial Corp.  Southeastern Bank Financial Corp. is the $1.7 billion-asset bank holding company of Georgia Bank & Trust Company of Augusta (GB&T). GB&T is the largest locally owned and operated community bank in the Augusta metro market, with nine full-service Augusta-area offices, three full-service offices in Aiken County, S.C. operating as Southern Bank & Trust and one limited service Loan Production Office in Athens, GA. The company also has mortgage operations in Augusta and Savannah. The banks focus primarily on real estate, commercial and consumer loans to individuals, small to medium-sized businesses and professionals, and also provides wealth management and trust services. The company's common stock is publicly traded under the symbol SBFC on OTCQB. Investors can find Real-Time quotes and market information for the Company on www.otcmarkets.com or by visiting the Company's Web site,   www.georgiabankandtrust.com .   Safe Harbor Statement – Forward-Looking Statements   Statements made in this release by Southeastern Bank Financial Corporation (The Company) other than those concerning historical information, should be considered forward-looking and subject to various risks and uncertainties. Such forward-looking statements are made based upon management's belief as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management pursuant to "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including: unanticipated changes in the Bank's local economy and in the national economy; governmental monetary and fiscal policies; deposit levels, loan demand, loan collateral values and securities portfolio values; difficulties in interest rate risk management; difficulties in operating in a variety of geographic areas; the effects of competition in the banking business; changes in governmental regulation relating to the banking industry, including regulations relating to branching and acquisitions; failure of assumptions underlying the establishment of reserves for loan losses, including the value of collateral underlying delinquent loans; and other factors. The Company cautions that such factors are not exclusive. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time to time by, or on behalf of, the Company.                SOUTHEASTERN BANK FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY                Consolidated Balance Sheets                  December 31, 2012     December 31, 2011     Assets   (Unaudited)                   Cash and due from banks   $ 39,565,757   $ 51,080,600    Interest-bearing deposits in other banks   4,322,317   18,760,812    Cash and cash equivalents   43,888,074   69,841,412               Available-for-sale securities   654,738,964   603,758,999               Loans held for sale   30,051,204   29,615,131               Loans   871,446,844   846,010,275     Less allowance for loan losses   28,846,336   29,045,876    Loans, net   842,600,508   816,964,399               Premises and equipment, net   26,145,378   27,608,118    Accrued interest receivable   6,602,879   6,246,880    Bank-owned life insurance   34,825,588   30,713,488    Restricted equity securities   5,295,600   5,086,000    Other real estate owned   3,489,887   6,208,720    Prepaid FDIC assessment   2,023,977   3,419,738    Deferred tax asset   10,406,187   12,723,238    Other assets   2,434,228   2,586,986                   $1,662,502,474   $1,614,773,109               Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity                      Deposits           Noninterest-bearing   $ 158,066,510   $ 147,196,034     Interest-bearing:           NOW accounts   349,531,376   346,235,936     Savings   504,193,793   471,727,749     Money management accounts   18,032,530   42,977,515     Time deposits over $100,000   280,870,648   286,318,774     Other time deposits   110,576,827   124,766,377        1,421,271,684   1,419,222,385               Securities sold under repurchase agreements   976,433   700,798    Advances from Federal Home Loan Bank   64,000,000   39,000,000    Accrued interest payable and other liabilities   18,924,619   15,874,526    Subordinated debentures   21,546,646   22,946,646               Total liabilities   1,526,719,382   1,497,744,355               Stockholders' equity:          Preferred stock, no par value;

Southeastern Bank Financial Corp (OTCPK:SBFC)
Accounts Receivable
=GURUF("SBFC","Accounts Receivable")

$5.49 Mil (As of Sep. 2016)
Accounts Receivable are created when a customer has received a product but has not yet paid for that product. Southeastern Bank Financial Corp's accounts receivables for the quarter that ended in Sep. 2016 was $5.49 Mil.
Accounts receivable can be measured by Days Sales Outstanding. Southeastern Bank Financial Corp's Days Sales Outstanding for the quarter that ended in Sep. 2016 was 25.91.
In Ben Grahams calculation of liquidation value, accounts receivable are only considered to be worth 75% of book value. Southeastern Bank Financial Corp's Liquidation Value for the quarter that ended in Sep. 2016 was $-1,587.42 Mil.

Definition
Accounts Receivable is money owed to a business by customers and shown on its Balance Sheet as an asset.

Explanation
1. Accounts Receivable are created when a customer has received a product but has not yet paid for that product. Days sales outstanding measures of the average number of days that a company takes to collect revenue after a sale has been made. It is a financial ratio that illustrates how well a company's accounts receivables are being managed.
Southeastern Bank Financial Corp's Days Sales Outstanding for the quarter that ended in Sep. 2016 is calculated as:



Days Sales Outstanding


=Account Receivable/Revenue*Days in Period

=5.492/19.344*91


=25.91



2. In Ben Grahams calculation of liquidation value, Southeastern Bank Financial Corp's accounts receivable are only considered to be worth 75% of book value:
Southeastern Bank Financial Corp's liquidation value for the quarter that ended in Sep. 2016 is calculated as:



Liquidation value


=Cash and Cash Equivalents-Total Liabilities+(0.75 * Account Receivable)+(0.5 * Inventory)


=95.392-1686.93+0.75 * 5.492+0.5 * 0


=-1,587.42



* All numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio. All numbers are in their local exchange's currency.

Be Aware
Net receivables tells us a great deal about the different competitors in the same industry. In competitive industries, some attempt to gain advantage by offering better credit terms, causing increase in sales and receivables.
If company consistently shows lower % Net receivables to gross sales than competitors, then it usually has some kind of competitive advantage which requires further digging.
Average Days Sales Outstanding is a good indicator for measuring a companys sales channel and customers. A company may book great revenue and earnings growth but never receive payment from their customers. This may force a write-off in the future and depress future earnings.
