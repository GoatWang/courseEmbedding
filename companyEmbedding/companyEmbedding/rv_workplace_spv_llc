Our RV Superstore in French Camp off of I-5, Our store in Historic Sacramento on El Camino and Our newest location in Beautiful Morgan Hill right off the 101. We have been meeting the needs of the RV community for over 50 years!!!Pan Pacific RV first began in Stockton under the name Mid-Valley Trailer Sales. It was very small but with a lot of hard work and determination, it grew to include approximately 40 new and used towable trailers, a small parts department, and a service facility with eight full bays plus a small storage area. In May of 1987, with a desire for growth, the company acquired the inventory of Pan Pacific RV Trailer Sales and expanded to include the location in Sacramento. Founded in 1946, this location claims the distinction of being one of the original "Fleetwood" travel trailer Dealers. Mid-Valley Trailers became Pan Pacific RV Centers.Moving our original location in Stockton just south to French Camp allowed us to continue to grow into the Full Service RV Dealership we are today. Stocking over 100 new and used motorhomes, fifth wheels, travel trailers and pop-ups at this location alone.  Wanting to expand into the Bay Area, Pan Pacific RV Centers took over the Old Alpine RV Center in Morgan Hill after they closed their doors in 2009. Three years later, We committed to the local community and relocated next door to the old Golden Oak restaurant site, developing it into one of the areas largest RV dealerships.Today We carry over 35 Brands and stock over 350 RVs for our customers to choose from.With a strong focus on customer service, continuous training for our family of employees, and the quality products that are sold, Pan Pacific RV strives to further develop the stability and consistency of our company.Since 1993, Pan Pacific RV Centers, Inc. has maintained the "CIRCLE OF EXCELLENCE" customer satisfaction award. In September of 2000, the company was nominated, recognized, and awarded the distinguished Western Region "DEALER OF THE YEAR" award by The National RV Dealers Association for outstanding contributions to the industry.Most recently, we were voted as one of North America's Top 50 RV Dealers by RV Business.We are dedicated to providing a professional, family oriented, teamwork environment in the workplace and it translates into the way We do business. We currently have over 40 employees selling and servicing over 35 brands of motorhomes and towables. Pan Pacific RV Centers, Inc. continually goes above and beyond to provide a level of honesty and integrity in our service to our customers. There's a reason we've been in the RV business over 50 years...Come in to one of our Stores and let us show you why!Price MatchPan Pacific RV Centers, Inc. guarantees to meet any Internet or local price from an authorized dealer of the RV brands we carry.
