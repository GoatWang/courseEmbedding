Accounts Payable
part of the Carillon ERP product line, by Carillon


Accounts Payable was designed for real world situations with simple and flexible check printing options. Checks can be printed from six different windows, with or without the invoice having previously been entered in the system. If an invoice needs to be entered and paid immediately, either of our voucher entry windows will allow you to enter the invoice information and print the check immediately. 
The cash requirements report uses the due date, terms due date and invoice date to determine which checks should be paid on this check run. By simply entering the date for this check run and the date of the next check run, Accounts Payable provides a listing of the checks that should be cut before the next check run.
The Accounts Payable clerk can then modify the list by partially paying invoices or removing them from the check run. 
Accounts Payable is tightly integrated with General Ledger to verify account numbers, open periods and years, and to automatically post balances in the cash disbursements and purchases journals. Accounts Payable is also integrates with the Time & Billing and Purchase Order.

Carillon-Sacré-Coeur History:
In 1903, a group of Jesuits and lay people in Quebec adopted Carillon-Sacré-Coeur as the national flag of French Canadians. Very quickly, other committees were set up throughout French Canada, from Quebec, Northern Ontario, to New Brunswick, to promote it. Nationalist circles were seeking to acquire a distinctive sign to replace the French tricolor (the flag of France) which was very popular among French-Canadians in the 19th century. The Carillon-Sacré-Coeur was a great success and is deployed in most major patriotic events throughout the first half of the 20th century, as elsewhere in Ontario.
In the center of the Carillon-Sacré-Coeur flag you can see the Sacred Heart wearing a crown of thorns, surmounted by a cross and surrounded by a garland of maple leaves. The blue background is in reference to Our Lady. The banner is crossed with a white cross and features to all over the lily, symbol of the French monarchy and also of Our Lady.
As you can see there is tremendous Catholic/Christian imagery within the flag. This Catholic identity was very strong and very much a part of French Canadians lives. – David Gilbert

Description



Un classico carillon per bambini che aiuta veramente a farli addormentare.
Presenta molta impostazioni anche la possibilità di attivare un monitor che in caso il bambino si svegli in piena notte e piange riattiva i automatico il carillon per calmarlo e per fargli prendere sonno.

E' proprio vero che dalle necessità vengono fuori i prodotti più utili :)
