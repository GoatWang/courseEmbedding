FAQ



Why should I choose NaturalShrimp?
NaturalShrimp is the FIRST truly eco-friendly, sustainable, closed system production facility that produces the best tasting, all-natural, premium quality shrimp year round without the use of antibiotics or chemicals.What kind of shrimp do you sell?
NaturalShrimp produces and sells Pacific White shrimp.
Where do you grow your shrimp?
We currently grow and harvest our shrimp in La Coste, TX…located just west of San Antonio. 
How are your shrimp grown?
NaturalShrimp’s method is based on the natural cycle found in an ocean environment.
What’s different?
We eliminated many of the ocean’s hazards to create an indoor production environment that is free of predators, weather hazards and chemicals. Naturally-found proteins provide a continuous food source so shrimp can thrive without the use of harmful antibiotics present in other shrimp farming methods.
The result: A closed, biologically secure, re-circulating, saltwater aquaculture system that produces safe, fresh, eco-friendly shrimp. And since our saltwater process does not require access to the ocean, soon you will find more NaturalShrimp operations near major metropolitan areas to deliver delicious, naturally produced shrimp directly to you 52 weeks a year.
How is Natural Shrimp Eco-Friendly?
Shrimp harvested and sold by NaturalShrimp has a virtually non-existent environmental impact as compared to traditional methods. The current preferred method of shrimp farmers around the world (especially in third world countries) utilize open air systems, or man-made shrimp ponds connected to the open ocean. Open air systems are environmentally destructive, have high chemical contamination levels and can foster widespread viral outbreaks that can wipe out an entire region’s shrimp production. Furthermore, in order to maximize their crop, farmers will use large quantities of antibiotics and dangerous levels of chemicals that pollute the oceans and in some cases make the shrimp they produce unsafe for human consumption.
Wild shrimp is caught by the process of ocean trawling. Ocean trawling involves the use of large, boat towed nets that are toxic to the undersea environment, disturb ocean-bottom ecosystems and catch a variety of non-shrimp sea life (called bycatch) which is usually killed and discarded as part of the shrimp harvesting process.
The NaturalShrimp process does not deplete natural resources, does not dump harmful chemicals into the ocean and does not use ocean trawlers that kill and dispose of unwanted bycatch marine life.
What is the difference between NaturalShrimp and wild shrimp caught in the ocean?
Most consumers are so used to that “iodine aftertaste” in shrimp that they don’t even notice it’s there…but it is. And most everyone thinks you’re supposed to “smell” shrimp on your hands after you eat it. The truth is, that “iodine aftertaste” is actually bromine (a chemical used in heavy duty cleansers) that the shrimp eat when they’re in the ocean or in a regular open-air shrimp farm. Furthermore, mercury and other contaminants found in wild caught shrimp will NOT be found in NaturalShrimp.
At NaturalShrimp, we don’t add chemicals! When we say our shrimp is fresh and naturally grown, we mean it! While many open-air shrimp farmers and wild fishers add sodium bisulfate to “prolong freshness,” we refuse to do so.
Is NaturalShrimp “Organic”?
The term “Organic” is still being defined as it applies to aquaculture. We feel we could achieve this coveted status….but, we cannot claim an “Organic” label until it has been defined. However, we do like to point out that our shrimp are “Naturally-grown and Sustainable, which to many is a higher standard than organic and fed with a non GMO feed.
Why is the NaturalShrimp process the future of the shrimp industry?
Shrimp is one of the most sought after seafood in the world and the oceans can only supply a finite amount of wild shrimp each year. According to the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service, the world consumes 9.5 billion pounds of shrimp annually, with over 1.7 billion consumed in the United States alone! And 1.3 billion pounds of shrimp are imported…most of it from Asia.
Approximately 65% of the global supply is provided by ocean trawlers which use large nets to catch their shrimp. This process is destructive, dangerous, unsafe and unsustainable. These nets are highly toxic, since they disturb sensitive ocean-bottom ecosystems and in the process, catch a large variety of non-shrimp sea life (bycatch) which is typically killed and discarded as waste.
With global populations surpassing seven billion and domestic consumption growing from 4% to 7% annually, it’s no wonder that global demand is outstripping the natural supply of wild caught shrimp. This is clearly an unsustainable production paradigm.
NaturalShrimp’s production facilities are the aquaculture industry’s first truly eco-friendly, sustainable way of cultivating shrimp in a high density environment. Our closed system production method can produce fresh, gourmet grade shrimp anywhere in the world without use of antibiotics, pollutants and chemicals or without further depleting the world’s oceans from overfishing.
What chemicals are used by other shrimp farming methods?
One chemical found in shrimp farms (especially those in Asia) is Chloramphenicol. This is a very strong antibiotic that is used to control widespread disease in high density shrimp farms. This chemical is banned in the U.S. because of its potentially lethal side effects.
Other chemicals banned by the US Food and Drug Administration include Malachite Green, Fluoroquinolones, Nitrofurans and Gentian Violet.
How does NaturalShrimp achieve a safe, high density growing environment, for its shrimp without antibiotics, probiotics and other chemicals?
The complete answer is a Company trade secret. However, part of our success is a result of our proprietary Vibrio Suppression Technology. This technology helps to protect our shrimp population from harmful organisms. Additionally, our computer monitoring system maintains proper levels of oxygen, salinity and temperature for optimal shrimp production.

 NaturalShrimp Inc. Announces Expansion Of Indoor Shrimp Operations




by NaturalShrimp Incorporated Posted: Wednesday, June 17, 2015 at 4:01PM EDT


	LA COSTE, Texas -- NaturalShrimp Incorporated (OTCQB: SHMP) reports that it will begin expanding its current indoor shrimp production system to launch commercial shrimp sales in August of this year. Wholesale prices for the shrimp produced by the company will be between $9.00 to $10.00 per pound F.O.B.

	"Over the past few years NaturalShrimp has grown its research, development and understanding for indoor shrimp production well beyond even our own expectations", said NaturalShrimp President Gerald Easterling. "Combining new water technology with our experience in growing shrimp has brought us to another positive milestone for the company. We look forward to expanding our operations beginning in the third quarter of this year."

	About NaturalShrimp Incorporated (OTCQB: SHMP)

	NaturalShrimp is a publically traded Agro-Tech company located near San Antonio, in La Coste Texas. NaturalShrimp has developed and tested the first commercially-viable system for growing shrimp indoors and is expanding current operations. This system uses a proprietary technology to reliably produce healthy, naturally-grown shrimp weekly without the use of antibiotics or toxic chemicals. www.naturalshrimp.com

	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT: This press release contains forward-looking statements, including expected industry patterns and other financial and business results that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from results expressed or implied by this press release. Such risk factors include, among others: the sustainability of recent growth rates in the holding industry; the positioning of NaturalShrimp Holdings, Inc. in the market; ability to integrate acquired companies and technology; ability to retain key employees; ability to successfully combine product offerings and customer acceptance of combined products; general market conditions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, changes to operating systems and product strategy by vendors of operating systems; and whether NaturalShrimp Inc. can successfully gain market acceptance. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements in this press release.

NaturalShrimp's system uses proprietary technology to reliably produce healthy, naturally-grown shrimp weekly.

NaturalShrimp Holdings Inc. Releases Investor Information for Capital Raise
 
(UNITED STATES, 3/19/2014)
Privately held indoor shrimp farming company NaturalShrimp Holdings Inc., has released information for Accredited Investors that are interested in the company's 506(c) private placement memorandum. 
NaturalShrimp is in the process of raising USD 3,500,000 for the construction of the first large scale indoor shrimp facility in North America projected to produce up to 6,000 pounds of fresh shrimp per week. 
On September 23, the JOBS Act-mandated SEC rule permitting general solicitation and advertising of private offerings conducted under SEC Rules 506(c) and Rule 144A went into effect, opening a key door to capital for U.S. and global companies. 








NaturalShrimp is delivered within hours of harvesting.



Lifting the ban on transparency in private offerings will also aid in producing more efficient pricing for private and public traded companies, as investors will be able to price in the performance of a private offering into a company's valuation. It could create a standard for more companies to share information in the public markets, creating a virtual circle for issuers and investors. 
Companies that are providing insight into their business operations and financials for the first time may be inclined to continue providing ongoing news and disclosure, whether on their website or through a public disclosure service such as OTC Markets Group's OTC Disclosure & News Service. 
While general solicitation of Rule 506(c) offerings is now permitted, purchasers in a Rule 506(c) offering must be "accredited investors." The SEC defines the term "accredited investor" in Rule 501(a). Generally, individuals are considered accredited investors if they have a net worth greater than USD 1 million (excluding their primary residence) or incomes in excess of USD 200,000 in the last two years with the expectation of the same in the current year (or USD 300,000 with a spouse). 






 Doug Ernst, Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Science and Technology.



NaturalShrimp Holdings Inc., Inc CEO Bill G. Williams stated, "Our new initiative to raise funds through a 506(c) exemption is very exciting and we look forward to partnering with new investors. NaturalShrimp is raising the capital so that we may proceed to the next step of our expansion and continue to market our revolutionary product to change the seafood industry for the better. Also, the funds will allows us the opportunity to step up our shrimp production to show the industry we are poised to be a large player in the future." 






The Company produces commercial quantities of shrimp in a closed system and a computer monitoring system automates monitors and maintains proper levels of oxygen, salinity and temperature for optimal shrimp production.



About NaturalShrimp Holdings, Inc. 
Founded in 2001, NaturalShrimp Holdings Inc. is a privately held Agro-Tech company located near San Antonio, in La Coste Texas. NaturalShrimp has developed and tested the first commercially-viable system for growing shrimp indoors and is currently raising capital for expansion. 
This system uses proprietary technology to reliably produce healthy, naturally-grown shrimp weekly without the use of antibiotics or toxic chemicals.






NaturalShrimp is the exclusive brand of shrimp harvested in the pristine, high-tech farms built by NaturalShrimp. 



NaturalShrimp is a global shrimp farming company that has developed and commercialized a technology to produce fresh, gourmet-grade shrimp reliably and economically in an enclosed, re-circulating, saltwater system. Its eco-friendly, bio-secure design does not rely on ocean water. It recreates the natural ocean environment allowing for high-density production which can be replicated anywhere in the world.
 NaturalShrimp Global, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of NaturalShrimp Holdings, Inc., is shareholder of NaturalShrimp International AS. NaturalShrimp International AS owns the exclusive rights to use the NaturalShrimp technology to grow and sell shrimp in all countries in Europe, Russia, Asia, and the Middle East. The first subsidiary, formed in Spain, is GambaNatural de España, S.L.
The land for the first facility has been purchased in Medina del Campo, Spain and construction of the 75,000 sq. ft. facility should be completed by early 2014. Medina del Campo is approximately seventy-five miles northwest of Madrid, Spain. In addition, GambaNatural has signed a distribution agreement with Izamar, S.A., located in San Sebastian de los Reyes, a suburb of Madrid. Izamar currently distributes live crabs and lobsters to over 300 customers around Madrid. In addition, Izamar has a booth license at the Mercamadrid, which is the second largest seafood market in the world. Izamar also owns two high-end seafood restaurants and one specialty seafood market.

WHAT IS NATURALSHRIMP?
NaturalShrimp is a global shrimp farming company that has developed a technology to produce fresh, gourmet-grade shrimp reliably and economically in an indoor, re-circulating, saltwater facility. Our eco-friendly, bio-secure design does not rely on ocean water. It recreates the natural ocean environment allowing for high-density production which can be replicated anywhere in the world.
 





    ABOUT US
The Company was founded by Gerald Easterling, Bill G. Williams and Tom Untermeyer in 2001. Mr. Williams serves as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Easterling serves as President and Mr. Untermeyer serves as a Consultant to the Company. Mr. Easterling also serves as Director of the Company and, in such capacity, along with the other board members and officers of the Company controls the operations, business, and affairs of the Company.
 TECHNOLOGY

Since its inception in 2001, NaturalShrimp has developed several proprietary technology assets that position the Company at the forefront of the global aquaculture industry. These “Trade Secret” assets include a knowledge base that allows the Company to produce commercial quantities of shrimp in a closed system and our computer monitoring system that automates monitors and maintains proper levels of oxygen, salinity and temperature for optimal shrimp production.
 INVESTOR RELATIONS

NaturalShrimp is a public Agro-Tech company located near San Antonio, Texas. NaturalShrimp has developed and tested the first commercially-viable system for growing shrimp indoors and is currently raising capital for expansion. This system uses proprietary technology to reliably produce a healthy, naturally-grown shrimp “crop” weekly, and accomplishes this without the use of antibiotics or toxic chemicals.
