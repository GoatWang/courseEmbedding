Shareholder Reports

The FMI Large Cap Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation through the purchase of a limited number of large capitalization value stocks. The Fund extends the core philosophy of the management company (Fiduciary Management, Inc.), buying good businesses at value prices, beyond the small to mid-capitalization range. Some of the characteristics of good businesses may include strong recurring revenue and attractive returns-on-investment capital. A strong orientation to low absolute or relative valuation is key to the execution of the investment strategy. As a non-diversified fund, the FMI Large Cap Fund tends to concentrate its investment on fewer companies than a diversified mutual fund. The Fund holds approximately 20-30 stocks, with most major industry groups represented.
Please refer to the Prospectus for a more detailed explanation of the FMI Large Cap Fund, the management, and an Application.

Equity Strategy Composites
Fiduciary’s objective is to buy durable businesses at value prices in order to achieve superior investment results over a three- to five-year time horizon. The essential tenets to our investment philosophy are:

We utilize a business owner’s approach to investing and thoroughly investigate the economics of the business and the qualities of management of each company.
Our approach is contrarian in nature as we invest in companies that have stumbled or are temporarily out of favor with the market, and hence improperly priced.
Our goal is to invest in durable business franchises that are selling at a discount to their intrinsic value.
We believe our investment process of purchasing good companies at low valuations will achieve superior risk-adjusted returns over a three- to five-year time horizon.

Shareholder Reports

The FMI Large Cap Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation through the purchase of a limited number of large capitalization value stocks. The Fund extends the core philosophy of the management company (Fiduciary Management, Inc.), buying good businesses at value prices, beyond the small to mid-capitalization range. Some of the characteristics of good businesses may include strong recurring revenue and attractive returns-on-investment capital. A strong orientation to low absolute or relative valuation is key to the execution of the investment strategy. As a non-diversified fund, the FMI Large Cap Fund tends to concentrate its investment on fewer companies than a diversified mutual fund. The Fund holds approximately 20-30 stocks, with most major industry groups represented.
Please refer to the Prospectus for a more detailed explanation of the FMI Large Cap Fund, the management, and an Application.

Equity Strategy Composites
Fiduciary’s objective is to buy durable businesses at value prices in order to achieve superior investment results over a three- to five-year time horizon. The essential tenets to our investment philosophy are:

We utilize a business owner’s approach to investing and thoroughly investigate the economics of the business and the qualities of management of each company.
Our approach is contrarian in nature as we invest in companies that have stumbled or are temporarily out of favor with the market, and hence improperly priced.
Our goal is to invest in durable business franchises that are selling at a discount to their intrinsic value.
We believe our investment process of purchasing good companies at low valuations will achieve superior risk-adjusted returns over a three- to five-year time horizon.
