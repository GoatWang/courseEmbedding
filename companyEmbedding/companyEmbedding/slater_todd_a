FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
 
Q:  How can I get a hold of you?
A:  You can email me anytime at slater.todd@gmail.comQ:  What’s the best way to find out about your poster releases? I keep missing out.A:  My prints are signed and numbered and can sell out very quickly.  The best way to get all the info is to join my mailing list or follow me on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.  When I release a print it will be announced simulateneously on all three of these.  Due to email spam rules I highly recommend joining all three to make sure your bases are covered.Here are the links: twitter + facebook + instagram Q:  When will I get my order and how is it packed?A:  We typically ship within one week of the order.  There are times when we run faster or a little slower depending on my deadlines.  Kristie packs and ships, and she knows how to pack minty fresh prints.  We sleeve all prints in a poly-bag to prevent scratching and wrap them in kraft paper to prevent sliding.  We use Uline tubes as of 2016.  They have a wall thickness of .125 which is the thickest they offer. Q:  Why does shipping cost what it does?I hate paying exorbitant shipping fees when I buy something so let's break down the shipping costs and figure this thing out! I buy sturdy Uline tubes which cost me $2.36 apiece. Every print is also protected in a poly-bag which costs .25 cents apiece plus the label and kraft paper to prevent sliding which costs .15 cents apiece.  I have the best success shipping with Priority Mail which usually takes 2-3 days to arrive if you’re in the US. The Priority rates vary from $8.15 - 10.15 depending on where you live in the US. So that puts my raw costs between $10.75 – $12.75. So in reality I’m actually losing money on shipping but I will try and keep the prices as low as I can for you all.Q: I received my poster and it's damaged. What do I do?Poster damage is extremely rare.  We take every precaution necessary to insure your print is not damaged.  If it does happen send me an email and let us know and we will replace it if possible. You will be responsible for shipping the poster back to us and we will refund your return shipping when the tube arrives back to us.
 
Q: Do you ship internationally?A: Yes, we do! Please understand that international shipments may take a little bit longer to arrive.

Occasional Acid Flashback - tee restock



$ 30.00


This tee is printed on a super soft American Apparel tri-blend track tee. I bought samples awhile back of literally every tee on the market and determined that this particular one fits and feels best. It's well worth the price of a blank. Be sure to check out the small print on the back between the shoulder blades.  It's meant to be a nod to Maude's headress :)

Mass Exodus






I made a Widespread Panic a couple of years back featuring a mass exodus of flying turtles in search of a new home. The whale and birds in this print are likely a few days behind them. The flock of birds resemble a school of fish emphasizing a feeling of safety in numbers.  Also of note is the sharp printing on this one along with a noticeable textured under print that's only seen in person.
NOTES: 18 x 12 inches /// 5 screens (2 metallic) /// editions signed and numbered: silver to 50 copies (sold out) & blue whale to 200 copies /// debuted at SXSW Flatstock 2017





                Default Title - Sold Out

Background[edit]
Personal life[edit]
Slater was born in July 1979 in Peoria, Illinois, United States.[4] His father, Wayne Slater, is an author and has been a political writer for the Dallas Morning News since the mid-1980s; he has co-written three books with James Moore, including Bush's Brain.[8] Todd Slater's mother is an English teacher. The Slater family moved to Austin, Texas when Todd was five years old.[4] Slater is married to wife Kristie[9] with whom he has three children.[1]
Education[edit]
Todd Slater graduated from Stephen F. Austin State University, Nacogdoches in Texas in 2002, majoring in art with an emphasis on design and minors in film and painting.[2][9]
Slater learned about digital media during an internship with Dave Turton at The Graphic Library, a producer of stock illustrations for Istockphoto.[1]
Career[edit]
Slater realized that making concert posters was what he wanted to do after discovering gigposters.com.[4] He started producing posters professionally when aged 24.[8]
His first professional poster commission was for Pretty Girls Make Graves.[8] He started sending unsolicited White Stripes poster designs to the band's tour manager and this led to him working with Rob Jones, who produced The White Stripes' gig posters, and later collaborations between Jones and Slater on gig posters for Jack White and Dave Matthews.[1][5]
Slater turned freelance in 2004.[8]
Influences[edit]
Todd Slater has cited a number of artistic influences including:

1966-68 Chicago art movement The Hairy Who[4]
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (an influence on some of Slater’s imagery)[5]
Figurative painters including Steven Assael, Lisa Yuskavage, Jenny Saville, John Currin and Peter Saul[8]
Aesthetic Apparatus[9]
Ames Bros.[9]

Work[edit]
Much of Slater's work is for major alternative bands, although he also has produced tour posters for some established and mainstream artists.[4] Although not a core part of Slater's work he has expressed an interest in album cover art, and produced six vinyl single sleeves for The Dead Weather in 2009.[5]
Slater produces film posters for the Mondo Gallery.
Stylistically Slater's gig poster designs tend to concentrate on the imagery and minimize the amount and size of text.[1] Most of his work is done on a computer with some elements done by hand. Each poster takes about 40 hours to produce.[9]

Background[edit]
Personal life[edit]
Slater was born in July 1979 in Peoria, Illinois, United States.[4] His father, Wayne Slater, is an author and has been a political writer for the Dallas Morning News since the mid-1980s; he has co-written three books with James Moore, including Bush's Brain.[8] Todd Slater's mother is an English teacher. The Slater family moved to Austin, Texas when Todd was five years old.[4] Slater is married to wife Kristie[9] with whom he has three children.[1]
Education[edit]
Todd Slater graduated from Stephen F. Austin State University, Nacogdoches in Texas in 2002, majoring in art with an emphasis on design and minors in film and painting.[2][9]
Slater learned about digital media during an internship with Dave Turton at The Graphic Library, a producer of stock illustrations for Istockphoto.[1]
Career[edit]
Slater realized that making concert posters was what he wanted to do after discovering gigposters.com.[4] He started producing posters professionally when aged 24.[8]
His first professional poster commission was for Pretty Girls Make Graves.[8] He started sending unsolicited White Stripes poster designs to the band's tour manager and this led to him working with Rob Jones, who produced The White Stripes' gig posters, and later collaborations between Jones and Slater on gig posters for Jack White and Dave Matthews.[1][5]
Slater turned freelance in 2004.[8]
Influences[edit]
Todd Slater has cited a number of artistic influences including:

1966-68 Chicago art movement The Hairy Who[4]

Stylistically Slater's gig poster designs tend to concentrate on the imagery and minimize the amount and size of text.[1] Most of his work is done on a computer with some elements done by hand. Each poster takes about 40 hours to produce.[9]

Background[edit]
Personal life[edit]
Slater was born in July 1979 in Peoria, Illinois, United States.[4] His father, Wayne Slater, is an author and has been a political writer for the Dallas Morning News since the mid-1980s; he has co-written three books with James Moore, including Bush's Brain.[8] Todd Slater's mother is an English teacher. The Slater family moved to Austin, Texas when Todd was five years old.[4] Slater is married to wife Kristie[9] with whom he has three children.[1]
Education[edit]
Todd Slater graduated from Stephen F. Austin State University, Nacogdoches in Texas in 2002, majoring in art with an emphasis on design and minors in film and painting.[2][9]
Slater learned about digital media during an internship with Dave Turton at The Graphic Library, a producer of stock illustrations for Istockphoto.[1]
Career[edit]
Slater realized that making concert posters was what he wanted to do after discovering gigposters.com.[4] He started producing posters professionally when aged 24.[8]
His first professional poster commission was for Pretty Girls Make Graves.[8] He started sending unsolicited White Stripes poster designs to the band's tour manager and this led to him working with Rob Jones, who produced The White Stripes' gig posters, and later collaborations between Jones and Slater on gig posters for Jack White and Dave Matthews.[1][5]
Slater turned freelance in 2004.[8]
Influences[edit]
Todd Slater has cited a number of artistic influences including:

1966-68 Chicago art movement The Hairy Who[4]
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (an influence on some of Slater’s imagery)[5]
Figurative painters including Steven Assael, Lisa Yuskavage, Jenny Saville, John Currin and Peter Saul[8]
Aesthetic Apparatus[9]
Ames Bros.[9]

Work[edit]
Much of Slater's work is for major alternative bands, although he also has produced tour posters for some established and mainstream artists.[4] Although not a core part of Slater's work he has expressed an interest in album cover art, and produced six vinyl single sleeves for The Dead Weather in 2009.[5]
Slater produces film posters for the Mondo Gallery.
Stylistically Slater's gig poster designs tend to concentrate on the imagery and minimize the amount and size of text.[1] Most of his work is done on a computer with some elements done by hand. Each poster takes about 40 hours to produce.[9]
Concert poster clients[edit]
