 OUR PROGRAMS
We are developing investigational therapies to address some of the most urgent needs of hemodialysis and peripheral artery disease patients, with the goal of redefining how these diseases are treated.

Technology Overview
Based on clinical and nonclinical studies, we believe that a one-time, local application of investigational vonapanitase to the external surface of the blood vessels during fistula surgical creation may enhance outward vascular remodeling and inhibit neointimal hyperplasia, thereby reducing the risk of fistula failure.
For a fistula to become usable for hemodialysis, the outflow vein experiences an increase in diameter and blood flow. This process, known as vascular remodeling, involves proliferation of cells in the vessel wall, secretion of proteases that degrade extracellular matrix, and synthesis of new extracellular matrix by these cells. Fistulas fail to become usable for dialysis or experience patency loss most commonly due to progressive scarring of the interior wall of the outflow vein near the lumen, resulting in stenosis of the vein lumen and obstruction of blood flow in the fistula. This form of vascular scarring, known as neointimal hyperplasia, typically occurs in response to vessel injury such as manipulation of blood vessels during fistula creation, the mechanical stress to the vein wall from the sudden and turbulent increase in blood flow or from corrective procedures to restore blood flow. The response of the vein to these injuries results in activation and recruitment of scar forming cells, which multiply and migrate from the outside wall to the inside wall of the blood vessel and produce a layer of tissue, creating a narrowing in the vein lumen and a reduction in fistula blood flow.

We demonstrated through nonclinical studies that vonapanitase, at the concentrations being studied in arteriovenous fistulas, causes partial fragmentation of elastin fibers, primarily in the adventitial (outer) layer of the vessel wall. Elastin fragmentation generates peptides in the adventitia that are chemo-attractants for cells possessing elastin receptors, including cells involved in vascular remodeling and the formation of neointimal hyperplasia. The generation of chemo-attractant peptides in the adventitia may thereby increase cells in the adventitia, promoting outward vascular remodeling. In experiment models, fragmentation of elastin is an early and essential event in outward vascular remodeling. The generation of chemo-attractant peptides in the adventitia may also reduce cell migration to the vessel lumen, focusing the healing response to vessel injury to the adventitial layer and inhibiting neointimal hyperplasia. Vonapanitase has also been shown to lead to vessel dilation when administered at a sufficient concentration.

Investigational Vonapanitase in Chronic Kidney Disease

Investigational Vonapanitase in Peripheral Artery Disease







Our lead drug candidate, vonapanitase, has the potential to redefine the care of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who require a radiocephalic fistula for hemodialysis by reducing the rate of fistula abandonment and improving fistula use for hemodialysis. Improving radiocephalic fistula outcomes is an urgent priority for hemodialysis patients, their surgeons, nephrologists and other caregivers.
Based on our clinical and nonclinical studies, we believe that a one-time, local application of investigational vonapanitase to the external surface of the blood vessel during fistula surgical creation may inhibit neointimal hyperplasia and enhance outward vascular remodeling.

Investigational vonapanitase has the potential to reduce the symptoms of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and may improve the durability of endovascular procedures by improving blood flow to the legs. In patients with PAD, investigational vonapanitase is administered locally to blood vessels either in conjunction with an endovascular procedure or as a monotherapy. When administered in high concentrations, nonclinical studies in human vessels have shown that vonapanitase causes elastin fragmentation throughout the vessel. Extensive elastin fragmentation reduces elastin’s constricting force, which is believed to lead to vessel dilation. Vessel wall strength is provided by collagen, which is not affected by investigational vonapanitase administration.

 Clinical Need
Patients with kidney and vascular diseases need innovative solutions that deliver clinically meaningful benefits.




Hemodialysis Vascular Access
Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) requiring hemodialysis must have a functioning vascular access that provides sufficiently high blood flow to complete a dialysis session in approximately four hours. Vascular access is a hemodialysis patient’s lifeline, without which a patient cannot receive this life-saving treatment.
The preferred form of vascular access is a radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula, which is created when a surgeon connects a vein to an artery in the forearm. Unfortunately, radiocephalic fistulas suffer from a high rate of failure during the first year, typically due to insufficient blood flow, which precludes hemodialysis.

Up to 40% will be abandoned (secondary patency loss)
More than 50% will fail to be used for hemodialysis because the fistula either has inadequate blood flow or cannot be successfully cannulated
Up to 70% will experience either a thrombosis or undergo a corrective procedure to restore or maintain blood flow (primary patency loss)

In hemodialysis patients, the consequences of fistula abandonment or non-use can be severe, including a reduction in dialysis adequacy and one or more additional surgical procedures to create a new vascular access. Patients will also be subjected to the potentially severe consequences of catheter exposure including:

Reduced quality of life
2x mortality risk in the 1st year
2x rate of hospitalization in the first 6 months

LEARN ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF VONAPANITASE





Physician and Patient Perspectives
By tackling the difficult challenges facing patients with kidney disease, we aim to address the urgent demand for new treatments to improve patient outcomes. Hear directly from patients and physicians here.




Peripheral Artery Disease


Patients with PAD experience a blockage in the arteries providing blood to the legs, often resulting in reduced quality of life, with daily activities significantly curtailed by leg pain that only abates with rest. Patients may also experience leg pain at rest, gangrene or tissue death, and may require amputation. Many patients with PAD do not receive meaningful symptom relief from lifestyle modification, exercise, or medical therapy. For these patients, the next option is typically an invasive revascularization procedure such as open surgical bypass or angioplasty. These procedures often lack durability, resulting in the potential for repeat interventions, symptom recurrence and disease progression.

 About Proteon
We are working to deliver a new future for patients and families affected by kidney and vascular diseases, where innovation drives health improvement and healthcare professionals have the tools they need to improve patient outcomes.

Overview
Proteon Therapeutics is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of patients and families affected by kidney and vascular diseases. Our goal is to address some of the most urgent needs of patients by developing potentially transformative solutions that redefine how these diseases are treated. Our lead product candidate, vonapanitase, is a first-in-class, investigational drug intended to treat vessel injury that leads to blood vessel blockage and reduced blood flow. Vonapanitase is currently being evaluated in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical study in hemodialysis vascular access. Vonapanitase has received breakthrough, fast track and orphan drug designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and orphan medicinal product designation from the European Commission for hemodialysis vascular access indications.
For people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) requiring hemodialysis, a functioning vascular access is their lifeline to care, enabling connection to a dialysis machine three times per week for life-saving blood cleansing. The preferred form of vascular access is a radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula created in the forearm. Unfortunately, up to 40% of radiocephalic fistulas will be abandoned within one year of surgical creation and more than 50% will fail to be used for hemodialysis. The clinical consequences of fistula abandonment are severe, including a reduction in dialysis adequacy, one or more surgical procedures to create a new vascular access, and prolonged exposure to dialysis catheters, the worst form of vascular access due to the increased risk of infection, hospitalization and death. We are currently conducting a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating whether a single topical administration of investigational vonapanitase can improve radiocephalic fistula outcomes. We are not aware of any products approved in the U.S. or Europe that would compete with vonapanitase for the improvement of secondary patency (time to abandonment) and fistula use for hemodialysis.
Vonapanitase is also being studied in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Patients with PAD suffer from a blockage in the arteries providing blood to the legs, which may result in impaired walking ability, leg pain and gangrene, and ultimately amputation. Many patients undergo invasive revascularization procedures to treat the blockage, but these procedures have poor long-term durability, resulting in the potential for repeat interventions, symptom recurrence and disease progression. Building on prior Phase 1 results, our current Phase 1 clinical trial is evaluating whether a single local administration of vonapanitase can reduce the symptoms of PAD in patients undergoing angioplasty of an artery below the knee.

About 



































ProteonSearch


 About Proteon
We are working to deliver a new future for patients and families affected by kidney and vascular diseases, where innovation drives health improvement and healthcare professionals have the tools they need to improve patient outcomes.

Overview
Proteon Therapeutics is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of patients and families affected by kidney and vascular diseases. Our goal is to address some of the most urgent needs of patients by developing potentially transformative solutions that redefine how these diseases are treated. Our lead product candidate, vonapanitase, is a first-in-class, investigational drug intended to treat vessel injury that leads to blood vessel blockage and reduced blood flow. Vonapanitase is currently being evaluated in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical study in hemodialysis vascular access. Vonapanitase has received breakthrough, fast track and orphan drug designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and orphan medicinal product designation from the European Commission for hemodialysis vascular access indications.
For people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) requiring hemodialysis, a functioning vascular access is their lifeline to care, enabling connection to a dialysis machine three times per week for life-saving blood cleansing. The preferred form of vascular access is a radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula created in the forearm. Unfortunately, up to 40% of radiocephalic fistulas will be abandoned within one year of surgical creation and more than 50% will fail to be used for hemodialysis. The clinical consequences of fistula abandonment are severe, including a reduction in dialysis adequacy, one or more surgical procedures to create a new vascular access, and prolonged exposure to dialysis catheters, the worst form of vascular access due to the increased risk of infection, hospitalization and death. We are currently conducting a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating whether a single topical administration of investigational vonapanitase can improve radiocephalic fistula outcomes. We are not aware of any products approved in the U.S. or Europe that would compete with vonapanitase for the improvement of secondary patency (time to abandonment) and fistula use for hemodialysis.
Vonapanitase is also being studied in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Patients with PAD suffer from a blockage in the arteries providing blood to the legs, which may result in impaired walking ability, leg pain and gangrene, and ultimately amputation. Many patients undergo invasive revascularization procedures to treat the blockage, but these procedures have poor long-term durability, resulting in the potential for repeat interventions, symptom recurrence and disease progression. Building on prior Phase 1 results, our current Phase 1 clinical trial is evaluating whether a single local administration of vonapanitase can reduce the symptoms of PAD in patients undergoing angioplasty of an artery below the knee.

Proteon Therapeutics, Inc. is a developer of pharmaceuticals with offices in Waltham, Massachusetts and Kansas City, Missouri.
Proteon was founded by Dr. F. Nicholas Franano based on technology created at Johns Hopkins University. Major investors in the company include MPM Capital, Rockhill Partners, TVM Capital, Skyline Ventures, Prism VentureWorks, Vectis Life Sciences and Intersouth Partners. They have invested over $72 million in the company.[1]
The company is led by Timothy Noyes, CEO; Steven Burke, CMO; George Eldridge, CFO; and Scott Toner, director of marketing.[2]
On March 5, 2009, the company announced that it had raised $32 million from its existing investors plus MPM Capital and Vectis Life Sciences. Proteon also announced that it had entered into an option agreement to be acquired by Novartis for up to $550 million.[3] The company went public in 2014.[4]
PRT-201[edit]
Proteon is developing PRT-201 (vonapanitase), a drug to improve blood flow following vascular surgery procedures, and, more broadly, is interested in vascular access for hemodialysis and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PRT-201 is a recombinant human elastase[5] manufactured for Proteon by Lonza.[6]
In September 2008, the company announced that the Food and Drug Administration had granted fast track status to PRT-201. In December 2016, they announced that the phase III trial of PRT-201 hadn't reached its primary endpoint, causing Proteon's stock price to drop more than 75%.[7]
