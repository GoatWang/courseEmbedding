PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT

THIS PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") made and entered into this 27th day of July, 2017 (the "Execution Date"),BETWEEN:

 ____________________________ of _________________________, _______________, __________, __________, and ____________________________ of _________________________, _______________, __________, __________(individually the "Partner" and collectively the "Partners").
	
BACKGROUND:


The Partners wish to associate themselves as partners in business.

This Agreement sets out the terms and conditions that govern the Partners within the Partnership.


IN CONSIDERATION OF and as a condition of the Partners entering into this Agreement and other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which consideration is acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:
	

Formation

By this Agreement the Partners enter into a general partnership (the "Partnership") in accordance with the laws of The State of Alabama. The rights and obligations of the Partners will be as as stated in the applicable legislation of The State of Alabama (the 'Act') except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.

Name

The firm name of the Partnership will be: ____________________.

Purpose

The purpose of the Partnership will be: ___________________________________.

Term

The Partnership will begin on July 27th, 2017 and will continue until terminated as provided in this Agreement.

Place of Business

The principal office of the business of the Partnership will be located at ____________________, __________, __________, __________ or such other place as the Partners may from time to time designate.

Capital Contributions

Each of the Partners has contributed to the capital of the Partnership, in cash or property in agreed upon value, as follows (the "Capital Contribution"):



Partner



Contribution Description



Agreed Value




 
					
 
					

$0.00 USD
						



 
					
 
					

$0.00 USD
						




All Partners will contribute their respective Capital Contributions fully and on time.

Withdrawal of Capital

No Partner will withdraw any portion of their Capital Contribution without the express written consent of the remaining Partners.

Additional Capital

Capital Contributions may be amended from time to time, according to the requirements of the Partnership provided that the interests of the Partners are not affected, except with the unanimous consent of the Partners. No Partner will be required to make Additional Capital Contributions. Whenever additional capital is determined to be required and an individual Partner is unwilling or unable to meet the additional contribution requirement within a reasonable period, as required by Partnership business obligations, remaining Partners may contribute in proportion to their existing Capital Contributions to resolve the amount in default. In such case the allocation of profits or losses among all the Partners will be adjusted to reflect the aggregate change in Capital Contributions by the Partners.

Any advance of money to the Partnership by any Partner in excess of the amounts provided for in this Agreement or subsequently agreed to as Additional Capital Contribution will be deemed a debt owed by the Partnership and not an increase in Capital Contribution of the Partner. This liability will be repaid with interest at rates and times to be determined by a majority of the Partners within the limits of what is required or permitted in the Act. This liability will not entitle the lending Partner to any increased share of the Partnership's profits nor to a greater voting power. Such debts may have preference or priority over any other payments to Partners as may be determined by a majority of the Partners.

Capital Accounts

An individual capital account (the "Capital Accounts") will be maintained for each Partner and their Initial Capital Contribution will be credited to this account. Any Additional Capital Contributions made by any Partner will be credited to that Partner's individual Capital Account.

Interest on Capital

No borrowing charge or loan interest will be due or payable to any Partner on their agreed Capital Contribution inclusive of any agreed Additional Capital Contributions.

Financial Decisions

Decisions regarding the distribution of profits, allocation of losses, and the requirement for Additional Capital Contributions as well as all other financial matters will be decided by a unanimous vote of the Partners.

Profit and Loss

Subject to any other provisions of this Agreement, the net profits and losses of the Partnership, for both accounting and tax purposes, will accrue to and be borne by the Partners in equal proportions (the "Profit and Loss Distribution").

Books of Account

Accurate and complete books of account of the transactions of the Partnership will be kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and at all reasonable times will be available and open to inspection and examination by any Partner. The books and records of the Partnership will reflect all the Partnership’s transactions and will be appropriate and adequate for the business conducted by the Partnership.

Annual Report

As soon as practicable after the close of each fiscal year, the Partnership will furnish to each Partner an annual report showing a full and complete account of the condition of the Partnership. This report will consist of at least the following documents:

a statement of all information as will be necessary for the preparation of each Partner's income or other tax returns;

a copy of the Partnership's federal income tax returns for that fiscal year; and

any additional information that the Partners may require.



Banking and Partnership Funds

The funds of the Partnership will be placed in such investments and banking accounts as will be designated by the Partners.  Partnership funds will be held in the name of the Partnership and will not be commingled with those of any other person or entity.

Fiscal Year

The fiscal year will end on the ______ day of ________________ of each year.

Audit

Any of the Partners will have the right to request an audit of the Partnership books. The cost of the audit will be borne by the Partnership. The audit will be performed by an accounting firm acceptable to all the Partners. Not more than one (1) audit will be required by any or all of the Partners for any fiscal year.

Management

Except as all of the Partners may otherwise agree in writing, all actions and decisions respecting the management, operation and control of the Partnership and its business will be decided by a unanimous vote of the Partners.

Contract Binding Authority

Each Partner will have authority to bind the Partnership in contract.

Tax Matters Partner

The tax matters partner will be ____________________________ (the "Tax Matters Partner"). The Tax Matters Partner will prepare, or cause to be prepared, all tax returns and reports for the Partnership and make any related elections that the Partners deem advisable.

A Tax Matters Partner can voluntarily withdraw from the position of Tax Matters Partner or can be appointed or replaced by a majority vote of the other Partners. In the event of a withdrawal of the Tax Matters Partner from the Partnership, the remaining Partners will appoint a successor as soon as practicable.

Meetings

Regular meetings of the Partners will be held as required.

Any Partner can call a special meeting to resolve issues that require a vote, as indicated by this Agreement, by providing all Partners with reasonable notice. In the case of a special vote, the meeting will be restricted to the specific purpose for which the meeting was held.

All meetings will be held at a time and in a location that is reasonable, convenient and practical considering the situation of all Partners.

Admitting a New Partner

A new Partner may only be admitted to the Partnership with a majority vote of the existing Partners.

Any new Partner agrees to be bound by all the covenants, terms, and conditions of this Agreement, inclusive of all current and future amendments. Further, a new Partner will execute such documents as are needed to effect the admission of the new Partner. Any new Partner will receive such business interest in the Partnership as determined by a unanimous decision of the other Partners.

Voluntary Withdrawal of a Partner

Any Partner will have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the Partnership at any time. Written notice of intention to withdraw must be served upon the remaining Partners at least three (3) months prior to the withdrawal date.

The voluntary withdrawal of a Partner will result in the dissolution of the Partnership.

A Dissociated Partner will only exercise the right to withdraw in good faith and will act to minimize any present or future harm done to the remaining Partners as a result of the withdrawal.

Involuntary Withdrawal of a Partner

Events resulting in the involuntary withdrawal of a Partner from the Partnership will include but not be limited to: death of a Partner; Partner mental incapacity; Partner disability preventing reasonable participation in the Partnership; Partner incompetence; breach of fiduciary duties by a Partner; criminal conviction of a Partner; Expulsion of a Partner; Operation of Law against a Partner; or any act or omission of a Partner that can reasonably be expected to bring the business or societal reputation of the Partnership into disrepute.

The involuntary withdrawal of a Partner will result in the dissolution of the Partnership.

A trustee in bankruptcy or similar third party who may acquire that Dissociated Partner's interest in the Partnership will only acquire that Partner's economic rights and interests and will not acquire any other rights of that Partner or be admitted as a Partner of the Partnership or have the right to exercise any management or voting interests.

Dissociation of a Partner

Where the dissociation of a Partner for any reason results in the dissolution of the Partnership then the Partnership will proceed in a reasonable and timely manner to dissolve the Partnership, with all debts being paid first, prior to any distribution of the remaining funds. Valuation and distribution will be determined as described in the Valuation of Interest section of this Agreement.

The remaining Partners retain the right to seek damages from a Dissociated Partner where the dissociation resulted from a malicious or criminal act by the Dissociated Partner or where the Dissociated Partner had breached their fiduciary duty to the Partnership or was in breach of this Agreement or had acted in a way that could reasonably be foreseen to bring harm or damage to the Partnership or to the reputation of the Partnership.

Dissolution

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Partnership may be dissolved only with the unanimous consent of all Partners.

Distribution of Property on Dissolution of Partnership

In the event of the dissolution of the Partnership, each Partner will share equally (the "Dissolution Distribution") in any remaining assets or liabilities of the Partnership.

Upon Dissolution of the Partnership and liquidation of Partnership Property, and after payment of all selling costs and expenses, the liquidator will distribute the Partnership assets to the following groups according to the following order of priority:

in satisfaction of liabilities to creditors except Partnership obligations to current Partners;

in satisfaction of Partnership debt obligations to current Partners; and then

to the Partners according to the Dissolution Distribution described above.



The claims of each priority group will be satisfied in full before satisfying any claims of a lower priority group. Any excess of Partnership assets after liabilities or any insufficiency in Partnership assets in resolving liabilities under this section will be shared by the Partners according to the Dissolution Distribution described above.

Valuation of Interest

In the absence of a written agreement setting a value, the value of the Partnership will be based on the fair market value appraisal of all Partnership assets (less liabilities) determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This appraisal will be conducted by an independent accounting firm agreed to by all Partners. An appraiser will be appointed within a reasonable period of the date of withdrawal or dissolution. The results of the appraisal will be binding on all Partners. A withdrawing Partner's interest will be based on that Partner's proportion of the Dissolution Distribution described above, less any outstanding liabilities the withdrawing Partner may have to the Partnership. The intent of this section is to ensure the survival of the Partnership despite the withdrawal of any individual Partner.

No allowance will be made for goodwill, trade name, patents or other intangible assets, except where those assets have been reflected on the Partnership books immediately prior to valuation.

Goodwill

The goodwill of the Partnership business will be assessed at an amount to be determined by appraisal using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

Title to Partnership Property

Title to all Partnership Property will remain in the name of the Partnership. No Partner or group of Partners will have any ownership interest in such Partnership Property in whole or in part.

Voting

Any vote required by the Partnership will be assessed where each Partner receives one vote carrying equal weight.

Force Majeure

A Partner will be free of liability to the Partnership where the Partner is prevented from executing their obligations under this Agreement in whole or in part due to force majeure, such as earthquake, typhoon, flood, fire, and war or any other unforeseen and uncontrollable event where the Partner has communicated the circumstance of said event to any and all other Partners and taken any and all appropriate action to mitigate said event.

Duty of Loyalty

No Partner will engage in any business, venture or transaction, whether directly or indirectly, that might be competitive with the business of the Partnership or that would be in direct conflict of interest to the Partnership without the unanimous written consent of the remaining Partners. Any and all businesses, ventures or transactions with any appearance of conflict of interest must be fully disclosed to all other Partners. Failure to comply with any of the terms of this clause will be deemed an Involuntary Withdrawal of the offending Partner and may be treated accordingly by the remaining Partners.

Duty of Accountability for Private Profits

Each Partner must account to the Partnership for any benefit derived by that Partner without the consent of the other Partners from any transaction concerning the Partnership or any use by that Partner of the Partnership property, name or business connection. This duty continues to apply to any transactions undertaken after the Partnership has been dissolved but before the affairs of the Partnership have been completely wound up by the surviving Partner or Partners or their agent or agents.

Duty to Devote Time

Each Partner will devote such time and attention to the business of the Partnership as the majority of the Partners will from time to time reasonably determine for the conduct of the Partnership business.

Forbidden Acts

No Partner may do any act in contravention of this Agreement.

No Partner may permit, intentionally or unintentionally, the assignment of express, implied or apparent authority to a third party that is not a Partner in the Partnership.

No Partner may do any act that would make it impossible to carry on the ordinary business of the Partnership.

No Partner may confess a judgment against the Partnership.

No Partner will have the right or authority to bind or obligate the Partnership to any extent with regard to any matter outside the intended purpose of the Partnership.

Any violation of the above Forbidden Acts will be deemed an Involuntary Withdrawal of the offending Partner and may be treated accordingly by the remaining Partners.

Indemnification

All Partners will be indemnified and held harmless by the Partnership from and against any and all claims of any nature, whatsoever, arising out of a Partner's participation in Partnership affairs. A Partner will not be entitled to indemnification under this section for liability arising out of gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Partner or the breach by the Partner of any provisions of this Agreement.

Liability

                        LawDepot TM is an online legal form site through which consumers are able to purchase customized legal documents. Consumers are advised to read and understand all of the information provided on the company website prior to becoming involved with the process. The process for creating forms through LawDepot TM is quite simple, however these forms are not a substitute for legal advice.Of the complaints processed by the BBB since opening its file on LawDepot TM, nearly all of the disputes result from misunderstandings concerning the site's access to forms that could have been avoided if the purchasers had read and understood the licence types and pricing policies. The BBB urges consumers to read and understand all of the site's policies before selecting a licence or creating forms. Law Depot offers licence types, each of which has a different cost, and access limit. Many consumers select the Trial Subscription, which is offered for free for one week. This trial must be cancelled within the free week in order to avoid monthly subscription charges. Complaints filed with BBB show that consumers neglect to cancel during the trial period, and are unhappy when they notice the charges on their credit card.   Monday to Friday, 8am to 7pm ET.

Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        LawDepot TM has received 4.07 out of 5 stars based on 24 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT

THIS PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") made and entered into this 27th day of July, 2017 (the "Execution Date"),BETWEEN:

 ____________________________ of _________________________, _______________, __________, __________, and ____________________________ of _________________________, _______________, __________, __________(individually the "Partner" and collectively the "Partners").
	
BACKGROUND:


The Partners wish to associate themselves as partners in business.

This Agreement sets out the terms and conditions that govern the Partners within the Partnership.


IN CONSIDERATION OF and as a condition of the Partners entering into this Agreement and other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which consideration is acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:
	

Formation

By this Agreement the Partners enter into a general partnership (the "Partnership") in accordance with the laws of The State of Alabama. The rights and obligations of the Partners will be as as stated in the applicable legislation of The State of Alabama (the 'Act') except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.

Name

The firm name of the Partnership will be: ____________________.

Purpose

The purpose of the Partnership will be: ___________________________________.

Term

The Partnership will begin on July 27th, 2017 and will continue until terminated as provided in this Agreement.

Place of Business

The principal office of the business of the Partnership will be located at ____________________, __________, __________, __________ or such other place as the Partners may from time to time designate.

Capital Contributions

Each of the Partners has contributed to the capital of the Partnership, in cash or property in agreed upon value, as follows (the "Capital Contribution"):



Partner



Contribution Description



Agreed Value




 
					
 
					

$0.00 USD
						



 
					
 
					

$0.00 USD
						




All Partners will contribute their respective Capital Contributions fully and on time.

Withdrawal of Capital

No Partner will withdraw any portion of their Capital Contribution without the express written consent of the remaining Partners.

Additional Capital

Capital Contributions may be amended from time to time, according to the requirements of the Partnership provided that the interests of the Partners are not affected, except with the unanimous consent of the Partners. No Partner will be required to make Additional Capital Contributions. Whenever additional capital is determined to be required and an individual Partner is unwilling or unable to meet the additional contribution requirement within a reasonable period, as required by Partnership business obligations, remaining Partners may contribute in proportion to their existing Capital Contributions to resolve the amount in default. In such case the allocation of profits or losses among all the Partners will be adjusted to reflect the aggregate change in Capital Contributions by the Partners.

Any advance of money to the Partnership by any Partner in excess of the amounts provided for in this Agreement or subsequently agreed to as Additional Capital Contribution will be deemed a debt owed by the Partnership and not an increase in Capital Contribution of the Partner. This liability will be repaid with interest at rates and times to be determined by a majority of the Partners within the limits of what is required or permitted in the Act. This liability will not entitle the lending Partner to any increased share of the Partnership's profits nor to a greater voting power. Such debts may have preference or priority over any other payments to Partners as may be determined by a majority of the Partners.

Capital Accounts

An individual capital account (the "Capital Accounts") will be maintained for each Partner and their Initial Capital Contribution will be credited to this account. Any Additional Capital Contributions made by any Partner will be credited to that Partner's individual Capital Account.

Interest on Capital

No borrowing charge or loan interest will be due or payable to any Partner on their agreed Capital Contribution inclusive of any agreed Additional Capital Contributions.

Financial Decisions

Decisions regarding the distribution of profits, allocation of losses, and the requirement for Additional Capital Contributions as well as all other financial matters will be decided by a unanimous vote of the Partners.

Profit and Loss

Subject to any other provisions of this Agreement, the net profits and losses of the Partnership, for both accounting and tax purposes, will accrue to and be borne by the Partners in equal proportions (the "Profit and Loss Distribution").

Books of Account

Accurate and complete books of account of the transactions of the Partnership will be kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and at all reasonable times will be available and open to inspection and examination by any Partner. The books and records of the Partnership will reflect all the Partnership’s transactions and will be appropriate and adequate for the business conducted by the Partnership.

Annual Report

As soon as practicable after the close of each fiscal year, the Partnership will furnish to each Partner an annual report showing a full and complete account of the condition of the Partnership. This report will consist of at least the following documents:

a statement of all information as will be necessary for the preparation of each Partner's income or other tax returns;

a copy of the Partnership's federal income tax returns for that fiscal year; and

any additional information that the Partners may require.



Banking and Partnership Funds

The funds of the Partnership will be placed in such investments and banking accounts as will be designated by the Partners.  Partnership funds will be held in the name of the Partnership and will not be commingled with those of any other person or entity.

Fiscal Year

The fiscal year will end on the ______ day of ________________ of each year.

Audit

Any of the Partners will have the right to request an audit of the Partnership books. The cost of the audit will be borne by the Partnership. The audit will be performed by an accounting firm acceptable to all the Partners. Not more than one (1) audit will be required by any or all of the Partners for any fiscal year.

Management

Except as all of the Partners may otherwise agree in writing, all actions and decisions respecting the management, operation and control of the Partnership and its business will be decided by a unanimous vote of the Partners.

Contract Binding Authority

Each Partner will have authority to bind the Partnership in contract.

Tax Matters Partner

The tax matters partner will be ____________________________ (the "Tax Matters Partner"). The Tax Matters Partner will prepare, or cause to be prepared, all tax returns and reports for the Partnership and make any related elections that the Partners deem advisable.

A Tax Matters Partner can voluntarily withdraw from the position of Tax Matters Partner or can be appointed or replaced by a majority vote of the other Partners. In the event of a withdrawal of the Tax Matters Partner from the Partnership, the remaining Partners will appoint a successor as soon as practicable.

Meetings

Regular meetings of the Partners will be held as required.

Any Partner can call a special meeting to resolve issues that require a vote, as indicated by this Agreement, by providing all Partners with reasonable notice. In the case of a special vote, the meeting will be restricted to the specific purpose for which the meeting was held.

All meetings will be held at a time and in a location that is reasonable, convenient and practical considering the situation of all Partners.

Admitting a New Partner

A new Partner may only be admitted to the Partnership with a majority vote of the existing Partners.

Any new Partner agrees to be bound by all the covenants, terms, and conditions of this Agreement, inclusive of all current and future amendments. Further, a new Partner will execute such documents as are needed to effect the admission of the new Partner. Any new Partner will receive such business interest in the Partnership as determined by a unanimous decision of the other Partners.

Voluntary Withdrawal of a Partner

Any Partner will have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the Partnership at any time. Written notice of intention to withdraw must be served upon the remaining Partners at least three (3) months prior to the withdrawal date.

The voluntary withdrawal of a Partner will result in the dissolution of the Partnership.

A Dissociated Partner will only exercise the right to withdraw in good faith and will act to minimize any present or future harm done to the remaining Partners as a result of the withdrawal.

Involuntary Withdrawal of a Partner

Events resulting in the involuntary withdrawal of a Partner from the Partnership will include but not be limited to: death of a Partner; Partner mental incapacity; Partner disability preventing reasonable participation in the Partnership; Partner incompetence; breach of fiduciary duties by a Partner; criminal conviction of a Partner; Expulsion of a Partner; Operation of Law against a Partner; or any act or omission of a Partner that can reasonably be expected to bring the business or societal reputation of the Partnership into disrepute.

The involuntary withdrawal of a Partner will result in the dissolution of the Partnership.

A trustee in bankruptcy or similar third party who may acquire that Dissociated Partner's interest in the Partnership will only acquire that Partner's economic rights and interests and will not acquire any other rights of that Partner or be admitted as a Partner of the Partnership or have the right to exercise any management or voting interests.

Dissociation of a Partner

Where the dissociation of a Partner for any reason results in the dissolution of the Partnership then the Partnership will proceed in a reasonable and timely manner to dissolve the Partnership, with all debts being paid first, prior to any distribution of the remaining funds. Valuation and distribution will be determined as described in the Valuation of Interest section of this Agreement.

The remaining Partners retain the right to seek damages from a Dissociated Partner where the dissociation resulted from a malicious or criminal act by the Dissociated Partner or where the Dissociated Partner had breached their fiduciary duty to the Partnership or was in breach of this Agreement or had acted in a way that could reasonably be foreseen to bring harm or damage to the Partnership or to the reputation of the Partnership.

Dissolution

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Partnership may be dissolved only with the unanimous consent of all Partners.

Distribution of Property on Dissolution of Partnership

In the event of the dissolution of the Partnership, each Partner will share equally (the "Dissolution Distribution") in any remaining assets or liabilities of the Partnership.

Upon Dissolution of the Partnership and liquidation of Partnership Property, and after payment of all selling costs and expenses, the liquidator will distribute the Partnership assets to the following groups according to the following order of priority:

in satisfaction of liabilities to creditors except Partnership obligations to current Partners;

in satisfaction of Partnership debt obligations to current Partners; and then

to the Partners according to the Dissolution Distribution described above.



The claims of each priority group will be satisfied in full before satisfying any claims of a lower priority group. Any excess of Partnership assets after liabilities or any insufficiency in Partnership assets in resolving liabilities under this section will be shared by the Partners according to the Dissolution Distribution described above.

Valuation of Interest

In the absence of a written agreement setting a value, the value of the Partnership will be based on the fair market value appraisal of all Partnership assets (less liabilities) determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This appraisal will be conducted by an independent accounting firm agreed to by all Partners. An appraiser will be appointed within a reasonable period of the date of withdrawal or dissolution. The results of the appraisal will be binding on all Partners. A withdrawing Partner's interest will be based on that Partner's proportion of the Dissolution Distribution described above, less any outstanding liabilities the withdrawing Partner may have to the Partnership. The intent of this section is to ensure the survival of the Partnership despite the withdrawal of any individual Partner.

No allowance will be made for goodwill, trade name, patents or other intangible assets, except where those assets have been reflected on the Partnership books immediately prior to valuation.

Goodwill

The goodwill of the Partnership business will be assessed at an amount to be determined by appraisal using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

Title to Partnership Property

Title to all Partnership Property will remain in the name of the Partnership. No Partner or group of Partners will have any ownership interest in such Partnership Property in whole or in part.

Voting

Any vote required by the Partnership will be assessed where each Partner receives one vote carrying equal weight.

Force Majeure

A Partner will be free of liability to the Partnership where the Partner is prevented from executing their obligations under this Agreement in whole or in part due to force majeure, such as earthquake, typhoon, flood, fire, and war or any other unforeseen and uncontrollable event where the Partner has communicated the circumstance of said event to any and all other Partners and taken any and all appropriate action to mitigate said event.

Duty of Loyalty

No Partner will engage in any business, venture or transaction, whether directly or indirectly, that might be competitive with the business of the Partnership or that would be in direct conflict of interest to the Partnership without the unanimous written consent of the remaining Partners. Any and all businesses, ventures or transactions with any appearance of conflict of interest must be fully disclosed to all other Partners. Failure to comply with any of the terms of this clause will be deemed an Involuntary Withdrawal of the offending Partner and may be treated accordingly by the remaining Partners.

Duty of Accountability for Private Profits

Each Partner must account to the Partnership for any benefit derived by that Partner without the consent of the other Partners from any transaction concerning the Partnership or any use by that Partner of the Partnership property, name or business connection. This duty continues to apply to any transactions undertaken after the Partnership has been dissolved but before the affairs of the Partnership have been completely wound up by the surviving Partner or Partners or their agent or agents.

Duty to Devote Time

Each Partner will devote such time and attention to the business of the Partnership as the majority of the Partners will from time to time reasonably determine for the conduct of the Partnership business.

Forbidden Acts

No Partner may do any act in contravention of this Agreement.

No Partner may permit, intentionally or unintentionally, the assignment of express, implied or apparent authority to a third party that is not a Partner in the Partnership.

No Partner may do any act that would make it impossible to carry on the ordinary business of the Partnership.

No Partner may confess a judgment against the Partnership.

No Partner will have the right or authority to bind or obligate the Partnership to any extent with regard to any matter outside the intended purpose of the Partnership.

Any violation of the above Forbidden Acts will be deemed an Involuntary Withdrawal of the offending Partner and may be treated accordingly by the remaining Partners.

Indemnification

All Partners will be indemnified and held harmless by the Partnership from and against any and all claims of any nature, whatsoever, arising out of a Partner's participation in Partnership affairs. A Partner will not be entitled to indemnification under this section for liability arising out of gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Partner or the breach by the Partner of any provisions of this Agreement.

Liability

A Partner will not be liable to the Partnership, or to any other Partner, for any mistake or error in judgment or for any act or omission done in good faith and believed to be within the scope of authority conferred or implied by this Agreement or the Partnership.

Liability Insurance

The Partnership may acquire insurance on behalf of any Partner, employee, agent or other person engaged in the business interest of the Partnership against any liability asserted against them or incurred by them while acting in good faith on behalf of the Partnership.

Life Insurance

The Partnership will have the right to acquire life insurance on the lives of any or all of the Partners, whenever it is deemed necessary by the Partnership. Each Partner will cooperate fully with the Partnership in obtaining any such policies of life insurance.

Amendments

This Agreement may not be amended in whole or in part without the unanimous written consent of all Partners.

The Partners submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of The State of Alabama for the enforcement of this Agreement or any arbitration award or decision arising from this Agreement.

What is a Partnership Agreement?
A partnership agreement is a contract between two or more business partners that is used to establish the responsibilities, and profit and loss distribution of each partner, as well as other rules about the general partnership.
Who needs a Partnership Agreement?
Any two or more people who run a for-profit business together, including family (spouses), friends or colleagues, should have a Partnership Agreement.
Types of Partnerships
General Partnership: A general partnership is a business structure involving two or more general partners who have formed a business for profit. Each partner is equally liable for the debts and obligations of the business, as well as the actions of the other partner(s).
Limited Partnership: A limited partnership includes at least one general partner who has unlimited liability in the company and a limited partner who is only liable for his or her portion of ownership.
Limited Liability Partnership: A limited liability partnership is a type of partnership in which each partner is only liable for his or her own actions.
What is included in a Partnership Agreement?
The partnership contract includes information about the business itself, business partners, profit and loss distribution, as well as management, voting methods, withdrawal and dissolution.
Capital Contribution
Each partner receives a percentage of ownership based on his or her capital contribution.
Profit and Loss Distribution
As agreed to by partners, profits and losses can be distributed by:

Fixed Percent: This number is a fixed percentage (e.g. 45, 55). The numbers must add up to 100% between all partners.
Equal Share: Profits and losses are distributed evenly between partners.

Management and Voting
Partnerships can be managed by a designated managing partner or through majority voting by all partners.
Voting can be carried out through three possible methods:

Proportional to Contributions: Voting powers reflect each partner's capital contribution.
Proportional to Profit Share: Voting powers are assigned according to profit distribution.
Equal Vote: Voting power is equal, and each partner is assigned one vote.

Partnership Withdrawal
If the partner contract permits withdrawal, a partner may make an amicable exit so long as he or she is adhering to the notice period, probation period, and other terms specified in the agreement.
There are two forms of partnership withdrawal:

Voluntary: A general partner decides to leave the business for personal reasons, such as retirement.
Non-voluntary: A partner exits from the partnership against his or her consent, such as through incarceration or death.

Partners may indicate how assets are distributed between partners in the event of dissolution.

$0.00 USD
						




All Partners will contribute their respective Capital Contributions fully and on time.

Withdrawal of Capital

No Partner will withdraw any portion of their Capital Contribution without the express written consent of the remaining Partners.

Additional Capital

Capital Contributions may be amended from time to time, according to the requirements of the Partnership provided that the interests of the Partners are not affected, except with the unanimous consent of the Partners. No Partner will be required to make Additional Capital Contributions. Whenever additional capital is determined to be required and an individual Partner is unwilling or unable to meet the additional contribution requirement within a reasonable period, as required by Partnership business obligations, remaining Partners may contribute in proportion to their existing Capital Contributions to resolve the amount in default. In such case the allocation of profits or losses among all the Partners will be adjusted to reflect the aggregate change in Capital Contributions by the Partners.

Any advance of money to the Partnership by any Partner in excess of the amounts provided for in this Agreement or subsequently agreed to as Additional Capital Contribution will be deemed a debt owed by the Partnership and not an increase in Capital Contribution of the Partner. This liability will be repaid with interest at rates and times to be determined by a majority of the Partners within the limits of what is required or permitted in the Act. This liability will not entitle the lending Partner to any increased share of the Partnership's profits nor to a greater voting power. Such debts may have preference or priority over any other payments to Partners as may be determined by a majority of the Partners.

Capital Accounts

An individual capital account (the "Capital Accounts") will be maintained for each Partner and their Initial Capital Contribution will be credited to this account. Any Additional Capital Contributions made by any Partner will be credited to that Partner's individual Capital Account.

Interest on Capital

No borrowing charge or loan interest will be due or payable to any Partner on their agreed Capital Contribution inclusive of any agreed Additional Capital Contributions.

Financial Decisions

Decisions regarding the distribution of profits, allocation of losses, and the requirement for Additional Capital Contributions as well as all other financial matters will be decided by a unanimous vote of the Partners.

Profit and Loss

Subject to any other provisions of this Agreement, the net profits and losses of the Partnership, for both accounting and tax purposes, will accrue to and be borne by the Partners in equal proportions (the "Profit and Loss Distribution").

Books of Account

Accurate and complete books of account of the transactions of the Partnership will be kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and at all reasonable times will be available and open to inspection and examination by any Partner. The books and records of the Partnership will reflect all the Partnership’s transactions and will be appropriate and adequate for the business conducted by the Partnership.

Annual Report

As soon as practicable after the close of each fiscal year, the Partnership will furnish to each Partner an annual report showing a full and complete account of the condition of the Partnership. This report will consist of at least the following documents:

a statement of all information as will be necessary for the preparation of each Partner's income or other tax returns;

a copy of the Partnership's federal income tax returns for that fiscal year; and

any additional information that the Partners may require.



Banking and Partnership Funds

The funds of the Partnership will be placed in such investments and banking accounts as will be designated by the Partners.  Partnership funds will be held in the name of the Partnership and will not be commingled with those of any other person or entity.

Fiscal Year

The fiscal year will end on the ______ day of ________________ of each year.

Audit

Any of the Partners will have the right to request an audit of the Partnership books. The cost of the audit will be borne by the Partnership. The audit will be performed by an accounting firm acceptable to all the Partners. Not more than one (1) audit will be required by any or all of the Partners for any fiscal year.

Management

Except as all of the Partners may otherwise agree in writing, all actions and decisions respecting the management, operation and control of the Partnership and its business will be decided by a unanimous vote of the Partners.

Contract Binding Authority

Each Partner will have authority to bind the Partnership in contract.

Tax Matters Partner

The tax matters partner will be ____________________________ (the "Tax Matters Partner"). The Tax Matters Partner will prepare, or cause to be prepared, all tax returns and reports for the Partnership and make any related elections that the Partners deem advisable.

A Tax Matters Partner can voluntarily withdraw from the position of Tax Matters Partner or can be appointed or replaced by a majority vote of the other Partners. In the event of a withdrawal of the Tax Matters Partner from the Partnership, the remaining Partners will appoint a successor as soon as practicable.

Meetings

Regular meetings of the Partners will be held as required.

Any Partner can call a special meeting to resolve issues that require a vote, as indicated by this Agreement, by providing all Partners with reasonable notice. In the case of a special vote, the meeting will be restricted to the specific purpose for which the meeting was held.

All meetings will be held at a time and in a location that is reasonable, convenient and practical considering the situation of all Partners.

Admitting a New Partner

A new Partner may only be admitted to the Partnership with a majority vote of the existing Partners.

Any new Partner agrees to be bound by all the covenants, terms, and conditions of this Agreement, inclusive of all current and future amendments. Further, a new Partner will execute such documents as are needed to effect the admission of the new Partner. Any new Partner will receive such business interest in the Partnership as determined by a unanimous decision of the other Partners.

Voluntary Withdrawal of a Partner

Any Partner will have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the Partnership at any time. Written notice of intention to withdraw must be served upon the remaining Partners at least three (3) months prior to the withdrawal date.

The voluntary withdrawal of a Partner will result in the dissolution of the Partnership.

A Dissociated Partner will only exercise the right to withdraw in good faith and will act to minimize any present or future harm done to the remaining Partners as a result of the withdrawal.

Involuntary Withdrawal of a Partner

Events resulting in the involuntary withdrawal of a Partner from the Partnership will include but not be limited to: death of a Partner; Partner mental incapacity; Partner disability preventing reasonable participation in the Partnership; Partner incompetence; breach of fiduciary duties by a Partner; criminal conviction of a Partner; Expulsion of a Partner; Operation of Law against a Partner; or any act or omission of a Partner that can reasonably be expected to bring the business or societal reputation of the Partnership into disrepute.

The involuntary withdrawal of a Partner will result in the dissolution of the Partnership.

A trustee in bankruptcy or similar third party who may acquire that Dissociated Partner's interest in the Partnership will only acquire that Partner's economic rights and interests and will not acquire any other rights of that Partner or be admitted as a Partner of the Partnership or have the right to exercise any management or voting interests.

Dissociation of a Partner

Where the dissociation of a Partner for any reason results in the dissolution of the Partnership then the Partnership will proceed in a reasonable and timely manner to dissolve the Partnership, with all debts being paid first, prior to any distribution of the remaining funds. Valuation and distribution will be determined as described in the Valuation of Interest section of this Agreement.

The remaining Partners retain the right to seek damages from a Dissociated Partner where the dissociation resulted from a malicious or criminal act by the Dissociated Partner or where the Dissociated Partner had breached their fiduciary duty to the Partnership or was in breach of this Agreement or had acted in a way that could reasonably be foreseen to bring harm or damage to the Partnership or to the reputation of the Partnership.

Dissolution

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Partnership may be dissolved only with the unanimous consent of all Partners.

Distribution of Property on Dissolution of Partnership

In the event of the dissolution of the Partnership, each Partner will share equally (the "Dissolution Distribution") in any remaining assets or liabilities of the Partnership.

Upon Dissolution of the Partnership and liquidation of Partnership Property, and after payment of all selling costs and expenses, the liquidator will distribute the Partnership assets to the following groups according to the following order of priority:

in satisfaction of liabilities to creditors except Partnership obligations to current Partners;

in satisfaction of Partnership debt obligations to current Partners; and then

to the Partners according to the Dissolution Distribution described above.



The claims of each priority group will be satisfied in full before satisfying any claims of a lower priority group. Any excess of Partnership assets after liabilities or any insufficiency in Partnership assets in resolving liabilities under this section will be shared by the Partners according to the Dissolution Distribution described above.

Valuation of Interest

In the absence of a written agreement setting a value, the value of the Partnership will be based on the fair market value appraisal of all Partnership assets (less liabilities) determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This appraisal will be conducted by an independent accounting firm agreed to by all Partners. An appraiser will be appointed within a reasonable period of the date of withdrawal or dissolution. The results of the appraisal will be binding on all Partners. A withdrawing Partner's interest will be based on that Partner's proportion of the Dissolution Distribution described above, less any outstanding liabilities the withdrawing Partner may have to the Partnership. The intent of this section is to ensure the survival of the Partnership despite the withdrawal of any individual Partner.

No allowance will be made for goodwill, trade name, patents or other intangible assets, except where those assets have been reflected on the Partnership books immediately prior to valuation.

Goodwill

The goodwill of the Partnership business will be assessed at an amount to be determined by appraisal using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

Title to Partnership Property

Title to all Partnership Property will remain in the name of the Partnership. No Partner or group of Partners will have any ownership interest in such Partnership Property in whole or in part.

Voting

Any vote required by the Partnership will be assessed where each Partner receives one vote carrying equal weight.

Force Majeure

A Partner will be free of liability to the Partnership where the Partner is prevented from executing their obligations under this Agreement in whole or in part due to force majeure, such as earthquake, typhoon, flood, fire, and war or any other unforeseen and uncontrollable event where the Partner has communicated the circumstance of said event to any and all other Partners and taken any and all appropriate action to mitigate said event.

Duty of Loyalty

No Partner will engage in any business, venture or transaction, whether directly or indirectly, that might be competitive with the business of the Partnership or that would be in direct conflict of interest to the Partnership without the unanimous written consent of the remaining Partners. Any and all businesses, ventures or transactions with any appearance of conflict of interest must be fully disclosed to all other Partners. Failure to comply with any of the terms of this clause will be deemed an Involuntary Withdrawal of the offending Partner and may be treated accordingly by the remaining Partners.

General Partnership Agreement
Partnership Contract
Articles of Partnership
Business Partnership Agreement

What is a Partnership Agreement?
A partnership agreement is a contract between two or more business partners that is used to establish the responsibilities, and profit and loss distribution of each partner, as well as other rules about the general partnership.
Who needs a Partnership Agreement?
Any two or more people who run a for-profit business together, including family (spouses), friends or colleagues, should have a Partnership Agreement.
Types of Partnerships
General Partnership: A general partnership is a business structure involving two or more general partners who have formed a business for profit. Each partner is equally liable for the debts and obligations of the business, as well as the actions of the other partner(s).
Limited Partnership: A limited partnership includes at least one general partner who has unlimited liability in the company and a limited partner who is only liable for his or her portion of ownership.
Limited Liability Partnership: A limited liability partnership is a type of partnership in which each partner is only liable for his or her own actions.
What is included in a Partnership Agreement?
The partnership contract includes information about the business itself, business partners, profit and loss distribution, as well as management, voting methods, withdrawal and dissolution.
Capital Contribution
Each partner receives a percentage of ownership based on his or her capital contribution.
Profit and Loss Distribution
As agreed to by partners, profits and losses can be distributed by:

Fixed Percent: This number is a fixed percentage (e.g. 45, 55). The numbers must add up to 100% between all partners.
Equal Share: Profits and losses are distributed evenly between partners.

Management and Voting
Partnerships can be managed by a designated managing partner or through majority voting by all partners.
Voting can be carried out through three possible methods:

Proportional to Contributions: Voting powers reflect each partner's capital contribution.
Proportional to Profit Share: Voting powers are assigned according to profit distribution.
Equal Vote: Voting power is equal, and each partner is assigned one vote.

Partnership Withdrawal
If the partner contract permits withdrawal, a partner may make an amicable exit so long as he or she is adhering to the notice period, probation period, and other terms specified in the agreement.
There are two forms of partnership withdrawal:

Voluntary: A general partner decides to leave the business for personal reasons, such as retirement.
Non-voluntary: A partner exits from the partnership against his or her consent, such as through incarceration or death.

Partnership Dissolution
Partners may indicate how assets are distributed between partners in the event of dissolution.
Potential ways a partnership may be dissolved:

All partners agree on a specified end date
All projects have been completed or the purpose of the partnership has been fulfilled
Upon death of a partner
Bankruptcy of a partner or the partnership
A partner withdraws

Related Documents:

Notice of Withdrawal from Partnership: A notice used to inform partners of the intended withdrawal of a partner from a business partnership. 
Assignment of Partnership Interest: Used to transfer partnership interest from one partner to another.

Joint Venture Agreement: A document used to spell out the details in which two parties unite resources for a common goal or project.

THIS PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") made and entered into this 27th day of July, 2017 (the "Execution Date"),BETWEEN:

 ____________________________ of _________________________, _______________, __________, __________, and ____________________________ of _________________________, _______________, __________, __________(individually the "Partner" and collectively the "Partners").

The Partners wish to associate themselves as partners in business.

This Agreement sets out the terms and conditions that govern the Partners within the Partnership.


IN CONSIDERATION OF and as a condition of the Partners entering into this Agreement and other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which consideration is acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:
	

Formation

By this Agreement the Partners enter into a general partnership (the "Partnership") in accordance with the laws of The State of Alabama. The rights and obligations of the Partners will be as as stated in the applicable legislation of The State of Alabama (the 'Act') except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.

Contribution Description



Agreed Value




 
					
 
					

$0.00 USD
						



 
					
 
					

$0.00 USD
						




All Partners will contribute their respective Capital Contributions fully and on time.

Withdrawal of Capital

No Partner will withdraw any portion of their Capital Contribution without the express written consent of the remaining Partners.

Additional Capital

Capital Contributions may be amended from time to time, according to the requirements of the Partnership provided that the interests of the Partners are not affected, except with the unanimous consent of the Partners. No Partner will be required to make Additional Capital Contributions. Whenever additional capital is determined to be required and an individual Partner is unwilling or unable to meet the additional contribution requirement within a reasonable period, as required by Partnership business obligations, remaining Partners may contribute in proportion to their existing Capital Contributions to resolve the amount in default. In such case the allocation of profits or losses among all the Partners will be adjusted to reflect the aggregate change in Capital Contributions by the Partners.

Any advance of money to the Partnership by any Partner in excess of the amounts provided for in this Agreement or subsequently agreed to as Additional Capital Contribution will be deemed a debt owed by the Partnership and not an increase in Capital Contribution of the Partner. This liability will be repaid with interest at rates and times to be determined by a majority of the Partners within the limits of what is required or permitted in the Act. This liability will not entitle the lending Partner to any increased share of the Partnership's profits nor to a greater voting power. Such debts may have preference or priority over any other payments to Partners as may be determined by a majority of the Partners.

Capital Accounts

An individual capital account (the "Capital Accounts") will be maintained for each Partner and their Initial Capital Contribution will be credited to this account. Any Additional Capital Contributions made by any Partner will be credited to that Partner's individual Capital Account.

Interest on Capital

No borrowing charge or loan interest will be due or payable to any Partner on their agreed Capital Contribution inclusive of any agreed Additional Capital Contributions.

Financial Decisions

Decisions regarding the distribution of profits, allocation of losses, and the requirement for Additional Capital Contributions as well as all other financial matters will be decided by a unanimous vote of the Partners.

Profit and Loss

Subject to any other provisions of this Agreement, the net profits and losses of the Partnership, for both accounting and tax purposes, will accrue to and be borne by the Partners in equal proportions (the "Profit and Loss Distribution").

Books of Account

Accurate and complete books of account of the transactions of the Partnership will be kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and at all reasonable times will be available and open to inspection and examination by any Partner. The books and records of the Partnership will reflect all the Partnership’s transactions and will be appropriate and adequate for the business conducted by the Partnership.

Annual Report

As soon as practicable after the close of each fiscal year, the Partnership will furnish to each Partner an annual report showing a full and complete account of the condition of the Partnership. This report will consist of at least the following documents:

a statement of all information as will be necessary for the preparation of each Partner's income or other tax returns;

a copy of the Partnership's federal income tax returns for that fiscal year; and

any additional information that the Partners may require.



Banking and Partnership Funds

The funds of the Partnership will be placed in such investments and banking accounts as will be designated by the Partners.  Partnership funds will be held in the name of the Partnership and will not be commingled with those of any other person or entity.

Fiscal Year

The fiscal year will end on the ______ day of ________________ of each year.

Audit

Any of the Partners will have the right to request an audit of the Partnership books. The cost of the audit will be borne by the Partnership. The audit will be performed by an accounting firm acceptable to all the Partners. Not more than one (1) audit will be required by any or all of the Partners for any fiscal year.

Management

Except as all of the Partners may otherwise agree in writing, all actions and decisions respecting the management, operation and control of the Partnership and its business will be decided by a unanimous vote of the Partners.

Contract Binding Authority

Each Partner will have authority to bind the Partnership in contract.

Tax Matters Partner

The tax matters partner will be ____________________________ (the "Tax Matters Partner"). The Tax Matters Partner will prepare, or cause to be prepared, all tax returns and reports for the Partnership and make any related elections that the Partners deem advisable.

A Tax Matters Partner can voluntarily withdraw from the position of Tax Matters Partner or can be appointed or replaced by a majority vote of the other Partners. In the event of a withdrawal of the Tax Matters Partner from the Partnership, the remaining Partners will appoint a successor as soon as practicable.

Meetings

Regular meetings of the Partners will be held as required.

Any Partner can call a special meeting to resolve issues that require a vote, as indicated by this Agreement, by providing all Partners with reasonable notice. In the case of a special vote, the meeting will be restricted to the specific purpose for which the meeting was held.

All meetings will be held at a time and in a location that is reasonable, convenient and practical considering the situation of all Partners.

Admitting a New Partner

A new Partner may only be admitted to the Partnership with a majority vote of the existing Partners.

Any new Partner agrees to be bound by all the covenants, terms, and conditions of this Agreement, inclusive of all current and future amendments. Further, a new Partner will execute such documents as are needed to effect the admission of the new Partner. Any new Partner will receive such business interest in the Partnership as determined by a unanimous decision of the other Partners.

Voluntary Withdrawal of a Partner

Any Partner will have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the Partnership at any time. Written notice of intention to withdraw must be served upon the remaining Partners at least three (3) months prior to the withdrawal date.

The voluntary withdrawal of a Partner will result in the dissolution of the Partnership.

A Dissociated Partner will only exercise the right to withdraw in good faith and will act to minimize any present or future harm done to the remaining Partners as a result of the withdrawal.

Involuntary Withdrawal of a Partner

Events resulting in the involuntary withdrawal of a Partner from the Partnership will include but not be limited to: death of a Partner; Partner mental incapacity; Partner disability preventing reasonable participation in the Partnership; Partner incompetence; breach of fiduciary duties by a Partner; criminal conviction of a Partner; Expulsion of a Partner; Operation of Law against a Partner; or any act or omission of a Partner that can reasonably be expected to bring the business or societal reputation of the Partnership into disrepute.

The involuntary withdrawal of a Partner will result in the dissolution of the Partnership.

A trustee in bankruptcy or similar third party who may acquire that Dissociated Partner's interest in the Partnership will only acquire that Partner's economic rights and interests and will not acquire any other rights of that Partner or be admitted as a Partner of the Partnership or have the right to exercise any management or voting interests.

Dissociation of a Partner

Where the dissociation of a Partner for any reason results in the dissolution of the Partnership then the Partnership will proceed in a reasonable and timely manner to dissolve the Partnership, with all debts being paid first, prior to any distribution of the remaining funds. Valuation and distribution will be determined as described in the Valuation of Interest section of this Agreement.

The remaining Partners retain the right to seek damages from a Dissociated Partner where the dissociation resulted from a malicious or criminal act by the Dissociated Partner or where the Dissociated Partner had breached their fiduciary duty to the Partnership or was in breach of this Agreement or had acted in a way that could reasonably be foreseen to bring harm or damage to the Partnership or to the reputation of the Partnership.

Dissolution

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Partnership may be dissolved only with the unanimous consent of all Partners.

Distribution of Property on Dissolution of Partnership

In the event of the dissolution of the Partnership, each Partner will share equally (the "Dissolution Distribution") in any remaining assets or liabilities of the Partnership.

Upon Dissolution of the Partnership and liquidation of Partnership Property, and after payment of all selling costs and expenses, the liquidator will distribute the Partnership assets to the following groups according to the following order of priority:

in satisfaction of liabilities to creditors except Partnership obligations to current Partners;

in satisfaction of Partnership debt obligations to current Partners; and then

to the Partners according to the Dissolution Distribution described above.



The claims of each priority group will be satisfied in full before satisfying any claims of a lower priority group. Any excess of Partnership assets after liabilities or any insufficiency in Partnership assets in resolving liabilities under this section will be shared by the Partners according to the Dissolution Distribution described above.

Valuation of Interest

In the absence of a written agreement setting a value, the value of the Partnership will be based on the fair market value appraisal of all Partnership assets (less liabilities) determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This appraisal will be conducted by an independent accounting firm agreed to by all Partners. An appraiser will be appointed within a reasonable period of the date of withdrawal or dissolution. The results of the appraisal will be binding on all Partners. A withdrawing Partner's interest will be based on that Partner's proportion of the Dissolution Distribution described above, less any outstanding liabilities the withdrawing Partner may have to the Partnership. The intent of this section is to ensure the survival of the Partnership despite the withdrawal of any individual Partner.

No allowance will be made for goodwill, trade name, patents or other intangible assets, except where those assets have been reflected on the Partnership books immediately prior to valuation.

Goodwill

The goodwill of the Partnership business will be assessed at an amount to be determined by appraisal using generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

Title to Partnership Property

Title to all Partnership Property will remain in the name of the Partnership. No Partner or group of Partners will have any ownership interest in such Partnership Property in whole or in part.

Voting

Any vote required by the Partnership will be assessed where each Partner receives one vote carrying equal weight.

Force Majeure

A Partner will be free of liability to the Partnership where the Partner is prevented from executing their obligations under this Agreement in whole or in part due to force majeure, such as earthquake, typhoon, flood, fire, and war or any other unforeseen and uncontrollable event where the Partner has communicated the circumstance of said event to any and all other Partners and taken any and all appropriate action to mitigate said event.

Duty of Loyalty

No Partner will engage in any business, venture or transaction, whether directly or indirectly, that might be competitive with the business of the Partnership or that would be in direct conflict of interest to the Partnership without the unanimous written consent of the remaining Partners. Any and all businesses, ventures or transactions with any appearance of conflict of interest must be fully disclosed to all other Partners. Failure to comply with any of the terms of this clause will be deemed an Involuntary Withdrawal of the offending Partner and may be treated accordingly by the remaining Partners.

Duty of Accountability for Private Profits

Each Partner must account to the Partnership for any benefit derived by that Partner without the consent of the other Partners from any transaction concerning the Partnership or any use by that Partner of the Partnership property, name or business connection. This duty continues to apply to any transactions undertaken after the Partnership has been dissolved but before the affairs of the Partnership have been completely wound up by the surviving Partner or Partners or their agent or agents.

Duty to Devote Time

Each Partner will devote such time and attention to the business of the Partnership as the majority of the Partners will from time to time reasonably determine for the conduct of the Partnership business.

Forbidden Acts

No Partner may do any act in contravention of this Agreement.

No Partner may permit, intentionally or unintentionally, the assignment of express, implied or apparent authority to a third party that is not a Partner in the Partnership.

No Partner may do any act that would make it impossible to carry on the ordinary business of the Partnership.

No Partner may confess a judgment against the Partnership.

No Partner will have the right or authority to bind or obligate the Partnership to any extent with regard to any matter outside the intended purpose of the Partnership.

Any violation of the above Forbidden Acts will be deemed an Involuntary Withdrawal of the offending Partner and may be treated accordingly by the remaining Partners.

Indemnification

All Partners will be indemnified and held harmless by the Partnership from and against any and all claims of any nature, whatsoever, arising out of a Partner's participation in Partnership affairs. A Partner will not be entitled to indemnification under this section for liability arising out of gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Partner or the breach by the Partner of any provisions of this Agreement.

Liability

A Partner will not be liable to the Partnership, or to any other Partner, for any mistake or error in judgment or for any act or omission done in good faith and believed to be within the scope of authority conferred or implied by this Agreement or the Partnership.

Liability Insurance

The Partnership may acquire insurance on behalf of any Partner, employee, agent or other person engaged in the business interest of the Partnership against any liability asserted against them or incurred by them while acting in good faith on behalf of the Partnership.

Life Insurance

The Partnership will have the right to acquire life insurance on the lives of any or all of the Partners, whenever it is deemed necessary by the Partnership. Each Partner will cooperate fully with the Partnership in obtaining any such policies of life insurance.

Partnership Agreement
Alternate Names:
A Partnership Agreement is also known as:

General Partnership Agreement
Partnership Contract
Articles of Partnership
Business Partnership Agreement

What is a Partnership Agreement?
A partnership agreement is a contract between two or more business partners that is used to establish the responsibilities, and profit and loss distribution of each partner, as well as other rules about the general partnership.
Who needs a Partnership Agreement?
Any two or more people who run a for-profit business together, including family (spouses), friends or colleagues, should have a Partnership Agreement.
Types of Partnerships
General Partnership: A general partnership is a business structure involving two or more general partners who have formed a business for profit. Each partner is equally liable for the debts and obligations of the business, as well as the actions of the other partner(s).
Limited Partnership: A limited partnership includes at least one general partner who has unlimited liability in the company and a limited partner who is only liable for his or her portion of ownership.
Limited Liability Partnership: A limited liability partnership is a type of partnership in which each partner is only liable for his or her own actions.
What is included in a Partnership Agreement?
The partnership contract includes information about the business itself, business partners, profit and loss distribution, as well as management, voting methods, withdrawal and dissolution.
Capital Contribution
Each partner receives a percentage of ownership based on his or her capital contribution.
Profit and Loss Distribution
As agreed to by partners, profits and losses can be distributed by:

Fixed Percent: This number is a fixed percentage (e.g. 45, 55). The numbers must add up to 100% between all partners.
Equal Share: Profits and losses are distributed evenly between partners.

Management and Voting
Partnerships can be managed by a designated managing partner or through majority voting by all partners.
Voting can be carried out through three possible methods:

Proportional to Contributions: Voting powers reflect each partner's capital contribution.
Proportional to Profit Share: Voting powers are assigned according to profit distribution.
Equal Vote: Voting power is equal, and each partner is assigned one vote.

Partnership Withdrawal
If the partner contract permits withdrawal, a partner may make an amicable exit so long as he or she is adhering to the notice period, probation period, and other terms specified in the agreement.
There are two forms of partnership withdrawal:

Voluntary: A general partner decides to leave the business for personal reasons, such as retirement.
Non-voluntary: A partner exits from the partnership against his or her consent, such as through incarceration or death.

Partnership Dissolution
Partners may indicate how assets are distributed between partners in the event of dissolution.
Potential ways a partnership may be dissolved:

All partners agree on a specified end date
All projects have been completed or the purpose of the partnership has been fulfilled
Upon death of a partner
Bankruptcy of a partner or the partnership
A partner withdraws
