About Us




Introduction


Our Vision
	Cobalt’s vision is to become one of the world’s most admired exploration and production companies by keeping commitments, adhering to our values, achieving results as promised, and consistently delivering top quartile rates of return. Our business model allows us to move quickly and seamlessly through the exploration, appraisal, development and production processes.

Our History
	Cobalt’s pioneering approach to oil exploration was built on the unique idea that an agile company, armed with exceptional human talent, the best available seismic data, outstanding assets and a disciplined business model, can compete with the world’s largest energy companies. Through our experienced workforce, innovative technology and pioneering siting techniques, the company has built a carefully selected, world-class oil portfolio in the deepwater regions of the Gulf of Mexico and offshore West Africa.

Our Future
	As we transition from an oil exploration company to exploration and development, we continue our endeavor to be a successful, enduring enterprise that will generate wealth for our investors and provide an outstanding professional experience for our team members. Our track record of exploration excellence continues with twelve deepwater discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. These achievements, combined with a disciplined plan for future oil production, position the company exceptionally well for long-term value creation.

At Cobalt, we are discovering opportunity and producing value.



Our People




	The Cobalt team  consists of highly experienced geoscientists, engineers, business professionals and technicians, led by a management team with a proven record of success.

	Our highly-skilled professionals have an average of more than 25 years of oil exploration, development and production experience. Members of our management team have negotiated globally significant commercial agreements and developed many long-standing relationships with independent, major and national oil companies, host governments and service providers.

	Cobalt’s staff and management are motivated by a shared vision and clear business model, enabling them to do what they do best: find, develop and produce oil. Our people combine the best data and technology with the expertise and collective insight necessary to locate the next best opportunities, and reduce cycle times at every phase of the exploration, appraisal, development and production process.

	Cobalt’s management team has a proven, differentiated track record of successfully participating in our industry’s largest global projects over the past two decades. We have played key roles in major offshore discoveries, and have been instrumental in bringing these large-scale global hydrocarbon projects through development to production.

	We have negotiated globally significant and challenging commercial agreements, and we have developed many long-standing relationships with independent oil companies, host governments, national oil companies and service providers – all of which enhances Cobalt’s competitiveness and our ability to deliver.

Houston-based independent Cobalt International Energy LP and Total E&P USA Inc. on Monday agreed to combine their Gulf of Mexico (GOM) lease holdings in a long-term strategic alliance.
Under the terms of the agreements, subject to approval of the Mineral Management Service (MMS), the GOM exploration portfolios of both companies will be merged. Cobalt has 122 offshore leases and Total has 80 leases, which will be added to 12 exploration leases they already jointly own. Generally the agreements stipulate that Cobalt will be 60% owner; Total, based in Paris, will hold a 40% stake. The agreements are expected to provide both companies with access to large areas of contiguous acreage, mainly sub-salt, similar to major discoveries in the Lower Tertiary area of the deepwater GOM.
The companies also agreed to a joint participation area for any future opportunities between the parties in the GOM. Cobalt was designated as the partnership's operator. No financial details were released.
"We will execute our program utilizing state-of-the-art technology to realize the full potential and value of our combined Gulf of Mexico assets," said Cobalt CEO Joseph H. Bryant. "The combined portfolio contains numerous prospects with significant working interests positioned in key play fairways."
The alliance would bring together Cobalt's "proven expertise in the Gulf of Mexico, along with Total's worldwide experience in deep offshore exploration and development," Total said. A multi-well program on the combined portfolio is expected to launch this summer using a Total-supplied drilling rig. Cobalt would operate the exploration phase in the joint program and Total would provide the rig and some personnel.
"Both companies have complementary competencies to successfully explore and develop their combined portfolio," said Total's Yves-Louis Darricarrere, president of exploration and production.
Cobalt has been in operation less than four years. It was formed in late 2005 by former Unocal Corp. and BP plc executives, and initially launched with $500 million in private equity from Carlyle/Riverstone and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners (see Daily GPI, Dec. 2, 2005). Additional financial backers now include First Reserve Corp. and Calgary-based KERN Energy Partners.
In October 2007 Cobalt ranked third behind only Shell Offshore Inc. and BP Exploration & Production Co. Inc. with 83 high bids on offshore leases offered by MMS (see Daily GPI, Oct. 9, 2007). In that lease sale, Cobalt obtained 53 deepwater leaseholds. In last month's MMS Central GOM Lease Sale 208, Cobalt, with Eni Petroleum US LLC and Samson Offshore Co., was high bidder at $22 million for Walker Ridge Block 133 in the deepwater Lower Tertiary Trend (see Daily GPI, March 19).
Total's U.S. E&P program has been ongoing since 1957. In the deepwater GOM, Total now is participating in two major development projects. The producer holds a 17% equity stake in Chevron Corp.'s Tahiti project, which is scheduled to ramp up in the next few months (see Daily GPI, March 11). In addition, Total owns a one-third stake in the Chinook deepwater project, which is scheduled for start-up in 2010 (see Daily GPI, Sept. 6, 2006). Total also operates two producing deep shelf fields, Matterhorn and Virgo (see Daily GPI, Feb. 5, 2007; Oct. 24, 2005).
Total, which is the fourth largest publicly traded oil and gas company in the world, also has operations onshore in the United States. It acquired a 30% working interest from Chevron in several onshore exploration blocks in the White Hills area of Alaska, and an exploration program is under way. Total also holds a portfolio of exploration blocks in the Beaufort Sea offshore Alaska. In addition, it acquired a half stake in IDT Corp.'s American Shale Oil LCC (AMSO) subsidiary, which is developing a research and demonstration program to produce and commercialize oil shales on AMSO's federal leasehold in western Colorado.

Map of Anchor, from Chevron.





	Houston’s Cobalt International Energy has entered into a definitive agreement with its co-owners in the Anchor development to unitize and include Cobalt’s two leases immediately south of the current Anchor unit (Green Canyon blocks 850 and 851) into the existing Anchor unit.

	The transfer of interests in the two leases and the revised Anchor unit are subject to customary regulatory approval. Following such approval, Cobalt will retain a 20% working interest in the revised Anchor Unit.

	The original Anchor discovery well is in Green Canyon Block 807, some 140mi (225km) off the coast of Louisiana in 5180ft (1579m) water depth.

	“Expansion of the Anchor unit to include Cobalt’s two blocks to the south is key to optimizing the development plan and increasing oil recovery from Anchor as the reservoir clearly extends onto these blocks,” says Timothy J. Cutt, Cobalt CEO. “This agreement makes Anchor even more attractive of a development going forward, whether for us or for a potential purchaser in our ongoing sales efforts.”

	In March, operator Chevron hit oil at the Anchor-4 appraisal well, encountering about 800ft of net oil pay in multiple inboard Lower Tertiary reservoirs.

	Chevron subsidiary Chevron USA Inc. is the operator of the Anchor prospect with 55% interest. Its partners include Cobalt International Energy (20%), Samson Offshore Anchor (12.5%), and Venari Resources (12.5%).

What is a “core” or a “core charge"?
A core is a term used in the automotive industry for the old defective engine in your vehicle. A core charge is a deposit left with us to ensure the core engine is returned. We pay the return shipping on the core engine. All core charges are refunded as soon as the old defective engine arrives at our location. This normally takes 2 – 3 business days.
90 Day Replacement Warranty

All other parts that may be provided are “Accessories and Extra Parts.” No warranty is provided for any such parts that are attached, including parts such as switches, sensors, cables, injectors, electronics, belts (including timing belt/chain), hoses, water pumps, manifolds and oil pans. Heat tabs are installed on engine if melted or missing Warrantee will be voided.
Installation Check List: (Failure to complete the following will void Warranty)
