MediXall Group, Inc. Announces that its Program to Recruit Healthcare Providers to Its Network is Approaching 1,500 Registrations

FT LAUDERDALE, FL--(Marketwired - Jul 6, 2017) -  MediXall Group Inc., (OTCQB: MDXL), a technology and innovation-driven organization structured to bring effective change to the U.S. healthcare industry is pleased to announce that through its program to recruit and enlist licensed and certified Diagnostic Centers, medical service, medical product providers and Physician Practices to its Member Network, over 1,000 healthcare providers have opted-in. By opting in, these healthcare providers have taken the first step into joining MediXaid and becoming an "Early Adopter" in the revolutionary MediXaid Provider Network. 
MediXall is completing development of a new generation healthcare marketplace platform to address the growing need of self-pay and high deductible consumers for greater transparency and price competition in their healthcare costs. The MediXaid platform provides a B2C capability that brings together into a single cloud-based, patent-pending virtual marketplace the consumers of healthcare products and services with providers that compete on price, location and schedule for requested products and services. 
The MediXaid platform will afford providers the opportunity to reach a higher percentage of self-pay and high-deductible consumers greatly benefiting the providers' practice and assuring higher cash flow through immediate payment for services. Consumers benefit by having greater access to more affordable qualified services in their immediate area with greater transparency in the pricing among providers.
The increasing number of healthcare providers opting in indicates that there is a growing number of healthcare services and product providers in South Florida recognizing the changing landscape of healthcare and the need for positive change. This is yet another major step in the validation of the MediXall business model and will be instrumental in the process of bringing real transparency and free market competition to healthcare. MediXall Group Chairman, Noel J. Guillama, stated, "When I envisioned the MediXaid platform I believed that healthcare would soon be moving toward the need to providing greater access, transparency and competition for the consumer and to ensuring a broader reach into a greater segment of the community for healthcare providers. Clearly, this vision has proven accurate and now even the federal government is calling for exactly what we are providing through the MediXaid platform and MediXall Group, Inc. The positive response we are seeing from the Providers we are contacting is exciting and serves to underscore that both the consumer and provider are seeing the need for a platform like MediXaid."

LAUDERDALE, FL--(Marketwired - Mar 14, 2017) - MediXall Group Inc. ("MediXall") (  OTCQB :  MDXL ), a technology and innovation-driven organization structured to bring effective change to the U.S. healthcare industry, announced this morning that it has completed the next step in the planned expansion of the MediXall business model. The Company has signed a Strategic Partnership Agreement with Quantum Innovations, Inc. to promote its flagship Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR) and Practice Management (PM) PWeR® platform to the MediXall Member Network.Neil Swartz, President & CEO of MediXall, commented, "Currently, medical care providers are facing material challenges that go well beyond attracting new patients; a league of issues being driven by consumers, payers and state and federal government. As part of our MediXall business model, we are selecting revolutionary products and services that will help MediXall Members increase their net margins and keep more of their revenue, as well as assist in reducing their business operations burden. Today we are introducing what we believe is a product that can help medical care providers not only meet government mandates, but also sets a new standard for the provider/patient relationship through a revolutionary patient portal that facilitates faster and more convenient physician-patient interaction."PWeR stands for Personal Wellness electronic Record®. This 21st century healthcare technology solution is a new breed, state-of-the-art "2016 Certified Ambulatory Complete EHR" that is focused on enhancing the interaction of provider-as-a-member-of-the-patient's-care-team. Medical and health records will follow the patient, giving every healthcare provider that sees that patient access to all the information needed to assist in their diagnosis and treatment plan. Providers will be able to access a patient's entire medical record in one virtual place, through our trademarked "One Patient...Total Connectivity®" concept. In critical situations, or routine consultations and treatments, on the PWeR platform, hospitals will be enabled to access full medical histories and make even more educated medical decisions based on complete and accurate data. Designed for healthcare providers, PWeR also supports the reporting and care management for providers in ACOs, MSNs, and PSNs.Noel J. Guillama, Chairman of MediXall Group, Inc., said, "Medical care providers in every segment of healthcare are overwhelmed with government regulations and changes in payment and fee structures. These changes include Meaningful Use (MU-2) standards, Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) a quality reporting program that started this January (2017) as part of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) and affects all physicians and healthcare professionals on The Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS). Regulations have burdened doctors with more work and fewer resources. MediXall's mission is to implement powerful tools to lighten that burden, and we believe that PWeR will offer material assistance to providers in a number of ways. We think the EHR should be easier to use and give doctors more information and easier access, while maintaining their connection to their patients."The Company announced that the agreement allows MediXall to offer PWeR, the beneficiary of many U.S. patents and proprietary technology, to its Members under a preferred pricing structure, including facilitating patient access via the built-in patient portal. "This is a first step toward a suite of services and products that will be available to our Members going forward," commented Mr. Neil Swartz.About MediXall Group, Inc.

We believe we have developed a strong marketing and sales program that will both facilitate the rapid development of a strong healthcare provider network here in South Florida and further serve as a foundation for expanding our reach throughout the State and nationwide. I am pleased by the success we are seeing in the innovative marketing and sales program we have designed and launched. Based upon our recruitment rate to date, I am confident that we can build our "Early Adopter" Provider Network more quickly than we had forecast, allowing deeper market penetration then we had predicted as well as the opportunity to extend our reach beyond South Florida sooner. The success in building our Provider Network in MediXaid® will also quickly translate to MediXall for other services we are preparing to rollout to our Provider Network, at or before launch of the MediXaid® Platform, including patient and provider loan services, and the PWeR Electronic Health Record Platform."The MediXaid® Electronic Marketplace Platform will allow the public to shop for their own medical services, diagnostic procedures, medical products and devices.

MediXall Group, Inc. Announces that its Program to Recruit Healthcare Providers to Its Network is Approaching 1,500 Registrations


/EINPresswire.com/ -- FT LAUDERDALE, FL--(Marketwired - Jul 6, 2017) -  MediXall Group Inc., (OTCQB: MDXL), a technology and innovation-driven organization structured to bring effective change to the U.S. healthcare industry is pleased to announce that through its program to recruit and enlist licensed and certified Diagnostic Centers, medical service, medical product providers and Physician Practices to its Member Network, over 1,000 healthcare providers have opted-in. By opting in, these healthcare providers have taken the first step into joining MediXaid and becoming an "Early Adopter" in the revolutionary MediXaid Provider Network. 
MediXall is completing development of a new generation healthcare marketplace platform to address the growing need of self-pay and high deductible consumers for greater transparency and price competition in their healthcare costs. The MediXaid platform provides a B2C capability that brings together into a single cloud-based, patent-pending virtual marketplace the consumers of healthcare products and services with providers that compete on price, location and schedule for requested products and services. 
The MediXaid platform will afford providers the opportunity to reach a higher percentage of self-pay and high-deductible consumers greatly benefiting the providers' practice and assuring higher cash flow through immediate payment for services. Consumers benefit by having greater access to more affordable qualified services in their immediate area with greater transparency in the pricing among providers.
The increasing number of healthcare providers opting in indicates that there is a growing number of healthcare services and product providers in South Florida recognizing the changing landscape of healthcare and the need for positive change. This is yet another major step in the validation of the MediXall business model and will be instrumental in the process of bringing real transparency and free market competition to healthcare. MediXall Group Chairman, Noel J. Guillama, stated, "When I envisioned the MediXaid platform I believed that healthcare would soon be moving toward the need to providing greater access, transparency and competition for the consumer and to ensuring a broader reach into a greater segment of the community for healthcare providers. Clearly, this vision has proven accurate and now even the federal government is calling for exactly what we are providing through the MediXaid platform and MediXall Group, Inc. The positive response we are seeing from the Providers we are contacting is exciting and serves to underscore that both the consumer and provider are seeing the need for a platform like MediXaid." 
ABOUT MEDIXALL GROUP, INC.
MediXall Group, Inc. is a technology and innovation-driven organization purposefully designed and structured to bring effective change to the U.S. healthcare industry. The Company believes its revolutionary approach will help drive much needed change that it envisions is needed in the current healthcare system. The mission of the MediXall Group is to revolutionize the medical industry by improving communication; providing better technology and support services; and enabling more efficient, cost-effective healthcare for the consumer. By approaching the healthcare ecosystem as a whole, MediXall creates, invests and incubates companies that embody its mission statement. MediXall's first acquisition was MediXaid™, a developing cloud-based software platform that promises to revolutionize the way people purchase healthcare goods and services.
