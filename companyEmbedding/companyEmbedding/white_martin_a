REMY MARTIN WHITE V

$39.99





Remy Martin V is a 100% distilled grape spirit from the famous Cognac House of Remy Martin, but it is not a Cognac. It is not aged in wood, and as the result of the non-aging and the cold filtration process it undergoes, it is crystal clear in color. Launched in 2010, Remy Martin V, whose name is derived from eau-de-vie, is fresh, smooth, and clean with subtle hints of pear and fresh mint. It is best served in cocktails. 80 Proof.

Martin's Bleedproof White:I bought this to brush letter on black envelopes and did a comparison with Winsor & Newton white calligraphy ink and this came out strong.

By Art teacherfrom MichiganComments about Dr. Ph. Martin's Bleedproof White:The best  opaque white ink I can find.  It is very thick and condensed and you add water to it to use.

Martin's Bleedproof White:I've been using Dr. Ph Martin's Bleedproof White with dip pens and brushes for a number of years.  I love the control I have with it, the ability to produce fine detail, and it's ability to cover a range of media, and it's been my go-to white for most projects.  I recently used it to accent a journal page covered with black gesso and Verithin colored pencils.  Weeks later, I did a not very wet watercolor directly onto the paper on the reverse of the gessoed mixed media page.  Much to my disappointment, the "Bleedproof" white dissolved and transferred to the adjoining artwork, completely ruining both pages. Because there was so much time between completion of the mixed media page and the WC, I know the white was completely dried.  It was affected solely by the moisture from the WC, which again, was not very wet when applied.This product’s quality compared to similar, competitive alternatives is:Really niceThe price of this product compared to similar, competitive alternatives is:AverageBottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend(3 of 3 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review8/10/2016(2 of 2 customers found this review helpful) 4.0Unbelievable!! By Underpaid-Paragon-of-Artingfrom Columbus, OHComments about Dr. Ph. Martin's Bleedproof White:This stuff is AMAZING!  Tested it against Copic V09 and it only took two layers to cover it up, with NO bleed-through.  I'd never used the Martin's bleed-proof white before and I wish I had--wouldn't have wasted my time on Higgins or the Bombay white for cover-ups.FYI: this stuff is densely packed and you only need to work up a bit at a time.  I use a Pentel wash brush (just poke the tip in, swirl it a few times until the area around the tip is the consistency of heavy cream).  Only downside is that you HAVE to affix it ASAP as otherwise it'll get gummy and pick up dirt super easy.This product’s quality compared to similar, competitive alternatives is:Really niceThe price of this product compared to similar, competitive alternatives is:A solid valueBottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend(2 of 2 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review7/2/2016 5.0Dr. Ph.

Martin's Bleedproof White:This product lives up to its reputation as a wonderfully opaque ink and is indeed just perfect for calligraphy on dark paper.  It truly is the best in its category in terms of its opacity. If you're looking for a white ink that works well with the pointed pen. This is THE ONE. You will need to add a few drops of water to make it thin enough as it comes quite thick. Just stir the water into the top surface only, about half an inch or so.Highly recommended!This product’s quality compared to similar, competitive alternatives is:Best in its categoryThe price of this product compared to similar, competitive alternatives is:A solid valueBottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend(4 of 4 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review5/18/2016 5.0lovely By nothingfrom you already knowComments about Dr. Ph.

Aggregates
Aggregates are an engineered granular material consisting of crushed stone, gravel and sand of varying mineralogies, manufactured to specific sizes, grades and chemistry for use in construction, chemical and industrial applications.









Ready Mixed Concrete
Martin Marietta provides the highest quality products and services. We partner with our customers to finish all projects in a timely manner with superior results. To facilitate this, we offer unique performance-driven mix designs and a wide range of ancillary products to meet specification requirements and provide additional value to the construction community.








Asphalt
Asphalt is America’s most recycled material. Reclaimed asphalt is not just reusable as a "black rock" – the asphalt cement in the reclaimed pavement is reactivated to become an integral part of the new pavement. The recycled asphalt cement replaces part of the new asphalt cement and aggregate required for the pavement, reducing costs for road agencies and preserving valuable natural resources.








Cement
Martin Marietta operates energy-efficient and modern cement production facilities that are among the top tier in the United States, providing a sustainable building material critical for durable and resilient construction needs across all market segments. Commonly referred to as portland cement, these products range from general-purpose types to oil well cements and specialty masonry and plastering cements. Among the most widely-utilized building material in the world, cement touches virtually every aspect of our lives, and builds the homes, hospitals, offices, public buildings, ports, roads, bridges, highways, sidewalks and foundations across the country.








Cement Treated Materials
Cement Treated Material (CTM) is a simple, plant-mixed, highly compacted mixture of granular aggregates, Portland cement and water.  As the cement hydrates, the mixture becomes a hard, durable paving material.  A bituminous wearing surface is placed on the CTM to complete the pavement structure.

Developed By Industry Renowned Dentistand Researcher, Dr. Martin Giniger







The Power Swabs® system was first introduced in 2008 with a breakthrough, patented teeth whitening technology developed by celebrated dentist Dr. Martin Giniger. In fact, according to several teeth whitening reviews in the dental literature, Dr. Giniger’s Power Swabs home teeth whitening product is proven to whiten teeth as well as white strips, but with far less sensitivity and greater ease of use. To accomplish this, Power Swabs whitening products use a patented combination of clinically-researched ingredients to reach between enamel and break the molecular bonds between positively charged stained molecules and the negatively charged surfaces they are bound to for a deeper, platinum white clean. An added bonus to the gentle formula is that it works on cosmetic dentistry as well as natural teeth.
Dr. Martin Giniger has 30 years of experience working as a dentist, and he has over 23 years of experience developing teeth whitening kits with the world’s largest oral care companies such as Proctor & Gamble, Church & Dwight, and Colgate-Palmolive. Teeth whitening reviews show that Dr. Giniger is the leading authority in the formulation of professional teeth whitening and over-the-counter dental products. Renowned for developing breakthrough whitening toothpaste, whitening swabs, whitening strips, as well as other oral care products for consumer and professional application, Dr. Giniger is the recipient of the prestigious NIH Physician-Scientist Award and the Academy of Oral Medicine’s Lester Burkett Memorial Award, and is recognized as one of the world's foremost experts on teeth whitening and dental health.






"Power Swabs Teeth Whitening are both very easy to use and also provides a healthier, more effective, clean and white result with zero sensitivity."
