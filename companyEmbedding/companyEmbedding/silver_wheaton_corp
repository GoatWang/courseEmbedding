History[edit]
Silver Wheaton was established in 2004. It was previously controlled by Goldcorp until December 7, 2006 when Goldcorp's sale of 18 million shares reduced its ownership to 48%. On February 14, 2008 Goldcorp divested itself completely of Silver Wheaton, selling 108 million shares for C$1.566 billion.
Silverstone Resources, acquired in 2009 previously traded on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol SST (delisted May 25, 2009 just after the takever) as a Tier 1 stock (the exchange's premier tier).[9][10]
Contracts[edit]
Although most agreements it makes are short-term contracts, at least one with the Penasquito mine in Mexico lasts the length of the mine's life. Until the third quarter of 2012 all of the gold it sold came from the Minto Mine in the Yukon, acquired in mid-2009 following the Cdn $190 million acquisition of Silverstone Resources Corp.[11] In 3q2012 it started receiving gold from HudBay's 777 polymetallic mine in Manitoba [1]. In 2013 it began receiving gold from 3 new mines: Sudbury (33,000 oz), Salobo (29,100 oz), and Constancia. Average realized price for gold produced at 777 was $1390 which is similar to Minto however, average realized cash cost is 32% higher at mine 777 ($400 vs $303).[3]
In total, there are 15 agreements with 11 different companies; being able to pay a large portion of the contract price in cash initially and having already developed, extensive relationships with mining companies helps it gain access to the commodity.[12] In 2013 the average price paid per ounce of pure silver was $4.12 up from $4.06, $3.99, $3.97 in 2012, 2011, 2010. Penasquito (one of the largest silver deposits in the world, Silver Wheaton's 25% interest would rank in the top 25 silver mines in the world) will give the company an average of 7 million ounces annually for 22 years (begins early production in 2010-2011). In 2013 Penasquito produced 6.216 million ounces for Silver Wheaton (down from 6.572m in 2012, 5.284m in 2011) at a cost of $4.02 per ounce (up from $3.99, $3.93). Like over half of the world's silver producing mines, the Penasquito mine also produces lead, copper and zinc.[13] In 2013 company production totaled 35.823 million ounces (26.754 million of that pure silver +0%, the rest being gold) 22.0% higher than 2012, 41.2% more than 2011, +110% vs 2009. In 2013 it sold 29.963 million ounces of silver equivalent (+9.6%) at an average price per ounce of $23.58 ($31.09 in 2012, $34.65 in 2011). In 2013 the unit price paid for pure silver was up six cents to $4.12 (incl gold $4.65) while the realized price was down 717 cents to $23.86 (incl gold $23.58). In 2011 though the unit price paid per silver equivalent ounce was only five cents higher at $4.09 it sold each ounce for 67.6% more, in 2010 it was 36.6% more. Total revenue was down 17% in 2013, up 16% in 2012, up 72% in 2011.
Mines[edit]
The silver it has agreed to purchase is in Mexico (40%), Portugal (20%), USA (10%), Chile (9%), Peru (9%), Argentina (7%), Sweden (4%), Greece and Canada (about 1%).[14] Silver Wheaton doesn't own or operate the mines but the contracts it has with their owners gives it full access to any silver (gold at the Minto Mine) mined there. The six mines from which the company gets most of its silver are : San Dimas, Penasquito, Barrick (made up of five parts), Yauliyacu, Zinkgruvan, Cozamin and Minto. In addition there are six other smaller mines that contribute about 22% of the total.[15]
The San Dimas mine was sold by Goldcorp in the summer of 2010 to Mala Noche Resources Corp. (later renamed Primero Mining) for half a billion dollars complicating things for Silver Wheaton which had already made an agreement with Goldcorp for the silver.[16] In response Silver Wheaton agreed to a new contract agreement.[17] The Penasquito mine which began producing in September 2010 (and has a mine life of 22 years) is Mexico's largest open pit mine.[18][19][20]
- The agreement it has with Barrick Gold involves the silver produced at 4 mines; Pascua Lama, Lagunas Norte (Peru), Pierina (Peru) and Veladero (Argentina).[21] The deal involving the Lagunas Norte, Pierina and Veladero mines was made in September 2009, required an initial deposit of $212.2 million, gives Silver Wheaton 100% of the silver produced and ends at the conclusion of 2013.[22] The Pascua-Lama mine (at the border of Chile and Argentina) contract gives Silver Wheaton access to a quarter of the silver produced there from 2013 to 2017 and could raise silver sales by 30%.[22]
- Subsidiary Silverstone Resources Corp. owns 100% of the life of mine silver produced at mines in Neves-Corvo and Aljustrel, Portugal. The Lundin Mining owned Neves-Corvo mine located near the Iberian Pyrite Belt is primarily a copper and zinc producer.[23]
- Mine 777 in Manitoba belongs to HudBay Minerals. The mine was the source of 62.8% of Silver Wheaton's gold produced in 2012. In the last quarter alone it accounted for 19,615 ounces of gold, more than Silver Wheaton's other gold mine produced over the entire year (18,600 oz). When converted to silver equivalent using the gold to silver ratio, gold from 777 accounted for 40.5% of the increase in total production in 2012.

Until the third quarter of 2012 all of the gold it sold came from the Minto Mine in the Yukon, acquired in mid-2009 following the Cdn $190 million acquisition of Silverstone Resources Corp.[11] In 3q2012 it started receiving gold from HudBay's 777 polymetallic mine in Manitoba [1]. In 2013 it began receiving gold from 3 new mines: Sudbury (33,000 oz), Salobo (29,100 oz), and Constancia. Average realized price for gold produced at 777 was $1390 which is similar to Minto however, average realized cash cost is 32% higher at mine 777 ($400 vs $303).[3]
In total, there are 15 agreements with 11 different companies; being able to pay a large portion of the contract price in cash initially and having already developed, extensive relationships with mining companies helps it gain access to the commodity.[12] In 2013 the average price paid per ounce of pure silver was $4.12 up from $4.06, $3.99, $3.97 in 2012, 2011, 2010. Penasquito (one of the largest silver deposits in the world, Silver Wheaton's 25% interest would rank in the top 25 silver mines in the world) will give the company an average of 7 million ounces annually for 22 years (begins early production in 2010-2011). In 2013 Penasquito produced 6.216 million ounces for Silver Wheaton (down from 6.572m in 2012, 5.284m in 2011) at a cost of $4.02 per ounce (up from $3.99, $3.93). Like over half of the world's silver producing mines, the Penasquito mine also produces lead, copper and zinc.[13] In 2013 company production totaled 35.823 million ounces (26.754 million of that pure silver +0%, the rest being gold) 22.0% higher than 2012, 41.2% more than 2011, +110% vs 2009. In 2013 it sold 29.963 million ounces of silver equivalent (+9.6%) at an average price per ounce of $23.58 ($31.09 in 2012, $34.65 in 2011). In 2013 the unit price paid for pure silver was up six cents to $4.12 (incl gold $4.65) while the realized price was down 717 cents to $23.86 (incl gold $23.58). In 2011 though the unit price paid per silver equivalent ounce was only five cents higher at $4.09 it sold each ounce for 67.6% more, in 2010 it was 36.6% more. Total revenue was down 17% in 2013, up 16% in 2012, up 72% in 2011.
Mines[edit]
The silver it has agreed to purchase is in Mexico (40%), Portugal (20%), USA (10%), Chile (9%), Peru (9%), Argentina (7%), Sweden (4%), Greece and Canada (about 1%).[14] Silver Wheaton doesn't own or operate the mines but the contracts it has with their owners gives it full access to any silver (gold at the Minto Mine) mined there. The six mines from which the company gets most of its silver are : San Dimas, Penasquito, Barrick (made up of five parts), Yauliyacu, Zinkgruvan, Cozamin and Minto. In addition there are six other smaller mines that contribute about 22% of the total.[15]
The San Dimas mine was sold by Goldcorp in the summer of 2010 to Mala Noche Resources Corp. (later renamed Primero Mining) for half a billion dollars complicating things for Silver Wheaton which had already made an agreement with Goldcorp for the silver.[16] In response Silver Wheaton agreed to a new contract agreement.[17] The Penasquito mine which began producing in September 2010 (and has a mine life of 22 years) is Mexico's largest open pit mine.[18][19][20]
- The agreement it has with Barrick Gold involves the silver produced at 4 mines; Pascua Lama, Lagunas Norte (Peru), Pierina (Peru) and Veladero (Argentina).[21] The deal involving the Lagunas Norte, Pierina and Veladero mines was made in September 2009, required an initial deposit of $212.2 million, gives Silver Wheaton 100% of the silver produced and ends at the conclusion of 2013.[22] The Pascua-Lama mine (at the border of Chile and Argentina) contract gives Silver Wheaton access to a quarter of the silver produced there from 2013 to 2017 and could raise silver sales by 30%.[22]
- Subsidiary Silverstone Resources Corp. owns 100% of the life of mine silver produced at mines in Neves-Corvo and Aljustrel, Portugal. The Lundin Mining owned Neves-Corvo mine located near the Iberian Pyrite Belt is primarily a copper and zinc producer.[23]
- Mine 777 in Manitoba belongs to HudBay Minerals. The mine was the source of 62.8% of Silver Wheaton's gold produced in 2012. In the last quarter alone it accounted for 19,615 ounces of gold, more than Silver Wheaton's other gold mine produced over the entire year (18,600 oz). When converted to silver equivalent using the gold to silver ratio, gold from 777 accounted for 40.5% of the increase in total production in 2012.

History[edit]
Silver Wheaton was established in 2004. It was previously controlled by Goldcorp until December 7, 2006 when Goldcorp's sale of 18 million shares reduced its ownership to 48%. On February 14, 2008 Goldcorp divested itself completely of Silver Wheaton, selling 108 million shares for C$1.566 billion.
Silverstone Resources, acquired in 2009 previously traded on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol SST (delisted May 25, 2009 just after the takever) as a Tier 1 stock (the exchange's premier tier).[9][10]

1 Key Metric for Silver Wheaton Corp. Investors to Focus On
Big deals made the last few years exciting for gold and silver streaming company Silver Wheaton. Now it's time to watch organic growth.











                Reuben Gregg Brewer
            

                (TMFReubenGBrewer)



            
            Mar 30, 2017 at 10:23AM
            
            





Silver Wheaton Corp. (NYSE:SLW) was able to grow its business at a time when gold and silver miners were struggling through a commodity downturn. With precious-metals prices on the mend, however, the opportunities for big streaming deals aren't as good. And that means it's time for investors to watch Silver Wheaton's production trends a little more closely.
Big years
Silver Wheaton is a streaming company and has a unique business model in the precious-metals space. It essentially gives money up front to miners, in exchange for the right to buy silver and gold at reduced prices in the future. To put some numbers on that: It pays around $4 an ounce for silver (about 60% of revenues) and $400 an ounce for gold (about 40% of revenues) -- well below the current spot price for each of these precious metals.

Image source: Silver Wheaton analyst presentation.

The question that should quickly come to mind is: Why would a miner want to sell gold or silver so cheaply? When a miner signs a deal with Silver Wheaton it needs the cash when other options -- like selling stock, issuing bonds, or going to a bank -- are less desirable. That's why the commodity downturn was so good for Silver Wheaton; big companies with operating mines were struggling financially and desperate for cash that few wanted to provide. Silver Wheaton stepped into the void.
For example, in 2015 Silver Wheaton was able to ink two $900 million deals, one with Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) and another with Glencore, two of the largest miners in the world. The terms of the Vale deal were for Silver Wheaton to buy gold from the Salobo mine at the lesser of $400 an ounce or the going spot price -- a really good deal for the streaming company. Vale, meanwhile, used the cash to fund development plans for its giant S11D iron-ore mine, and to pay down debt: a win-win. In fact, Vale came back for more in 2016, letting Silver Wheaton make another $800 million streaming deal at the same mine.

Summary stats for the Salobo mine deals. Image source: Silver Wheaton.

Deals like this allowed Silver Wheaton to opportunistically expand its business during the downturn: Silver-equivalent production increased 37% between 2014 and 2015, and jumped another 15% in 2016. With precious-metals prices on the rebound, however, investors shouldn't count on more big deals like that. Silver Wheaton's production outlook is relatively flat through 2020 -- from the operating mines in its portfolio.
Watch the production
To be fair, even if production doesn't expand, a precious-metals rally could still boost the company's top and bottom lines. But real growth in the business will need to show up in the production numbers. And that's why now is the time to keep a close eye on production growth. You see, another reason why miners sign streaming deals is to pay for early-stage development and expansion projects. Silver Wheaton has a number of these deals on the books, but the projects aren't up and running yet.
The problem is that these investments take longer to bring on line and their outcomes are far less certain than investing in a mine that's already operational. But they're where Silver Wheaton's growth is going to come from in the next few years. That said, there's a huge opportunity, with more than 10,000 silver-equivalent ounces of "optionality," as Silver Wheaton calls it, built into its portfolio:

Silver Wheaton's production growth is all about "optionality." Image source: Silver Wheaton.

It's Silver Wheaton's production growth that will tell you if it made the right investments or not. For example, Silver Wheaton has invested in Barrick Gold’s (NYSE:ABX) Pascua-Lama mine, a development project that has been mired in political and environmental drama for years. Although the opportunity at Pascua-Lama is huge, it may never live up to its potential. But if it does, it could provide a huge boost to the company's production numbers.





A different part of the cycle
Silver Wheaton did a great job of expanding its business while the opportunity was there during the commodity downturn. But now it looks like we're heading into a different phase of the typical boom-and-bust cycle for miners. You should definitely pay attention to the company's financial results, but don't overlook production growth; that will tell you how well Silver Wheaton is doing, now that miners are no longer as desperate for cash. If the "optionality" in its portfolio doesn't turn into physical production, then Silver Wheaton's future won't be as bright as its recent past.

TSX: SLWNYSE:    SLW
VANCOUVER, May 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - Silver Wheaton Corp. ("Silver Wheaton" or the "Company") (TSX:SLW) (NYSE:   SLW) is pleased to announce that it has filed Articles of Amendment to change its name to Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. ("Wheaton Precious Metals"). Shareholders approved a special resolution to change the name at the Company's Annual and Special Meeting of Shareholders held on May 10, 2017. 








The change of name to Wheaton Precious Metals is effective May 10, 2017. Concurrently, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Silver Wheaton (Caymans) Ltd. will change its name to Wheaton Precious Metals International Ltd. 
It is anticipated that the Company will commence trading under the symbol "WPM" on the TSX and NYSE effective on or about the opening of trading on May 16, 2017. 
"Changing our name to Wheaton Precious Metals marks our evolution from a pure silver streaming company to a diversified precious metals streaming company. Since 2004, the company has focused on building the best portfolio of precious metals streams underpinned by low-cost mining operations. Starting in 2013, the opportunities have been more focused on gold, and thus, our portfolio is now relatively balanced between silver and gold. We are excited about this new identity, which better reflects our underlying operations and still respects our history," said Randy Smallwood, President and Chief Executive Officer of Silver Wheaton.
New Website 
As part of the rebranding initiative, the newly designed corporate website will launch on May 16, 2017, to coincide with the commencement of the Company's shares trading under the new stock symbol "WPM" on the TSX and NYSE. The new domain name will be: www.wheatonpm.com. Visitors to the current website and emails to existing Company addresses will be redirected.  
More Than Just Silver  
The new name, Wheaton Precious Metals, better aligns with the Company's diverse portfolio of both silver and gold assets. Since 2013, the Company has seen a marked increase in gold production, and more recently, for the third consecutive quarter, revenue was roughly evenly split between silver and gold. Over the Company's history, value has been created through streaming both silver and gold assets, and the new name will reinforce its position as the leader in precious metals streaming.
