Friday 4 February 2005 20.47 EST


First published on Friday 4 February 2005 20.47 EST







Lucian Grainge is sitting crosslegged on his office sofa, twiddling his fingers and trying not to sound irritated by questions about the role of big business in the music industry. The head of Universal Music UK - which sells one in four of the records we buy and manages acts from Keane to Eminem to U2 - is adamant that Universal is not really very commercial at all.
"What makes something corporate? I believe our company is the least corporate company in the corporate world," he says. "It's built up with a bunch of talented, focused, intelligent, passionate people who like developing music and making it. Why is that corporate?" 
It is a question that could be answered this Wednesday night at the annual industry love-in that is the British Record Industry Awards, or Brits. Millions of viewers will tune in to watch stars such as Franz Ferdinand, Joss Stone, Snow Patrol and both Bedingfields perform at the 25th anniversary event. Many more millions of pounds will be raised for charity, largely through corporate tables that dominate the space at the Earls Court event, rather than the few hundred screaming fans likely to dominate television screens. At last year's event, one industry executive described Beyoncé as a "great product, beautifully packaged". 
Grainge, 44 and a co-chairman of this year's event, has little time for those who fear the impact of the increasingly huge global record companies on the business. The awards are "an opportunity for us to enjoy and celebrate British music and celebrate the music business", he says. 
To be fair, Grainge and the British music industry itself have something to celebrate this year. The industry finds itself in positive sales territory for the first time in years, with a 3% increase in album sales. Universal's sales rose 12% in the UK last year, as the market leader managed to increase its share of the albums and singles market to more than 29%. It had three albums in the top 10, including the top two by Scissor Sisters and Keane. 
These two acts are also indicative of what has been described as a resurgent British music industry. (Scissors, an American band, were signed in the UK.) Four of the top five albums were by British acts last year, four of whom were previously unknown acts.
Peter Jamieson, chairman of the trade body, the British Phonographic Industry, says he can't remember the last time the charts were not dominated by foreigners. 
The success last year earned Grainge and his team a special mention in last week's results from its giant parent company, Vivendi Universal. They were praised for "an exceptional year for breaking new artists". 
It isn't long in the conversation with Grainge before talk turns to which new acts could help make this year as good as last. Any discomfort disappears and, like an ageing rock star coming into a packed auditorium, he jumps up from the sofa and runs over to his stereo system, shouting: "That's the best bit!" Before we know where we are he has turned up the volume on a demo disc and launched into a story about the Next Big Thing. 
The story starts when someone who knew Grainge 20 years ago rang and said he'd found a new talent. "He brings this guy in and I flip," says Grainge. "I do it on the spot. I call the head of Mercury [one of Universal's record labels] and I say, 'if you like this as much as I like it, we've got a deal'. 
'That's the gift' 
"This guy, Bobby Kray his name is, K-R-AY, he looks like someone from Jamiroquai yet has the voice of an angel. He was a choir boy at St Paul's or somewhere when he was 14 or something ... He's...," the machine-gun patter stalls momentarily, "He's stunning." 
But how can he tell that this new act will sell? Grainge, who is wearing a dark suit over an open-necked shirt revealing a mat of dark chest hair, leans over and says: "I can smell it. After 26 or 27 years, it's a smell." By this point, he is rifling through the stack of discs and tapes on his desk. We sit listening to at least five different, yet-to-be launched acts. 
Grainge, a stocky man, hums, nods and stamps along to the entire show. He knows the pauses, speaks up at the bits that need a little bit more work and points out the choruses that will work. 
How does this middle-aged man who grew up in north London loving the Clash and the Sex Pistols know what it takes for a hip-hop, pop or soul song to work? At this question, he smiles and says softly: "That's the gift." 
"I was a publisher for the first 10 years of my career. I understand songs. It's very, very difficult to define. I can definitely smell it. I can feel it in my fingertips." 
His ability to pick artists who work across a range of styles does mark Grainge out. But then it also marks out Universal, which produced half of the classical albums released last year, as well as Busted. 
His gift is allied to his business skills. In describing the first time he heard one new act, The Bravery, he says: "It was the best thing I'd heard. I absolutely loved it. It ticked every box - radio, TV, press, merchandise, the look, the trend." 
Yet it is impossible not to feel that Grainge really does love music and not just because the words "I love this business" and "I absolutely love this" act like a refrain to his speech.
He left school at 18 after walking out of an A-level exam to attend a meeting in which he helped to negotiate his first record deal. He earned £400 and knew he had "crossed a divide". "I felt comfortable and normal around musicians and artists and managers. I liked the social scene and loved the music. I was absolutely obsessed with it." 
His life today - regular dinners with Sir Elton John and a big house near Richmond, south-west London - is a far cry from his early days when his father owned a television and radio shop with "a carousel of 78s" in it and the young Lucian managed a band at school. 
Yet he maintains a link to what people really want, he says, by taking some of his senior managers to local high streets. "You're going to think I'm mad but what I do with my senior people is go and observe people," he says. 
"I love going to Coventry, Harrow, West Bromwich. That's where I walk into stores and get a sense of what people are wearing and what they want. There's an awful lot of data in the record business ... but to actually see these people and get a sense of demographics..." He tails off.
He is scathing of critics of reality-TV programmes such as Pop Idol or Fame Academy, describing them simply as "family entertainment". He adds: "Why not let people enjoy themselves? Why must we judge people all the time?" 
His first proper job was plugging songs, trying to get radio stations to play his company's music. Within five years he had moved to a record label and was director of A&R - artist and repertoire - which combines spotting talent with developing it. 
Grainge believes his background and that of his top team differentiates Universal from its main competitors, which are now reduced to three after Sony and BMG agreed to merge last year. Explaining the difference, Grainge says: "I am from an A&R background. All those other guys are from marketing." 
Jamieson at the BPI, who is co-chair of the Brits, says Grainge is a "one-off " in what can appear a cut-throat music business. "He can be both harsh and gentle, both businessman and music devotee." 
His boss, Doug Morris, chairman of Universal Music Group, has said of him: "He is so deceptive with that little kind face and those little glasses. Behind them, he is actually a killer shark." 
Despite his obvious love of the industry, Grainge is reluctant to name the music he listens to for pleasure. He begins by saying he can't listen to music at home as his youngest children, who are five and 11, overtake the system. So what does he listen to in the car alone? "I love listening to the Scissors in the car. They had the number-one biggest, most successful selling album last year." 
How about music he wasn't necessarily involved in? "The buzz of listening to one of the artists we have been involved with and which has sold millions is very therapeutic," he smiles. 
But is there any music he just really loves? Finally, he says: "Presley, Led Zeppelin, the Clash, the Sex Pistols." But he admits he could never name a truly favourite band, especially not a still-performing one, for fear of the people who would feel slighted. 
"When you're in this business, and particularly when you've been in this business since you were 18 like I have, there's no difference between the personal and business," he says.
Previous interviews have made much of the running machine, unplugged and unloved at the back of Grainge's office. But he seems to use up plenty of energy bouncing around the room and talking about work. "I love it. I am stimulated by it. The only time that the phone doesn't ring and the BlackBerry doesn't work is over Christmas. But that's because no one else is working." 
This Wednesday, Grainge is likely to be in his element. His front-row table at the Brits will be graced by some of Universal's top international executives, as well as the singer Amy Winehouse. 
A million miles away from all those record buyers in the Midlands. Yet when he hears that my mum is an Il Divo fan, he insists that I take her a new tape from a yet-to-be released crooner Patrizio Buanne. "She's a big market, your mum. Give her this and tell me what she thinks. Tell me as soon as possible. Before next week. Really, I mean it." And I think he really does.

Sir Lucian Charles Grainge, CBE, (born 29 February 1960)[1] is the chairman and chief executive officer of Universal Music Group. Over the course of his career, he has been instrumental in the careers of artists such as Amy Winehouse, ABBA, Eurythmics, Rihanna, Sam Smith, Take That, Psychedelic Furs, The Rolling Stones, Sting, U2, Jamie Cullum and Andrea Bocelli.[2][3][4] Grainge has worked in the music business for his entire career.[5] In 2013, 2015, and 2016, he topped Billboard Magazine’s “Power 100” list as the most powerful person in the music business, the only person to ever hold that distinction three times and the first to earn that position for consecutive years.[3][6][7]
Irving Azoff called him "'the great hope for the music business'" and Jimmy Iovine commented that Grainge "is working to restore [a] spirit of risk-taking and innovation" by being "'willing and open to entrepreneurship and that kind of thing the record industry has gotten depleted of.'"[8]
In an interview with Grainge, Billboard wrote: “If “power” means moving markets or greenlighting massive spends, Universal Music Group chairman Lucian Grainge demonstrated a staggering penchant for it when UMG completed its $1.9 billion acquisition of EMI’s recorded-music assets in September 2012. Grainge is a fierce and tireless advocate for the recorded-music business."[9] In 2013, CNET wrote that “Grainge is positioning Universal to lead the pack” of major labels in their embracing of new digital opportunities.[10] A 2014 front-page LA Times profile of Grainge said that "if anyone can save the music business, it might be Grainge."[8] In 2015, Billboard wrote, “in the age of Spotify, YouTube and Shazam, Grainge is positioned to tackle his business' overriding priority: win fair compensation for artists, and take full ownership of content that other parties have been profiting from.”[3]

Early life and career[edit]
Lucian Grainge grew up in north London. Grainge worked his way up in the London music scene after leaving Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School for Boys at the age of 18, when he began working as a runner at a talent scout company called MPC.[5] After calling several record label heads from the Music Week directory, he got through to Maurice Oberstein, the chairman of CBC Records, who hired him for publishing company April Music's A&R department. His first signing was the Psychedelic Furs. In 1982 he became the director of RCA Music Publishing. Two years later he became an A&R director for MCA Records. He set up PolyGram Music Publishing in 1986 and joined Polydor as GM of A&R and business affairs in 1993. He was promoted to managing director of Polydor in 1997, and had success with acts including Boyzone and the Lighthouse Family.[11] Since becoming chairman and Chief Executive of Universal Music in 2011, Grainge has overseen a strategy to increase Universal's digital distribution, international expansion and market leadership in both recorded music and publishing. Best-selling artists signed to Universal Music in recent years have included Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Jessie J, Amy Winehouse, Carly Rae Jepsen and Maroon 5.
Universal Music Group[edit]
Grainge became the chairman of the UK division of the Universal Music Group and later became chairman of Universal Music Group International in 2005. He served in this position until 2010. On 1 January 2011 he became CEO of the Universal Music Group and later became chairman on 9 March 2011. He succeeded Doug Morris who served as chairman and CEO since 1995.[12]
Grainge has been influential in Universal Music Group's international digital expansion by pioneering distribution models with a wide range of technology partners, including Apple, Spotify, BSkyB, Rdio, Virgin Media, Vodafone and 19 Entertainment.[13][14][15][16][17][18][19]
He recently established the licensed music service, One-Stop China, with Baidu, as well as a deal with B'IN to break Taiwanese acts on the mainland.[20] There is also an agreement in place with Reliance to start India's first mobile music service.[21]
Grainge also helped arrange the partnership between Bravado, Universal Music's entertainment merchandising division, and Tommy Hilfiger[22] and oversaw expansion for flagship classical labels Deutsche Grammophon and Decca Classics. He also put together the global strategic partnership with entertainment company Live Nation.[23]
Within his first year as chairman & CEO of Universal, he led the company in acquiring EMI's Recorded Music operations.[24] In doing so he argued that selling to Universal was the only way to make EMI better and thus lift the entire industry.[25] He made the revitalisation of former EMI labels such as Capitol Records and Virgin Records a key part of his strategy.[26] As a result of the EMI acquisition, "Grainge will go down as the master architect of what is likely to be the last big deal in the music business."[25]
In the EMI deal, UMG acquired the Beatles catalogue. UMG's merchandising division, Bravado, subsequently secured North American merchandising for the band.[27] UMG is now creating a "unified marketing strategy for the music and associated products of the most influential and beloved band in the history of music."[28] The wisdom of the acquisition was further illustrated by the quick success of the revitalized Capitol Music Group.[29] In 2015, Capitol earned all the major Grammy Awards for the year, with Sam Smith receiving Best New Artist, Record of the Year and Song of the Year awards and Beck winning Album of the Year.[30]
In 2013, Grainge partnered with Russell Simmons, Brian Robbins and Steve Rifkind to create All Def Music, the first major label-affiliated music company created specifically to sign, develop and promote artists on YouTube.[10] Russell Simmons called Grainge "the most innovative of music executives."[31]
UMG partnered with Samsung in the spring of 2013 to launch a music service in Africa called the Kleek, featuring the company's international catalogue, as well as local artists.[8]
Under Grainge's leadership, UMG has broken a string of records, becoming the first company in the US to have nine of the top 10 songs on the digital charts, according to SoundScan,[32] and weeks later, becoming the first company to hold all 10 of the top 10 spots on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[33] According to an industry insider, UMG's "enterprise value in 10 years stands to be closing in on $40 billion."[25]
In 2015, Grainge was featured in a documentary film that depicts the life and death of late British singer Amy Winehouse, entitled Amy, which was released theatrically in July.
In 2015, Vivendi announced that Grainge agreed to extend his tenure as UMG’s chairman and CEO until at least 2020, stating he was key to its strategy.[34] Under his leadership, UMG experienced growth in annual revenue, digital recorded music revenue and EBITDA.[35]
Personal life[edit]
In January 1993, Grainge married his first wife, attorney Samantha Berg. That November, she experienced complications while giving birth to their son Elliot, and fell into a coma from which she never recovered.[36] She died in England in 2007.[37]
In 2002 Grainge married his second wife, Caroline. Their daughter Alice was born in 2001. In November 2012 Grainge and his wife reportedly paid 13 million USD for a house in Pacific Palisades. They had previously leased a Brentwood home from the owner of Rhino Entertainment.[38]
His older brother was Nigel Grainge, the founder of Ensign Records.[39]
Industry honours and other achievements[edit]
In 2008, Grainge was honoured with the prestigious Music Industry Trusts’ Award, which recognises the world’s most influential and successful executives in music. Members of U2 presented him with the award, and other acts he was associated with, like Take That, performed.
Grainge was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2010 New Year Honours for services to the creative industries.[40] In 2012, UK Prime Minister David Cameron appointed him as a British Business Ambassador.[41] He was knighted in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to British business and inward investment.[42] He was inaugurated to appointment to the Order of the British Empire and Knight Bachelor by Prince William on November 29, 2016.[43]
Grainge is a Trustee of The American Friends of The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. http://www.royalfoundation.com/contact-us/
In 2013, he received the Humanitarian Award from The Foundation for Ethnic Understanding. That same year, UMG was honoured with a SAG-AFTRA American Scene Award, recognising the company's commitment to diversity as exemplified by its "entire catalog and roster of artists."[44] In 2014, he was awarded the President's Merit Award ("Icon Award") by the Recording Academy in recognition of his significant contributions to the music industry.[45][46] In 2015, he will receive the Spirit of Life Award from the City of Hope, recognizing his outstanding achievements in business and his dedication to philanthropic causes.[47]
Grainge serves on the boards of Lionsgate and Northeastern University.[48][49]
In October 2016, Variety presented Grainge with its 2016 Empowerment Award for overseeing a "noticeable shift in the demographics of the industry leader’s C-suites” with women occupying some of the highest executive positions at Universal Music Group.[50]
In May 2017 the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity announced that Grainge would be honored as the 2017 Media Person of the Year. He is the first music executive to be recognized since the award was launched in 1999.[51]
He was awarded an honorary doctorate of music by the Berklee College of Music in May 2016[52] and an honorary doctorate of global commerce by Northeastern University in May of 2017.[53]

Sir Lucian Grainge named Cannes Lions Media Person of the Year 2017




Product name：Sir Lucian Grainge named 


2017/05/02 update
Industry：Advertising







Universal Music Group Chairman & CEO is first music executive honoured with award LONDON, May 1, 2017 - (ACN Newswire) -  The Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity today announced that Sir Lucian Grainge, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of Universal Music Group (UMG), will be honoured as the 2017 Media Person of the Year at the annual Festival. Grainge is the first music executive to be recognised since the award launched in 1999. Media Person of the Year recognises innovators who have shaped the future of media. The award will be presented to Grainge at a ceremony on Wednesday, 21 June 2017, during the Festival. During a career spanning nearly four decades in the music business, Grainge signed and worked with many global stars, including ABBA, Justin Bieber, Elton John, Jay Z, Katy Perry, Queen, Rihanna, The Rolling Stones, Sam Smith, U2 and Amy Winehouse. Widely credited for laying the foundation that has led to the music industry's return to growth after more than a decade of decline, Grainge developed new approaches to the signing and development of global recording artists and songwriters and championed innovative business models and created partnerships with a wide range of international technology and media partners. Philip Thomas, CEO of Ascential Events, organisers of Cannes Lions, said, "Through creative drive, passion and outstanding leadership, Sir Lucian has made bold investments in music and technology that helped return the industry to growth, while continuing to foster an environment that puts artists first. During his tenure, Grainge has transformed Universal Music Group into a world leader in music-based entertainment and we're delighted to honour him as this year's Media Person of the Year." Grainge commented, "While today's music industry is virtually unrecognizable from the business I started in, one thing that hasn't changed is that great artists and great music remain at the heart of everything we do. We are proud to demonstrate how traditional media businesses can reinvent themselves in the age of streaming, leverage new technologies and work closely with brand partners to develop exciting opportunities for artists, labels and fans. On behalf of everyone at UMG and all of our recording artists and songwriters, we're very thankful to Cannes Lions for this honour." In 2011, Grainge led UMG's successful acquisition of the recorded music assets of the legendary British music company EMI, revitalizing its iconic Capitol Records, and, in the process, further strengthening UMG's position as the global leader in music. Under his leadership, the company set numerous creative records including being the first music company to score all 10 of the top 10 spots on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2016, Grainge was knighted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in the Queen's 90th Birthday Honours list for accomplishments in the music industry and leadership through its challenging times, contributions to British business and inward investment. Grainge also serves on the boards of Lionsgate Entertainment Corp., a premier next generation global content leader, and Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. About Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity The International Festival of Creativity, also known as Cannes Lions, is the world's leading celebration of creativity in communications and encompasses Lions Health, Lions Innovation and Lions Entertainment.

Sir Lucian Charles Grainge, CBE, (born 29 February 1960)[1] is the chairman and chief executive officer of Universal Music Group. Over the course of his career, he has been instrumental in the careers of artists such as Amy Winehouse, ABBA, Eurythmics, Rihanna, Sam Smith, Take That, Psychedelic Furs, The Rolling Stones, Sting, U2, Jamie Cullum and Andrea Bocelli.[2][3][4] Grainge has worked in the music business for his entire career.[5] In 2013, 2015, and 2016, he topped Billboard Magazine’s “Power 100” list as the most powerful person in the music business, the only person to ever hold that distinction three times and the first to earn that position for consecutive years.[3][6][7]
Irving Azoff called him "'the great hope for the music business'" and Jimmy Iovine commented that Grainge "is working to restore [a] spirit of risk-taking and innovation" by being "'willing and open to entrepreneurship and that kind of thing the record industry has gotten depleted of.'"[8]
In an interview with Grainge, Billboard wrote: “If “power” means moving markets or greenlighting massive spends, Universal Music Group chairman Lucian Grainge demonstrated a staggering penchant for it when UMG completed its $1.9 billion acquisition of EMI’s recorded-music assets in September 2012. Grainge is a fierce and tireless advocate for the recorded-music business."[9] In 2013, CNET wrote that “Grainge is positioning Universal to lead the pack” of major labels in their embracing of new digital opportunities.[10] A 2014 front-page LA Times profile of Grainge said that "if anyone can save the music business, it might be Grainge."[8] In 2015, Billboard wrote, “in the age of Spotify, YouTube and Shazam, Grainge is positioned to tackle his business' overriding priority: win fair compensation for artists, and take full ownership of content that other parties have been profiting from.”[3]

Early life and career[edit]
Lucian Grainge grew up in north London. Grainge worked his way up in the London music scene after leaving Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School for Boys at the age of 18, when he began working as a runner at a talent scout company called MPC.[5] After calling several record label heads from the Music Week directory, he got through to Maurice Oberstein, the chairman of CBC Records, who hired him for publishing company April Music's A&R department. His first signing was the Psychedelic Furs. In 1982 he became the director of RCA Music Publishing. Two years later he became an A&R director for MCA Records. He set up PolyGram Music Publishing in 1986 and joined Polydor as GM of A&R and business affairs in 1993. He was promoted to managing director of Polydor in 1997, and had success with acts including Boyzone and the Lighthouse Family.[11] Since becoming chairman and Chief Executive of Universal Music in 2011, Grainge has overseen a strategy to increase Universal's digital distribution, international expansion and market leadership in both recorded music and publishing. Best-selling artists signed to Universal Music in recent years have included Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Jessie J, Amy Winehouse, Carly Rae Jepsen and Maroon 5.
Universal Music Group[edit]
Grainge became the chairman of the UK division of the Universal Music Group and later became chairman of Universal Music Group International in 2005. He served in this position until 2010. On 1 January 2011 he became CEO of the Universal Music Group and later became chairman on 9 March 2011. He succeeded Doug Morris who served as chairman and CEO since 1995.[12]
Grainge has been influential in Universal Music Group's international digital expansion by pioneering distribution models with a wide range of technology partners, including Apple, Spotify, BSkyB, Rdio, Virgin Media, Vodafone and 19 Entertainment.[13][14][15][16][17][18][19]
He recently established the licensed music service, One-Stop China, with Baidu, as well as a deal with B'IN to break Taiwanese acts on the mainland.[20] There is also an agreement in place with Reliance to start India's first mobile music service.[21]
Grainge also helped arrange the partnership between Bravado, Universal Music's entertainment merchandising division, and Tommy Hilfiger[22] and oversaw expansion for flagship classical labels Deutsche Grammophon and Decca Classics. He also put together the global strategic partnership with entertainment company Live Nation.[23]
Within his first year as chairman & CEO of Universal, he led the company in acquiring EMI's Recorded Music operations.[24] In doing so he argued that selling to Universal was the only way to make EMI better and thus lift the entire industry.[25] He made the revitalisation of former EMI labels such as Capitol Records and Virgin Records a key part of his strategy.[26] As a result of the EMI acquisition, "Grainge will go down as the master architect of what is likely to be the last big deal in the music business."[25]
In the EMI deal, UMG acquired the Beatles catalogue. UMG's merchandising division, Bravado, subsequently secured North American merchandising for the band.[27] UMG is now creating a "unified marketing strategy for the music and associated products of the most influential and beloved band in the history of music."[28] The wisdom of the acquisition was further illustrated by the quick success of the revitalized Capitol Music Group.[29] In 2015, Capitol earned all the major Grammy Awards for the year, with Sam Smith receiving Best New Artist, Record of the Year and Song of the Year awards and Beck winning Album of the Year.[30]
In 2013, Grainge partnered with Russell Simmons, Brian Robbins and Steve Rifkind to create All Def Music, the first major label-affiliated music company created specifically to sign, develop and promote artists on YouTube.[10] Russell Simmons called Grainge "the most innovative of music executives."[31]
UMG partnered with Samsung in the spring of 2013 to launch a music service in Africa called the Kleek, featuring the company's international catalogue, as well as local artists.[8]
Under Grainge's leadership, UMG has broken a string of records, becoming the first company in the US to have nine of the top 10 songs on the digital charts, according to SoundScan,[32] and weeks later, becoming the first company to hold all 10 of the top 10 spots on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[33] According to an industry insider, UMG's "enterprise value in 10 years stands to be closing in on $40 billion."[25]
In 2015, Grainge was featured in a documentary film that depicts the life and death of late British singer Amy Winehouse, entitled Amy, which was released theatrically in July.
In 2015, Vivendi announced that Grainge agreed to extend his tenure as UMG’s chairman and CEO until at least 2020, stating he was key to its strategy.[34] Under his leadership, UMG experienced growth in annual revenue, digital recorded music revenue and EBITDA.[35]
Personal life[edit]
In January 1993, Grainge married his first wife, attorney Samantha Berg. That November, she experienced complications while giving birth to their son Elliot, and fell into a coma from which she never recovered.[36] She died in England in 2007.[37]
In 2002 Grainge married his second wife, Caroline. Their daughter Alice was born in 2001. In November 2012 Grainge and his wife reportedly paid 13 million USD for a house in Pacific Palisades. They had previously leased a Brentwood home from the owner of Rhino Entertainment.[38]
His older brother was Nigel Grainge, the founder of Ensign Records.[39]
Industry honours and other achievements[edit]
In 2008, Grainge was honoured with the prestigious Music Industry Trusts’ Award, which recognises the world’s most influential and successful executives in music. Members of U2 presented him with the award, and other acts he was associated with, like Take That, performed.

Sir Lucian Charles Grainge, CBE, (born 29 February 1960)[1] is the chairman and chief executive officer of Universal Music Group. Over the course of his career, he has been instrumental in the careers of artists such as Amy Winehouse, ABBA, Eurythmics, Rihanna, Sam Smith, Take That, Psychedelic Furs, The Rolling Stones, Sting, U2, Jamie Cullum and Andrea Bocelli.[2][3][4] Grainge has worked in the music business for his entire career.[5] In 2013, 2015, and 2016, he topped Billboard Magazine’s “Power 100” list as the most powerful person in the music business, the only person to ever hold that distinction three times and the first to earn that position for consecutive years.[3][6][7]
Irving Azoff called him "'the great hope for the music business'" and Jimmy Iovine commented that Grainge "is working to restore [a] spirit of risk-taking and innovation" by being "'willing and open to entrepreneurship and that kind of thing the record industry has gotten depleted of.'"[8]
In an interview with Grainge, Billboard wrote: “If “power” means moving markets or greenlighting massive spends, Universal Music Group chairman Lucian Grainge demonstrated a staggering penchant for it when UMG completed its $1.9 billion acquisition of EMI’s recorded-music assets in September 2012. Grainge is a fierce and tireless advocate for the recorded-music business."[9] In 2013, CNET wrote that “Grainge is positioning Universal to lead the pack” of major labels in their embracing of new digital opportunities.[10] A 2014 front-page LA Times profile of Grainge said that "if anyone can save the music business, it might be Grainge."[8] In 2015, Billboard wrote, “in the age of Spotify, YouTube and Shazam, Grainge is positioned to tackle his business' overriding priority: win fair compensation for artists, and take full ownership of content that other parties have been profiting from.”[3]

Early life and career[edit]
Lucian Grainge grew up in north London. Grainge worked his way up in the London music scene after leaving Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School for Boys at the age of 18, when he began working as a runner at a talent scout company called MPC.[5] After calling several record label heads from the Music Week directory, he got through to Maurice Oberstein, the chairman of CBC Records, who hired him for publishing company April Music's A&R department. His first signing was the Psychedelic Furs. In 1982 he became the director of RCA Music Publishing. Two years later he became an A&R director for MCA Records. He set up PolyGram Music Publishing in 1986 and joined Polydor as GM of A&R and business affairs in 1993. He was promoted to managing director of Polydor in 1997, and had success with acts including Boyzone and the Lighthouse Family.[11] Since becoming chairman and Chief Executive of Universal Music in 2011, Grainge has overseen a strategy to increase Universal's digital distribution, international expansion and market leadership in both recorded music and publishing. Best-selling artists signed to Universal Music in recent years have included Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Jessie J, Amy Winehouse, Carly Rae Jepsen and Maroon 5.
Universal Music Group[edit]
Grainge became the chairman of the UK division of the Universal Music Group and later became chairman of Universal Music Group International in 2005. He served in this position until 2010. On 1 January 2011 he became CEO of the Universal Music Group and later became chairman on 9 March 2011. He succeeded Doug Morris who served as chairman and CEO since 1995.[12]
Grainge has been influential in Universal Music Group's international digital expansion by pioneering distribution models with a wide range of technology partners, including Apple, Spotify, BSkyB, Rdio, Virgin Media, Vodafone and 19 Entertainment.[13][14][15][16][17][18][19]
He recently established the licensed music service, One-Stop China, with Baidu, as well as a deal with B'IN to break Taiwanese acts on the mainland.[20] There is also an agreement in place with Reliance to start India's first mobile music service.[21]
Grainge also helped arrange the partnership between Bravado, Universal Music's entertainment merchandising division, and Tommy Hilfiger[22] and oversaw expansion for flagship classical labels Deutsche Grammophon and Decca Classics. He also put together the global strategic partnership with entertainment company Live Nation.[23]
Within his first year as chairman & CEO of Universal, he led the company in acquiring EMI's Recorded Music operations.[24] In doing so he argued that selling to Universal was the only way to make EMI better and thus lift the entire industry.[25] He made the revitalisation of former EMI labels such as Capitol Records and Virgin Records a key part of his strategy.[26] As a result of the EMI acquisition, "Grainge will go down as the master architect of what is likely to be the last big deal in the music business."[25]
In the EMI deal, UMG acquired the Beatles catalogue. UMG's merchandising division, Bravado, subsequently secured North American merchandising for the band.[27] UMG is now creating a "unified marketing strategy for the music and associated products of the most influential and beloved band in the history of music."[28] The wisdom of the acquisition was further illustrated by the quick success of the revitalized Capitol Music Group.[29] In 2015, Capitol earned all the major Grammy Awards for the year, with Sam Smith receiving Best New Artist, Record of the Year and Song of the Year awards and Beck winning Album of the Year.[30]
In 2013, Grainge partnered with Russell Simmons, Brian Robbins and Steve Rifkind to create All Def Music, the first major label-affiliated music company created specifically to sign, develop and promote artists on YouTube.[10] Russell Simmons called Grainge "the most innovative of music executives."[31]
UMG partnered with Samsung in the spring of 2013 to launch a music service in Africa called the Kleek, featuring the company's international catalogue, as well as local artists.[8]
Under Grainge's leadership, UMG has broken a string of records, becoming the first company in the US to have nine of the top 10 songs on the digital charts, according to SoundScan,[32] and weeks later, becoming the first company to hold all 10 of the top 10 spots on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[33] According to an industry insider, UMG's "enterprise value in 10 years stands to be closing in on $40 billion."[25]
In 2015, Grainge was featured in a documentary film that depicts the life and death of late British singer Amy Winehouse, entitled Amy, which was released theatrically in July.
In 2015, Vivendi announced that Grainge agreed to extend his tenure as UMG’s chairman and CEO until at least 2020, stating he was key to its strategy.[34] Under his leadership, UMG experienced growth in annual revenue, digital recorded music revenue and EBITDA.[35]
Personal life[edit]
In January 1993, Grainge married his first wife, attorney Samantha Berg. That November, she experienced complications while giving birth to their son Elliot, and fell into a coma from which she never recovered.[36] She died in England in 2007.[37]
In 2002 Grainge married his second wife, Caroline. Their daughter Alice was born in 2001. In November 2012 Grainge and his wife reportedly paid 13 million USD for a house in Pacific Palisades. They had previously leased a Brentwood home from the owner of Rhino Entertainment.[38]
His older brother was Nigel Grainge, the founder of Ensign Records.[39]
Industry honours and other achievements[edit]
In 2008, Grainge was honoured with the prestigious Music Industry Trusts’ Award, which recognises the world’s most influential and successful executives in music. Members of U2 presented him with the award, and other acts he was associated with, like Take That, performed.
Grainge was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2010 New Year Honours for services to the creative industries.[40] In 2012, UK Prime Minister David Cameron appointed him as a British Business Ambassador.[41] He was knighted in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to British business and inward investment.[42] He was inaugurated to appointment to the Order of the British Empire and Knight Bachelor by Prince William on November 29, 2016.[43]
Grainge is a Trustee of The American Friends of The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. http://www.royalfoundation.com/contact-us/
In 2013, he received the Humanitarian Award from The Foundation for Ethnic Understanding. That same year, UMG was honoured with a SAG-AFTRA American Scene Award, recognising the company's commitment to diversity as exemplified by its "entire catalog and roster of artists."[44] In 2014, he was awarded the President's Merit Award ("Icon Award") by the Recording Academy in recognition of his significant contributions to the music industry.[45][46] In 2015, he will receive the Spirit of Life Award from the City of Hope, recognizing his outstanding achievements in business and his dedication to philanthropic causes.[47]
Grainge serves on the boards of Lionsgate and Northeastern University.[48][49]
In October 2016, Variety presented Grainge with its 2016 Empowerment Award for overseeing a "noticeable shift in the demographics of the industry leader’s C-suites” with women occupying some of the highest executive positions at Universal Music Group.[50]
In May 2017 the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity announced that Grainge would be honored as the 2017 Media Person of the Year. He is the first music executive to be recognized since the award was launched in 1999.[51]
He was awarded an honorary doctorate of music by the Berklee College of Music in May 2016[52] and an honorary doctorate of global commerce by Northeastern University in May of 2017.[53]

Best-selling artists signed to Universal Music in recent years have included Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Jessie J, Amy Winehouse, Carly Rae Jepsen and Maroon 5.
Universal Music Group[edit]
Grainge became the chairman of the UK division of the Universal Music Group and later became chairman of Universal Music Group International in 2005. He served in this position until 2010. On 1 January 2011 he became CEO of the Universal Music Group and later became chairman on 9 March 2011. He succeeded Doug Morris who served as chairman and CEO since 1995.[12]
Grainge has been influential in Universal Music Group's international digital expansion by pioneering distribution models with a wide range of technology partners, including Apple, Spotify, BSkyB, Rdio, Virgin Media, Vodafone and 19 Entertainment.[13][14][15][16][17][18][19]
He recently established the licensed music service, One-Stop China, with Baidu, as well as a deal with B'IN to break Taiwanese acts on the mainland.[20] There is also an agreement in place with Reliance to start India's first mobile music service.[21]
Grainge also helped arrange the partnership between Bravado, Universal Music's entertainment merchandising division, and Tommy Hilfiger[22] and oversaw expansion for flagship classical labels Deutsche Grammophon and Decca Classics. He also put together the global strategic partnership with entertainment company Live Nation.[23]
Within his first year as chairman & CEO of Universal, he led the company in acquiring EMI's Recorded Music operations.[24] In doing so he argued that selling to Universal was the only way to make EMI better and thus lift the entire industry.[25] He made the revitalisation of former EMI labels such as Capitol Records and Virgin Records a key part of his strategy.[26] As a result of the EMI acquisition, "Grainge will go down as the master architect of what is likely to be the last big deal in the music business."[25]
In the EMI deal, UMG acquired the Beatles catalogue. UMG's merchandising division, Bravado, subsequently secured North American merchandising for the band.[27] UMG is now creating a "unified marketing strategy for the music and associated products of the most influential and beloved band in the history of music."[28] The wisdom of the acquisition was further illustrated by the quick success of the revitalized Capitol Music Group.[29] In 2015, Capitol earned all the major Grammy Awards for the year, with Sam Smith receiving Best New Artist, Record of the Year and Song of the Year awards and Beck winning Album of the Year.[30]
In 2013, Grainge partnered with Russell Simmons, Brian Robbins and Steve Rifkind to create All Def Music, the first major label-affiliated music company created specifically to sign, develop and promote artists on YouTube.[10] Russell Simmons called Grainge "the most innovative of music executives."[31]
UMG partnered with Samsung in the spring of 2013 to launch a music service in Africa called the Kleek, featuring the company's international catalogue, as well as local artists.[8]
Under Grainge's leadership, UMG has broken a string of records, becoming the first company in the US to have nine of the top 10 songs on the digital charts, according to SoundScan,[32] and weeks later, becoming the first company to hold all 10 of the top 10 spots on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[33] According to an industry insider, UMG's "enterprise value in 10 years stands to be closing in on $40 billion."[25]
In 2015, Grainge was featured in a documentary film that depicts the life and death of late British singer Amy Winehouse, entitled Amy, which was released theatrically in July.
In 2015, Vivendi announced that Grainge agreed to extend his tenure as UMG’s chairman and CEO until at least 2020, stating he was key to its strategy.[34] Under his leadership, UMG experienced growth in annual revenue, digital recorded music revenue and EBITDA.[35]
Personal life[edit]
In January 1993, Grainge married his first wife, attorney Samantha Berg. That November, she experienced complications while giving birth to their son Elliot, and fell into a coma from which she never recovered.[36] She died in England in 2007.[37]
In 2002 Grainge married his second wife, Caroline. Their daughter Alice was born in 2001. In November 2012 Grainge and his wife reportedly paid 13 million USD for a house in Pacific Palisades. They had previously leased a Brentwood home from the owner of Rhino Entertainment.[38]
His older brother was Nigel Grainge, the founder of Ensign Records.[39]
Industry honours and other achievements[edit]
In 2008, Grainge was honoured with the prestigious Music Industry Trusts’ Award, which recognises the world’s most influential and successful executives in music. Members of U2 presented him with the award, and other acts he was associated with, like Take That, performed.
Grainge was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2010 New Year Honours for services to the creative industries.[40] In 2012, UK Prime Minister David Cameron appointed him as a British Business Ambassador.[41] He was knighted in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to British business and inward investment.[42] He was inaugurated to appointment to the Order of the British Empire and Knight Bachelor by Prince William on November 29, 2016.[43]
Grainge is a Trustee of The American Friends of The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. http://www.royalfoundation.com/contact-us/
In 2013, he received the Humanitarian Award from The Foundation for Ethnic Understanding. That same year, UMG was honoured with a SAG-AFTRA American Scene Award, recognising the company's commitment to diversity as exemplified by its "entire catalog and roster of artists."[44] In 2014, he was awarded the President's Merit Award ("Icon Award") by the Recording Academy in recognition of his significant contributions to the music industry.[45][46] In 2015, he will receive the Spirit of Life Award from the City of Hope, recognizing his outstanding achievements in business and his dedication to philanthropic causes.[47]
Grainge serves on the boards of Lionsgate and Northeastern University.[48][49]
In October 2016, Variety presented Grainge with its 2016 Empowerment Award for overseeing a "noticeable shift in the demographics of the industry leader’s C-suites” with women occupying some of the highest executive positions at Universal Music Group.[50]
In May 2017 the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity announced that Grainge would be honored as the 2017 Media Person of the Year. He is the first music executive to be recognized since the award was launched in 1999.[51]
He was awarded an honorary doctorate of music by the Berklee College of Music in May 2016[52] and an honorary doctorate of global commerce by Northeastern University in May of 2017.[53]

Sir Lucian Charles Grainge, CBE, (born 29 February 1960)[1] is the chairman and chief executive officer of Universal Music Group. Over the course of his career, he has been instrumental in the careers of artists such as Amy Winehouse, ABBA, Eurythmics, Rihanna, Sam Smith, Take That, Psychedelic Furs, The Rolling Stones, Sting, U2, Jamie Cullum and Andrea Bocelli.[2][3][4] Grainge has worked in the music business for his entire career.[5] In 2013, 2015, and 2016, he topped Billboard Magazine’s “Power 100” list as the most powerful person in the music business, the only person to ever hold that distinction three times and the first to earn that position for consecutive years.[3][6][7]
Irving Azoff called him "'the great hope for the music business'" and Jimmy Iovine commented that Grainge "is working to restore [a] spirit of risk-taking and innovation" by being "'willing and open to entrepreneurship and that kind of thing the record industry has gotten depleted of.'"[8]
In an interview with Grainge, Billboard wrote: “If “power” means moving markets or greenlighting massive spends, Universal Music Group chairman Lucian Grainge demonstrated a staggering penchant for it when UMG completed its $1.9 billion acquisition of EMI’s recorded-music assets in September 2012. Grainge is a fierce and tireless advocate for the recorded-music business."[9] In 2013, CNET wrote that “Grainge is positioning Universal to lead the pack” of major labels in their embracing of new digital opportunities.[10] A 2014 front-page LA Times profile of Grainge said that "if anyone can save the music business, it might be Grainge."[8] In 2015, Billboard wrote, “in the age of Spotify, YouTube and Shazam, Grainge is positioned to tackle his business' overriding priority: win fair compensation for artists, and take full ownership of content that other parties have been profiting from.”[3]

Early life and career[edit]
Lucian Grainge grew up in north London. Grainge worked his way up in the London music scene after leaving Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School for Boys at the age of 18, when he began working as a runner at a talent scout company called MPC.[5] After calling several record label heads from the Music Week directory, he got through to Maurice Oberstein, the chairman of CBC Records, who hired him for publishing company April Music's A&R department. His first signing was the Psychedelic Furs. In 1982 he became the director of RCA Music Publishing. Two years later he became an A&R director for MCA Records. He set up PolyGram Music Publishing in 1986 and joined Polydor as GM of A&R and business affairs in 1993. He was promoted to managing director of Polydor in 1997, and had success with acts including Boyzone and the Lighthouse Family.[11] Since becoming chairman and Chief Executive of Universal Music in 2011, Grainge has overseen a strategy to increase Universal's digital distribution, international expansion and market leadership in both recorded music and publishing. Best-selling artists signed to Universal Music in recent years have included Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Jessie J, Amy Winehouse, Carly Rae Jepsen and Maroon 5.
Universal Music Group[edit]
Grainge became the chairman of the UK division of the Universal Music Group and later became chairman of Universal Music Group International in 2005. He served in this position until 2010. On 1 January 2011 he became CEO of the Universal Music Group and later became chairman on 9 March 2011. He succeeded Doug Morris who served as chairman and CEO since 1995.[12]
Grainge has been influential in Universal Music Group's international digital expansion by pioneering distribution models with a wide range of technology partners, including Apple, Spotify, BSkyB, Rdio, Virgin Media, Vodafone and 19 Entertainment.[13][14][15][16][17][18][19]

Lucian Grainge Convinces Jay Z to Join Universal





















– 
Grainge,    a thirty year veteran of the pop music business who has developed the careers of some of the industry’s legends,    may have succeeded in pulling off his most major coup to date by convincing Jay Z,    one of pop music’s top stars and entrepreneurs  to sign for  Universal Music  which he heads.

/ By Yoel Bermant /
Despite being just in his early fifties,    Lucian Grainge has been one of the key players in the music industry for more than thirty years helping to guide the careers of such international superstars ranging from Amy Winehouse to ABBA,    Sting to Andrea Bocelli,    with countless others in between.
Many music industry observers are saying that Grainge may have pulled off its greatest deal yet by convincing a certain Shawn Corey Carter,    known to all followers of rap music as Jay-Z. Jay-Z’s music style is described as American rap,    yet he is much more than just a simple rapper,    with talents including being a record producer and music industry entrepreneur in his own right. Jay-Z has succeeded in reaching a  net worth estimated to be approaching five hundred million dollars,    much of it gained from recording,    producing and managing the careers of a number of other prominent singers in the rap genre through his Roc Nation record label .
Under Jay-Z’s  leadership,    Roc Nation that has become one of the most successful brands in today’s pop music culture,    earning a tremendous reputation for discovering and developing many of the music industry’s current most impressive and prolific record selling talents
For the last four years the multi-million Roc Nation record label have had their records distributed through Epic Publishing,    part of the  Sony Music group. However thanks to the persuasive powers of Lucian Grainge,    Universal Music’s chairman and chief executive,    Roc Nation’s music will now be distributed under the Universal label after the recent signing of  a long term deal that will cover global distribution of all of the recording released by Roc Nation.
Although no financial details have been released as yet both Grainge and Jay Z were both reported to be highly satisfied with the terms of the agreement,    described as a “a new age deal”,    that according to Jay Z will provide the Roc Nation record label with a unique opportunity. That of being able to continue to operate as an independent label while enjoying the strength,    power and reach of one of the music industry’s best run and best managed recording companies
The agreement with the Roc Nation record label marks another significant victory for Universal Music,    part of the Vivendi group,    now sitting on top as the world’s largest music company,    after recently acquiring most of EMI’s record label in a $1.9 billion deal that left Universal with the recording rights of a huge number of music industry legends of the past and present.

Lucian Grainge was born and raised in the North of London and began his musical career immediately after leaving high school in 1978. After learning the basics of industry and deciding that this is where his future lay,    the young Grainge got his first real break when he convinced Maurice Oberstein,    at that time head of CBS Records,    that he had the talent to make it big in the music business.
Oberstein apparently was impressed and found an opening for Lucian in the A&R department of one of CBS’s minor publishing companies. That was all the help that was needed to get Grainge’s career underway and by the early Eighties he was already rapidly climbing up the ladder of success in the music publishing business.
By the late nineties was appointed to the post of managing director of the Polydor record label where he remained for fourteen years before being appointed to the post of Chairman and Chief Executive of Universal Music in 2011.

Sir Lucian Grainge


Sir Lucian Grainge is Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of Universal Music Group (UMG), the world leader in music-based entertainment.
Grainge has spent his entire career in the music industry and has signed and worked with many worldwide stars, including ABBA, Elton John, Jay Z, Katy Perry, Queen, Rihanna, The Rolling Stones, Sam Smith, U2 and Amy Winehouse, among many others. Over the span of three decades, he has not only pioneered new approaches to the signing and development of the world’s most successful recording artists and songwriters but he has consistently championed the development of innovative business models and partnerships with a wide range of technology and media partners around the world. His inspiring leadership has been recognized as having laid the foundation for a return to growth in recent years of an industry that had been suffering more than a decade of decline.
Grainge joined Universal Music in 1986 to launch PolyGram Music Publishing UK. Within five years, he had led the fledgling division to become one of the top three publishing companies in the UK. Grainge joined UMG’s Polydor in 1993 as General Manager of A&R and Business Affairs, rising to Managing Director of the British record label in 1997. He was subsequently appointed Deputy Chairman, and then, in 2001, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Universal Music UK. In 2005, he was named Chairman and Chief Executive of Universal Music Group International, gaining oversight of global operations outside the U.S. Grainge was appointed CEO of UMG in 2010 and promoted in 2011 to Chairman and CEO. During his leadership, Grainge has dramatically improved the financial performance of UMG by significantly increasing the company’s revenues and profitability.  In 2011, he led UMG’s successful acquisition of the recorded music assets of the legendary British music company EMI, revitalizing its iconic Capitol Records, and, in the process, further strengthening UMG’s position as the global leader in music. Under his leadership, the company set numerous creative records including being the first music company with nine of the top 10 songs on Billboard’s Digital Songs chart and the first music company to score all 10 of the top 10 spots on the Billboard Hot 100.
Grainge has been recognized for his many achievements throughout the years. In 2016, 2015 and 2013, he topped Billboard Magazine’s “Power 100” as the most powerful executive in the music business, the only person to hold that distinction three times and for consecutive years. In 2016, Berklee College of Music presented Grainge with an honorary doctor of music degree, in 2015 he received the Spirit of Life Award from City of Hope and in 2014, he was awarded the President’s Merit Award by The Recording Academy. In 2008, he was awarded the prestigious Music Industry Trusts’ Award. A native of London, Sir Lucian was bestowed with a knighthood in 2016 by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in the Queen’s 90th Birthday Honours list for accomplishments in the music industry and leadership through its challenging times, contributions to British business and inward investment, as well as his development of innovative business models, technology and media partnerships that have expanded UMG’s global presence. For his service to global creative industries, he was recognized in Britain’s New Years Honors and awarded Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2010  and in 2011 he was made an Officier des Arts et Lettres by the French Government.  In 2013, UK Prime Minister David Cameron appointed him as a British Business Ambassador. In 2011, he was named a Trustee of the American Friends of the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Grainge serves on the boards of Lionsgate and Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts.
He lives in Los Angeles with his wife and children.

NO. 2
Lucian Grainge

Chairman/CEO, Universal Music Group
 


He gambled everything for EMI and now looks set to win bigger than previously imagined
 If anyone in the music business still has any doubt about the wisdom of Lucian Grainge’s career-defining decision to risk his stellar reputation by bidding for EMI in 2012, consider this: Just 10 months after the deal closed, Universal Music Group (UMG) parent Vivendi received a whopping bid of $8.5 billion to buy the music behemoth and was able to turn it down. Media assets are typically valued at around six to seven times operating profits. By that valuation metric the bid was about $2 billion higher than would typically be expected.
But that was the bet Grainge was making all along. Like anyone else in this business he is acutely aware of the struggles the industry has faced for the last decade in a state of seemingly permanent decline—perhaps more so, as you would be if you were responsible for the livelihoods of 7,500 employees and more than 3,000 artists. But as a true music man to his core, he has never stopped believing in the return to growth for the industry, and others are starting to believe.
“Every morning when I wake up I realize the consumer has total choice,” Grainge says. “We don’t have the divine right to expect consumers to buy our product. Yet after all is said and done, I believe the industry will return to the level of growth that we’ve hoped for and have been fighting for for the last 10 years.” 
Grainge isn’t interested in specifying what that level of growth is—his point is that the last 10 years have been the opposite of growth. And for him, there are many reasons for optimism.
As music business revenue opportunities continue to diversify away from a reliance on retail to areas more beloved by investors—subscription services, digital platforms with access to youth and high-margin brand partnerships—the value of music assets will at worst hold steady, but more than likely appreciate.
Grainge has almost guaranteed that UMG, as an all-dominant market leader, will benefit disproportionately from the rebound. It’s a key reason why the July bid from Japan’s Softbank was so high. It’s also the reason why even some of those who publicly objected to the bid at the time now privately admit Grainge made the right move.
When thinking about Grainge’s vision—and the determination and power it took to realize it—it’s important to remember just how controversial UMG’s offer for EMI was. It drew strong objections from several quarters of the business, which balked at a company that already possessed more than 30% market share being allowed to take another 10%. Grainge had to make his case before a congressional committee in a testy performance that some felt might derail the deal. It was such a risky bid that Grainge was under intense pressure that spilled over into his press encounters even after the deal was approved. But talking to Grainge a year later is revealing. Success seems to have humbled him as he marvels at how well his team has integrated the main EMI assets (Capitol and Virgin) that they retained in such a short period of time.

 Sir Lucian Grainge honoured in Cannes as Media Person Of The Year - Music Business Worldwide                      Music Business Worldwide      Sir Lucian Grainge honoured in Cannes as Media Person Of The Year              0 shares  June 22, 2017By Rhian JonesSir Lucian Grainge paid tribute to his late brother, Nigel Grainge, and discussed the changing nature of the music business during an acceptance speech for his Media Person of the Year Award 2017 at Cannes Lions yesterday.The UMG chief is the first music executive to be honoured with the award, which was presented by Cannes Lions CEO Philip Thomas at the annual conference for the advertising industry in Cannes.Launched in 1999, the honour is given to an individual who has shaped the future of media through leadership and innovation.Philip said: “Sir Lucian is the first music executive to be honoured since this award was first introduced, which says much about the convergence of entertainment with marketing and advertising. “A champion of new business models and fresh approaches, Sir Lucian is widely credited for laying the foundation that has led to the music industry’s recent return to growth after nearly a decade of decline.”philip thomas, cannes lions “A champion of new business models and fresh approaches, Sir Lucian is widely credited for laying the foundation that has led to the music industry’s recent return to growth after nearly a decade of decline. “He’s worked with global stars that include the likes of Elton John, Jay Z, Amy Winehouse, ABBA, The Rolling Stones and Queen and during his tenure at Universal Music Group he’s transformed the company into a world leader in music based entertainment.“Sir Lucian has been described as the great hope for the music business, has been widely praised for his risk taking and innovation, forging partnerships with a wide range of technology and media platforms including Apple, Spotify and Amazon.”You can read Grainge’s acceptance speech in full below.Thank you very much for that, and thank you Philip, I am deeply honoured for this award and also that I am the first member of the music industry to be here. That means a great deal to me and all of us.No talent scout, no artist, no band, no label, no CEO, no creative executive ever succeeds on their own, and today I’d like to humbly thank those who made it possible for me to stand before you, including obviously, all of our recording artists and our songwriters.  My incredible team at Universal Music including all our label heads, our A&R team, our CEO’s and our broader Vivendi family, in particular Vincent Bolloré, whose support and belief for me and us and the entire team has enabled us to achieve the kind of success and what we are trying to achieve in the transformation of this business.As a kid who started out as a talent scout, my job has since changed in many ways. While our labels seek out great new talent, today I scout for brands and digital platforms and new forms of technology as well as great people to collectively work on behalf of our artists.Bearing that in mind I am very proud to report that at Universal we’re engaging a completely new generation of music lovers around the world on a scale that we’ve never seen.Our business, our connectivity, all that we do has to be about the music, and the quality of the music and the creativity is what connects all of us. That is our key focus.At Lions, I have been incredibly inspired by what I’ve seen and the people I’ve met, by the diverse talents, even the presentations and the awards that have been given so far this evening…fabulous.Everyone’s innovation and enthusiasm…that excites me and I’m sure it excites all of us in terms of all the things we can do together, so I thank you for that.On one last note, I hope you don’t mind. I lost someone in my family last week and this is a big award for me, my older brother Nigel, who was a great music executive, so I’d like to dedicate this award on my behalf to my brother.Music Business WorldwideNews France Cannes Lions Sir Lucian GraingeRelated Posts   Despacito breaks all-time streaming records with 4.6bn plays in 6 months    Apple Music’s growth is getting faster… but it can’t quite keep up with Spotify    Vivendi sponsors Cannes Lions    Sir Lucian Grainge named Cannes Lions Media Person Of The Year 2017         Popular Articles  'There are 365m people in China willing to pay for entertainment.
