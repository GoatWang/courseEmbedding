DSOX-20 and NJORD
The Worlds Most Advanced Emission Control Solution

 







Earth Changing Performance
Our DSOX-20 fuel scrubber is a pre-combustion desulfurization system, which utilizes our proprietary and proven technology as its foundation. By integrating this proven platform with additional new proprietary technologies, which react and release the sulfur in the fuel, our DSOX-20 system is able to scrub and wash the sulfur from the fuel.
 

 






 

NJORD Exhaust Gas Scrubber System
The NJORD exhaust gas scrubber is the latest addition to our emission control solution for the maritime industry. NJORD is a hybrid exhaust gas scrubber that can operate in either in a closed loop configuration or as an open loop configuration. Adding to its flexibility, Triton’s NJORD can be used either as a standalone solution or as a complement to the DSOX-20  fuel desulfurization system.

 

 








Clean You Can Bank On
With our DSOX-20 technology we have found a way to make this happen. As a byproduct the system also removes other harmful alkali metals such as vanadium, sodium and calcium. The DSOX-20 system works by creating an emulsion of fuel and process water, which is injected into the unit under high pressure. This process releases the sulfur from the fuel making it possible to mix with the water. Upon completion of the mixing step, the wash water is separated out in the regular purification system. In order to minimize the use of chemicals, our process is undertaken in 2 steps, utilizing the reused process water in the
initial cleaning step. 
 

 

 







DSOX-20 TOUR
Triton Emission Solutions proudly presents a tour of a full scale DSOX system currently installed and running on a cruise ship.    

 










PST-200
The PST-200 is a patented system designed to significantly reduce the maintenance cost and premature failure of gas turbines by removing alkali metals in the fuel stock prior to combustion.

The elimination of salt, calcium and other alkali metal substances in the fuel stock by the PST-200 significantly reduces and in many cases eliminates the high temperature corrosion and premature failure in gas turbine engine components caused by the high temperature corrosion process. 
 

 

 


Small Footprint
Big Benefits

 









Exhaust Gas Heat Reduction
The DSOX-20 increases the ship’s exhaust gas boiler efficiency, removing excess heat from the exhaust gases, without risking corrosion of the boiler tubes.




Discharging Waste Water
The DSOX-20 system allows vessels to operate in all waters with sulfur emission controls, including all upcoming ECA’s. The resulting waste water can be processed as bilge water and discharged at sea or while landed in ports.




Onboard Chemical Manufacturing
We have now developed a system without the need to bunker chemicals as they will be manufactured onboard. Only the activator and emulsifier will be added to the system.




Compact Size
Our fuel purification system takes less space and weighs less than any existing scrubber on the market. Because of its compact size it can easily be installed while the vessel is in service.





Low Energy Consumption
Lower use of electricity substantially reduces operating costs, when compared to the use of existing exhaust scrubber technologies.




Reduced Installation Expense
Installation expenditures are lower than those of competitors since it can be installed while a vessel is in service.








THE BASICS – WHAT YOU GET WITH OUR PRODUCT
Our Solution not only reduces the sulfur emissions but offers numerous beneficial byproducts on installation and while in production.



 


The Right Kind of Clean Energy

0
Global Required Ships
Each ship must comply with the new directive of .1% within the ECA’s or they can be fined $25,000 per day for non-compliance.




.0
DSOX-20 Sulfur Level
We anticipate that our solution will satisfy both the 2015 requirement, as well as the 2020 global requirement of .5%




0

Which equals 260 times all car emissions worldwide, and Triton plans to put a big dent in that.

Making the Earth a Better Place

 

a little bit about us



who we are
A team of world renown engineers who are driven by innovation and the urge to create ground breaking products that reduce toxic emissions.


what we do
Our engineers work countless hours to build proprietary products that reduce harmful chemical emissions into the ocean and atmosphere.


why we do it
We love it and because we know that by investing our efforts now we can benefit the future generations to come.


since when
Triton Emission Solutions Inc was founded in 2012 with Rasmus Norling leading our emissions abatement technology.








 

 


a short history



Triton Emission Solutions Inc has developed a fuel desulfurization system called the DSOX-20 Fuel Purification System, which we expect will satisfy all the upcoming sulfur caps and provide for full compliance with the mandatory regulations. 

A competitive product analysis reveals that no other system has been developed that is able to match our scrubber system in performance, size and weight, installation, or cost efficiency. With its low unit price, energy optimization characteristics, and ease of installation, our DSOX-20 Fuel Purification System is the most financially feasible fuel desulfurization system available in the worldwide market.

Our competitors have invested millions of dollars developing marine exhaust emissions abatement systems, leading only to cost inefficient and impractical solutions. Triton Emission Solutions proprietary technology provides the only viable solution with the following differentiating characteristics:
 Triton Emission Solutions Inc provides the marine exhaust emissions abatement industry with the following solutions:

Proprietary technology
Most innovative, smallest and lightest fuel purification system available
Options for exhaust emission abatement, exhaust or fuel purification systems for more customer flexibility
Marine industry expertise
Industry associations and established professional network
