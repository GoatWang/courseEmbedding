We've Got Answers

Is my money safe?
What’s the minimum required to earn interest?
How is this different from a savings account?
How can I maximize my earnings?
Is it easy to access and move my money?





Yes. Your deposits will be FDIC insured up to the maximum ($250K) allowed by law. We offer products and
                        across the country, and we employ a wide range of security measures to ensure the safety of your digital information. EverBank has also received industry recognition for safety and financial strength from a number of respected sources.


EverBank & TIAAPlease note: EverBank® is a division of TIAA, FSB. TIAA, FSB also offers deposit accounts through its TIAA Direct® division. EverBank and TIAA Direct accounts are considered together when determining deposit insurance coverage under applicable FDIC regulations.

No minimum is required to earn interest. However, a $5,000 minimum deposit is required to open the account.1 Check out the compare & calculate section above to see just how much interest you could earn in your first year.
There are a few important differences between a savings and money market account. While both are easy to open, FDIC-insured, and fall under specific transaction rules9, their features may be different. For instance, money market funds are usually more accessible (via debit cards, ATM withdrawals, checks and electronic transfers) than funds in a traditional savings account.
Our 1-year intro APY is available on balances up to $250,000 for first-time money market clients.1 If depositing more than this amount, consider opening a companion Yield Pledge Checking Account. This account offers the same 1-year intro APY on balances up to $250,000 for first-time checking clients. Many of our new clients choose to maximize their first year earnings by opening both accounts.

Keep in mind this is a money market account so standard transaction limitations will apply. You may make up to six transfers or withdrawals per month without incurring a fee.9 But yes, it’s easy to access your money, including at ATMs across the country.
Speaking of ATMs, we’ve got your back when it comes to fees. First, we’ll never charge you a fee. And if you keep $5,000 or more in your account, we’ll even reimburse you for all ATM fees charged by other U.S. banks.5
As for making deposits, choose from a range of convenient solutions such as mobile check deposits6 via our mobile app, by online transfer or by simply mailing us a check. Use our mobile app to stay connected to your money anytime, anywhere.













Important Disclosures

The Yield Pledge® Money Market Account is a tiered, variable rate account, unless it was opened prior to 11/06/2016, in which case it is a variable rate account but not tiered. The quoted Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) are accurate as of 7/21/2017 12:00:00 AM. A fixed, 1-year introductory APY is available for first-time Yield Pledge Money Market account holders on balances up to $250,000. The 1-year introductory APY for balances (i) up to $250,000 is 1.21%, and (ii) from $250,000.01 to $10,000,000 is best expressed as a range: 1.21% to 0.72%. Otherwise the variable ongoing APY applies (by balance tier, if applicable). Ongoing APYs and tiers may change without notice. If your average daily balance is within a tier, then your entire balance will have that corresponding APY, except as described above for the 1-year introductory APY. Current ongoing APYs and tiers are: 0.71% for $100,000 - $10,000,000; 0.71% for $50,000 - $99,999.99; 0.71% for $25,000 - $49,999.99; 0.71% for $10,000 - $24,999.99; and 0.71% for balances under $10,000. For accounts opened prior to 11/06/2016, the current ongoing APY for balances up to $10,000,000 is 0.71%. Higher balances are accepted. Accounts opened and initially funded with money transferred from another EverBank account are not eligible for the 1-year introductory APY. The required minimum opening deposit is $5,000. Fees may reduce earnings.
EverBank promises that the yield on your Yield Pledge® Checking and/or Money Market Account will stay in the Top 5% of Competitive Accounts based on Bankrate Monitor National Index survey data from the last week of each month. "Competitive Accounts" are similar accounts from the 10 largest banks and thrifts in 10 large U.S. banking markets. This includes data from the 5 largest banks and 5 largest thrifts in each market, except in markets without 5 banks and 5 thrifts. Each week Bankrate.com surveys these institutions and distributes its results on a paid subscription basis. Not all institutions report each week. EverBank reserves the right to change its Yield Pledge calculation method as necessary to accommodate changes in Bankrate's survey methodology at any time.

We've Got Answers


If you’re interested in opening a Yield Pledge Money Market Account but still have a question or two, we can help. Select from the frequently asked questions below, or call us at 1.855.242.7405 to learn more. Then open an account today so you can start earning top 5% yields2 with total peace of mind.





Is my money safe?
What’s the minimum required to earn interest?
How is this different from a savings account?
How can I maximize my earnings?
Is it easy to access and move my money?





Yes. Your deposits will be FDIC insured up to the maximum ($250K) allowed by law. We offer products and
                        across the country, and we employ a wide range of security measures to ensure the safety of your digital information. EverBank has also received industry recognition for safety and financial strength from a number of respected sources.


EverBank & TIAAPlease note: EverBank® is a division of TIAA, FSB. TIAA, FSB also offers deposit accounts through its TIAA Direct® division. EverBank and TIAA Direct accounts are considered together when determining deposit insurance coverage under applicable FDIC regulations.

No minimum is required to earn interest. However, a $5,000 minimum deposit is required to open the account.1 Check out the compare & calculate section above to see just how much interest you could earn in your first year.
There are a few important differences between a savings and money market account. While both are easy to open, FDIC-insured, and fall under specific transaction rules9, their features may be different. For instance, money market funds are usually more accessible (via debit cards, ATM withdrawals, checks and electronic transfers) than funds in a traditional savings account.
Our 1-year intro APY is available on balances up to $250,000 for first-time money market clients.1 If depositing more than this amount, consider opening a companion Yield Pledge Checking Account. This account offers the same 1-year intro APY on balances up to $250,000 for first-time checking clients. Many of our new clients choose to maximize their first year earnings by opening both accounts.

Keep in mind this is a money market account so standard transaction limitations will apply. You may make up to six transfers or withdrawals per month without incurring a fee.9 But yes, it’s easy to access your money, including at ATMs across the country.
Speaking of ATMs, we’ve got your back when it comes to fees. First, we’ll never charge you a fee. And if you keep $5,000 or more in your account, we’ll even reimburse you for all ATM fees charged by other U.S. banks.5
As for making deposits, choose from a range of convenient solutions such as mobile check deposits6 via our mobile app, by online transfer or by simply mailing us a check. Use our mobile app to stay connected to your money anytime, anywhere.













Important Disclosures

The Yield Pledge® Money Market Account is a tiered, variable rate account, unless it was opened prior to 11/06/2016, in which case it is a variable rate account but not tiered. The quoted Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) are accurate as of 7/21/2017 12:00:00 AM. A fixed, 1-year introductory APY is available for first-time Yield Pledge Money Market account holders on balances up to $250,000. The 1-year introductory APY for balances (i) up to $250,000 is 1.21%, and (ii) from $250,000.01 to $10,000,000 is best expressed as a range: 1.21% to 0.72%. Otherwise the variable ongoing APY applies (by balance tier, if applicable). Ongoing APYs and tiers may change without notice. If your average daily balance is within a tier, then your entire balance will have that corresponding APY, except as described above for the 1-year introductory APY. Current ongoing APYs and tiers are: 0.71% for $100,000 - $10,000,000; 0.71% for $50,000 - $99,999.99; 0.71% for $25,000 - $49,999.99; 0.71% for $10,000 - $24,999.99; and 0.71% for balances under $10,000. For accounts opened prior to 11/06/2016, the current ongoing APY for balances up to $10,000,000 is 0.71%. Higher balances are accepted. Accounts opened and initially funded with money transferred from another EverBank account are not eligible for the 1-year introductory APY. The required minimum opening deposit is $5,000. Fees may reduce earnings.

				Banking POV
			

                Flying in the face of the status quo
            


Our bank is the creation of a revolutionary energy similar to that of the 60s. We'd grown sick of the nickel and diming of other banks, so we stepped up. The result is something wholly different. It's about opportunity and the freedom to bank when and how you want. It's about a high yield promise.1 It's about believing the client comes first no matter what, then honoring that belief every single day.
For you, it starts now. It starts at EverBank.

TIAA, FSB is an FDIC insured federal savings association. The standard FDIC insurance limit of $250,000 applies per depositor, per insured depository institution for each account ownership category. FDIC insurance covers against loss due to the failure of the institution, but not due to fluctuations in currency values. Due to the nature and volatility of the foreign exchange market, the values of currencies are subject to wide fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency denominated instruments will entail significant risk exposure to adverse movements of the foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar. The amount of deposit insurance available for products denominated in foreign currency will be determined and paid in the United States dollar equivalent of the foreign currency, as the value of such currency is determined by the FDIC under its regulations, on the institution's date of default. You can lose money, including principal, due to currency fluctuations. Please only deposit money that you can afford to risk, and as part of a broadly diversified strategy.
EverBank® Metals Select® products:


Are Not FDIC Insured
Are Not Bank or Government Guaranteed
Are Not Deposits
May Lose Value


 
Purchasing or owning metals involves degrees of risk that make them unsuitable for certain individuals. You should carefully consider the suitability of such metals before making any decision. Please refer to the Specific Terms - Metals Select Accounts section in your Account Terms, Disclosures and Agreements Booklet for additional information.

On June 24, 2016, the Class of the U.S. Government Money Market Trust was redesignated as the "R Class."
On June 28, 2016, the U.S. Government Money Market Trust launched Class S shares.
Where the net expense ratio is lower than the gross expense ratio, certain fees have been waived and/or expenses reimbursed. These waivers and/or reimbursements will continue for at least one year from the date of the applicable fund’s current prospectus (unless otherwise noted in the applicable prospectus) or until such time as the fund's Board of Directors/Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such waivers and/or reimbursements. Absent such waivers and/or reimbursements, returns would have been lower. Expenses are based on the Fund's current prospectus.
Subject to change daily. Portfolio information and composition are provided for informational purposes only, and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell any security.
DEFINITIONS 
Net Asset Value (NAV) is the dollar value of a single mutual fund share, based on the value of the underlying assets of the fund minus its liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding. It is calculated at the end of each business day. Subsidized(Sub.) reflects current fee waivers in effect. Absent such fee waivers, the yield would have been lower. The Unsubsidized (Unsub.) does not reflect the fee waivers currently in effect. Current yield is a measure that looks at the current price of a bond instead of its face value and represents the return an investor would expect if he or she purchased the bond and held it for a year. Calculated by dividing the Annual Cash Inflows / Market Price. The 7-day effective yields are annualized net yields that describe 1-year earnings assuming dividends are reinvested at the average rate of the last 7 days. SEC 30-day yield is a measure of the income generated by the portfolio's underlying asset over the trailing 30 days, relative to the asset base of the portfolio itself. The SEC 30-day yield - Subsidized (Sub.) reflects current fee waivers in effect. Absent such fee waivers, the yield would have been lower. The SEC 30-Day yield - Un-Subsidized (Un-Sub.) does not reflect the fee waivers currently in effect.
Weighted average maturity (WAM). Maturity measures the number of days remaining in the life of a bond. The weighted average maturity of the portfolio represents the market-weighted average of the maturities of the portfolio's individual holdings. Weighted average life (WAL). A measure of sensitivity to liquidity and/or credit risk. Weighted average life takes into account all call options exercised by the issuer as well as permissible maturity shortening devices such as demand features.
You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Funds’ sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.
1 Amended rule 2a-7(a)(8) (defining “daily liquid asset” to mean (i) cash; (ii) direct obligations of the U.S. Government; and (iii) securities that will mature or are subject to a demand feature that is exercisable and payable within one business day).
2 Amended rule 2a-7(a)(32) (defining “weekly liquid assets” to mean (i) cash; (ii) direct obligations of the U.S. Government; (iii) Government securities issued by a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of the Government of the United States pursuant to authority granted by the Congress of the United States, that are issued at a discount to the principal amount to be repaid at maturity and have a remaining maturity of 60 days or less; and (iv) securities that will mature or are subject to a demand feature that is exercisable and payable within five business days).
As of January 1, 2011, the SEC requires fund companies to file a new exhibit with risk/return summary information in interactive data (XBRL) format. Click here for XBRL files.
Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the portfolios carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information about the portfolios. To obtain a prospectus, download one at www.morganstanley.com/liquidity or call 1.800.236.0992. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.

  WAM is the weighted average maturity of the portfolio. The WAM calculation utilizes the interest-rate reset date, rather than a security's stated final maturity, for variable- and floating- rate securities. By looking to a portfolio's interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates, the WAM measure effectively captures a fund's exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from interest rate movements.
 


  WAL is the weighted average life of the portfolio. The WAL calculation utilizes a security's stated final maturity date or, when relevant, the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest (such as a put feature). Accordingly, WAL reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit (widening spreads) or tightening liquidity conditions.
 


  Tracking error and information ratio are calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index (added October 2, 2013), as this is a better representation of the Portfolio's global multi-asset strategy. The investment team manages the Portfolio relative to this Blended Index.
 


  Excess return versus Custom Benchmark is calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index based on the period since it was added as a benchmark on October 2, 2013.
 


  NTM = Next Twelve Months
 


  LTM = Last Twelve Months
 


  Because the Portfolio had not commenced operations as of the most recent fiscal year end, no portfolio turnover rate is available for the Portfolio.
 


  The Reorganization occurred on January 6, 2015. The inception date reflects the inception date of the Private Fund.
 


  Global equities is represented by the MSCI All Country World Index.
 


  Net exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)-(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV)
 


  Gross exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)+(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV).
 


  Fixed income net and gross exposure is duration adjusted (U.S. Treasury 10-Year equivalents)
 


  Security ratings disclosed above have been obtained from Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("S&P"). S&P's credit ratings express its opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer to meet its financial obligations in full and on time.'AAA' is the highest rating. Any rating below 'BBB-' rating 
		is considered non-investment grade. Ratings are relative and subjective and are not absolute standards of quality. Ratings apply only to the underlying holdings of the portfolio and does not remove market risk.
		"NR" or "Not Rated" indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&P does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy. Futures are not rated.

PITTSBURGH, June 4, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Federated Investors, Inc. (NYSE: FII), one of the nation's largest investment managers, today announced further refinements to its plan to restructure the company's line of money market funds by delineating which money market funds will be classified as retail money market funds under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's 2014 rules.  In addition, the company announced a series of planned mergers with the aim of strengthening and streamlining its money market fund offerings.  Federated expects to announce its institutional money market fund product line in the future.  "While Federated's clients don't need to make any changes to their investments now, the planned adjustments to Federated's product line are the result of an active and ongoing dialogue with our large, diversified client base," said J. Christopher Donahue, president and chief executive officer.  "As a leading provider of liquidity management services for 40 years, Federated continues to work with our clients in an effort to meet their liquidity needs today and in the future."Retail money market fundsIf all of the anticipated fund mergers are completed, Federated expects to offer the six retail prime and national municipal funds listed in the table below.  The company also anticipates offering the 13 state-specific money market funds listed below as retail money market funds subject to board approval.  Each of the funds named below will continue to permit institutional investors to invest in the funds until Oct. 14, 2016, when the SEC rule changes go into effect.  Retail prime and national municipal money market fundsFederated Capital Reserves Fund Federated Prime Cash Obligations Fund Federated Municipal Obligations Fund Federated Tax-Free Obligations Fund Federated Municipal Trust Tax-Free Money Market Fund Retail state-specific money market fundsFederated California Municipal Cash TrustFederated New Jersey Municipal Cash TrustFederated Connecticut Municipal Cash TrustFederated New York Municipal Cash TrustFederated Florida Municipal Cash TrustFederated North Carolina Municipal Cash TrustFederated Georgia Municipal Cash TrustFederated Ohio Municipal Cash TrustFederated Massachusetts Municipal Cash TrustFederated Pennsylvania Municipal Cash TrustFederated Michigan Municipal Cash TrustFederated Virginia Municipal Cash TrustFederated Minnesota Municipal Cash TrustEach retail money market fund will continue to seek a stable $1.00 per share net asset value (NAV).  Retail money market mutual funds are defined by the 2014 money market fund rules as funds that have policies and procedures reasonably designed to limit all beneficial owners of the fund to natural persons.  Generally, individuals may continue to invest in retail money market funds through their brokerage account, retirement accounts, education and savings accounts, as well as through ordinary trusts.  Federated Automated Cash Management Trust, Federated Prime Cash Series and Federated Municipal Cash Series are expected to be merged into other retail money market funds before the deadline to designate a fund as retail or institutional.  Money market fund mergersIn an effort to strengthen and streamline its retail money market fund offerings, Federated plans a series of fund mergers for certain prime, municipal and government money market funds.  The three retail and four government money market funds listed below are expected to be merged into designated retail and government money market funds with similar investment objectives and principal investment strategies.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
