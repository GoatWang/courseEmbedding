The dollar and Washington

Amazon.com IncAmazon.com Announces Second Quarter Sales up 25% to $38.0 BillionTwitterFacebookLinkedInGooglePlusRedditPinterestUrlJul 27 2017 21:01 BSTSource: Business Wire

SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul. 27, 2017--
      Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced financial results for
      its second quarter ended June 30, 2017.
    

      Operating cash flow increased 37% to $17.9 billion for the trailing
      twelve months, compared with $13.0 billion for the trailing twelve
      months ended June 30, 2016. Free cash flow increased to $9.7 billion for
      the trailing twelve months, compared with $7.7 billion for the trailing
      twelve months ended June 30, 2016. Free cash flow less lease principal
      repayments increased to $5.5 billion for the trailing twelve months,
      compared with $4.2 billion for the trailing twelve months ended June 30,
      2016. Free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets
      acquired under capital leases decreased to $1.5 billion for the trailing
      twelve months, compared with $2.9 billion for the trailing twelve months
      ended June 30, 2016.
    

      Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying stock-based awards
      totaled 502 million on June 30, 2017, compared with 495 million one year
      ago.
    

      Net sales increased 25% to $38.0 billion in the second quarter, compared
      with $30.4 billion in second quarter 2016. Excluding the $502 million
      unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates
      throughout the quarter, net sales increased 26% compared with second
      quarter 2016.
    

      Operating income decreased 51% to $628 million in the second quarter,
      compared with operating income of $1.3 billion in second quarter 2016.
    

      Net income was $197 million in the second quarter, or $0.40 per diluted
      share, compared with net income of $857 million, or $1.78 per diluted
      share, in second quarter 2016.
    

      “Our teams remain heads-down and focused on customers,” said Jeff Bezos,
      Amazon founder and CEO. “In the last few months, we launched Echo Show
      (our newest Echo device with a video screen), introduced calling and
      messaging via Alexa on all Echo devices, debuted Inside Edge on
      Prime Video (the first of 18 Indian Original Series), introduced Amazon
      Channels in both the U.K. and Germany, launched four new Fire tablets,
      expanded Amazon Fresh to Germany, launched Prime Now in Singapore,
      launched our 25th airplane with Prime Air, hired more than
      30,000 new employees, opened three new Amazon Books stores, launched
      more than 400 significant AWS features and services, migrated more than
      7,000 databases using AWS Database Migration Service, and held our third
      annual Prime Day — signing up more Prime members than ever before. It’s
      energizing to invent on behalf of customers, and we continue to see many
      high-quality opportunities to invest.”
    

Highlights



        The third annual Prime Day was the biggest global shopping event ever

        AWS announced the general availability of AWS Greengrass, software

        sync capabilities on connected devices. Enel, Konecranes, Pentair, Rio

        Greengrass to allow connected devices to perform some tasks locally
        while leveraging the full processing, analytics, and storage power of
        the AWS Cloud. More than a dozen AWS partners including BSquare,
        Canonical, Digi International, Intel, Lenovo, Mongoose, Nokia,
        Qualcomm Technologies, Raspberry Pi, Samsung, Technicolor, and Wistron

        reduce Amazon DynamoDB response times from milliseconds to
        microseconds, even at millions of requests per second. With DAX,
        customers using DynamoDB for mobile, web, gaming, ad tech, IoT, and

        designed for graphics-intensive workloads like 3D rendering, 3D
        visualization, video encoding, and virtual reality applications.
        Backed by NVIDIA Tesla M60 GPUs, G3 instances offer double the CPU
        power per GPU and double the host memory per GPU than the prior most
        powerful GPU cloud instance available.

Amazon announced that more than 10,000 employees have participated in
        Career Choice, and that it expects to reach 20,000 participants by
        2020. Career Choice is Amazon’s innovative career training program
        that pre-pays 95% of tuition for high-demand fields, regardless of
        whether they are relevant to a career at Amazon. Career Choice has
        dedicated on-site classrooms at 25 fulfillment centers, and has
        expanded the program to include in-demand fields such as robotics and
        photovoltaic certifications.
      

Amazon now has more than 10 large-scale solar installations on
        fulfillment center rooftops, and remains on track to install 50 or
        more by 2020. Amazon was the leading corporate purchaser of renewable
        energy in the U.S. in 2016, according to the 2017 State of Green
        Business report.
      

Amazon donated more than 47,000 square feet of space within its newest
        headquarters building to Mary’s Place Family Shelter in Seattle, which
        will include 65 rooms to help shelter more than 200 homeless women,
        children, and families each night. Additionally, Amazon announced that
        it will match donations up to $1 million through the end of the year
        made to Friendship Place, a leader in the Washington, D.C., region in
        developing innovative solutions to end homelessness. Amazon also
        donated $1 million and 25,000 square feet of space within its Seattle
        headquarters to FareStart, a leader in transforming the lives of
        people who are homeless or living in poverty through its culinary job
        training and employment placement programs. The donations will help
        FareStart open five new eateries and launch a foodservice
        apprenticeship program to help people living in poverty obtain higher
        income jobs.
      


Financial Guidance


      The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s
      expectations as of July 27, 2017, and are subject to substantial
      uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be
      materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign
      exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer
      spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online
      commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below.
      This guidance excludes the impact of our proposed acquisition of Whole
      Foods Market, Inc.

      Third Quarter 2017 Guidance
    


        Net sales are expected to be between $39.25 billion and $41.75
        billion, or to grow between 20% and 28% compared with third quarter
        2016. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately
        $125 million or 40 basis points from foreign exchange rates.
      

        Operating income (loss) is expected to be between $(400) million and
        $300 million, compared with $575 million in third quarter 2016.
      

        This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business
        acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are
        concluded.
      


      A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m.
      ET, and will be available for at least three months at
      www.amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and
      other material information regarding the Company’s financial and
      operating results.
    

These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict.
      Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons,
      including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that
      Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those
      investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix
      of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent
      to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of
      growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international
      growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims,
      fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of
      inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company
      enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and
      completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and
      risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and
      uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products,
      services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation
      and taxation, and fraud. In addition, the current global economic
      climate amplifies many of these risks. More information about factors
      that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included
      in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
      (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and
      subsequent filings.

          retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows
          to reclassify excess tax benefits of $113 million for the
          three-months ended June 30, 2016, $320 million for the six-months
          ended June 30, 2016, and $323 million for the twelve-months ended
          June 30, 2016 from financing activities to operating activities.

          As a result of accounting guidance adopted in Q1 2017, we
          retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows
          to reclassify excess tax benefits from financing activities to
          operating activities. The amount of the adjustment was $305 million
          for TTM Q1 2016, $323 million for TTM Q2 2016, $401 million for TTM
          Q3 2016, and $829 million for TTM Q4 2016.
        



          (2)
        




          Free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of
          property and equipment, including internal-use software and website
          development, net,” which is included in cash flow from investing
          activities.
        



          (3)
        




          Free cash flow less lease principal repayments is free cash flow
          reduced by “Principal repayments of capital lease obligations,” and
          “Principal repayments of finance lease obligations,” which are
          included in cash flow from financing activities.
        



          (4)
        




          Free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets
          acquired under capital leases is free cash flow reduced by
          “Principal repayments of finance lease obligations,” which is
          included in cash flow from financing activities, and property and
          equipment acquired under capital leases. In this measure, property
          and equipment acquired under capital leases is reflected as if these
          assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these
          assets have been leased.

          Average Total Assets minus Current Liabilities (excluding current
          portion of Long-Term Debt and current portion of capital lease
          obligations and finance lease obligations) over five quarter ends.

Certain Definitions


Customer Accounts



        References to customers mean customer accounts, which are unique
        e-mail addresses, established either when a customer places an order
        or when a customer orders from other sellers on our websites. Customer
        accounts exclude certain customers, including customers associated
        with certain of our acquisitions, Amazon Payments customers, AWS
        customers, and the customers of select companies with whom we have a
        technology alliance or marketing and promotional relationship.
        Customers are considered active when they have placed an order during
        the preceding twelve-month period.
      


Seller Accounts



        References to sellers means seller accounts, which are established
        when a seller receives an order from a customer account. Sellers are
        considered active when they have received an order from a customer
        during the preceding twelve-month period.
      


AWS Customers



        References to AWS customers mean unique AWS customer accounts, which
        are unique customer account IDs that are eligible to use AWS services.
        This includes AWS accounts in the AWS free tier. Multiple users
        accessing AWS services via one account ID are counted as a single
        account. Customers are considered active when they have had AWS usage
        activity during the preceding one-month period.
      


Units



        References to units mean physical and digital units sold (net of
        returns and cancellations) by us and sellers at Amazon domains
        worldwide as well as Amazon-owned items sold through non-Amazon
        domains. Units sold are paid units and do not include units associated
        with AWS, certain acquisitions, rental businesses, or advertising
        businesses, or Amazon gift cards.
