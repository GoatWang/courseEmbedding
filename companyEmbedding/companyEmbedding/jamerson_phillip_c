With over 30 years of construction experience, he started as a general laborer during the summers and steadily progressed to foreman, superintendent, project manager and project executive. Phillip has been associated with some of the industry’s largest jobs. At Jamerson-Lewis, Phillip will oversee construction as Chief Operating Officer. Phillip Jamerson is now 1 of 4 owners of Jamerson Lewis Construction Inc.

" As a leader in the construction industry, Jamerson-Lewis is known for their highly skilled workforce. We have always found their workmanship to be above industry standards. Their willingness to go the extra mile has always produced a quality and very reliable product.....Southern Air, Inc regards Jamerson-Lewis as one of the best general contractors in the Southeast".Ronald G. Kidd, Jr. President Southern Air, Inc."Our Department has been very pleased with the professional performance of Jamerson-Lewis Construction, Inc. during the completion of the alterations and additions to Midlothian High School....The project design was phased, unique and complex. The time for completion was compressed. The project team was proactive in their scheduling and phase completions. The owner and the users were amazed with the smooth transition into these new and renovated spaces. Jamerson-Lewis met every time sensitive issue and moved to the completion dates with ease. I would highly recommend this company to any other architect, engineer or owner."Everett A. Minton, Jr.Chesterfield County Public SchoolsI have worked with William Cook of Jamerson Lewis Construction, Inc. on several construction projects since 2008 where I served as the Project Architect. Throughout the time I’ve known him, he has shown me time and again that he has excellent project management skills (very thorough, a team player and has a positive attitude). In summary, due to his ability to coordinate closely and effectively with the owner, architect, and subcontractors I highly recommend William as a Project Manager for your projects.

Alan Burchette, AIA Senior Associate
Dewberry Engineers Inc.

Architecture Department Manager"William Cook and I worked together on the Livestock Road Region 2000. Regional Landfill Facilities Project in 2011-2012.  The project consisted of constructing a new Office Building, Maintenance Building, Scale House, Convenience Station and general site development.  William helped deliver this project on schedule while coordinating Jamerson Lewis' work with several other contractors working for Region 2000. William's professionalism, organization and commitment to meeting the project schedule were integral to the project's success.  As an Owner, I highly recommend William Cook as a Construction Project Manager."
Clarke W. Gibson, P.E.
Director
Region 2000 Services Authority“I would like to sincerely thank you for your help on Banks-Gannaway! You helped us be very good stewards of VES’s hard-earned funds. Your work, friendship, professionalism and honesty is greatly appreciated! It was a pleasure!“
Rob TaylorBoard of TrusteesVirginia Episcopal School“As construction has progressed, each obstacle we have encountered has been met with a spirit of ‘can-do’ and a willingness to talk through the options with us. You have also been very accommodating as we have made changes along the way. It’s exciting to look out my window each day and see the progress. Thank you again for Jamerson-Lewis’ support to date.“
Scott C. ShankVice President for Finance and AdministrationSweet Briar College“I have to say that the process of working with you throughout the history of Phelps Road has been nothing less than spectacular, and for me, a true gift. …This project is really very well done and your whole firm is the reason why. Top to bottom. You guys really are pros. I very much appreciate what you are doing for me. Double underline ‘appreciate’.“
Ron L. MittelmanShareholder/Managing Member, Phelps Road Partners, LPLocust Hill Consulting Services, LLC“Thank you for your incredible patience and your willingness to work with us… It is inconceivable where this project would be right now with a different contractor. We can’t sing your praises loud enough.“
Gary W. Lee, CPAPrincipalYount, Hyde & Barbour, P.C.“I want to thank you on behalf of Centra for your professionalism, attention to detail, and your steadfastness to meet the completion date on time. You helped make difficult decisions an easy process to manage and you worked with me to accomplish changes that Centra requested quickly and efficiently. This made the project turn out even better than expected.”
Richard T. MosbyProject ManagerCentra Health, Inc.“Jamerson-Lewis Construction, Inc. is 5 stars. From their quality work, to their attention to detail, to their effort to remain on schedule and great customer service, I would highly recommend talking with them. I do not think that the construction of the State Theatre would have gone as smoothly without their professional team of contractors and management.”
Ed Bednarczyk, Executive DirectorCulpeper State TheatreThe State Theatre Foundation, Inc.“The original goal was to pursue Silver [LEED] certification. They [City of Lynchburg] really wanted it. It was to the City’s benefit to have them on this project. Jamerson-Lewis’ efforts pushed the project over the top and got it in the Gold.”
Jim TalianCity of Lynchburg Project ManagerDaily News Record, January 10, 2012
 “…The goal of Jamerson-Lewis always seems to be making sure the client is satisfied. We have worked with other contractors with goals of making a profit over making happy customers. This makes working with Jamerson-Lewis a positive experience, not just a job.”
Kim BassProject ManagerLongwood University“Jamerson-Lewis Construction, Inc. completed a major restoration and rehabilitation project at the Old Court House in 2005. The project required that the historic fabric and character of the 1855 building be restored to high standards while adding systems to protect the building and artifacts preserved here. We are very pleased with the end result and receive many compliments from our visitors who often tell us they love the restored building environment as well as the exhibits.”
Douglas K. HarveyMuseum DirectorThe Lynchburg Museum System“Luck is the random result of circumstances and situations void of directed influences. Luck had nothing to do with our accomplishment. It is the result of highly skilled and dedicated professionals working together safely to an expected and defined goal. Without these men and women and their amazing contributions to this endeavor, none of this would be possible.”
John W. Compher, PE, CPEManager, Industrial EngineeringBabcock & Wilcox Nuclear Operations Group“I recommend Jamerson-Lewis Construction as a highly motivated and experienced builder in the design/build arena. Their abilities were irreplaceable in our success in this building endeavor. We would not hesitate to contract with them again in the future.”
Douglas A. CooperPresidentLiberty Construction Services, Inc.“The recent renovation and build out of additional space done by your company through our property manager was excellent. We appreciated the professionalism of your people and in particular the fine communication system used by your company to assure us along the way that the job met our specifications.”
Michael E. Watson & R. Gregory Porter, IIIInvestment CounselsFlippin, Bruce & Porter, Inc.“…What a great group of people you have assembled. From Mrs. Brooks [C.L. Lewis & Company secretary for 45 years], whose dedication and loyalty are inspirational, to a group of Superintendents that I am sure your competitors envy, you have something special. Good people are the difference!”
John M. Jordan, IIIPresidentHawkins-Graves, Inc.“I would like to express my appreciation to you and your staff on behalf of the City of Lynchburg for a job well done. … The level of pride shown by your employees in their work is a real testament to their commitment to provide quality services. … I am pleased to say this has been a wonderful experience for all of us and I highly recommend Jamerson-Lewis Construction, Inc. to others in need of a quality job accomplished.”
D’Anna Conner, PEPrincipal EngineerCity of Lynchburg’s Monument Terrace“Your ability to actually estimate the construction project costs, to orchestrate the construction timelines and your willingness to work with us to minimize the number of change orders enabled us to complete a successful project that was under budget and on time… Again, thank you for your professionalism, attention to construction detail and to the project’s bottom line.”
W. J. ThomasExecutive DirectorValley Community Services Board“Your creativity and goodwill during the negotiating phase was most welcomed, and your leadership, fairness and judgment on the jobsite made the construction process enjoyable from beginning to end. Thanks, too, for your determined effort at completing the last few items of work, and insuring the Owner’s long-term satisfaction.”
Ken ThackerAssociate PrincipalVMDO Architects“From line carpenter to the foreman to the subcontractors, everyone was skilled and professional, and the job was ably managed from your office… Regular site meetings and your personal involvement assured that the project stayed on schedule, and I always felt I was treated fairly in change order negotiations.”
George KriegerExecutive DirectorNelson County Community Development Foundation“From my viewpoint, the team at Jamerson-Lewis Construction uniquely possesses the skill set and initiative to meet the challenges of modern construction. Whether restoring an 1855 courthouse or building the City of Lynchburg’s first LEED building, Jamerson-Lewis Construction delivers repeat performances of ‘a job well done.’”
Amanda G. Adams, LEED AP (BD+C)Associate AIACJMW Architecture“I appreciate their strong leadership and customer service.

I have a high regard for Jamerson-Lewis Construction, Inc…”
Joe Archambeault, PE, CHFMManaging Director of FacilitiesCentra Health, Inc.“…I am deeply indebted to all who worked in planning the science building at Sweet Briar. It is a magnificent, functional laboratory. Last but not least, it all culminated in the joyful, happy celebration of dedication in April.
