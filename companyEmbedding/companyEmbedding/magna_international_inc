Capabilities and products[edit]




Magna International global locations in 2016.


Magna’s capabilities include the design, engineering, testing and manufacture of exterior systems, seating systems, closure systems, vision systems, powertrain systems, electronic systems, roof systems, body & chassis systems, hybrid & electric vehicle systems, and vehicle engineering & contract assembly.[7]
History[edit]
The company was founded in 1957 by Frank Stronach as Multimatic Investments Ltd. This company merged with Magna Electronics in 1969, and the combined company became Magna International in 1973.
Magna acquired 80% of New Venture Gear, once a joint venture between General Motors and Chrysler, in September 2004, and combined it into Magna Powertrain. It assumed full ownership in 2007.
Magna purchased CTS Fahrzeug-Dachsysteme, a supplier of convertible roofs, from Porsche in November 2005.
The Sunday Telegraph in London reported January 2007 that Magna International was on a short list of bidders to purchase Aston Martin.[8] Their bid was unsuccessful; the company instead went to a British consortium led by Dave Richards of Prodrive for £479 million.[9]
According to a NPR broadcast on March 23, 2007, Magna showed interest in acquiring the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler. However, on 14 May 2007, it was announced that Cerberus Capital Management had won the acquisition bid for $7.4 billion.
In April 2008, Magna's wholly owned subsidiary, Cosma International, announced that they were buying the Ogihara America Corp. stamping plant in Birmingham, Alabama, that makes parts for Mercedes-Benz and other automakers.[10]
During the second quarter of 2015, the Magna battery pack business, Magna Steyr, was sold to Samsung SDI approximately $120 million.[11]
In July 2015, Magna bought the German company Getrag, specialized in transmission systems with about 13,500 employees, for 1.9 billion dollars.[12]

Magna has produced a number of first-to-market technologies and manufacturing processes throughout its history. Some of these innovations include the integrated child safety seat, stow-into-floor minivan seats, and plastic, reaction injection moulding (RIM) bumpers.
Magna has also been recognized with several Automotive News PACE Awards for its innovations. Magna technologies that received PACE Awards in recent years include its BlindZone outside mirror (2009), Infinity rearview mirror (2012), laser-welded, hot-stamped door ring (2014, in partnership with Honda and ArcelorMittal) and PureView seamless sliding window (2015).
In 2005, Magna began producing automotive rearview cameras at its facility in Holly, Michigan, and in September 2014, Magna produced its 10 millionth rearview camera in Holly.[13]
In 2011, Magna supplied the complete electric drivetrain on the 2012 Ford Focus Electric, Ford’s first full production, all-electric passenger vehicle.[14] The Focus Electric was awarded the 2011 Green Car Vision Award at the 2011 Washington Auto Show.
In June 2014, Magna presented a Multi-Material Lightweight Vehicle (MMLV) concept developed in partnership with Ford Motor Company.[15] The vehicle was based on a 2013 Ford Fusion and represented a 25 percent vehicle weight reduction. The vehicle was cosponsored by the U.S Department of Energy and was praised by numerous industry leaders for its innovative approach to vehicle lightweighting and fuel efficiency.[16]
In 2015, Magna’s SmartLatch, an industry-first, 100 percent electronic door latching system, was named a finalist for the 2016 Automotive News PACE Awards.[17]

Magna’s capabilities include the design, engineering, testing and manufacture of exterior systems, seating systems, closure systems, vision systems, powertrain systems, electronic systems, roof systems, body & chassis systems, hybrid & electric vehicle systems, and vehicle engineering & contract assembly.[7]
History[edit]
The company was founded in 1957 by Frank Stronach as Multimatic Investments Ltd. This company merged with Magna Electronics in 1969, and the combined company became Magna International in 1973.
Magna acquired 80% of New Venture Gear, once a joint venture between General Motors and Chrysler, in September 2004, and combined it into Magna Powertrain. It assumed full ownership in 2007.
Magna purchased CTS Fahrzeug-Dachsysteme, a supplier of convertible roofs, from Porsche in November 2005.
The Sunday Telegraph in London reported January 2007 that Magna International was on a short list of bidders to purchase Aston Martin.[8] Their bid was unsuccessful; the company instead went to a British consortium led by Dave Richards of Prodrive for £479 million.[9]
According to a NPR broadcast on March 23, 2007, Magna showed interest in acquiring the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler. However, on 14 May 2007, it was announced that Cerberus Capital Management had won the acquisition bid for $7.4 billion.
In April 2008, Magna's wholly owned subsidiary, Cosma International, announced that they were buying the Ogihara America Corp. stamping plant in Birmingham, Alabama, that makes parts for Mercedes-Benz and other automakers.[10]
During the second quarter of 2015, the Magna battery pack business, Magna Steyr, was sold to Samsung SDI approximately $120 million.[11]
In July 2015, Magna bought the German company Getrag, specialized in transmission systems with about 13,500 employees, for 1.9 billion dollars.[12]

Magna International Inc. is Ready to Accelerate its Growth
Magna International Inc. has an under-leveraged balance sheet that it intends to employ before the end of the year.

Magna International Inc (NYSE:MGA) is already the world's number two auto parts supplier while holding the top spot in the North American auto market. However, despite holding strong positions in most of the key auto part product areas, the company would like to capture even more of the auto parts market. Magna International has plans of doing just that as the company believes that its balance sheet is currently a bit under leveraged, leaving it room to take on a bit more debt to accelerate growth and capture even more of the auto parts market.
Magna International is already close to the top As the slide below shows, Magna International holds leading global positons in most of the major product areas.

However, despite being a global leader across several categories Magna International still intends to grow its position where it finds attractive opportunities. For example, earlier this year the company announced the acquisition of Getrag, which is the largest OEM-independent supplier of automotive transmissions, in an effort to bolster its powertrain offerings. The driving force behind that deal was the fact that Magna International has identified growth in the powertrain area, and has therefore made it a strategic priority within its portfolio.
On the other hand, the company has not been shy to pare away parts of its portfolio that don't have the same compelling growth prospects. That's largely behind the company's decision to sell its interior operations earlier this year.





Magna International isn't satisfied Magna International might not be done optimizing its portfolio via acquisitions and divestitures. That's because the company has come to the realization that its balance sheet could easily handle more leverage while still staying within its target leverage ratio. As the slide below shows, the company could add between $700 million and $2.4 billion in debt to its balance sheet while still remaining within its target debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.0 times to 1.5 times.

That debt, when combined with the company's strong cash position gives it a lot of money to put to use. The company has a variety of potential uses for that cash such as increasing its dividend, buying back shares, or funding growth both organically and via acquisitions. All options appear to be on the table as the company has consistently increased its dividend and it has bought back more than $3.2 billion in shares since 2010, including $241 million over the past year. Further, it is planning to spend upwards of $1.5 billion in capex this year to drive organic growth.
Having said all that, don't be surprised if Magna International uses its balance sheet to drive growth via acquisitions. It certainly has a lot of options as it could, for example, bolster its leading global mirrors position by acquiring auto-dimming mirror pioneer Gentex Corporation (NASDAQ:GNTX). As the slide below shows, Gentex has a growing share of the growing interior and exterior auto-dimming mirror marketplace.

That would certainly fit within the company's desire to bolster its portfolio in product categories that are growing. Also compelling about Gentex is that the $4.4 billion company has a cash rich balance sheet with $570 million in cash against just $250 million in debt as of the end of last quarter. Because of that, such a deal could conceivably be made for all cash while enabling Magna International to stay within its target leverage range. 
Another option would be to acquire a company in a new product category. An option here, for example, would be leading safety system supplier Autoliv (NYSE:ALV). It's a much larger company as its enterprise value is $10 billion, suggesting that such a deal would likely need cash and equity to complete. However, Autoliv would also fit Magna International's priority of targeting a growth market. That's because while Autoliv's revenue last year was $9.2 billion the company's plan is to grow its sales to at least $12 billion by the end of the decade, with a potential to reach $15 billion in sales if it can claim additional market share. In other words, auto safety parts are a large growth market.
Investor takeaway Magna International is currently the second largest auto parts maker in the world with leading positions across several key markets. However, it's not content with that position, which is why it continues to refine its portfolio. More reshuffling could be on the way, with a large acquisition not out of the question due to the fact that the company's leverage ratio is below its target range giving it ample capacity to make a deal.

Men's ClothingGuys, it’s time to update your wardrobe. Luckily for you, we’ve got all the staples and on-trend pieces your closet needs. Explore men’s clothing (including big & tall sizes), plus shoes and accessories to create outfits tailored for every occasion. And if you’re interested in a few helpful styling tips, then check out our Men’s Guide to Style. Don’t worry, you can thank us later.
First, let’s keep it casual. The keys to a great laid-back wardrobe are to pick pieces that fit well, are comfortable and are versatile. T-shirts and tees are a great place to start. Plain tees are simple and can be worn with anything. Bonus? They can double as undershirts in a pinch. Graphic tees are an easy way to show off your personality. Go with versions that showcase your interests, rep your favorite sports team or just look cool. Finish your chill shirt collection with a few polos—they’re a more polished option and can easily be dressed down or up.
Now that you’ve got your list of classic casual shirts, it’s time to focus on refreshing your collection of shorts and pants. From cargos and chinos to denim, we’ve got you covered. When it comes to jeans, especially, grab a few pairs in various washes—think light, medium and dark. Feeling adventurous? Colored denim provides a fresh update to your look. From skinny and slim fit to bootcut and relaxed, fit matters and you should always pick pairs that suit your frame and that you feel good in.
Let’s move on to pieces you’ll need to dress to impress. Look pulled together with suits, dress shirts, undershirts and men’s dress shoes. Take the opportunity to mix and match with sport coats and blazers. Pair them with dress pants or jeans for a modern feel (but only if if the dress code is more lenient). Whether you’re headed to the office, a wedding or special event, your stylish clothes will speak for themselves. Don’t forget accessories. Grab a wallet, cuff links, ties, belts and more to round out your look.
Whether you’re dressed up or down, you’ll need to layer up when it’s cold outside. Our collection of jacket, coats and vest will keep you warm. Throw on cozy sweaters and sweatshirts into your look, and for even more warmth, stock up on hats, scarves and gloves. Stick with Timberland boots and thicker fabrics that help trap heat—think wool, leather, cotton and more.
Oh, and we can’t forget workout clothes. Whether you live at the gym or are just getting back into an exercise routine, you’re going to need a solid collection of activewear. And on rest days (and every evening), pajamas and loungewear will come in handy. We’re here to help you look great every hour of the day. Find helpful styling tops and tricks with Macy’s Men’s Guide to Style.
Who’s ready for a wardrobe refresh? Shop men’s clothing, shoes, accessories and more at Macy’s.Looking for huge savings? Shop our Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Holiday Gift Guide!
