Large Cap Value Equity 

Our Large Cap Value strategy is implemented by constructing portfolios of individual stocks, selected on a bottom-up basis, reflecting all three value characteristics: a price/earnings and price/book below the market and a dividend yield above the market.  Through the research-intensive process, our seasoned investment team identifies large, well-known companies that are undervalued and temporarily out-of-favor for reasons we can identify and understand.  Our independent, in-depth research provides the conviction and patience necessary to invest in a business where negative, short-term sentiment exists and the discernment to sell, as the company becomes fairly valued.

Investment Process
Our approach to the equity market is based on the underlying philosophy that markets are inefficient.  These inefficiencies can best be exploited through adherence to a value-oriented investment process dedicated to the selection of securities on a bottom-up basis.  We do not attempt to time the market or rotate in and out of broad market sectors, as we believe it is difficult, if not impossible, to add incremental value on a consistent basis by market timing.
We stay fully invested with a defensive, conservative orientation based on our belief that superior returns can be achieved while taking below average risks.  We implement this strategy by constructing portfolios of individual stocks that reflect all three value characteristics: price/earnings and price/book ratios below the market and dividend yields above the market (S&P 500).  While we are exacting in our definition of value, we are equally demanding in our pursuit of quality companies.  We look at stocks for what they are - an ownership interest in a business - and never want to own an interest in a company that has a deteriorating business.  We seek companies with profitability and earnings growth greater than the market.
Our strategy of emphasizing low price/book ratios as well as high dividend yields provides a measure of protection in down markets, helping to preserve assets.  In periods of economic recovery and rising equity markets, profitability and earnings growth are rewarded by the expansion of price/earnings ratios and the generation of excess returns.
Our greatest source of value added comes through individual stock selection.  The vast experience of Barrow Hanley's large cap investment team, both in absolute terms and in years working together, is where the value is added in the qualitative part of the decision-making process.  The Barrow Hanley team not only has the experience necessary to identify the reasons for a temporary undervaluation of a company's shares in the market, but also has the conviction and patience to invest in shares of stock of the business on a contrarian basis.
