GRE plugin integration with vCenter 5.5 and DataProtector 9.06









Hello all,I'm facing some errors regarding this topic... I planned to migrate my infrastructure from vCenter / vSphere 5.1 to 5.5.I'm licensed with the VMware GRE plugin, It works well with the 5.1 infrastructureI already prepared the 5.5 servers, I integrated the server to DataProtector in order to validate that the GRE is working, but the problem is the following :When I use the vSphere Web Client, if I go to the "HP DataProtector" tab, I have this error : Http Error - 500  {"message":"Unexpected error :There was a problem while sending query to service https://myservername.mydomain:7116/dp-gui/grePlugin/GetMountProxies.jsp?newMachineTypeParam=ESX. Check that this agent is accessible."}The server is reachable, it works properly... When I try to access the URL directly from my browser, I have a 404 error....Maybe there is a little trick... I don't know, please help me =(

I have the same problem using IE11 or Google ChromeI see that the tab is named "HP Data Protector"... On the 9.06 version, it's "HPE Data Protector" if I'm right, no ?

Re: GRE plugin integration with vCenter 5.5 and DataProtector 9.06








Have you checked the GRE integration guide shipped with Data Protector A.09.06 in the Docs folder? If this is a VCSA you need to open the firewall on the client that has the GRE agent and on the VCSA.Regards,Sebastian Koehler

Re: GRE plugin integration with vCenter 5.5 and DataProtector 9.06








With VC5.5U2 and above,  GRE UI is changed from Flex to Angular and it has gone Agentless. So probably you need to:- Delete (with remove components) the VCenter client from DP Cell manager- Restart VCenter service and Vcenter webclient service in VCenter server.- Install VMWare Granular Recovery Extension agent component in Cell manager or any other Host part of the cell. This will act as the mount proxy. (Mandatory pre-req)- Import the VCenter again to the cell along with select "Advanced GRE Web Plugin" tick box - Close, clear the cache  and open the Web Browser; Open VCenter Web client.- In VM-> Manage -> HPE DataProtector -> Settings : Set the mount proxy pathNow you can proceed to Recovery.Hope you are using VC5.5U2 or higher and firewall is disabled or configured for the ports in use.

Re: GRE plugin integration with vCenter 5.5 and DataProtector 9.06








When you click on the HPE-DP tab, an auto pop-up will come,  which display the Cell Manager name. and quickly goes off.  Hope you found this. Then if the screen is in loading can bedue to several issues:- Check HP OpenView is not installed in the same VCenter machine. (or any other HP software installed, that use the same port?)- Not able to communicate between CellManager-MountProxy-Vcenter.  [Add all the host resolution information to /etc/hosts file or C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts] ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Still not working? - Close browser and clean cache.- Remove the Advanced GRE Web Plugin.- Go to VCenter/mob ->Extension Manger (https://<VC-host>/mob/?moid=ExtensionManager) and check old HP Web Plugin is removed.- Restart the VCenter and WebPlugin services.- Add the Advanced GRE Web Plugin again , by select+ Apply the tick box.-  Open browser and check now. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Also check in the integration guide for the error messages and trouble shooting.

Re: GRE plugin integration with vCenter 5.5 and DataProtector 9.06








Please make sure the following TCP ports are open between the vCenter server and server where the VMware GRE agent is installed. Make sure the VMware GRE agent is not installed on multiple servers. This will make troubleshooting complicated. Check the debug.log on the server where the VMware GRE agent is installed.5555 — the default port for Data Protector communication7116 — the Application Server (HTTPS AS) portThe port ranges for the Advanced GRE Web-plugin are between 15000 and 15999.Regards,Sebastian Koehler

Re: GRE plugin integration with vCenter 5.5 and DataProtector 9.06








I see communication from vCenter to Cell Manager on ports 7116 and 5555, no packets dropped, it's perfect.When I restart vCenter Virtual Machine, I'm able to access to the "HPE Data Protector" tab, I can see the requests without the "Loading" popup, but when I try to access the "GRE Settings" page, it's stuck on "Loading"

Could you add an user <ANY>, group <ANY>, host <ANY> to the Data Protector admin group to see if it is a permission issue?Regards,Sebastian Koehler

After a reboot of the vCenter, I was able to access to the plugin. I clicked on "New Request", I see the backup I have for my VM, I was not able to create a Restore Request because there is no Mount Proxy on the dropdown list.So I tried to go to "GRE Settings", but the same as everytime... "Loading"

Re: GRE plugin integration with vCenter 5.5 and DataProtector 9.06








I suspect the Mount Proxy machine. (The first machine in which you have installed the GRE agent)Which OS it is? Check firewalls are disabled or configured.If possible remove this mount proxy and try GRE with the second mount proxy or a new server.

Re: GRE plugin integration with vCenter 5.5 and DataProtector 9.06








- Hope you have upgraded the Data Protector in all the clients and now all the Clients in the CellManager(CM) are of same version.- Make sure Vepa(Virtual Environment Integration) also installed along with VMWare GRE agent in all the mount proxies.- You should able to remove any mount proxy from the CM.  Incase any errors from DP, you can manually remove from the client-> Control Panel. Just reconnect the GUI to refresh the changes.- Same mount proxy can be used for VC5.1 as well as VC5.5. (Only Linux Guest VM needs a Linux mount proxy)- Is VC5.1 GRE working?

No. I dont think we can remove a component. If it is a client we can uninstall and do install again.Can you check the version of VMWare GRE agent is showing 906?

Re: GRE plugin integration with vCenter 5.5 and DataProtector 9.06








From your error message, i think host is not connecting.ipc_sendDataEx: IpcHandle -1 does not exist Now one option to troubleshoot the issue is:- Backup(make a copy) of c:\programdata\omniback\Config\server\cell\cell_info file- Edit the original cell_info file by moving the second mount proxy above the first mount proxy, which in your case is CM. - Close the DP GUI and Open again. Refresh/close-open browser and Try GRE.--------------------------Still problem:- Remove  "-vmwaregre_agentpatch A.09.06" from the CM/First mount proxy entry in the cell_info file. - Close the DP GUI and Open again. Refresh/close-open browser and Try GRE.

There is something wrong with the setup. Its not proper. "-vmwaregre_agentpatch A.09.00" must not be seen in the cell_info file. All component version should be 906. You can remove the "-vmwaregre_agentpatch A.09.00" and try.  Or try upgrading the clients again and see all components are upgraded to latest patch and no duplicate entries for same component.
