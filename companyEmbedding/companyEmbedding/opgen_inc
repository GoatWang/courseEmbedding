About Antibiotic Resistance
Every year, more than two million people in the U.S. become ill from antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and 23,000 of them die. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that antibiotic resistance causes $20 billion in excess direct healthcare costs and the report “Antimicrobial Resistance: Taking a Crisis for the Health and Wealth of Nations” (Review on Antimicrobial Resistance) predicts that antimicrobial resistance will be a bigger killer than cancer in the year 2050 with a projected 10 million deaths annually. Multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs), or superbugs, are a global healthcare issue and the CDC and other public health organizations have called for new molecular technologies for MDRO testing that can detect more quickly and accurately, improving infection control programs and providing hospitals with faster, more targeted antibiotic response and stewardship programs.

OpGen Receives Non-Compliance Notice From Nasdaq
Jun 22 17
On June 20, 2017, OpGen, Inc. (Company) received a written notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) notifying the Company that it fails to comply with Nasdaq’s Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2) because the Company’s shares of common stock (Common Stock) failed to maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share for thirty (30) consecutive trading days. In accordance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements, the Company has 180 calendar days, or until December 18, 2017 to regain compliance. If at any time before December 18, 2017, the closing bid price of the Common Stock is at least $1 for a minimum of ten (10) consecutive trading days, the Company can regain compliance. If the Company does not regain compliance by December 18, 2017, the Company may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day extension to regain compliance if the Company (i) meets the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement and (ii) provides written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. The Company intends to promptly evaluate various courses of action to regain compliance. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance.


OpGen Signs Supply Agreement to Use Thermo Fisher Scientific’s Technology to Advance Acuitas Rapid Test
Jun 19 17
OpGen, Inc. announced that it has entered into a global supply agreement to use Thermo Fisher Scientific’s technology to support the commercialization of its rapid molecular products and informatics system to help combat multidrug-resistant infections. OpGen will combine Thermo Fisher’s real-time PCR solutions with its genomic analysis and bioinformatics technology to help healthcare providers rapidly and accurately identify bacterial antibiotic susceptibility using resistance gene profiles. Under the terms of the agreement, OpGen will commercialize the Acuitas Rapid Test for Pathogen ID and resistance genes on Thermo Fisher’s new mid-throughput real-time PCR system. The effort will be supported by local labs that will be able to interpret results using customized analysis software and OpGen’s cloud-based Acuitas Lighthouse Knowledgebase to match genomic analysis data with antibiotic susceptibility information to identify microbial infections in individual patients.

OpGen Inc. (NASDAQ:OPGN) Focused On Acuitas Family Products Development After Q1 Net loss 

0000OpGen Inc. (NASDAQ:OPGN)
OpGen Inc. (NASDAQ:OPGN) is in the process of transitioning its business as focus shifts to developing the Acuitas family of genomic and informatics products. The shift comes on the company posting a wider than expected net loss in Q1 2017, attributed to a decrease in sales of FISH pathogen identification products. The company was also on the receiving end on the discontinuation of genome mapping products.
OpGen Q1 Results 
Revenue in the quarter came in at $4.08 million – down from $1.1 million as of Q1 2016. Operating Expenses, on the other hand, soared to highs of $5.7 million from $5.6 million as OpGen Inc. (NASDAQ:OPGN) invested big on the Acuitas Rapid Test development. Net loss soared to highs of $5 million from $4.5 million as of Q1 2016.
Cash and cash equivalent as of the end of the quarter stood at $1.7 million compared to $4.1 million as of December 31, 2016. Development of the Acuitas Rapid Test is a key priority as the company believes it will provide the foundation for growth going forward.
During the quarter the company presented preliminary test results for the technology it hopes to use for the detection of resistance genes in multi-drug resistant pathogens
“In the preliminary results presented at ECCMID, our Acuitas technology demonstrated the ability to rapidly and accurately predict antibiotic susceptibility using resistance gene profiles. The development of our first Acuitas Rapid Test to detect resistance genes for interpretation by our Acuitas Lighthouse informatics is underway,” said CEO, Evan Jones.
2017 Outlook 
Focus now shifts to implementing the Acuitas Rapid Test technology for external research use. OpGen is planning to expand the technology knowledge base by essentially completing 4,000 clinical isolates from various clinical sites include Merck SMART surveillance.
OpGen Inc. (NASDAQ:OPGN) is exploring a number of distribution and partnership relationships to support commercialization of the Acuitas Rapid Test. Accelerating growth of the business both in the U.S and on the international scene is also high on the agenda as OpGen looks to unlock new opportunities for growth.
Separately, OpGen Inc. (NASDAQ:OPGN) has confirmed the appointment of Dr. Tina S. Nova to its board of directors. Dr. Nova joins the board with vast experience in building novel genomics-based businesses. She is currently the CEO of Molecular Stethoscope Inc.
OpGen Inc. (NASDAQ:OPGN)’s stock was a big mover in Wednesday trading session having rallied by 6.09% to close at highs of $0.845 a share.
