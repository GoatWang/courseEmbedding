	Independent
	Auditors’ Report




	 




	To
	the Shareholders of




	The
	Pride Group Pty Ltd.




	 




	We
	have audited the accompanying financial statements of The Pride Group Pty Ltd, which comprise the balance sheets as of June 30,
	2016 and 2015, and the related statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and
	the related notes to the financial statements.




	 





	Management’s
	Responsibility for the Financial Statements





	 




	Management
	is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
	generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control
	relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due
	to fraud or error.




	 





	Auditor’s
	Responsibility





	 




	Our
	responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
	with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
	audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.




	 




	An
	audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The
	procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
	the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control
	relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures
	that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s
	internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
	policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
	presentation of the financial statements.




	 




	We
	believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.




	 





	Opinion





	 




	In
	our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The
	Pride Group Pty Ltd. as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended
	in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

	The
	Pride Group Pty Ltd.











	Notes
	to Financial Statements







	June
	30, 2016 and 2015





	 





	Note
	1 - Nature of Operations





	 




	Formed
	under the laws of the Australian State of Queensland in 1997, The Pride Group Pty Ltd (the “Company”) is a leading
	provider of a variety of technology based products and services in the commercial security systems space and in the renewable
	energy space, including, but not limited to, alarm systems, access control, video surveillance, closed circuit television, audio
	and visual systems and public announcement systems. During the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company’s operations
	were primarily in the Australian state of Queensland.




	 





	Note
	2 - Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies





	 





	Use
	of estimates:





	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
	of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
	during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.




	 





	Accounts
	and retainage receivable:





	 




	Accounts
	receivable are recorded when invoices are issued and are presented in the balance sheet net of the allowance for doubtful accounts.
	The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on the Company’s historical losses, the existing economic conditions
	in the construction industry, and the financial stability of its customers. Accounts are written off as uncollectible after collection
	efforts have failed. In addition, the Company does not generally charge interest on past-due accounts or require collateral. At
	June 30, 2016 and 2015, there was no allowance for doubtful accounts required.




	 





	Property
	and Equipment, and Depreciation

	:




	 




	Property
	and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is generally provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
	lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the remaining term
	of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement.




	 




	Repairs
	and maintenance that do not improve or extend the lives of the property and equipment are charged to expense as incurred.




	 





	Comprehensive
	Income (Loss)





	 




	Comprehensive
	income (loss) consists of two components, net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income
	(loss) refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that are recorded as an element of stockholder’s equity but are excluded
	from net income (loss). The Company’s other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments.




	 





	Foreign
	Currency Translation





	 




	Assets,
	liabilities, revenue and expenses denominated in non-U.S. currencies are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing on the
	date of the balance sheet. Gains (losses) on translation of the financial statements are from the Company’s operations where
	the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Translation gains (losses) are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
	income (loss). Gains (losses) on foreign currency transactions are included in the statements of Operations.

	The
	Pride Group Pty Ltd.






	Notes
	to Financial Statements






	June
	30, 2016 and 2015





	 





	Note
	2 - Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)





	 





	Revenue
	and Cost Recognition:





	 




	The
	Company recognizes revenue from construction contracts over the contractual period under the percentage-of-completion (POC) method
	of accounting. This method of accounting recognizes sales and gross profit as work is performed based on the relationship between
	actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. Recognized revenues that will not be billed under the terms of
	the contract until a later date are recorded in “Costs and earnings in excess of billings”. Likewise, contracts where
	billings to date have exceeded recognized revenues are recorded in “Billings in excess of costs and earnings”. Construction
	costs of projects under contract include all direct material and labor costs and other direct costs related to contract performance.
	Changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract and such estimates are reviewed periodically.
	Changes in job performance, job conditions, estimated profitability and final contract settlements might result in revisions to
	costs and income that are recognized in the period in which the changes are disregarded. Estimated losses are recorded when identified.




	 




	The
	use of the POC method of accounting involves considerable use of estimates in determining revenues, costs and profits and in assigning
	the amounts to accounting periods. The Company continually evaluates all of the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent
	with the application of the POC method of accounting. Because of inherent uncertainties in estimating costs, it is at least reasonably
	possible that the estimates used will change within the near-term.




	 




	Revenue
	from service or short term contracts is recognized currently as the work is performed.




	 





	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents:





	 




	For
	purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash equivalents include time deposits, certificates of deposit, and all highly liquid
	debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less.




	 





	Fair
	value of financial instruments:





	 




	The
	carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, consisting principally of cash, receivables and accounts payable
	approximates fair value due to either the short-term maturity of the instruments or borrowings with similar interest rates or
	maturities.




	 





	Income
	taxes:





	 




	The
	Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition threshold of more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination
	by the appropriate taxing authority. Measurement of the tax uncertainty occurs if the recognition threshold is met. Management
	has determined that there were no tax uncertainties that met the recognition threshold at the balance sheet dates, and no interest
	and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits have been recognized in the Company’s financial statements.




	 




	The
	Company files tax returns in the Australia federal jurisdiction and has no open tax years for 2012 and prior.




	 





	Compensated
	Absences

	:




	 







	The Company provides for employees
	to annually accrue up to five weeks of unused vacation beyond the calendar year as required by Australian law. At June 30, 2016
	and 2015 the balance of accrued unused vacation time approximated $97,000 and $103,000, respectively.

	The
	Pride Group Pty Ltd.






	Notes
	to Financial Statements






	June
	30, 2016 and 2015





	 





	Note
	2 - Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)





	 





	Advertising:





	 




	The
	Company expenses advertising costs as they are incurred. Advertising expense for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were $3,820
	and $6,362, respectively.




	 





	Operating
	Loss and Tax Credit Carryforwards:





	 




	At
	June 30, 2016, the Company has loss carryforwards totaling approximately $92,000 that may be offset against future taxable income.
	The carryforwards are available indefinitely.




	 





	Note
	3 – Significant Concentrations of Credit Risk





	 




	Cash
	maintained at an authorized deposit-taking institution (bank) incorporated in Australia is insured by the Australian Securities
	& Investments Commission (“ASIC”) up to approximately $186,000 USD in total. At June 30, 2016 and 2015, cash balances,
	in USD exceeded ASIC insured limits by approximately $70,000 and $87,000, respectively.




	 




	Credit
	risk for trade accounts is concentrated as well because substantially all of the balances are receivable from entities located
	within certain geographic regions. To reduce credit risk, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’
	financial conditions, but does not generally require collateral. In addition, at June 30, 2015, approximately 26% of the Company’s
	accounts receivable is due from two unrelated customers, 12% and 14%, respectively; and, at June 30, 2015, approximately 25% of
	the Company’s accounts receivable is due from two unrelated customers, 12% and 13%.




	 





	Note
	4 – Major Customers





	 




	During
	the year ended June 30, 2016, there were no customers with a concentration of 10% or higher. During the year ended June 30, 2015,
	approximately 17% of the Company’s revenue was earned from one customer.




	 







	Note

	Notes
	to Financial Statements






	 





	Note
	1 - Nature of Operations





	 




	Formed
	under the laws of the Australian State of Queensland in 1997, The Pride Group Pty Ltd (the “Company”) is a leading
	provider of a variety of technology based products and services in the commercial security systems space and in the renewable
	energy space, including, but not limited to, alarm systems, access control, video surveillance, closed circuit television, audio
	and visual systems and public announcement systems.




	 





	Note
	2 - Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies





	 





	Use
	of estimates:





	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
	of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
	during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.




	 





	Accounts
	and retainage receivable:





	 




	Accounts
	receivable are recorded when invoices are issued and are presented in the balance sheet net of the allowance for doubtful accounts.
	The allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on the Company’s historical losses, the existing economic conditions
	in the construction industry, and the financial stability of its customers. Accounts are written off as uncollectible after collection
	efforts have failed. In addition, the Company does not generally charge interest on past-due accounts or require collateral. At
	December 31, 2016, there was no allowance for doubtful accounts required.




	 





	Property
	and Equipment, and Depreciation

	:




	 




	Property
	and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is generally provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
	lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the remaining term
	of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement.




	 




	Repairs
	and maintenance that do not improve or extend the lives of the property and equipment are charged to expense as incurred.




	 





	Comprehensive
	Income (Loss)





	 




	Comprehensive
	income (loss) consists of two components, net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income
	(loss) refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that are recorded as an element of stockholder’s equity but are excluded
	from net income (loss). The Company’s other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments.




	 





	Foreign
	Currency Translation





	 




	Assets,
	liabilities, revenue and expenses denominated in non-U.S. currencies are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing on the
	date of the balance sheet. Gains (losses) on translation of the financial statements are from the Company’s operations where
	the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. Translation gains (losses) are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
	income (loss). Gains (losses) on foreign currency transactions are included in the statements of Income.

	Note
	2 - Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)





	 





	Revenue
	and Cost Recognition:





	 




	The
	Company recognizes revenue from construction contracts over the contractual period under the percentage-of-completion (POC) method
	of accounting. This method of accounting recognizes sales and gross profit as work is performed based on the relationship between
	actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion. Recognized revenues that will not be billed under the terms of
	the contract until a later date are recorded in “Costs and earnings in excess of billings”. Likewise, contracts where
	billings to date have exceeded recognized revenues are recorded in “Billings in excess of costs and earnings”. Construction
	costs of projects under contract include all direct material and labor costs and other direct costs related to contract performance.
	Changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract and such estimates are reviewed periodically.
	Changes in job performance, job conditions, estimated profitability and final contract settlements might result in revisions to
	costs and income that are recognized in the period in which the changes are disregarded. Estimated losses are recorded when identified
	and material.




	 




	The
	use of the POC method of accounting involves considerable use of estimates in determining revenues, costs and profits and in assigning
	the amounts to accounting periods. The Company continually evaluates all of the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent
	with the application of the POC method of accounting. Because of inherent uncertainties in estimating costs, it is at least reasonably
	possible that the estimates used will change within the near-term.




	 




	Revenue
	from service or short term contracts is recognized currently as the work is performed.




	 





	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents:





	 




	For
	purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash equivalents include time deposits, certificates of deposit, and all highly liquid
	debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less.




	 





	Fair
	value of financial instruments:





	 




	The
	carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, consisting principally of cash, receivables and accounts payable
	approximates fair value due to either the short-term maturity of the instruments or borrowings with similar interest rates or
	maturities.




	 





	Income
	taxes:





	 




	The
	Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition threshold of more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination
	by the appropriate taxing authority. Measurement of the tax uncertainty occurs if the recognition threshold is met. Management
	has determined that there were no tax uncertainties that met the recognition threshold at the balance sheet dates, and no interest
	and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits have been recognized in the Company’s financial statements.




	 




	The
	Company files tax returns in the Australia federal jurisdiction and has no open tax years for 2012 and prior.




	 





	Compensated
	Absences

	:




	 




	The
	Company provides for employees to annually accrue up to five weeks of unused vacation beyond the calendar year as required by
	Australian law. At December 31, 2016, the Company had a balance of accrued unused vacation time of approximately $110,000.

	Note
	2 - Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)





	 





	Advertising:





	 




	The
	Company expenses advertising costs as they are incurred. Advertising expense for the six months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015
	were $1,073 and $2,297, respectively.




	 





	Operating
	Loss and Tax Credit Carryforwards:





	 




	At
	December 31, 2016, the Company has loss carryforwards totaling approximately $95,000 that may be offset against future taxable
	income. The carryforwards are available indefinitely.




	 





	Note
	3 – Significant Concentrations of Credit Risk





	 




	Cash
	maintained at an authorized deposit-taking institution (bank) incorporated in Australia is insured by the Australian Securities
	& Investments Commission (“ASIC”) up to approximately $180,000 USD in total. At December 31, 2016, cash balances,
	in USD exceeded ASIC insured limits by approximately $72,000.




	 




	Credit
	risk for trade accounts is concentrated as well because substantially all of the balances are receivable from entities located
	within certain geographic regions. To reduce credit risk, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’
	financial conditions, but does not generally require collateral. In addition, at December 31, 2016, approximately 25% of the Company’s
	accounts receivable is due from one unrelated customer; and, at December 31, 2015, approximately 37% of the Company’s accounts
	receivable is due from two unrelated customers, 22% and 15%, respectively.




	 





	Note
	4 – Major Customers





	 




	During
	the six months ended December 31, 2016, there were no customers with a concentration of 10% or higher. During the six months ended
	December 31, 2015, approximately 17% of the Company’s revenue was earned from one customer.




	 







	Note
	5 – Property and Equipment





	 




	At
	December 31, 2016, property and equipment are comprised of the following:

	UNAUDITED
	PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION





	 




	On
	January 31, 2017 (the “Closing Date”), we entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”)
	by and among us, The Pride Group (QLD) Pty Ltd., an Australian corporation (“Pride”), Turquino Equity LLC (“Turquino”)
	and Stephen Paul Mullane and Marie Louise Mullane as Trustees of the Mullane Family Trust (the “Mullane Trust” and
	together with Turquino, the “Pride Shareholders”). Andrew Hidalgo and Matthew Hidalgo, our Chief Executive Officer
	and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, are each a managing partner of Turquino.




	 




	Pursuant
	to the exchange agreement, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Pride from the Pride Shareholders in
	exchange for an aggregate of 3,800,000 shares of our common stock (the “Acquisition Shares”).





	 





	The
	unaudited pro forma combined balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 giving effect to the contribution transactions as if they had
	occurred on the balance sheet date, and statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 include the historical statements
	of operations of the combined companies, giving effect to the contribution transactions as if they had occurred at the beginning
	of the period. This information is only a summary, and you should read it in conjunction with the company’s historical financial
	statements and related notes and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained
	in H/Cell’s annual reports, quarterly reports and other information on file with the SEC. As a result, the combination of
	H/Cell and Pride pursuant to the exchange agreement is considered a business combination of companies under common control and
	will be accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling-of-interests.




	 




	We
	have prepared the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements based on available information, using assumptions that we
	believe are reasonable. These unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are being provided for informational purposes
	only. They do not purport to represent our actual financial position or results of operations had the exchange agreement occurred
	on the dates specified, nor do they project our results of operations or financial position for any future period or date.




	 




	The
	unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations do not reflect any adjustments for non-recurring items or anticipated
	synergies resulting from the combination. Pro forma adjustments are based on certain assumptions and other information that are
	subject to change as additional information becomes available. Accordingly, the adjustments included in our financial statements
	published after the completion of the combination may vary from the adjustments included in these unaudited pro forma condensed
	combined financial statements below.

About Us

H/Cell Energy Corporation > About Us 





The renewable energy market is quickly becoming one of the fastest growing industries in the world. It is led by continued expansion in renewable energy technology, the need to lessen dependency on fossil fuel energy, grid-based vulnerabilities and the battle against global warming. Government initiatives continue to focus on the implementation of renewable energy. Currently, there are tax credits and monetary incentives to ensure that a growing percent of electricity comes from renewable energy sources. The key to substantial growth of renewable energy will be cost efficiency and consistency as a primary energy source. The key to consistency is energy storage as an end user cannot rely just on solar, wind or batteries. The concept of combining renewable energy with hydrogen energy is the new frontier.
H/Cell Energy Corporation has developed and implemented a hydrogen energy system used to completely power a residence or commercial property with clean energy so that it can run independent of the utility grid and also provide energy to the utility grid for monetary credits. It is a system that solves the need to produce clean energy and eliminate greenhouse gases for a better environment and a better world. This unique system uses renewable energy as its source for hydrogen production. Whether it is powering a home or commercial property with clean energy or providing hydrogen fueling stations for transportation, H/Cell Energy Corporation is innovative in integrating clean energy technology that protects our environment for future generations.

De Tiberge Property, Pennington, NJ
This installation is comprised of land-based solar panels, an underground tank that holds uncompressed hydrogen, inverters, batteries, a hydrogen generator and a fuel cell. The system was purchased by the owner and included a 30% investment tax credit received by the government. The dwelling is a 2,300 square foot home that had a high electricity bill. With the installation of the hydrogen energy system, the property now generates approximately $9,000 in solar renewable energy credits per year with a net zero electricity bill.

Return on Investment

H/Cell Energy Corporation > Return on Investment 





There are many ways to achieve a return on investment when implementing an HC-1 system. End users can receive an investment tax credit for the purchase of an HC-1 system. In addition, if you are located in states or countries whose government supports a regulatory standard requiring its utility companies to increase their production of energy from renewable sources, there are additional monetary benefits. For those states or countries that support renewable energy credits, H/Cell Energy Corporation, on behalf of the end user, submits an interconnection application with the local public utility company.
The application is approved based on historical consumption and renewable energy to be produced. Once approved and when the system is operational, the HC-1 system can begin to eliminate the electric bill while generating renewable energy credits. The end user sells these credits to a broker who in turn sells the credits to a utility company so that the utility company can demonstrate their compliance with the regulatory obligations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Many states or countries that do not offer these renewable energy credits, do offer other cash incentives for renewable energy systems. H/Cell Energy Corporation will work with the end user to maximize tax and energy credits that can generate a solid return on investment.
