Security and Issuer   This Schedule 13D relates to the common stock, $0.001 par value
per share (“Common Stock”) of Lucas Energy, Inc. (the “Company” or the “Issuer”).
The principal executive offices of the Company are located at 450 Gears Road, Suite 860, Houston, Texas 77067.   Item 2. Identity and Background   (a) This statement is filed by RAD2 Minerals, Ltd., a Texas limited
partnership (“RAD2”), RAD2 Management, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“RAD2 LLC”),
Segundo Resources, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Segundo”) and Richard N. Azar, II (“Azar”).
Each of the foregoing is referred to as a “Reporting Person” and collectively as the “Reporting Persons.”   RAD2 LLC is the general partner of RAD2. Azar is the managing member
of RAD2 LLC. By virtue of these relationships, each of RAD2 LLC and Azar may be deemed to beneficially own the securities beneficially
owned by RAD2.   Azar is the Managing Member of Segundo. By virtue of this
relationship, Azar may be deemed to beneficially own the securities beneficially owned by Segundo.   Azar was appointed as a member of the Board of Directors of, and
as Chairman of, the Company on August 26, 2016.   Each of the Reporting Persons is a party to that certain Joint Filing
Agreement described in detail in Item 6. Accordingly, the Reporting Persons are hereby filing a joint Schedule 13D.   (b) The principal business address of each of RAD2, RAD2 LLC, Segundo
and Azar is P.O. Box 6172, San Antonio, Texas 78209.   (c) The principal business of RAD2 LLC is serving as the general

State of Texas. Azar is a citizen of the United States of America.   Item 3. Source of Amount of Funds or Other Compensation   Effective August 25, 2016 (the “Closing”), the
Company closed the transactions contemplated by that certain Asset Purchase Agreement, entered into between the Company and twenty-three
sellers (collectively, the “Sellers”), including RAD2, as a Seller, and Segundo, as a Seller and as a representative
of the Sellers named therein (the “Representative”), dated December 31, 2015 (as amended to date, the “Purchase
Agreement”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired working interests in producing properties and undeveloped
acreage in Texas and Oklahoma, including varied interests in two largely contiguous acreage blocks in the liquids-rich Mid-Continent
region of the United States, and related wells, leases, records, equipment and agreements associated therewith (collectively, the
“Assets”), from the Sellers (the “Acquisition”). In consideration for the purchase of the
Assets, the Company assumed approximately $30.6 million of commercial bank debt, issued the Sellers (a) 552,000 shares of Series
B Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Series B Preferred Stock”)(convertible into 3,941,280 shares of Common Stock,
the “Series B Preferred Stock”)(all of which were issued to RAD2 (200,000 shares) and Segundo (352,000 shares))
and (b) 13,009,664 shares of restricted Common Stock (of which 3,409,385 shares were issued to RAD2); and (ii) paid the Sellers
$4,975,000 in cash.     CUSIP No. 549333300   Effective August 25, 2016, the Company, as borrower, and Azar and
certain other Sellers, as guarantors (collectively, the “Guarantors”), and International Bank of Commerce, as
Lender (“Lender”), entered into a Loan Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”), whereby the Company
borrowed $40 million from the Lender. Additionally, in connection with the parties’ entry into the Loan Agreement and to
further secure amounts due thereunder, certain of the Guarantors pledged shares of Common Stock which they received at the Closing
to the Lender, with RAD2 pledging 3,120,606 shares of Common Stock. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Loan Agreement,
and subject to the terms thereof, the Lender can obtain ownership of, and therefore voting power and investment power over such
pledged securities.   The Loan Agreement and promissory note entered into in order to
evidence the amount borrowed under the Loan Agreement include standard and customary events of default for similarly sized facilities,
including, but not limited to, in the event the Company fails to pay any amounts owed to Lender when due; the Company (or any Guarantor)
breaches any covenant, obligation, agreement, or other provision in any agreement entered into with Lender; the sale, lease, transfer
or other disposition of all or any substantial part (i.e., 10% or more in any fiscal year) of the Company’s or any Guarantor’s
assets, subject to certain exceptions; or in the event any person, entity, or group (other than any Guarantor) acquires beneficial
ownership of 50% or more of the Company’s securities or more than 50% of the members of the Company’s Board of Directors
change without the consent of Lender. The Company’s failure to comply with any covenant or requirement under the Loan Agreement
and related documents constitutes an event of default under the note, subject to cure periods thereunder. Upon the occurrence of
an event of default, the Lender may, at its option, declare the amounts due under the Loan Agreement immediately due and payable
without notice of any kind.   The Series B Preferred Stock has dividend rights
that accrue at an annual rate of 6%, payable quarterly in arrears, beginning at the end of the first full quarter following the
Closing, until such Series B Preferred Stock is no longer outstanding either due to conversion, redemption or otherwise. The Series
B Preferred Stock also has liquidation rights equal to the original issue price of such shares ($25 per share) payable upon the
Company’s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, either voluntarily or involuntarily. Each outstanding share of Series B
Preferred Stock is entitled to one vote on all stockholder matters to come before the Company’s stockholders and are not
entitled to series voting except as required by law.   The Series B Preferred Stock has a face value of $25 per share.
The Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into Common Stock at a rate of 7.14:1 (convertible into an aggregate of 3,941,280 shares
of Common Stock if fully converted), at the option of the holder thereof, or automatically as to 25% of the Series B Preferred
Stock shares if the Company’s Common Stock trades above $6.125 per share for at least 20 consecutive trading days, and trades
with at least 75,000 shares of average volume per day during such period; an additional 50% of the Series B Preferred Stock shares
if the Company’s Common Stock trades above $7.00 per share for at least 20 consecutive trading days, and trades with at least
75,000 shares of average volume per day during such period; and as to the remaining Series B Preferred Stock shares, if the Company’s
Common Stock trades above $7.875 per share for at least 20 consecutive trading days, and trades with at least 75,000 shares of
average volume per day during such period.   The Series B Preferred Stock is redeemable at any time by the Company
upon the payment by the Company of the face amount of the Series B Preferred Stock ($25 per share) plus any and all accrued and
unpaid dividends thereon.   Pursuant to a Letter Agreement entered into at Closing between the
Company and RAD2, RAD2 agreed to accept full liability for any and all deficiencies between the “Agreed Assets Value”
set forth in the Purchase Agreement of $80,697,710, and the mutually agreed upon value of the assets delivered at Closing by the
Sellers, up to an aggregate of $1,030,941 (as applicable, the “Deficiency”). In connection therewith, RAD2 agreed
to establish an escrow account within three business days of the Closing and place into escrow 288,779 shares of Common Stock,
within 15 business days from the date of the Closing. The escrowed shares are to be held in escrow pending (a) RAD2’s transfer
of assets to the Company following the Closing, equal to at least the value of the Deficiency (as valued in the reasonable determination
of the Company); or (b) another mutually agreeable solution to the Deficiency ((a) or (b) as applicable, the “Make-Whole”).
In the event the Make-Whole occurs on or prior to 45 business days from the date of Closing (the “Make-Whole Deadline”),
the escrowed shares are to be released to RAD2, and in the event the Make-Whole does not occur prior to the Make-Whole Deadline,
the escrowed shares (or such portion thereof that equals the Deficiency, in the reasonable determination of the Company) are to
be released to the Company for cancellation as consideration for the Deficiency.     CUSIP No. 549333300   Item 4. Purpose of Transaction   The Reporting Persons acquired the securities for investment purposes.
In the future, depending on general market and economic conditions affecting the Company and other relevant factors, the Reporting
Persons may purchase additional securities of the Company or dispose of some or all of the securities they currently own from time

        detail in Item 2, each of RAD2 LLC and Azar may be deemed to beneficially own the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by
        RAD2.   As of the close of business on September 1, 2016, Segundo
