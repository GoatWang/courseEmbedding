Verity Investments, Inc.










Reality-based investing





Investment Philosophy


Our investment philosophy is derived from three primary considerations:

We have observed over many years the inclination of markets to deviate, sometimes dramatically, from any reasonably definable measure of value or other meaningful metric.
An advantage may be gained by investing in targeted sectors or securities based upon sound underlying fundamentals or in recognition of market pricing anomalies, particularly where there are emerging or established trends supported by those factors.
The most reliable way to maximize the probability of better than average long term results is to identify opportunity in those areas that are mispriced while systematically avoiding severe downturns in portfolio value.

As a consequence, we seek to maximize absolute returns using a broad tactical asset allocation methodology implemented in coordination with multiple risk management strategies.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Barnes Group (NYSE:B) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Hold Ratings, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.50)Consensus Price Target: $54.33 (10.13% downside)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Valmont Industries (NYSE:VMI) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.33)Consensus Price Target: $171.00 (11.76% upside)
