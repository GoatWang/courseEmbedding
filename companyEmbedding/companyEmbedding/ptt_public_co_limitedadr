PTT Chemical Public Company To Benefit From ASEAN Growth - Ptt Chemical Public Co., Ltd. ADR (OTCMKTS:PCHUY) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»PTT Chemical Public Company To Benefit From ASEAN GrowthAug.17.15 | About: Ptt Chemical (PCHUY) Shelley Goldberg Macro, commodities, alternative energy, sustainabilityInvest-With-PurposeSummaryPTT Chemical Public Company is set to benefit from ASEAN growth.ASEAN member nations' energy needs are growing.PCHUY has lowered its debt and sees opportunities ahead.PTT Chemical Public Company (OTCPK:PCHUY), also known as the Petroleum Authority of Thailand Public Company Limited (PTT Group), is the Thai state-owned oil and gas company. PTT Group was formerly known as the Petroleum Authority of Thailand. Today, it owns extensive submarine gas pipelines in the Gulf of Thailand in addition to a network of LPG terminals throughout the Kingdom. It is involved in all things energy, including:

Upstream and downstream petroleum
Procurement, processing, transmission and distribution of natural gas
Import, export and trading of crude oil, condensate, petroleum petrochemical products, and other specialty substances
Retail sale of natural gas at service stations for light and heavy duty vehicles
Operation of gas separation units
Exploration, production and distribution of coal
Distribution of petroleum products and byproducts
Refining and processing
Palm oil investments

PTT Group was founded in 1978 and is headquartered in Bangkok. In fact, it's one of the largest corporations in Thailand and the only Thai company on the Fortune 500 and Forbes 2000 lists. The stock price of this rather interesting conglomerate has been drifting lower, largely as a result of the price of crude oil and other energy commodities falling.
PTT Group: The Nouvelle Energy Company for ASEAN
But the prospects for growth are exceptionally good if one focuses on the growth of the ASEAN block (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and its need for energy now and in the future. All you have to do is look at the statistics.
The number of people living in Southeast Asia is estimated to grow from today's 625 million to 690 million by 2020, and no doubt that will create a massive thirst for energy. It's a known fact that all ASEAN nations must synergize and develop its people together with its limited natural energy resources to prevent energy shocks driven by global energy security and price volatility. Sure, global energy prices have fallen precipitously -- but volatility is here to stay. We are now at precarious levels where producers are staring to slow down production, which only helps to put upward pressure on crude oil in the near future.

Also, we should focus on the strength of the ASEAN nations' economies, which have seen 5% growth per year over the last 15 years. The middle class is growing stronger and the people are moving into urban areas, leading to greater demand for energy. In fact, according to ASEAN statistics, the group saw 2014 total trades reach $2.5 trillion, making the region the eighth largest economy globally. Oil and gas ranks No. 1 in size in terms of intra-ASEAN trading by industry.
Here are some of PTT's initiatives in the ASEAN block:
Country Initiatives


Brunei: Helped local producers to increase the value of their export crude oil products through trading in the global market

Cambodia: Supplying the LPG and petroleum products for domestic consumption

Indonesia: Exploring growth opportunity in exploration and production and petrochemical production and trading

Laos: Building hydropower and developing oil and retail business

Malaysia: Has a joint development area for natural gas

Myanmar: Working with the local company to provide petroleum product and improve existing energy infrastructure.

Philippines: Enhancing its existing petroleum and retail business to better cater to changing lifestyle

Singapore: Expanding its crude oil, condensate, petroleum petrochemical products and other commodities trading

Vietnam: Helping to build a large scale petrochemical refinery complex

It's evident that PTT has made an impact in every ASEAN nation. Beginning in and as of 2014, PTT has taken the role in ASEAN Council on Petroleum (ASCOPE) as its Secretary in Charge. Like any emerging market, there are risks. In February 2015, PTT Exploration and Production reported its first quarterly net loss in 16 years, with a reported net loss of US$739 million for the October-December 2014 quarter. Needless to say, this news -- alongside dropping energy prices -- did not bode well for the stock.
Yet, as for PTT Group's debt, Moody's investor service maintained PTT's final issuer ratings at Baa1 -- on par with the sovereign rating -- given Moody's expectation of a high level of sovereign support. Moody's stated, "At the same time, PTT's strong liquidity profile also continues to support its rating, even if earnings come under pressure in this weak operating environment." Furthermore, the company has reduced its debt. As of Dec. 31, 2014, PTT had cash and cash equivalents of THB203.8 billion compared to THB85.0 billion of debt maturing in the next 12 months. The company also had a well-spread-out maturity profile, with around 43% of its total long-term borrowings maturing after 2019.

PTT's upstream business -- through its 65%-owned subsidiary PTT Exploration & Production Public Company Ltd. (PTTEP, Baa1 stable) -- remained the key earnings contributor of the group in Q4, accounting for 78% of its Q4 EBITDA and 70% of its full-year EBITDA. So, as we move toward the end of 2015, it might be a good time to start building a position in light of expected future growth in the ASEAN region.
