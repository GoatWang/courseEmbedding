The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and
related notes included elsewhere in this report.
Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.




Our operating results for the years for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and
2015.:



                                                        Year Ended
                                                       December 31,

Net Income (Loss)
                                 $ 61,354$ (73,287 )




Operating Revenues




Our company did not record any revenues during the years ended December 31, 2016
and 2015.
Operating Expenses and Net Loss
Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $61,354 compared
with $73,287 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in operating
expense was primarily attributed to a reduction in business activities, and
management initiatives to reduce general & administrative expenses. Our expenses
consisted entirely of general and administrative expenses, which included
professional fees (legal, accounting, audit), annual and incidental corporate
filing fees, filing fees associated with the electronic filing of our public
disclosure documents, travel expense, communications expenses (telephone,
internet) and incidental office expenses (mail, courier, etc.).
Our Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $61,354 compared with
$73,287 for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Cash and Equivalents at end of the period         $          459     $       13,501
As at December 31, 2016, our cash balance and total assets were $459 compared to
$13,501 as at December 31, 2015. The decrease was due to our application of cash
during 2016 toward accrued expenses.
As at December 31, 2016, we had total liabilities of $144,534 compared with
total liabilities of $96,222 as at December 31, 2015. The increase in total
liabilities was attributed to the receipt of additional related party loans
during 2016.
As at December 31, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $144,075 compared
with a working capital deficit of $82,721 as at December 31, 2015. The increase
in our working capital deficit was due to our use of
Cash flow from Operating Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we used $66,307 of cash for operating
activities compared to the use of $42,376 of cash for operating activities
during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cash used for operating
activities was due to the application of cash toward accrued liabilities.
Cash flow from Investing Activities
During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not have any cash
transactions related to investing activities.
Cash flow from Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we received $53,265 of cash from
financing activities compared to $55,877 for the year ended December 31, 2015
The nominal decrease in cash provided by financing activities is due to an
equivalent decrease in related party loans.

Expense                                        Amount

General and administrative expenses          $    75,000
Film project pre-production and production   $ 1,000,000
Total
                                        $ 1,075,000
We estimate that we will require additional funds of approximately $1,075,000
over the next twelve months to implement our growth strategy. In the event that
we are unable to raise sufficient funds to implement our growth strategy, we
intend to scale back our business plan commensurate with the financing available
to us. In that regard, we estimate that we will require approximately $75,000 to
maintain our basic business operations, which includes fulfilling our public
reporting obligations, and continuing to seek opportunities to produce or to
participate in the production of an internet movie. Further, we estimate that
development and production costs for an internet movie production will be
between $300,000 and $1,000,000, depending on the complexity of the project
undertaken, the marquee value of key talent, the duration of the film, and the
cost of the chosen location. We intend to tailor our production values to the
budget available to us.
The funds we will require may be raised through equity financing, debt
financing, or other sources, which may result in further dilution in the equity
ownership of our shares. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain
operations at a level sufficient for an investor to obtain a return on their
investment in our common stock. Further, we may continue to be unprofitable.



Future Financings



We will continue to rely on equity sales of our common shares in order to
continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will
result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will
achieve any additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or
other financing to fund our operations and other activities.
Purchase of Significant Equipment
We do not anticipate the purchase or sale of any plant or significant equipment
during the next 12 months.



Going Concern



Our company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern. This contemplates
the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal
course of business. Our company does not have a source of revenue sufficient to
cover our operation costs giving substantial doubt for it to continue as a going
concern. Our company will be dependent upon the raising of additional capital
through placement of our common stock in order to implement its business plan,
or merge with an operating company. There can be no assurance that our company
will be successful in either situation in order to continue as a going concern.
Our company is funding our initial operations by way of issuing founder's
shares.
Our officers and directors have committed to advancing certain operating costs
of our company, including legal, audit, transfer agency and edgar filing costs,
however they are under no obligation to provide additional financial support.



         23

  Table of Contents




In order to continue as a going concern, our company will need, among other
things, additional capital resources. Management's plan is to obtain such
resources for our company by obtaining capital from management and significant
shareholders sufficient to meet our minimal operating expenses and seeking
equity and/or debt financing. However management cannot provide any assurances
that our company will be successful in accomplishing any of our plans.
The ability of our company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our
ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding
paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable
operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might be necessary if our company is unable to continue as a going concern.



Contractual Obligations



As a "smaller reporting company", we are not required to provide tabular
disclosure obligations.



Going Concern



The Company has incurred losses since Inception (January 30, 2013) resulting in
an accumulated deficit of $180,775 as of December 31, 2016 that includes loss of
$61,354 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and further losses are anticipated
in the development of its business. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt
about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which
contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and
classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of
liabilities that could result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company
generating profitable operations in the future and, or, obtaining the necessary
financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal
business operations when they come due.
Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future,
on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. The Company intends
to position itself so that it may be able to raise additional funds through the
capital markets. In light of management's efforts, there are no assurances that
the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become
financially viable and continue as a going concern.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to
have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.



Critical Accounting Policies



Basis of Presentation



The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are
presented in US dollars.



Use of Estimates



The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the
reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.



         24

  Table of Contents




Cash and Cash Equivalents



The Company considers all highly liquid investments with the original maturities
of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company had $459 and $13,501
of cash as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The Company's bank accounts are deposited in insured institutions. At December
31, 2016 and 2015, the Company's bank deposits did not exceed the insured
amounts.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
ASC 820 "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures" establishes a three-tier fair
value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs in measuring fair value. The
hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which
inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.



These tiers include:



Level 1: defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
Level 2: defined as input other than quoted market prices that are observable,
either directly or indirectly, and reasonably available. Observable inputs
reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources
independent of the Company.
Level 3: defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data
exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
The Company's financial instruments consist of cash, a related party loan and
note payable related party. The carrying amount of these financial instruments
approximates fair value due their short term maturity.



Income Taxes



Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under the asset
and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined
based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets
and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws.
A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that,
based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.



Revenue Recognition



The Company will recognize revenue in accordance with ASC. 605, "Revenue
Recognition". ASC-605 requires that four basic criteria must be met before
revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2)
delivery has occurred; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4)
collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are
based on management's judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices
of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions
for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and
other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are
recorded. The Company will defer any revenue for which the product has not been
delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the
customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will
be required.




Advertising Costs




The Company policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when
incurred. The Company incurred advertising expense of $0 for the years ended
December 31, 2016 and 2015.



         25

  Table of Contents




Stock-Based Compensation



Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC
Topic 718.
As at December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company has not adopted a stock option
plan and has not granted any stock options.
Basic and diluted Income (Loss)
Per Share Basic income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Company's
net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of
common shares during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by
dividing the Company's net income available to common shareholders by the
diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. The
diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted
number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity. For the
years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no potentially dilutive
securities issued or outstanding and any such shares would have been excluded
from the computation because they would have been anti-dilutive as the Company
incurred losses for these periods.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting
pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such
pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on our financial
condition or the results of its operations.© Edgar Online, source Glimpses

Success Holding Group International is among Asia’s leading providers of self-improvement products and programs. Led by China’s foremost motivational speaker and marketer, Steve Chen, SHGT has established an umbrella organization acquiring rapidly growing companies in the self-help, inspirational and health drink sectors. Among these is a company producing and marketing personal improvement seminars featuring Mr. Chen, another entity marketing inspirational short films for pay-per-view online audiences worldwide, and a third business marketing China’s only health drink made from black rice.
In its first nine months of operations as a public entity, ended March 31, 2015, SHGT had revenues of $24.7 million and earnings of $3.7 million. Spurred by growth of our two primary businesses, and expanding sales of our new ‘888’ health drink, we anticipate significant improvements in top and bottom line performance in 2015.
Going forward, the company will continue its drive to acquire expanding, high-margin businesses providing products and services serving the physical, spiritual and emotional well-being of diverse consumers across China and around the globe.
