Info




                    The Nittany Lion Fund
                








The Nittany Lion Fund is a $7 million hedge fund run exclusively by undergraduate students at Penn State. The first of its kind in the country, the Nittany Lion Fund provides students the chance to make real investment decisions regarding the fund's 65 equities while exploring the intricacies of the financial world. The Nittany Lion Fund's mission is two-fold, to outperform the market providing a strong return for its investors and to educate its students in order to help them obtain careers on Wall Street.
The Penn State Investment Association
The Penn State Investment Association (PSIA) is the student organization that assists the Nittany Lion Fund, LLC and is open for students of all majors and experience levels to join. The group was founded to involve students in the research, analysis, and maintenance of a securities portfolio using a hands-on approach that would bridge the gap between classroom concepts and real world situations. The Nittany Lion Fund eventually grew out of this effort, based on a marketing plan and business structure developed by PSIA students.
Currently, the Nittany Lion Fund and PSIA co-exist. Both organizations develop leaders who have landed careers with investment banks such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase.
In the News: Members of the Nittany Lion Fund at Smeal appeared on the Fox Business television show Money with Melissa Francis answering questions about what stocks the fund is currently investing in and how various sectors are performing.

      Wall Street Oasis Investment Banking & Finance Community        Forums:IBPEHFRECOTRAMERCFALL |JOBBSCHOFFFASHTRENDBEST  HomeBlogsgordo's blog(1/4) Undergrad Review: Nittany Lion Fund, LLC               6/18/12 - 6:11pm  gordoIB |196    | Rank: Senior Baboon Last week I posted about how public universities are developing a growing presence on Wall Street. In that post, I highlighted four undergraduate programs that have earned an upstanding reputation for job placement. Over a four week span, I will give you guys a better understanding of each and the benefits of joining them.For the first week, I will be covering the Nittany Lion Fund, LLC - Penn State. Founded in 2005, this $4 million student-managed mutual fund has a habit of placing kids on the street (both in IBD and S&T). (See the link below)CAREER OPPORTUNITIESPenn State is commonly referred to as a "non-target" for positions on Wall Street. However, in the Nittany Lion Fund, students are able to gain real-world experience by actively managing real investor assets. Through this organization, you will enhance your knowledge-base and skill-set of comps and ratios, discounted cash flow analysis, financial statement analysis and other valuation techniques by working with other analysts.This is a great opportunity to gain exposure to the industry outside of the classroom. This kind of hands-on experience (equity research, valuation, etc.) is unmatched by the majority of universities in the US.If you are at all interested in applying to Penn State, or interested in the fund, I recommend viewing the website: NITTANY LION FUND.There, you can also see the video of Jim Cramer visiting the NLF in 2008.Interesting pieces on the NLF include:Article from The StreetStudent Videogordo's blogLog in or register to post comments ×Want to Vote on this Content?!

I know you are just starting that BB investment banking job and are looking to move into private equity, or you just started that biz dev role and are studying for the GMAT so you can get into B-school, but first, you have a lot of work to do.You're off on a fun adventure, though it may not seem like it every single day. You're being paid to learn various skills that will continue to make you money and provide a certain level of security for the remainder of your life. You may find some days you're the ball, but other days you're the Louisville Slugger. Some days you're the windshield. Some days you're the bug. Ride the waves.If you can last through the late hours, challenging personalities, lack of sleep, and self-inflicted poor nutrition (because, let's be real, you can choose to eat healthy foods and drink in moderation), many doors will open to you. And these doors are not limited to suit-wearing jobs in New York City. You're showing the world that you can compete professionally with the big dogs.

Following the disappointing Facebook [NASDAQ: FB] flop, investor confidence dropped dramatically. It's no secret that the waters were already muddied by BATS Global and the like; however, who is really to blame for the travesty that is Facebook? Morgan Stanley ? NASDAQ? Zuckerberg?In the wake of Facebook's complications, many investors have steered clear of the newly traded companies. But, I'm not so sure that's a good idea. The most shocking thing is that IPOs have actually outperformed the S&P 500 so far this year, according to CNBC. So while the botched initial public offerings are the ones making the news, they aren't necessarily the ones that are moving the market.Read more about IPO: Success or Flop?7 commentsLog in or register to post commentsMGM to go Public?As you all probably know, MGM Studios recently filed for a possible IPO just under 2 years after filing for bankruptcy protection. The company is likely to use the offering to reestablish itself as a prominent studio, allowing it to actually produce films on its own rather than co-financing with the likes of Warner Bros. and Sony Pictures. Since emerging from bankruptcy, MGM decided to target television and co-financing in order to limit their risk against box office flops.
