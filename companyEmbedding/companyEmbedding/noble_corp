 About Noble

History of Noble

HSE Policy









Noble Corporation Overview

Noble is a proven leader in the offshore drilling industry.
The Company's proactive style of management has guided it from a one rig operation in 1921 to one of the largest offshore drilling contractors in the world today. The Company's growth since the time of its spin-off from Noble Affiliates in 1985 has come about through a series of strategic acquisitions of offshore drilling assets.
These acquisitions follow the goals originally set forth in 1985 - to gain a strong position in foreign drilling markets, to expand marine drilling operations and to move into new markets and segments of the industry, preparing the Company to take advantage of an improved marketplace.
Noble has been successful by maintaining a conservative financial policy, positioning itself to adapt to the ever changing world energy market and meeting customers' needs and demands. At the same time, the Company has assimilated an experienced and well trained work force. Lloyd Noble set the tone for the Company's employee-oriented attitude in A Legacy for Management when he said :

It has been my further belief that it was the duty of the management, and to that end my mind has been constantly surcharged, to so build the organization that when men evidenced capabilities to give them a part of my work and find other tasks to do which might result in increased benefits to the organization, or step aside; and, on the other hand, should death intervene, to have matters so arranged that I would be missed personally, while the machinery continued to function smoothly. 
- from the will of Lloyd Noble

Noble will continue to perpetuate this heritage by providing the highest quality service and performance, which its customers, employees and shareholders have come to know and expect.

The #1 Investment
for You and 
for Your Customers!



We serve several thousand stores 
across America. 
A large percentage of them have told us, "Per dollar invested and space 
allotted,
NOBLE is the number one Return-On-Investment line in 
their store."
The selections are the result of NOBLE's 
customers listening to their customers.



Why do your NOBLE 
    customers come back and bring others with them?








Because you keep the popular parts in stock.
Because you have a package the right size for every customer.
Because NOBLE is the world's finest quality 
        and NOBLE is made in America.
Because every package is pre-priced and the price is right.
Because you have access to the complete line - every item in the catalogue. 
          Those numbers you don't carry - you can have in a few days.
Because your customers know "In the Long Haul - The Best Costs Less."

As an employee of Amateur Electronic Supply / Las Vegas, and in charge of doing the shipping 
			and receiving it is a real pleasure to always receive in an order from Noble Wire.
			The way your shipping department packs orders is the best I have ever seen. Everything comes out of the box 
			exactly the same way its written on your invoice.  Your shipping crew has to be a very talented group, 
			and should be commended for high quality workmanship. Thanks for 
			making my job so much easier.
