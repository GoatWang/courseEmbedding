Ride The Coattails Of Activist Shareholders With This Fund

                        You don’t have to be Carl Icahn, Bill Ackman or Dan Loeb to invest like an activist shareholder.  When crusading investors are demanding corporate change, they buy the stock of a target company. Activists who own more than 5% of the voting class of a company’s stock must file a Schedule 13D form with the Securities and Exchange Commission within 10 days after the purchase.

The total operating expense ratio (including indirect expenses such as the costs of investing in underlying funds), as stated in the
                    fee table in the Fund’s prospectus dated January 30, 2017, is 1.51% for I Class, 1.76% for A Class and 2.51% for C Class. For most recent month end information, please visit www.13DActivistFund.com (http://www.13DActivistFund.com) or call toll-free 1-877-413-3228.

                Overall stock market risks will affect the value of individual instruments in which the Fund invests. Factors such as economic growth, market conditions, interest rate levels, and political events affect the U.S. securities markets. When the value of the Fund's investments goes down, your investment in the Fund decreases in value and you could lose money. The Fund is a non-diversified investment company, which makes the value of the Fund's shares more susceptible to certain risks than shares of a diversified investment company. The Fund has a greater potential to realize losses upon the occurrence of adverse events affecting a particular issuer. The value of small or medium capitalization company stocks may be subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than those of larger, more established companies or the market averages in general.
                
                The Morningstar Rating for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history.  Exchange –traded funds and open ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.  It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product’s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance.  The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.  The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10 year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.  The weights are 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40%three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30%five-year rating/20%three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns.  While the 10-year overall rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three –year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

        Investment Process  
    


            The 13D Activist Fund seeks to invest in 20 to 40 activist situations that we believe will successfully lead to the realization of enhanced shareholder value. We analyze each 13D event and make a decision as to how much, if any, to allocate to the Fund. The investment decision is based primarily on an analysis of the history/track record of the activist, type of activism employed, sector and probability of a success. The decision is based primarily on an analysis of the 13D event. Among other things, we analyze the activist, his track record, the sector, and the activist’s track record in that sector. Additionally, we look at the activist strategy that will be employed and the type of returns that strategy typically creates. We also make a judgment on the probability for success of the filing based on the activist’s experience, the shareholder base and other factors. The fundamental analysis of the company is largely outsourced to the activist. Our investments are spread among many top activists with different activist styles, strategies and sector expertise.
        

            The average holding period for these types of 13D investments is 15 months. The success of the Fund does not depend on being able to capture the initial price bump1 that occurs when a 13D is filed. In fact, we expect that we will never capture the return on that price bump. For the types of investments we focus on (investments in companies with $1 billion+ market caps by premium activist investors), 13D Monitor data shows that historically there is an average 2.65% one-day bump in the stock price. However, 13D Monitor data also shows that these 13D filings produce an average return during their 15-month life that outperforms the S&P 500 Index2 by approximately 16%, after the 2.65% bump. We focus on capturing this long-term growth for shareholders, and are not as concerned with any initial, small bump in return.
        


        ---
        
1 The difference between the closing price on the day prior to the 13D following and the closing price on the day following the 13D filing is referred to as the “bump”.
        
2 The S&P 500® is regarded as a gauge of large cap U.S. equities. The index includes 500 leading companies in leading industries of the U.S. economy, capturing 75% coverage of U.S. equities.

        History      
    


            The Fund was founded on December 28, 2011 by Ken Squire, who serves as the Chief Investment Strategist of the 13D Activist Fund. After graduating from New York University School of Law in 1992, Ken practiced corporate and securities law for five years at Weil, Gotshal & Manges. He left the practice of law in 1997 and joined private equity firm Crown Capital Group. After nine years as a private equity investor, in April of 2006, Ken founded 13D Monitor, a subscription-based research company that specializes in 13D filings and shareholder activism.
        

            13D Monitor reviews and analyzes approximately 2,000 13D filings and 4,000 13D amendments each year and writes reports on the material filings. At any given time, 13D Monitor is following between 150 and 200 material activist campaigns. Ken  quickly became a leading commentator in this industry, penning “The Activist Spotlight” weekly column in Barron’s since 2007 and regularly appearing on CNBC and Bloomberg TV. Ken also hosts the largest conference dedicated to activism where all of the major activists come to speak. As a result, Ken has developed deep relationships with virtually every major activist investor and speaks with them and others in the activist community on a regular basis. Since its launch in 2006, 13D Monitor has become the preeminent qualitative subscription-based service for the institutional investor community, with clients that include most of the major investment banks and many of the top hedge funds, pension funds, institutional investors and law firms.
        

            With 13D Monitor established as the premier subscription research service for the institutional investor community, Ken began thinking about how he could apply his research and expertise for the benefit of individual investors. He came to three conclusions: (i) shareholder activism has been a successful strategy that has historically outperformed the market, (ii) we know of no way for individuals to invest in activism and (iii) we know of no one else who is as focused on this area like Ken is, given his focus since 2006  on nothing but analyzing 13D filings, developing relationships with the activists and the activist community and becoming deeply familiar with the styles, habits and philosophies of activist investors. So in December of 2011, Ken Squire launched the 13D Activist Fund to give individual and institutional investors access to the strategy of shareholder activism in a low-cost, liquid, transparent investment vehicle.

                Overall stock market risks will affect the value of individual instruments in which the Fund invests. Factors such as economic growth, market conditions, interest rate levels, and political events affect the U.S. securities markets. When the value of the Fund's investments goes down, your investment in the Fund decreases in value and you could lose money. The Fund is a non-diversified investment company, which makes the value of the Fund's shares more susceptible to certain risks than shares of a diversified investment company. The Fund has a greater potential to realize losses upon the occurrence of adverse events affecting a particular issuer. The value of small or medium capitalization company stocks may be subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than those of larger, more established companies or the market averages in general.
                
                The Morningstar Rating for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history.  Exchange –traded funds and open ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.  It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product’s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance.  The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.  The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10 year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.  The weights are 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40%three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30%five-year rating/20%three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns.  While the 10-year overall rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three –year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

Shares held for less than 30 days of both classes are subject to a 2.00% redemption fee.

13D Activist Fund Posts 19.57% Return for 2016 and a Five-Year Track Record Besting the S&P 500

                Highlights the Benefits of Pure, Diversified and Complete Exposure to a Successful Strategy
            

                January 17, 2017
            








Ride The Coattails Of Activist Shareholders With This Fund

                You don’t have to be Carl Icahn, Bill Ackman or Dan Loeb to invest like an activist shareholder.
                
                When crusading investors are demanding corporate change, they buy the stock of a target company. Activists who own more than 5% of the voting class of a company’s stock must file a Schedule 13D form with the Securities and Exchange Commission within 10 days after the purchase.
            

                July 30, 2014
            








A Top Advisor Focuses on Safety First

                When Chemical Bank asked Louise Gunderson to run its fledgling private-banking division in 1982, she thought she was being demoted. Private banking in the U.S. hadn't yet emerged as a sought-after club for the superrich.                
            

                July 1, 2014
            








13D Fund: Invest Like Carl Icahn and Other Corporate Raiders

                Activist investors such as Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman generate headlines, and big profits, by taking stakes in companies and shaking up management. Individual investors often pile in after them, after the price of the target company has already risen. Is that an effective investment strategy? 
            

                July 1, 2014
            








Hedge fund trackers shooting the lights out

                A pair of funds that track hedge fund filings are turning out to be much better at producing alpha than the real McCoys, but questions remain about how they will do if stocks head south. The $117 million Global X Top Holdings ETF (GURU) and the $74.8 million 13D Activist Fund (DDDAX) were both up more than 23% year-to-date through Aug. 21, crushing the S&P 500's 16% return over the same time period. 
            
August 23, 2013
            








Ride the Coattails of Activist Hedge Funds with Form 13D

                Hedge fund performance in aggregate has returned a dismal 3.55% as of the end of June, versus the 13.24% return of the S&P 500 during the same period. As unenviable as these returns are, activist hedge funds have attracted a lot of attention this year, and with good reason. Not only are they making headlines for public disputes, but the market environment is back in a position where activists can find alpha-rich trades following the fallow years of the credit crisis.
July 19, 2013
            








HEDGE FUND ALERT

                Activist hedge fund managers are projecting continued growth for a mutual fund that shadows their positions. Ken Squire’s 13D Management started this year with $6 million in its 13D Activist Fund and since then has added $8 million to $10 million of assets per month — finishing the first quarter with $32 million. One activist manager predicts the vehicle could reach $100 million by yearend. “He may have a special sauce there,” the source said. Squire’s fund is so named because of its strategy of scouring Schedule 13D filings with the SEC to learn which companies activist managers are targeting.             
April 24, 2013
            








A Fund That Piggybacks on Corporate Raiders

                It's far from a sexy name: The 13D Activist Fund. Until you realize it's built around the machinations of such glamorous and infamous corporate raiders as Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman. 
            
April 18, 2013
            








ValueInvestor - Taking A Stand

                Activist-investing expert Ken Squire has a front-row seat in monitoring the strategies the best activists employ 
and their track records in doing so. Now he’s translating that knowledge into an investment strategy of his own.

Stage Stores Credit Card


                                            I was charged fees then late fees then fees. So $28.22 balance appeared out of thin air without any purchase. I moved while opening the credit card account so I did not receive statements on time (or maybe they did not send it to me). Called and got $17 back. As for the rest, I...show more

                                            IF I COULD GIVE IT A ZERO I WOULD! Amazon/Synchrony Bank will cut your limit out of no where, even when making monthly payments. I've spent almost a year trying to pay off a card THEY maxed out and now they have sent to collections AS IM PAYING IT! DO NOT APPLY FOR THIS CARD!

                                            The one star is generous! I purchased car insurance and paid 450.00 for the policy and had to cancel 3 days later and only received a refund for $220! These people are theives!! What kind of insurance is 230 dollars for 3 damn days! CROOKS!

Synchrony Bank 


                                            I was told no interest for 1 year, not deferred interest for 1 year. I make 1 payment for every paycheck, biweekly, and on the rare occasion I have not been able to make a 2nd payment in a month, if it was not close to the due date, they charged me a late fee I had to fight to...show more

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
