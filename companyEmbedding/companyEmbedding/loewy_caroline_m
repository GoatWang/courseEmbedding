Caroline Loewy Joins Corcept as Chief Financial OfficerMenlo Park, Calif., - December 2, 2008Corcept Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CORT) today announced the appointment of  Caroline M. Loewy to the position of Chief Financial Officer. She will oversee  Corcept’s financial operations, business development activities, investor  relations, and along with other members of the management team, corporate  strategy.
“We are pleased to have a person  with Caroline’s financial and biopharmaceutical industry expertise join us at  Corcept” said Joseph K. Belanoff, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Corcept  Therapeutics. “Caroline’s broad experience will be valuable to Corcept during  this significant period in our Company’s evolution, as we move CORLUX toward  the market with our two ongoing Phase III programs, and advance our second  generation selective GRII antagonists into clinical development.”
Ms. Loewy most recently served as  Chief Financial Officer of Poniard Pharmaceuticals, a publicly traded  biopharmaceutical company, where she was a key driver of that company’s  corporate strategy, visibility among investors, and led several successful  financings. From 2004-2006 she acted as  an independent consultant to a variety of biopharmaceutical companies advising  on corporate strategy, business development, and financing. Ms. Loewy spent 14 years in equity research  and corporate finance. From 2000-2004 she  was an Executive Director in biotechnology equity research at Morgan Stanley,  providing fundamental analysis and recommendations to investors, as well as strategic  advisory services to corporate clients.  She was also a Managing Director in biotechnology equity research at  Prudential Securities and held positions in corporate finance at  BankAmerica. Ms. Loewy holds a BA degree  from the University of California, Berkeley,  and an MBA/MS degree from Carnegie   Mellon University.
About Corcept Therapeutics  Incorporated 
      Corcept is a pharmaceutical  company engaged in the development of drugs for the treatment of severe  psychiatric and metabolic disorders. The company’s lead programs are the  development of CORLUX for the treatment of the psychotic symptoms of psychotic  depression and for Cushing’s Syndrome. Both of the programs are in Phase  3.
Corcept has also developed an  extensive intellectual property portfolio that covers the use of GRII  antagonists in the treatment of a wide variety of psychiatric and metabolic  disorders, including the prevention of weight gain caused by the use of  antipsychotic medication. The company has also discovered and filed  patents for the three different series of compounds which block cortisol’s  activity at the GRII receptor but do not block the progesterone receptor.  CORT 108297, a potential lead compound from these series, recently produced  encouraging results in a human microdosing study. The compound was  extremely well absorbed, demonstrated good bioavailability and had a half-life  that appears compatible with once-a-day oral dosing.
Statements made in this news release, other than  statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements, including, for  example, statements relating to Corcept’s clinical development and research  programs. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of known and  unknown risks and uncertainties that might cause actual results to differ materially  from those expressed or implied by such statements. For example, there  can be no assurances with respect to the cost, rate of spending, completion or  success of clinical trials; financial projections may not be accurate; there  can be no assurances that Corcept will pursue further activities with respect  to the development of CORLUX, CORT 108297, or any of its other selective GR-II  antagonists. These and other risk factors are set forth in the Company's  SEC filings, all of which are available from our website (www.corcept.com) or  from the SEC's website (www.sec.gov). We disclaim any intention or duty  to update any forward-looking statement made in this news release.
