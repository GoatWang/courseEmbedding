Early years[edit]
A graduate of Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland, Snyderman received his MD in 1965 from SUNY Downstate Medical Center.[10] He served his internship and residency in medicine at Duke, and later worked as a Public Health Officer doing research in immunology at the NIH.[18]
Snyderman accepted his first faculty appointment at Duke in 1972 and by 1984, he was the Frederic M. Hanes Professor of Medicine and Immunology.[10] He is a well-cited researcher in the field of inflammation and has won many awards for his seminal work on leukocyte chemotaxis.[19] Snyderman discovered C5a, a major chemotactic factor responsible for white blood cell accumulation and vascular permiability at sites of inflammation.[20][21][22] He also discovered chemotactic lymphokines, anticipating the field of chemokine research.[23][24] Snyderman has contributed to almost 400 scientific manuscripts.[25]

            Ralph Snyderman

             
                James B. Duke Professor of Medicine




 Phagocytic leukocytes including neutrophils and macrophages play a critical role in immunologically mediated host defense and tissue destruction.  These cells migrate to and become activated at sites of inflammation in response to chemoattractant factors, including -C5a, interleukin 8 (IL-8), formylated peptides (e.g. fMLP) Leukotriene B4(LTB4) and platelet activating factor (PAF).  The responses of leukocytes to chemoattractants is mediated by G protein coupled receptors.  The focus of this laboratory has been to define the mechanisms which regulate chemoattractant receptors activation, desensitization and priming. To study the mechanisms of leukocyte activation, we have developed genetic and biochemical techniques.  We constructed epitope-tagged human formylpeptide, C5a, PAF, LTB4 and IL-8 receptor cDNAs and expressed receptors either singly or multiply in a cell line which mimics responses of human inflammatory cells. These RBL-2H3 cells are a basophilic cell line which endogenously contains thrombin receptors. Using this model system, we are studying desensitization, cross-desensitization and priming, a phenomenon whereby one stimulus leads to greatly enhanced responsiveness to a second stimulus.  Our data have demonstrated an unexpected and interesting complexity in chemoattractant receptor phosphorylation and desensitization.  We have defined kinases involved in receptor desensitization. Furthermore, we have identified motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of IL-8 and PAF receptors that appear to be critical for cell activation by their respective ligands. We have also identified a new form of chemoattractant receptor desensitization, termed class desensitization.  A major effort of this laboratory is directed at defining the precise molecular events controlling leukocyte activation.

Early years[edit]
A graduate of Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland, Snyderman received his MD in 1965 from SUNY Downstate Medical Center.[10] He served his internship and residency in medicine at Duke, and later worked as a Public Health Officer doing research in immunology at the NIH.[18]
Snyderman accepted his first faculty appointment at Duke in 1972 and by 1984, he was the Frederic M. Hanes Professor of Medicine and Immunology.[10] He is a well-cited researcher in the field of inflammation and has won many awards for his seminal work on leukocyte chemotaxis.[19] Snyderman discovered C5a, a major chemotactic factor responsible for white blood cell accumulation and vascular permiability at sites of inflammation.[20][21][22] He also discovered chemotactic lymphokines, anticipating the field of chemokine research.[23][24] Snyderman has contributed to almost 400 scientific manuscripts.[25]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
