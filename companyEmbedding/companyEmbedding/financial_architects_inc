									“If your current financial plan were going to fail, when would you like to know?”  – André Davis								
André Davis serves as a Financial Planner with Financial Architects, having joined the firm in spring of 2012. Since joining the firm, he has espoused the firm’s foundational philosophy and believes in measuring the effectiveness of each dollar within his clients’ personal economy to determine the best model to increase wealth, minimize risk and maintain lifestyle.
André left a career at Ernst & Young, LLP to launch his own accounting practice in 2009, where he immediately began to realize his clients’ personal need for proven wealth accumulation and management strategies. In his more than 10-year career as an accountant and licensed CPA, he gained rich insights into what makes businesses successful. He would go on to apply that realization by asking his clients a pointed question: “If your current financial plan were going to fail, when would you like to know?”
André earned a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration & Masters of Accountancy, while playing Division I football at Bowling Green State University in Ohio.
He is an active member and Deacon at his church, Word of Faith International Christian Center in Southfield. He is also a Board Member and supporter of other nonprofit and international ministries.  Andre’s greatest joy is spending quality time with his wife and kids.
André Davis is not affiliated with The O.N. Equity Sales Company or O.N. Investment Management Company.

									“Failing to plan is planning to fail.”
– Winston Churchill								
Jon Hans joined Financial Architects in 2011. Since joining the team, Jon has leveraged 200+ years of experience from a team of advisors and now works primarily with the top 10% of wage earners. His prevailing aspiration is to become the most important financial relationship in a client’s life.
In 2009, Jon graduated from the University of Detroit Mercy with a Bachelors of Science in International Business, on a full athletic and academic scholarship. Upon graduation, he left Detroit with the hope and dream of changing the world one person at a time and would later find the perfect industry to do so— financial planning.
Jon resides in Dearborn Heights and is a former alumnus of Crestwood High School. He is a member of Christ Our Savior Lutheran Church in Livonia and has made it his mission to help teach economic principals and financial concepts to a country that is in desperate need of both.
Jon Hans is not affiliated with The O.N. Equity Sales Company or O.N. Investment Management Company.

									“Making a real difference in people’s lives is a blast. It’s also very humbling. And it’s a privilege I cherish every day.”  – Ken Grace								
Ken Grace formed Financial Architects in 1985 as an independent firm dedicated to creating long-term client relationships. His philosophy has been to attract clients who are wise and knowledgeable enough to understand what they need to do financially, but who lack the time and energy to do it effectively.
Since entering the financial services industry in 1976, Ken’s focus has been on helping clients grow their net worth while reducing their overall risk. To achieve this goal, he applies his considerable expertise at planning at a macro level—the “big picture.”
Ken is an active member of The Lakes Community Church in Walled Lake, MI and serves on several advisory boards for large national companies.
He resides in West Bloomfield with his wife Jane. They have four children and six grandchildren. Ken and his family spend quality time year-round in Northern Michigan boating, snowmobiling, hunting and fishing.

Our Approach


Our Approach
Our History
Tomorrow Always Comes


 


Plan for tomorrow
Account for today.
At Financial Architects, we plan with the future in mind…yours. But we also account for today, developing a strategic roadmap for your unique tomorrow with the understanding that any program we design must perform better today, tomorrow and at retirement.


Regardless of any product we offer, or any individual’s unique path, our strategies are custom-engineered to build wealth and minimize risk—all while allowing you to maintain your existing lifestyle. We work closely with each client to provide a blueprint for life planning, based on precision, verifiable metrics and deep-rooted principles.
We know that tomorrow always comes…we just don’t know what it will hold. With Financial Architects serving as your partner, you will be better prepared for whatever tomorrow may bring.
