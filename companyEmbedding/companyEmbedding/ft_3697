Nice 50x100 foot lot to build a home on. Great central location. The adjacent property is listed as well for the same price. That is MLS 924155. If you get both of them you would have a 100x100 foot parcel.

Important Information



  All sales on house plans and customization/modifications are final. No refunds or exchanges can be given once your order has started the fulfillment process.


  All house plans from Houseplans are designed to conform to the local codes when and where the original house was constructed.


  In addition to the house plans you order, you may also need a site plan that shows where the house is going to be located on the property. You might also need beams sized to accommodate roof loads specific to your region. Your home builder can usually help you with this. You may also need a septic design unless your lot is served by a sanitary sewer system. Many areas now have area-specific energy codes that also have to be followed. This normally involves filling out a simple form providing documentation that your house plans are in compliance.


  In some regions, there is a second step you will need to take to insure your house plans are in compliance with local codes. Some areas of North America have very strict engineering requirements. Examples of this would be, but not limited to, earthquake-prone areas of California and the Pacific Coast, hurricane risk areas of the Florida, Gulf & Carolina Coasts. New York, New Jersey, Nevada, and parts of Illinois require review by a local professional as well. If you are building in these areas, it is most likely you will need to hire a state licensed structural engineer to analyze the design and provide additional drawings and calculations required by your building department. If you aren’t sure, building departments typically have a handout they will give you listing all of the items they require to submit for and obtain a building permit.


  Additionally, stock plans do not have a professional stamp attached. If your building department requires one, they will only accept a stamp from a professional licensed in the state where you plan to build. In this case, you will need to take your house plans to a local engineer or architect for review and stamping. In addition, plans which are used to construct homes in Nevada are required to be drawn by a licensed Nevada architect.

Best Price Policy



  Some of our plans are also available on other websites and in printed catalogs. We are committed to selling these plans at or below the lowest price available elsewhere. If you find a regularly priced plan (not “on-sale”) for a lower price, we'll beat the advertised price by 5%. We will match the price for any on-sale plans.


  Once our staff is able to verify that the same plan is offered at a lower published price, Houseplans will offer the plan for sale at the lower published price less 5%. Our discount is available for immediate plan purchase only. Please call us at 1-800-913-2350.


  The advertised item must be the same plan as the product being purchased, including set type (5-copy, 8-copy, Reproducible, or CAD Set), foundation options, and any miscellaneous details. Advertised prices must be in the same currency that the original product was purchased in. Our Price Guarantee does not apply to advertising errors or misprints, special prices, restricted offers, mail order offers, rebates, coupons, premiums, free or bonus offers, OEM products, limited or minimum quantity or limited time offers, close-outs, liquidations, clearances, and special financing offers.


  Full sets of plans only, such as PDF, 5-copy, 8-copy, Reproducible, or CAD, are eligible for this offer. 1-copy Sets, Study Sets, Additional Sets, Materials Lists are not eligible for this offer.

In the early 1840s, several settlers came to an area north of Dallas. Several nearby facilities including a saw mill, gristmill, and a store lured more folks to this remote area, just north of town. Soon, mail service was established and after rejecting several names for the budding town (including naming it in honor of then-President Millard Fillmore), the locals suggested the name Plano, which they incorrectly believed to be the Spanish word for "plain," a reference to the terrain of the area. The name was accepted by the Post Office and Plano was born.
Major urban growth began in the 1970s with large office complexes and housing developments being constructed in the late 20th century. It didn't take this "plain-ole" town to become a booming financial and commercial center claiming headquarters addresses to numerous major corporations such as, Cadbury Schweppes, Ericsson, Electronic Data Systems, Frito Lay, and JCPenney. Today, Plano remains one of the fastest-growing U.S. cities and is the 9th largest in the state of Texas. 
The city has its share of notable residents. Troy Aikman, former quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys; Lance Armstrong, seven-time Tour de France winner; Steve Harvey, comedian and radio show host; and H. Ross Perot, businessman and two-time presidential candidate, all hail from Plano.
New home development is prevalent throughout Plano with many neighborhoods touting one- and two-story brick homes and manicured lawns; backyard pools are also commonplace. Additionally, you'll find million dollar mansions in the mix. Condos and Townhomes are sprinkled throughout the city as well. Quite simply, there's something for every price range here.
The Plano Independent School district serves the majority of the city, but small portions of Plano are served by the Lewisville Independent School District and the Frisco Independent School District. Plano is also home for two campuses of the Collin County Community College District.
Outdoor enthusiasts can find a lot to do with a parks and recreation system that includes playgrounds, bicycling trails, and nature preserves. The City of Plano offers numerous venues and attractions for keeping fit, family time, and fun.
Transportation in and out of the area is a snap with the addition of the Dallas Area Rapid Transit's light rail. The "Red Line" has opened stations in downtown Plano and at Parker Road making it easy to commute to downtown Dallas or other neighboring communities.  Plano is also directly served by several major freeways including I-75 (Central Expressway), the Dallas North Tollway, the President George Bush Turnpike, and SH 121.  Additionally, State Highway 289 (Preston Road) is a major thoroughfare that runs through the city.

Business is Booming in Downtown Billings, MT

                    I recently listed a two-story downtown loft in the historic Oliver Building in Billings. We don't have a lot of properties like that in this small city, but that's a situation that looks likely to change. 

If you're at all au fait with real estate you will know that listing agents use a comparative market analysis (CMA) tool to determine the asking price of a properly. So when I came to list Unit 307 at 2702 Montana Ave, Billings, I really struggled to find comparable homes.

Well with determination, frustration and some divine inspiration I settled on an asking price of $289,000 for the 1,700 sq ft unit. So far we've attracted a good bit of interest. But more surprisingly we've seen similar homes his the market in recent weeks. Looking at those home in comparison to my listing, I'm happy to say my price per square foot is highly competitive and we should be getting an offer soon.

So to return to my original statement, it does look as if things are beginning to come alive in the downtown residential property market. It would be great to see the city come to life outside of business hours. I'm sure it will be a busy, vibrant place for people who don't want the ubiquitous suburban rancher. 

Please check out my listing and let me know if this kind of lifestyle would suit you. We will also be listing similar properties in the future, and if you're into something bigger, please let me know as we are also looking at selling former commercial sites for residential use.

                    Billings West and Northwest continues to add new homes on it's new development journey towards Laurel. Closeness to major retail shopping in the West side of Billings, which draws over a half million consumers from the Montana and the surrounding States, is part of the draw for West end residents. Easy access from the West end to the Interstate means easy access to workplaces anywhere in the surrounding area.
