      ■ Steven R. Rogel, chairman, president, and chief executive officer
      of Weyerhaeuser Company, stirred up a hornet's nest when he led
      Weyerhaeuser's hostile takeover bid for Willamette Industries,
      where he had worked until jumping to the bigger company in 1997. The
      Willamette takeover pitted Rogel against the smaller company's
      chairman, who had been his mentor for much of the Rogel's 25 years
      with Willamette. Although Rogel and Weyerhaeuser ultimately prevailed, it
      took more than a year to hammer out a deal acceptable to Willamette. In
      the end, Weyerhaeuser had to raise its bid substantially from the initial
      offer and Rogel had to endure vitriolic attacks from Willamette's
      executives and workers.
    

      Rogel's relationship with Willamette chairman William
      Swindells—that of protégé and mentor during
      Rogel's 25 years at the Oregon-based forest-products
      company—had gone sour the day Rogel announced his plans to leave
      and take a job with its bigger rival, Weyerhaeuser. According to Stanley

      Holmes of 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
      , Swindells insisted that Rogel leave the company immediately, and the two
      had not spoken since. Despite the bitterness he knew the takeover bid
      would generate among his onetime colleagues at Willamette, Rogel said he
      was comforted by his certainty that the acquisition would benefit both
      companies. "I slept well at night," he told Holmes (March
      11, 2002). "I was doing the right thing not just for Weyerhaeuser
      but for good friends at Willamette."
    

      One of America's largest forest-products companies, Weyerhaeuser
      has fared well under Rogel's leadership. In addition to its
      expansion through the acquisition of Willamette, the company significantly
      increased its revenue in the opening years of the new millennium. Total
      sales climbed from roughly $15.9 billion in 2000 to nearly $20 billion in
      2003. The company harvests timber not only in North America but also from
      such far-flung woodlands as those of Australia, France, Ireland,
       New Zealand, and Uruguay. Weyerhaeuser produces a wide range of forest
      products, including solid wood products, pulp and paper, containerboard,
      and packaging materials. The company's real estate division
      develops both residential building lots and single-family housing for
      sale. Asked by 
      
        PaperAge
      
       editor-in-chief Jack O'Brien to summarize his business philosophy,
      Rogel said, "I believe that people who are successful must have
      first a good battle plan and then stick with it" (March 2003).
    

      RAISED IN GRAIN COUNTRY OF EASTERN WASHINGTON
    

      Rogel, born in Ritzville, Washington, on October 25, 1942, grew up in the
      grain-growing and livestock-raising country of eastern Washington. After
      finishing high school in Ritzville, he enrolled at the University of
      Washington in Seattle to study chemical engineering. His interest in the
      forest-products industry was awakened during a 1964 summer internship at
      the Tacoma kraft mill of St. Regis Paper Company. Rogel told 
      
        PaperAge
      
       that the experience convinced him of the value of internships.
      "They bring you into the real world. Even though I was a chemical
      engineer and had opportunities to enter the chemical and oil industries, I
      chose forest products" (March 2003).
    

      In 1964, a year before graduating from the University of Washington, Rogel
      married Connie Schuler, his high school sweetheart. Fresh out of college,
      Rogel took a job with St. Regis, where he remained until 1970. He next
      moved to the other side of the continent, taking a job as assistant
      manager at St. Anne–Nackawic Pulp and Paper in Nackawic, New
      Brunswick, Canada. Two years later he got an offer to work as a technical
      director in the Albany, Oregon, facility of Western Kraft, which was soon
      to become part of Willamette Industries. Thus began a career of about 25
      years with Willamette.
    

      Quickly singled out as a promising candidate for a top management
      position, Rogel moved rapidly up the ladder at Willamette. After holding
      several management positions at the company's Albany, Oregon, and
      Campti, Louisiana, mills, he was elected a vice president in 1979. Nine
      years later he was named executive vice president, and in 1991 he became
      Willamette's president and chief operating officer. Groomed as a
      successor to the company's longtime chairman and CEO, William
      Swindells, Rogel took over as Willamette's CEO on October 1, 1995.
      Swindells, however, remained as chairman.
    

      WON PRAISE AS WILLAMETTE'S CEO
    

      Over the next two years, Rogel's leadership of Willamette won
      plaudits from Wall Street analysts. Less than a year after taking over as
      CEO, Rogel engineered Willamette's acquisition of nearly 400,000
      acres of prime forestland in Oregon's Pacific Coast and Cascade
      ranges, making the company the biggest private landowner in the state. In
      an interview with Hal Bernton of the 
      
        Oregonian
      
       (June 25, 1997), Rogel said that his goal for Willamette was to be
      recognized as "one of the outstanding companies in the industry,
      not only for financial performance but also for safety, environmental
      policies, and contributions to local communities." In 1996,
      Willamette's first full year under Rogel as CEO, the company
      managed to post net earnings of $192 million on revenue of $3.4 billion
      despite the impact of soft markets on Willamette's paper and pulp
      mills.
    

      Rogel maintained Willamette's well-established reputation for
      strong growth and high rates of return on investment. In the five years
      that ended December 31, 1996, the company generated an average annual rate
      of return of 21 percent. According to Morgan Stanley forest-products
      analyst Matt Berler, quoted in the 
      
        Oregonian
      
      , "Willamette is the premier company in the pulp and paper
      industry" (June 25, 1997). Berler added that the company had
      generated "the highest, most consistent returns in the industry and
      … sustained the fastest growth rate."
    

      Although Rogel said that he was happy at Willamette, which for its part
      seemed pleased with the job he was doing as CEO, in 1997 he received an
      offer he felt that he could not refuse. Rogel told O'Brien of 
      
        PaperAge
      
       (March 2003) that he was first approached by Jack Creighton, who was then
      Weyerhaeuser's president and CEO, and later contacted by George
      Weyerhaeuser Sr., the company's chairman and great-grandson of its
      founder. Both told Rogel they wanted to bring changes to Weyerhaeuser and
      felt that he was the man to do the job. "This presented a challenge
      I couldn't resist—the professional challenge of my entire
      career!"
    

      DEPARTURE ANGERED WILLAMETTE EXECUTIVES
    

      Rogel's decision to leave Willamette for Weyerhaeuser was not at
      all well received by the former's executives, particularly
      Swindells, who saw their CEO's defection to a larger rival as a
      betrayal. Weyerhaeuser, for its part, was delighted that Rogel had been
      persuaded to join the company as its new president and CEO. Many observers
      found the hiring a bit surprising, given Weyerhaeuser's previous
      record of filling its top executive positions from within. However, in
      announcing the appointment, Creighton made clear that the company had
      chosen Rogel because "he is a proven leader at the CEO
      level," according to the 
      
        Seattle Post-Intelligencer
      
       (November 18, 1997).
    

      Rogel wasted no time in defining his vision of a new, more focused,
      nimble, and efficient Weyerhaeuser. Within months of coming on as CEO in
      December 1997, he took steps to rationalize Weyerhaeuser's
      corporate structure, began using the
       company's buying power as leverage in its dealings with major
      suppliers, and put greater emphasis on Weyerhaeuser's core
      businesses. He also moved quickly to grow the company's holdings,
      acquiring MacMillan Bloedel, a Canadian forest-products company; TJ
      International, MacMillan Bloedel's partner in Trus Joist MacMillan;
      and three Canadian mills owned by Bowater.
    

      WILLAMETTE TAKEN OVER
    

      The next step in Rogel's long-term strategy for
      Weyerhaeuser—the acquisition of Willamette—revived and
      intensified all the ill feelings that had first been generated by his
      decision to leave more than three years earlier. In what was to be a
      lengthy war of wills, Rogel fired the opening shot on November 6, 2000,
      when he offered Willamette's shareholders $48 per share for their
      stock. In addition, Weyerhaeuser's offer provided for the
      assumption of roughly $1.7 billion in Willamette debt, bringing the total
      value of the offer to about $7 billion. Willamette's board quickly
      rejected the hostile takeover bid, hoping to slam the door on
      Weyerhaeuser's un-welcome acquisition campaign.
    

      Rogel had no intention of giving up that easily, however. As he told
      Holmes in 
      
        BusinessWeek
      
      , "I knew [the takeover bid] would be upsetting to them [Willamette
      management] and come back on me personally" (March 11, 2002). Over
      the next 14 months or so, the battle got very personal indeed. Willamette
      executives taped a picture of Rogel to a voodoo doll and stuck pins into
      it, and thousands of Willamette's workers wore buttons that read
      "Just Say No Wey." Despite the personal attacks, Rogel
      continued to press the bid. Weyerhaeuser's offer was steadily
      sweetened, eventually reaching $55.50 per share, which with the assumption
      of debt, brought the total price for Willamette to about $7.9 billion. In
      January 2002 Willamette finally accepted the offer, and in March 2002 the
      company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Weyerhaeuser.
    

      Although the standoff between Weyerhaeuser and Willamette had been
      unpleasant, in the end, Rogel told 
      
        PaperAge
      
      , "Willamette people came with the attitude, 'we may not
      have wanted this, but let's get on with it and make the very best
      company we can'" (March 2003). To facilitate the integration
      of his latest acquisition into the Weyerhaeuser corporate structure, Rogel
      tapped a number of Willamette people from throughout the company for
      management positions at Weyerhaeuser.
    

      CONCENTRATING ON WEYERHAEUSER
    

      With the Willamette acquisition behind him, Rogel in early 2003 began to
      focus his energies on making Weyerhaeuser "lean, nimble, quick,
      opportunistic," according to 
      
        Official Board Markets
      
       (April 19, 2003). He told shareholders that the company must reinvent
      itself to increase both its efficiency and its profitability. He suggested
      that short-term priorities might include expansion of
      Weyerhaeuser's international operations, a critical reassessment of
      its wood and paper operations, and redoubled effort to control expenses.
      He told 
      
        Official Board Markets
      
       that company employees had been told: "You're going to find
      our workplace of the future fulfilling, exciting, and rewarding if
      you're the kind of person who is customer-focused and
      results-oriented" (April 19, 2003).
    

      In addition to his responsibilities at Weyerhaeuser, Rogel sat on the
      boards of various forest-products industry organizations, including the
      World Forestry Center, Wood Promotion Network, and American Forest
      & Paper Association. He also served as a director of Kroger Company
      and Union Pacific Corporation and a trustee of Pacific University. Rogel
      was vice president of administration for the Western Region of the Boy
      Scouts of America. In 2001 Rogel was picked as Global CEO of the Year in a
      survey of forest-products analysts conducted by 
      
        Pulp & Paper
      
       and 
      
        PPI
      
       magazines, and in 2003 he was named Executive Papermaker of the Year by 
      
        PaperAge
      
       magazine.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
