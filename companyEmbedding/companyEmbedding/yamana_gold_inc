Better Buy: Yamana Gold Inc. vs. Agnico Eagle Mines
One gleaming gold miner glimmers a lot more than the other.












                Scott Levine
            

                (TMFProudMonkey)



            
            Jun 27, 2017 at 1:19PM
            
            





The price of gold has fallen 1.8% through June, and it may very well continue its retreat following the Federal Reserve's mid-June announcement that it's raising its benchmark interest rate to a range of 1% to 1.25% by the end of the year. With gold mining stocks likely to also fall, now is a good time to see where the opportunities lie. So let's consider two leading gold miners, Yamana Gold (NYSE:AUY) and Agnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM), to see which one offers the more compelling argument for investment.
A round of introductions
Headquartered in Canada, Yamana maintains a portfolio of assets strictly located in the Americas. Similarly, Agnico also has a strong presence in the Americas, but it also operates overseas: one gold-producing mine in Finland and several projects in the exploration phase scattered throughout Scandinavia.

The most decisive factors, though, transcend cursory looks at the companies' assets, so let's compare them on some important metrics to gain better insight.



Company
 Market Cap
FY 2016 Revenue 
FY 2016 EarningsPper Share 
FY 2016 Operating Margin 
FY 2016 Return on Equity 


Yamana Gold
$2.5 billion
$1.79 billion
($0.33)
(26.5%)
(6.58%) 


Agnico Eagle 
$11.0 billion
$2.13 billion
$0.70
11.4%
3.68% 



Data source: Morningstar.
A brief look suggests Agnico Eagle is more lustrous, but let's see what we find when we dig in further.
A tale of two miners
Reporting gold production of 1.66 million ounces in fiscal 2016, Agnico Eagle's higher revenue for the year is unsurprising, since Yamana produced only 1.27 million ounces. More importantly, though, is how the companies have fared over the past several years.

AUY Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts
From two different perspectives, Agnico Eagle appears more desirable. Unlike Yamana -- which has reported declining sales -- Agnico Eagle has improved its top line at at a steady clip, and it has reported even greater EBITDA growth. Yamana, however, has reported negative EBITDA in each of the past three years.
The companies' margins provide another reason Agnico Eagle is more attractive. Although it forecasts all-in sustaining costs (AISC) between $850 and $900 per gold ounce for fiscal 2017 -- higher than the $824 it reported in fiscal 2017 -- it wouldn't be surprising if the company performs better, as it has beaten its guidance in each of the past three years. Conversely, Yamana reported AISC (on a co-product basis) of $911 per gold ounce in fiscal 2016 -- far worse than its guidance of $840. In fiscal 2017, it estimates AISC between $890 and $910.
Winner: Agnico Eagle.





A delicate balancing act
Though Yamana offers a less attractive income statement, perhaps its balance sheet will give Agnico Eagle a run for its money.



Company
Debt-to-Equity
Quick Ratio


Yamana
0.35
0.44


Agnico Eagle
0.24
1.71



Data source:Morningstar.
Again, Agnico Eagle shimmers more brightly than Yamana, this time in terms of liquidity. According to its quick ratio, Agnico Eagle retains 1.71 times the amount of liquid assets -- cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and short-term investments -- as it does immediate liabilities, suggesting that it's better suited than Yamana to withstand a fast downturn in the price of gold. Agnico Eagle's conservative approach to leverage further illustrates its enviable position relative to Yamana. Whereas Agnico Eagle reported a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.05 at the end of fiscal 2016, according to Morningstar, Yamana ended the same year with $1.477 billion in net debt and negative EBITDA.
Yamana sought to strengthen its balance sheet in 2016 by divesting non-core assets Ernesto Pau-a-Pique and Mercedes. Attempting to optimize its portfolio, Yamana's management has identified a long-term goal of achieving a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio below 1.5. Unlike its peer, Agnico Eagle hasn't resorted to divesting its assets. In fact, it sought to improve its portfolio by acquiring Osisko Mining in 2014. Yamana, however, doesn't intend to seek acquisitions in the immediate future, relying instead on organic growth.
Winner: Agnico Eagle.
Mining the gold to generate the green
Finally, let's compare the companies in terms of cash flow. 

AUY Cash from Operations (Annual) data by YCharts
Our look at Yamana has revealed some sources of concern, but the company deserves credit for its improved operational cash flow -- something extremely helpful for the company's future success. If it continues growth in its operational cash flow, it may be less reliant on assuming more debt; in fact, it may be able to extend its debt-reduction initiative beyond the $370 million reduction it has reported since the end of 2014.
Although Yamana deserves kudos for its operational cash-flow growth, Agnico Eagle wins in terms of free cash flow, reporting positive free cash flow in four out of the past five years. By the same measure, Yamana has only reported a positive amount twice. Much of Yamana's capital expenditure relates to the construction of Cerro Moro, which is expected to emerge as a core mine after it commences production in 2018. Like Yamana, Agnico Eagle is also committed to organic growth of its portfolio, illustrated by the development of the Meliadine mine. This, among other projects, will result in negative free cash flow over the next two years, according to management; however, it expects to be free cash flow positive again in 2019.
In light of Agnico Eagle's 3.89% return on invested capital at the end of fiscal 2016 compared with Yamana's negative-3.98%, I have more faith in Agnico Eagle's capex spending than that of Yamana.
Winner: Agnico Eagle.





And the winner is...
Which gold miner offers the more compelling argument for investment? Undoubtedly, it's Agnico Eagle. Although Yamana's price tag seems more attractive -- it trades at 1.4 times trailing sales, compared with Agnico Eagle's 5.0 -- it's not enough to compensate for the numerous ways in which Agnico Eagle outshines Yamana.

Better Buy Now: Yamana Gold Inc. vs. Agnico Eagle Mines
While Agnico Eagle looks operationally stronger, Yamana Gold is trading cheaper. So which one should you buy?











                Neha Chamaria
            

                (Nehams)



            
            Mar 23, 2017 at 1:17PM
            
            





All that glitters is not gold. Or so appears to be the case with some gold stocks right now. While players across the gold industry have taken a beating in recent months, Agnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM) and Yamana Gold Inc. (NYSE:AUY) have been hit particularly hard. They're down nearly 21% and 41%, respectively, in the past six months. Compare that to the relative resilience that larger gold miners like Barrick Gold (NYSE:ABX) and Goldcorp Inc. (NYSE:GG) have displayed and you're bound to wonder whether there's trouble brewing at Agnico and Yamana.

AEM data by YCharts.
If you ask me, I think the big price drops in both stocks offer a great opportunity for precious metal investors. But how do Agnico and Yamana stack up and which one should you buy? It's a tough match, as you shall soon see, but one stock looks particularly compelling right now based on three key aspects.
1. AISC: Agnico leads
Gold prices aside, two other factors drive a gold miner's profits: production and costs. While production can differ considerably depending on the size and scale of a miner, costs are where things get really interesting because in a volatile industry like precious metals, low costs can prove to be one of the strongest competitive advantages.

Image source: Getty Images.

Gold miners use all-in sustaining cost, or AISC, to measure costs, which is a comprehensive metric that includes nearly every element of operating expenses. From a cost standpoint, Agnico had a strong 2016 as it beat its own target and ended the year with AISC of only about $824 per ounce, substantially lower than Yamana's 2016 AISC of $911 an ounce. It's worth noting, though, that Yamana reports AISC on a co-product basis or before deducting by-product metal revenues from production costs. Agnico's co-product AISC was $894 per ounce last year.
Agnico is clearly more cost efficient than Yamana, but its investment thesis gets even stronger when you stack it against other players in the industry.

Agnico Eagle
$824


Yamana Gold
$911


Barrick Gold
$730


Goldcorp
$856


Newmont Mining
$912



Data source: Companies' financials. 
You guessed it right: Agnico is among the lowest-cost producers in the industry today -- a status unlikely to change in 2017 given the miner's projected full-year AISC of $850-$900 an ounce versus Yamana's AISC guidance of $890-$910 an ounce. Agnico clearly wins this round.
2. Cash flows: Yamana makes the cut
Do you wonder why most miners suffer losses or barely make profits even when precious metal prices are on the rise? I believe net income isn't a great metric metric to judge a miner's standing. That's because the nature of the mining business is such that miners periodically revalue their reserves based on spot prices, which could mean big writedowns when prices are falling as exploration and development of mines becomes unviable.
That's not to say the mines aren't valuable anymore, but miners still end up with huge non-cash expenditures (read: writedowns) that make their profits look smaller than what they really are. Remember how Barrick sent shockwaves through the industry when it announced writedowns worth $3 billion early last year? Now here's the deal: Barrick ended 2016 with net profit worth only about $861 million but generated operating and free cash flows worth nearly $2.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.
The point I'm trying to drive home is that if you want to see how healthy a gold miner is, focus on its cash flows instead of profits. Here again, Agnico trumps Yamana in terms of growth in cash flows in recent years.

AUY cash from operations (TTM.) Data source: YCharts.
Let me warn you that Agnico's free cash flow could suffer for a year or two as it spends money on developing its Meliadine and Meadowbank mines in northern Canada, having recently reversed asset impairments on them. Agnico expects to start production at both mines by the third quarter of 2019, which should push its total its production to 2 million ounces by 2020 from about 1.6 million of ounces for 2019.
In contrast, I expect Yamana's cash flows to improve going forward as it brings its seventh mine, Cerro Moro, on line by early next year. Yamana's efforts to strengthen its balance sheet -- it recently spun off subsidiary Brio Gold and hasn't ruled out the possibility of selling its stake in Brio to raise cash to invest in growth and repay debt -- should provide further support.
It's a tight call, but I believe Yamana wins this round given its immediate cash flow potential.





3. Valuation: The winner is...
So far, it's a tie, so the final decision boils down to valuation. My favorite valuation metrics are based on cash flow, especially when it comes to mining stocks.

AUY price to CFO per share (TTM). Data source: YCharts.
It's a clear verdict: Yamana looks incredibly undervalued on a cash flow basis. When you factor in the growth potential in its cash flows in coming years, the stock could turn out to be a bigger winner than Agnico.

How Yamana Gold Inc. Makes Most of Its Money
Grab a pickax and dig in to see how Yamana Gold makes its green.











                Scott Levine
            

                (TMFProudMonkey)



            
            Jul 10, 2017 at 8:32AM
            
            





As volatility continues to grow thanks to the current political environment, many investors are turning their focus to gold. Consequently, now seems like a good time to get to know the industry leaders a little better. For example, one may assume Yamana Gold (NYSE:AUY) earns its keep by dealing in the yellow metal; however, the company also deals in silver and copper. Whereas it reported $1.79 billion in sales for fiscal 2016, gold sales accounted for $1.47 billion -- 82% of overall revenue -- according to its annual report; revenue from copper sales and silver sales were 11% and 6%, respectively. 
This is just a glance, so let's dig in deeper and learn how prominently the sale of gold plays in the company's portfolio.

Image source: Getty Images.

Perusing the portfolio 
Of Yamana's six gold-producing mines, Canadian Malartic is the company's only operating asset in the Great White North, but the company certainly doesn't leave it out in the cold. The mine -- in which Yamana holds a 50% interest and Agnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM) holds the other 50% -- is one of the largest gold-producing mines in Canada. According to Yamana's 2016 annual report, Canadian Malartic was Yamana's largest gold-producing mine in fiscal 2016.

Image source: Yamana Gold.

And thanks to higher throughput and recovery rate, the mine achieved record annual production: 292,514 gold ounces. For context, El Penon was the company's second-most productive mine, reporting 220,209 gold ounces.
Of course, how much gold is produced is relative to the expense of digging it out of the ground. Although management doesn't break out the earnings generated by gold for each mine, one can gain some insight into the mines' profitability by examining their all-in sustaining costs (AISC). In this regard, Chapada, located in Brazil, produces the highest margin. In fiscal 2016, Chapada reported co-product AISC of $478 per gold ounce. Canadian Malartic generated the second-highest margin; it reported AISC of $795 per gold ounce. Chapada's superior profitability becomes even more apparent from another perspective: It reported a total cost of sales per gold ounce sold of $489 while El Penon -- next lowest -- reported a total cost of sales per gold ounce sold of $1,019.
Lastly, we can gain another perspective on how Yamana makes its money by extending our perspective beyond just gold. Taking into account all minerals produced at the mines, El Penon contributed the most -- $381 million -- to the company's top line in fiscal 2016. But the bottom line belongs to Canadian Malartic. Excluding non-cash charges, it reported a gross profit of $188 million.
A golden horizon
Just as the yellow stuff contributed the most to the company's earnings in 2016, it will presumably continue to play a prominent role in the years ahead. Because of decreased production at El Penon, management expects a year-over-year decrease in gold production in fiscal 2017. Looking farther out, though, management foresees growth from an estimated 940,000 ounces in 2017 to 1.1 million ounces in 2019.
The company's growth will come primarily from the commencement of gold production at projects that are currently in development -- not through acquisitions. The project that plays most prominently in this outlook is Cerro Moro, which management believes will emerge as its next cornerstone mine. According to management's estimates, Cerro Moro will produce 80,000 ounces of gold in 2018, when it begins production; moreover, management expects the mine to yield gold production of 130,000 ounces in 2019. Further demonstrating its importance, Cerro Moro is expected to be one of the company's more profitable mines, averaging AISC less than $600 per gold ounce in 2018 and 2019.
Besides Cerro Moro, Yamana has two other projects near completion that will help the company grow its gold-production. Suruca is expected to contribute approximately 40,000 ounces annually to Chapada's gold production when it commences operations in 2019. Moreover, gold production is expected to increase at Canadian Malartic, when the Barnat extension commences operations in 2018.





Investor takeaway
Playing supporting roles, silver and copper sales pale in comparison with how much money Yamana makes from gold. Although Canadian Malartic -- the company's lone operation in the country -- is one of the most prominent players in its portfolio, it's the companies assets in Brazil which contributed the most -- 39% of total revenue -- in fiscal 2016.
Because the company is solely relying on organic growth in the near future, it's important for investors to monitor the development of Cerro Moro. Once the project commences operations, look for it to achieve management's estimates for gold production in 2018 and 2019. But, more importantly, confirm that the mine's AISC are less than $600 per ounce, for failure to achieve success at Cerro More could greatly detract from what management foresees as a lustrous future.
