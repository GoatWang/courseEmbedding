Portfolio

Here are some of our latest projects.











Basic Trauma Care For Educators
This short promotional film was another joint project between E Shift Productions and King County Medic One. It explains the growing epidemic of school shootings. It also outlines a class that King County Medic One offers, in conjunction with law enforcement, to provide teachers with a basic medical skill set to treat students and colleagues who are critically injured. 

Production
The footage was obtained at a regional active shooter drill at Tahoma Junior High School. Many paramedic, police, and fire units were involved in this very realistic exercise.
Post Production
Editing occurred on an iMac equipped with Adobe Premiere Pro. Titling and graphics were crafted in After Effects, Illustrator, and Photoshop. Color grading was done with SpeedGrade.
Client
King County Medic One
Camera
Panasonic AF-100, Canon XF-105, GoPro Hero3 Black, and a Sony RX-100
Date
January 2014









Tactical Helicopter Night Operations
We at E Shift Productions work closely with many public safety agencies, including the King County Sheriff’s Office (KCSO). This video shows a small portion of a training video produced for the KCSO Swat Team, known as Tac 30. It shows law enforcement personnel rapidly deploying from a helicopter onto a ship.

Preproduction
Two days of test footage were generated to identify the correct infrared settings, lens combinations, filters, lighting, and diffusion.
Production
In order to accomplish this shoot, we had to fabricate several custom-built infrared lights.

King County Medic One Promotional Video
This video was created to serve two purposes: first, King County Medic One wanted a recruitment video that would answer many of the frequently asked questions posed by potential hires. Second, the department wanted the video to be shown to the general public, so people can better understand the role these Advanced Life Support (ALS) providers play in the community.

Preproduction
Two weeks of preproduction generated a loose shooting schedule (for interviews), outline, and production concepts.
Production
The majority of this video was shot documentary-style, with a small film crew following King County Medic One paramedics throughout their lifesaving shifts. Interviews were staged in or near King County Medic One apparatus. 

Due to the highly unpredictable filming environment, principal photography lasted approximately three months.
Post Production
Due to the documentary nature of this video, the final product was truly formed during post production. Weaving a narrative from interviews, writing narration, and choosing the best clips from over 20 hours of individually-logged footage took the better part of two weeks.

Motion graphics for the title sequence were constructed from scratch in Blender, and animated in After Effects. This process took approximately four days.

The remaining two weeks of postproduction consisted of: (1) color grading, correction, and shot matching; (2) audio post production; and (3) incorporating the feedback from targeted focus groups.

Hot Air Balloons Over Prosser
In September 2012, our Director of Photography, Jeff Allen, took a field trip to the Prosser Balloon Rally. This time lapse sequence documents the majestic beauty of these balloons as they traverse the landscape of Eastern Washington. Principal photography occurred completely on the Canon XF-105, with Adobe CS6 providing all of the post-production capabilities. The footage was gathered over approximately three days; editing and color grading took approximately six hours.

Care Under Fire — Traffic Stop
“Care Under Fire” is a curriculum developed jointly by King County Medic One and King County Sheriff’s Office to train police officers in basic lifesaving first aid, while maintaining tactical discipline. This is the second video produced for the class; it shows a King County deputy shot during a routine traffic stop, and shows the application of a single tourniquet to stop arterial bleeding. Preproduction took approximately two weeks, production lasted one 12 hour day, and post production also took two weeks.

Preproduction
This project required significant prep time, as it included multiple special effects, crane shots, and some visual effects work. Our production design team also redesigned the special effects wound rig for a more dramatic show of arterial bleeding.
Production
A single 12 hour day, with a crew of six.
Post Production
Beyond the usual editing and production sound design, this project required rotoscoping/removal of special effects equipment and personnel, as well as some light visual effects work.
Client

Camera
Canon XF-105, Panasonic AF-100 with Atomos Samurai for 4:2:2 color space
Post Production Tools

Date
August 2012









Care Under Fire — Disturbance
“Care Under Fire” is a curriculum developed jointly by King County Medic One and King County Sheriff’s Office to train police officers in basic lifesaving first aid, while maintaining tactical discipline. This is the first video produced for the class; it shows two King County Sheriff’s deputies responding to a routine disturbance: an argument in a workplace. Unfortunately, things soon go awry, and a King County deputy is shot in the leg. The video shows the application of two tourniquets to stop major arterial bleeding, as well as the correct method of tactical patient extraction. Preproduction took approximately one week, production lasted one 14 hour day, and post production took two weeks.

Preproduction
This project required a moderate amount of preparation, as the special effects for the blood were custom-engineered by our production design crew. A moulage expert was contracted to outline a special effects makeup plan.
Production
A single 14 hour day, with a crew of six.
Post Production
Beyond the usual editing and production sound design, this project required rotoscoping/removal of special effects equipment, and some Automated Dialog Replacement (ADR) to fix some problem audio. The ADR was completed at no additional cost to the client, as it was a result of an equipment issue. Thus proving, WE GUARANTEE OUR WORK 100%!

Lifepak 15 Transmission
E Shift Productions developed this video for King County Medic One as a part of an instructional video series for field paramedics. It outlines the steps necessary to transmit patient case information to local hospitals. Preproduction took one day, with three hours of shooting, and one day of postproduction.
The title sequence was created in Apple Motion, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Photoshop.

We were pleased and honored to be invited to document an annual training event for the King County Sheriff’s Office (KCSO). On October 29, 2012, we joined the tactical divisions of King County Sheriff’s Office, Seattle Police, Washington State Patrol, and the Coast Guard on board a Washington State Ferry.
As SWAT teams practiced ferry-specific maneuvers, two E Shift Productions film crews documented the event. Within the next few months, we will release a video showing the highlights of the day. Until then, enjoy the following still images captured from our footage. Expect the full video soon!

INITIAL CONSULTATION
Need something unusual? Not sure if it’s even possible? We provide a free initial consultation. Why wouldn’t we? After all, it’s just another opportunity to talk about doing what we love. We recognize that you have unique needs, and a vision for how you want your content portrayed. Together, we discuss the options and decide on a course of action.
Should you choose to retain our services, we provide you with a confidential Project Brief, and continue on to…







PREPARATION (Pre-Production)
Once we have helped to identify your needs, we move on to the next step. Here, we flesh out all of the elements we need to turn your big ideas into reality. In this phase, we think through the whole process: shaping the story, crafting storyboards, casting, finalizing cinematography, etc. In addition to these “big ticket” items, we also work to ensure all of the little details are in place. We then create a proprietary “shoot manual” that outlines EVERYTHING. After all, a well-prepared shoot is fast, efficient and cost-effective…







THE SHOOT (Production)
Armed with the shoot manual and your feedback, we proceed to the production phase. From set design to lighting to camera movement, our experienced crew works to achieve the highest possible production quality. Once your images are obtained, we utilize the latest digital backup technology to ensure the safety and security of the captured footage.







TYING IT ALL TOGETHER (Post-Production)
Once we have the raw footage “in the can”, we proceed to apply the latest in postproduction technology to achieve the finest end result. We carefully catalog all footage, and then our editors work to seamlessly integrate it. We handle the majority of custom graphics and visual FX in-house, and tie it all together with custom motion titling. To top it all off, digital color correction and grading gives your finished footage a professional polish.
After a screening, and your approval, we provide you with the delivery media and raw footage!

The Role of Test Footage





During production, time is money. There is no time to guess, and hope it works. A little preparation goes a long way, and a lot of preparation ensures success. Thus, previsualization (previs, in industry speak) is a crucial aspect of the preproduction process. Whether one uses storyboards, complex 3-D renders, or scratch video to previsualize →

The Democrats’ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the party’s commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.
