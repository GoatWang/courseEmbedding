CHANSOO JOUNG, 56, joined the company’s board of directors in February 2011. He chairs the Audit Committee and is a member of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee.
From 2005 to 2015, Joung was a partner and then senior advisor at Warburg Pincus LLC. He was responsible for making and monitoring investments in all sectors of the energy industry, including upstream, gas and gas liquids processing and transportation, and electric power. He was also responsible for global coordination of the firm’s renewables activities, including wind, solar, biofuels and grid storage. From 1987 to 2004, Joung was employed by Goldman Sachs where he held increasingly senior positions, culminating his 17-year career as head of the Americas Natural Resources Group in the investment banking division. His other leadership responsibilities in the investment banking division included stints as co-head of recruiting and co-head of women’s and diversity recruitment and development.
Prior to joining Apache’s board, Joung served as a director on two other NYSE-listed company boards: Targa Resources Partners LP from 2007 to 2011, and Targa Resources Corporation from 2010 to 2011. He also served as a director on a number of private company boards during his tenure at Warburg Pincus.
Currently, Joung is a consultant for TPH Asset Management LLC, an affiliate of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.
Joung has spent almost his entire career in the finance industry working with energy companies. Through his experiences in private equity and as an investment banker, Joung gained significant experience with energy companies, the energy industry and energy-related capital markets and mergers and acquisitions activity, which enhance his contributions to the Board. Those experiences have also given Joung the ability to identify, assess and manage risk that can affect a large energy company like Apache.
