F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG is a Swiss multinational healthcare company that operates worldwide under two divisions: Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. Its holding company, Roche Holding AG, has bearer shares listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange. The company headquarters are located in Basel.
The company controls the American biotechnology company Genentech, which is a wholly owned affiliate, and the Japanese biotechnology company Chugai Pharmaceuticals, as well as the United States-based Ventana. Roche's revenues during fiscal year 2016 were 50.58 billion Swiss francs,[2] or approximately US$50 billion. Roche is the third-largest pharma company worldwide.[3] Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families own slightly over half of the bearer shares with voting rights (a pool of family shareholders 45%, and Maja Oeri a further 5% apart), with Swiss pharma firm Novartis owning a further third of its shares. Roche is one of the few companies increasing their dividend every year, for 2016 as the 30th consecutive year.[4] F. Hoffmann-La Roche is a full member of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA).[5]

History[edit]
Founded in 1896 by Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche, the company was early on known for producing various vitamin preparations and derivatives. In 1934, it became the first company to mass-produce synthetic vitamin C, under the brand name Redoxon. In 1957 it introduced the class of tranquilizers known as benzodiazepines (with Valium and Rohypnol being the best known members). It manufactures and sells several cancer drugs and is a leader in this field. In 1956, the first antidepressant, iproniazid, was accidentally created during an experiment while synthesizing isoniazid. Originally, it had been intended to create a more efficient drug at combatting Tuberculosis. Iproniazid, however, revealed to have its own benefits; some people felt it made them feel happier. It was withdrawn from the market in the early 1960s due to toxic side-effects.
In 1976, an accident at a chemical factory in Seveso, Italy, owned by a subsidiary of Roche caused a large dioxin contamination; see Seveso disaster. In 1982, the United States arm of the company acquired Biomedical Reference Laboratories for US$163.5 million. That company dated from the late 1960s, and was located in Burlington, North Carolina. That year Hoffmann–La Roche then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical became one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with 20 major laboratories and US$600 million in sales.[6]
Roche has also produced various HIV tests and antiretroviral drugs. It bought the patents for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique in 1992. In 1995 the era of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) was initiated by the United States FDA's approval of Hoffman LaRoche's HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir. Within 2 years of its approval (and that of ritonavir 4 months later) annual deaths from AIDS in the United States fell from over 50,000 to approximately 18,000 [7] On 28 April 1995 Hoffmann–La Roche sold Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. to National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc. (which then changed its name to Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings).[8] Roche acquired Syntex in 1994 and Chugai Pharmaceuticals in 2002.
Oseltamivir is considered to be the primary antiviral drug used to combat avian influenza, commonly known as the bird flu. Roche is the only drug company authorized to manufacture the drug, which was discovered by Gilead Sciences. Roche purchased the rights to the drug in 1996 and in 2005 settled a royalty dispute, agreeing to pay Gilead tiered royalties of 14–22% of annual net sales without adjusting the payments for manufacturing costs, as had been allowedin the original licensing agreement.[9]
On 20 October 2005, Hoffmann–La Roche decided to license other companies to manufacture Oseltamivir.[10]
Also in 2005, Roche acquired the Swiss company GlycArt Biotechnology in order to acquire technology to afucosylate antibodies; one of its products in development was obinutuzumab, which gained FDA approval in November 2013 for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.[11][12][13]
On 22 January 2008, Roche acquired Ventana Medical Systems for $3.4 billion.[14] On 2 January 2009, Roche acquired Memory Pharmaceuticals Corp.[15] On 26 March, Roche acquired Genentech for $46.8 billion.[16] On 12 March 2009 Roche agreed to fully acquire Genentech, in which it had held a majority stake since 1990,[17] after 8 months of negotiations. As a result of the Genentech acquisition, Roche closed its Palo Alto based research facilities and moved them to their campus that straddles the border between Clifton, New Jersey and Nutley, New Jersey while Roche's United States headquarters, located on the site since 1929, was moved to Genentech's facility in South San Francisco.[18] Genentech became a wholly owned subsidiary group of Roche on 25 March 2009.[19]
On 13 April, Roche acquired Medingo Ltd., for $160 million.[20] On 23 August 2010, Roche acquired BioImagene, Inc., for $100 million.[21] In 2011, the company received the ISPE Facility of the Year Award for Process Innovation for Roche’s "MyDose" Clinical Supply project.[22] On 15 March, Roche acquired PVT Probenverteiltechnik GmbH for up to 85 million EUR.[23] On 19 July, Roche acquired mtm laboratories AG for up to 190 million EUR.[24] On 17 October, Roche acquired Anadys Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for $230 million.[25]
On 26 June 2012, Roche announced the closure of the Nutley/Clifton campus, which was completed in 2013. The property is in the process of remediation.[26] On 2 July 2013, Roche Diagnostics acquired blood diagnostics company Constitution Medical Inc. for $220 million.[27]
On 7 April 2014, Roche announced its intention to acquire IQuum for up to $450 million,[28] as well as the rights to an experimental drug (ORY-1001) from Spanish company Oryzon Genomics for $21 million and up to $500 million in milestone payments.[29] On 2 June, Roche announced its intention to acquire Genia Technologies Inc. for up to $350 million.[30] In August 2014, the company agreed to purchase Californian-based pharmaceutical firm InterMune for $8.3 billion, at $74 a share this represents a 38% premium over the final share closing price.[31][32][33] In December 2014, the company acquired next-generation sequencing processing company Bina Technologies for an undisclosed sum.[34]
On 16 January 2015, the company announced that they would acquire Trophos for €470 million ($543 million) in order to increase the company's neuromuscular disease presence. The deal will centre on the Phase II and III spinal muscular atrophy drug olesoxime (TRO19622).[35] In August, the company announced its intention to acquire GeneWEAVE for up to $425 million in order to strengthen its microbial diagnostics business.[36] Days later the company acquired Kapa Biosystems focussing on next generation sequencing and polymerase chain reaction applications.[37] In October 2015, the company acquired Adheron Therapeutics for $105 million (plus up to $475 million in milestone payments).[38]
In January 2016, the company announced it would acquire Tensha Therapeutics for $115 million upfront, with $420 million in contingent payments.[39]
In January 2017, the company acquired ForSight Labs.[40] In June, the company acquired the diabetes management platform, mySugr for an undisclosed price.[41]

Price-fixing conspiracy[edit]
See also: Cartel
Stanley Adams, Roche's World Product Manager in Basel, contacted the European Economic Community in 1973 with evidence that Roche had been breaking antitrust laws, engaging in price fixing and market sharing for vitamins with its competitors. Roche was fined accordingly, but a bungle on the part of the EEC allowed the company to discover that it was Adams who had blown the whistle. He was arrested for unauthorised disclosure — an offence under Swiss law — and imprisoned. His wife, having learnt that he might face decades in jail, committed suicide.[44]
In 1999 the firm pleaded guilty to participation in a worldwide conspiracy to raise and fix prices for vitamins sold in the USA and globally. Hoffmann-La Roche paid $500 million in criminal fines to the United States.[45][44][46]
Collaborative research[edit]
In addition to internal research and development activities F. Hoffmann–La Roche is also involved in publicly funded collaborative research projects, with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox.[47][48] The company is expanding its activities in joint research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative of EFPIA and the European Commission.[49]

Founded in 1896 by Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche, the company was early on known for producing various vitamin preparations and derivatives. In 1934, it became the first company to mass-produce synthetic vitamin C, under the brand name Redoxon. In 1957 it introduced the class of tranquilizers known as benzodiazepines (with Valium and Rohypnol being the best known members). It manufactures and sells several cancer drugs and is a leader in this field. In 1956, the first antidepressant, iproniazid, was accidentally created during an experiment while synthesizing isoniazid. Originally, it had been intended to create a more efficient drug at combatting Tuberculosis. Iproniazid, however, revealed to have its own benefits; some people felt it made them feel happier. It was withdrawn from the market in the early 1960s due to toxic side-effects.
In 1976, an accident at a chemical factory in Seveso, Italy, owned by a subsidiary of Roche caused a large dioxin contamination; see Seveso disaster. In 1982, the United States arm of the company acquired Biomedical Reference Laboratories for US$163.5 million. That company dated from the late 1960s, and was located in Burlington, North Carolina. That year Hoffmann–La Roche then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical became one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with 20 major laboratories and US$600 million in sales.[6]
Roche has also produced various HIV tests and antiretroviral drugs. It bought the patents for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique in 1992. In 1995 the era of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) was initiated by the United States FDA's approval of Hoffman LaRoche's HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir. Within 2 years of its approval (and that of ritonavir 4 months later) annual deaths from AIDS in the United States fell from over 50,000 to approximately 18,000 [7] On 28 April 1995 Hoffmann–La Roche sold Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. to National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc. (which then changed its name to Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings).[8] Roche acquired Syntex in 1994 and Chugai Pharmaceuticals in 2002.
Oseltamivir is considered to be the primary antiviral drug used to combat avian influenza, commonly known as the bird flu. Roche is the only drug company authorized to manufacture the drug, which was discovered by Gilead Sciences. Roche purchased the rights to the drug in 1996 and in 2005 settled a royalty dispute, agreeing to pay Gilead tiered royalties of 14–22% of annual net sales without adjusting the payments for manufacturing costs, as had been allowedin the original licensing agreement.[9]
On 20 October 2005, Hoffmann–La Roche decided to license other companies to manufacture Oseltamivir.[10]
Also in 2005, Roche acquired the Swiss company GlycArt Biotechnology in order to acquire technology to afucosylate antibodies; one of its products in development was obinutuzumab, which gained FDA approval in November 2013 for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.[11][12][13]

Price-fixing conspiracy[edit]
See also: Cartel
Stanley Adams, Roche's World Product Manager in Basel, contacted the European Economic Community in 1973 with evidence that Roche had been breaking antitrust laws, engaging in price fixing and market sharing for vitamins with its competitors. Roche was fined accordingly, but a bungle on the part of the EEC allowed the company to discover that it was Adams who had blown the whistle. He was arrested for unauthorised disclosure — an offence under Swiss law — and imprisoned. His wife, having learnt that he might face decades in jail, committed suicide.[44]
In 1999 the firm pleaded guilty to participation in a worldwide conspiracy to raise and fix prices for vitamins sold in the USA and globally. Hoffmann-La Roche paid $500 million in criminal fines to the United States.[45][44][46]
Collaborative research[edit]
In addition to internal research and development activities F. Hoffmann–La Roche is also involved in publicly funded collaborative research projects, with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox.[47][48] The company is expanding its activities in joint research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative of EFPIA and the European Commission.[49]

History[edit]
Founded in 1896 by Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche, the company was early on known for producing various vitamin preparations and derivatives. In 1934, it became the first company to mass-produce synthetic vitamin C, under the brand name Redoxon. In 1957 it introduced the class of tranquilizers known as benzodiazepines (with Valium and Rohypnol being the best known members). It manufactures and sells several cancer drugs and is a leader in this field. In 1956, the first antidepressant, iproniazid, was accidentally created during an experiment while synthesizing isoniazid. Originally, it had been intended to create a more efficient drug at combatting Tuberculosis. Iproniazid, however, revealed to have its own benefits; some people felt it made them feel happier. It was withdrawn from the market in the early 1960s due to toxic side-effects.
In 1976, an accident at a chemical factory in Seveso, Italy, owned by a subsidiary of Roche caused a large dioxin contamination; see Seveso disaster. In 1982, the United States arm of the company acquired Biomedical Reference Laboratories for US$163.5 million. That company dated from the late 1960s, and was located in Burlington, North Carolina. That year Hoffmann–La Roche then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical became one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with 20 major laboratories and US$600 million in sales.[6]
Roche has also produced various HIV tests and antiretroviral drugs. It bought the patents for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique in 1992. In 1995 the era of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) was initiated by the United States FDA's approval of Hoffman LaRoche's HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir. Within 2 years of its approval (and that of ritonavir 4 months later) annual deaths from AIDS in the United States fell from over 50,000 to approximately 18,000 [7] On 28 April 1995 Hoffmann–La Roche sold Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. to National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc. (which then changed its name to Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings).[8] Roche acquired Syntex in 1994 and Chugai Pharmaceuticals in 2002.
Oseltamivir is considered to be the primary antiviral drug used to combat avian influenza, commonly known as the bird flu. Roche is the only drug company authorized to manufacture the drug, which was discovered by Gilead Sciences. Roche purchased the rights to the drug in 1996 and in 2005 settled a royalty dispute, agreeing to pay Gilead tiered royalties of 14–22% of annual net sales without adjusting the payments for manufacturing costs, as had been allowedin the original licensing agreement.[9]
On 20 October 2005, Hoffmann–La Roche decided to license other companies to manufacture Oseltamivir.[10]
Also in 2005, Roche acquired the Swiss company GlycArt Biotechnology in order to acquire technology to afucosylate antibodies; one of its products in development was obinutuzumab, which gained FDA approval in November 2013 for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.[11][12][13]

Price-fixing conspiracy[edit]
See also: Cartel
Stanley Adams, Roche's World Product Manager in Basel, contacted the European Economic Community in 1973 with evidence that Roche had been breaking antitrust laws, engaging in price fixing and market sharing for vitamins with its competitors. Roche was fined accordingly, but a bungle on the part of the EEC allowed the company to discover that it was Adams who had blown the whistle. He was arrested for unauthorised disclosure — an offence under Swiss law — and imprisoned. His wife, having learnt that he might face decades in jail, committed suicide.[44]
In 1999 the firm pleaded guilty to participation in a worldwide conspiracy to raise and fix prices for vitamins sold in the USA and globally. Hoffmann-La Roche paid $500 million in criminal fines to the United States.[45][44][46]
Collaborative research[edit]
In addition to internal research and development activities F. Hoffmann–La Roche is also involved in publicly funded collaborative research projects, with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox.[47][48] The company is expanding its activities in joint research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative of EFPIA and the European Commission.[49]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

Turns Out That Instant 20,000% Stock Gain Was a Mistake

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar spins wheels ahead of GDP report expected to show faster clip of growth
              
              The U.S. dollar churned lower against most rivals save for the depreciating Swiss franc on Friday ahead of an update on the broadest measure of the U.S. economy—a GDP report that could help shape the Federal Reserve’s so far slow-moving approach to interest rates.

History[edit]
Founded in 1896 by Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche, the company was early on known for producing various vitamin preparations and derivatives. In 1934, it became the first company to mass-produce synthetic vitamin C, under the brand name Redoxon. In 1957 it introduced the class of tranquilizers known as benzodiazepines (with Valium and Rohypnol being the best known members). It manufactures and sells several cancer drugs and is a leader in this field. In 1956, the first antidepressant, iproniazid, was accidentally created during an experiment while synthesizing isoniazid. Originally, it had been intended to create a more efficient drug at combatting Tuberculosis. Iproniazid, however, revealed to have its own benefits; some people felt it made them feel happier. It was withdrawn from the market in the early 1960s due to toxic side-effects.
In 1976, an accident at a chemical factory in Seveso, Italy, owned by a subsidiary of Roche caused a large dioxin contamination; see Seveso disaster. In 1982, the United States arm of the company acquired Biomedical Reference Laboratories for US$163.5 million. That company dated from the late 1960s, and was located in Burlington, North Carolina. That year Hoffmann–La Roche then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical became one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with 20 major laboratories and US$600 million in sales.[6]
Roche has also produced various HIV tests and antiretroviral drugs. It bought the patents for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique in 1992. In 1995 the era of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) was initiated by the United States FDA's approval of Hoffman LaRoche's HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir. Within 2 years of its approval (and that of ritonavir 4 months later) annual deaths from AIDS in the United States fell from over 50,000 to approximately 18,000 [7] On 28 April 1995 Hoffmann–La Roche sold Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. to National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc. (which then changed its name to Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings).[8] Roche acquired Syntex in 1994 and Chugai Pharmaceuticals in 2002.
Oseltamivir is considered to be the primary antiviral drug used to combat avian influenza, commonly known as the bird flu. Roche is the only drug company authorized to manufacture the drug, which was discovered by Gilead Sciences. Roche purchased the rights to the drug in 1996 and in 2005 settled a royalty dispute, agreeing to pay Gilead tiered royalties of 14–22% of annual net sales without adjusting the payments for manufacturing costs, as had been allowedin the original licensing agreement.[9]
On 20 October 2005, Hoffmann–La Roche decided to license other companies to manufacture Oseltamivir.[10]
Also in 2005, Roche acquired the Swiss company GlycArt Biotechnology in order to acquire technology to afucosylate antibodies; one of its products in development was obinutuzumab, which gained FDA approval in November 2013 for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.[11][12][13]
On 22 January 2008, Roche acquired Ventana Medical Systems for $3.4 billion.[14] On 2 January 2009, Roche acquired Memory Pharmaceuticals Corp.[15] On 26 March, Roche acquired Genentech for $46.8 billion.[16] On 12 March 2009 Roche agreed to fully acquire Genentech, in which it had held a majority stake since 1990,[17] after 8 months of negotiations. As a result of the Genentech acquisition, Roche closed its Palo Alto based research facilities and moved them to their campus that straddles the border between Clifton, New Jersey and Nutley, New Jersey while Roche's United States headquarters, located on the site since 1929, was moved to Genentech's facility in South San Francisco.[18] Genentech became a wholly owned subsidiary group of Roche on 25 March 2009.[19]
On 13 April, Roche acquired Medingo Ltd., for $160 million.[20] On 23 August 2010, Roche acquired BioImagene, Inc., for $100 million.[21] In 2011, the company received the ISPE Facility of the Year Award for Process Innovation for Roche’s "MyDose" Clinical Supply project.[22] On 15 March, Roche acquired PVT Probenverteiltechnik GmbH for up to 85 million EUR.[23] On 19 July, Roche acquired mtm laboratories AG for up to 190 million EUR.[24] On 17 October, Roche acquired Anadys Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for $230 million.[25]
On 26 June 2012, Roche announced the closure of the Nutley/Clifton campus, which was completed in 2013. The property is in the process of remediation.[26] On 2 July 2013, Roche Diagnostics acquired blood diagnostics company Constitution Medical Inc. for $220 million.[27]
On 7 April 2014, Roche announced its intention to acquire IQuum for up to $450 million,[28] as well as the rights to an experimental drug (ORY-1001) from Spanish company Oryzon Genomics for $21 million and up to $500 million in milestone payments.[29] On 2 June, Roche announced its intention to acquire Genia Technologies Inc. for up to $350 million.[30] In August 2014, the company agreed to purchase Californian-based pharmaceutical firm InterMune for $8.3 billion, at $74 a share this represents a 38% premium over the final share closing price.[31][32][33] In December 2014, the company acquired next-generation sequencing processing company Bina Technologies for an undisclosed sum.[34]
On 16 January 2015, the company announced that they would acquire Trophos for €470 million ($543 million) in order to increase the company's neuromuscular disease presence. The deal will centre on the Phase II and III spinal muscular atrophy drug olesoxime (TRO19622).[35] In August, the company announced its intention to acquire GeneWEAVE for up to $425 million in order to strengthen its microbial diagnostics business.[36] Days later the company acquired Kapa Biosystems focussing on next generation sequencing and polymerase chain reaction applications.[37] In October 2015, the company acquired Adheron Therapeutics for $105 million (plus up to $475 million in milestone payments).[38]
In January 2016, the company announced it would acquire Tensha Therapeutics for $115 million upfront, with $420 million in contingent payments.[39]
In January 2017, the company acquired ForSight Labs.[40] In June, the company acquired the diabetes management platform, mySugr for an undisclosed price.[41]

Price-fixing conspiracy[edit]
See also: Cartel
Stanley Adams, Roche's World Product Manager in Basel, contacted the European Economic Community in 1973 with evidence that Roche had been breaking antitrust laws, engaging in price fixing and market sharing for vitamins with its competitors. Roche was fined accordingly, but a bungle on the part of the EEC allowed the company to discover that it was Adams who had blown the whistle. He was arrested for unauthorised disclosure — an offence under Swiss law — and imprisoned. His wife, having learnt that he might face decades in jail, committed suicide.[44]
In 1999 the firm pleaded guilty to participation in a worldwide conspiracy to raise and fix prices for vitamins sold in the USA and globally. Hoffmann-La Roche paid $500 million in criminal fines to the United States.[45][44][46]
Collaborative research[edit]
In addition to internal research and development activities F. Hoffmann–La Roche is also involved in publicly funded collaborative research projects, with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox.[47][48] The company is expanding its activities in joint research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative of EFPIA and the European Commission.[49]

History[edit]
Founded in 1896 by Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche, the company was early on known for producing various vitamin preparations and derivatives. In 1934, it became the first company to mass-produce synthetic vitamin C, under the brand name Redoxon. In 1957 it introduced the class of tranquilizers known as benzodiazepines (with Valium and Rohypnol being the best known members). It manufactures and sells several cancer drugs and is a leader in this field. In 1956, the first antidepressant, iproniazid, was accidentally created during an experiment while synthesizing isoniazid. Originally, it had been intended to create a more efficient drug at combatting Tuberculosis. Iproniazid, however, revealed to have its own benefits; some people felt it made them feel happier. It was withdrawn from the market in the early 1960s due to toxic side-effects.
In 1976, an accident at a chemical factory in Seveso, Italy, owned by a subsidiary of Roche caused a large dioxin contamination; see Seveso disaster. In 1982, the United States arm of the company acquired Biomedical Reference Laboratories for US$163.5 million. That company dated from the late 1960s, and was located in Burlington, North Carolina. That year Hoffmann–La Roche then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical became one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with 20 major laboratories and US$600 million in sales.[6]
Roche has also produced various HIV tests and antiretroviral drugs. It bought the patents for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique in 1992. In 1995 the era of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) was initiated by the United States FDA's approval of Hoffman LaRoche's HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir. Within 2 years of its approval (and that of ritonavir 4 months later) annual deaths from AIDS in the United States fell from over 50,000 to approximately 18,000 [7] On 28 April 1995 Hoffmann–La Roche sold Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. to National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc. (which then changed its name to Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings).[8] Roche acquired Syntex in 1994 and Chugai Pharmaceuticals in 2002.
Oseltamivir is considered to be the primary antiviral drug used to combat avian influenza, commonly known as the bird flu. Roche is the only drug company authorized to manufacture the drug, which was discovered by Gilead Sciences. Roche purchased the rights to the drug in 1996 and in 2005 settled a royalty dispute, agreeing to pay Gilead tiered royalties of 14–22% of annual net sales without adjusting the payments for manufacturing costs, as had been allowedin the original licensing agreement.[9]
On 20 October 2005, Hoffmann–La Roche decided to license other companies to manufacture Oseltamivir.[10]
Also in 2005, Roche acquired the Swiss company GlycArt Biotechnology in order to acquire technology to afucosylate antibodies; one of its products in development was obinutuzumab, which gained FDA approval in November 2013 for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.[11][12][13]
On 22 January 2008, Roche acquired Ventana Medical Systems for $3.4 billion.[14] On 2 January 2009, Roche acquired Memory Pharmaceuticals Corp.[15] On 26 March, Roche acquired Genentech for $46.8 billion.[16] On 12 March 2009 Roche agreed to fully acquire Genentech, in which it had held a majority stake since 1990,[17] after 8 months of negotiations. As a result of the Genentech acquisition, Roche closed its Palo Alto based research facilities and moved them to their campus that straddles the border between Clifton, New Jersey and Nutley, New Jersey while Roche's United States headquarters, located on the site since 1929, was moved to Genentech's facility in South San Francisco.[18] Genentech became a wholly owned subsidiary group of Roche on 25 March 2009.[19]
On 13 April, Roche acquired Medingo Ltd., for $160 million.[20] On 23 August 2010, Roche acquired BioImagene, Inc., for $100 million.[21] In 2011, the company received the ISPE Facility of the Year Award for Process Innovation for Roche’s "MyDose" Clinical Supply project.[22] On 15 March, Roche acquired PVT Probenverteiltechnik GmbH for up to 85 million EUR.[23] On 19 July, Roche acquired mtm laboratories AG for up to 190 million EUR.[24] On 17 October, Roche acquired Anadys Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for $230 million.[25]
On 26 June 2012, Roche announced the closure of the Nutley/Clifton campus, which was completed in 2013. The property is in the process of remediation.[26] On 2 July 2013, Roche Diagnostics acquired blood diagnostics company Constitution Medical Inc. for $220 million.[27]
On 7 April 2014, Roche announced its intention to acquire IQuum for up to $450 million,[28] as well as the rights to an experimental drug (ORY-1001) from Spanish company Oryzon Genomics for $21 million and up to $500 million in milestone payments.[29] On 2 June, Roche announced its intention to acquire Genia Technologies Inc. for up to $350 million.[30] In August 2014, the company agreed to purchase Californian-based pharmaceutical firm InterMune for $8.3 billion, at $74 a share this represents a 38% premium over the final share closing price.[31][32][33] In December 2014, the company acquired next-generation sequencing processing company Bina Technologies for an undisclosed sum.[34]
On 16 January 2015, the company announced that they would acquire Trophos for €470 million ($543 million) in order to increase the company's neuromuscular disease presence. The deal will centre on the Phase II and III spinal muscular atrophy drug olesoxime (TRO19622).[35] In August, the company announced its intention to acquire GeneWEAVE for up to $425 million in order to strengthen its microbial diagnostics business.[36] Days later the company acquired Kapa Biosystems focussing on next generation sequencing and polymerase chain reaction applications.[37] In October 2015, the company acquired Adheron Therapeutics for $105 million (plus up to $475 million in milestone payments).[38]
In January 2016, the company announced it would acquire Tensha Therapeutics for $115 million upfront, with $420 million in contingent payments.[39]
In January 2017, the company acquired ForSight Labs.[40] In June, the company acquired the diabetes management platform, mySugr for an undisclosed price.[41]

Price-fixing conspiracy[edit]
See also: Cartel
Stanley Adams, Roche's World Product Manager in Basel, contacted the European Economic Community in 1973 with evidence that Roche had been breaking antitrust laws, engaging in price fixing and market sharing for vitamins with its competitors. Roche was fined accordingly, but a bungle on the part of the EEC allowed the company to discover that it was Adams who had blown the whistle. He was arrested for unauthorised disclosure — an offence under Swiss law — and imprisoned. His wife, having learnt that he might face decades in jail, committed suicide.[44]
In 1999 the firm pleaded guilty to participation in a worldwide conspiracy to raise and fix prices for vitamins sold in the USA and globally. Hoffmann-La Roche paid $500 million in criminal fines to the United States.[45][44][46]
Collaborative research[edit]
In addition to internal research and development activities F. Hoffmann–La Roche is also involved in publicly funded collaborative research projects, with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox.[47][48] The company is expanding its activities in joint research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative of EFPIA and the European Commission.[49]

	Roche Holding Ltd. (ADR) (RHHBY) Stock Is Weathering the Healthcare Storm
Big Pharma company Roche has its sails full of wind

Roche Holding Ltd. (ADR) (OTCMKTS:RHHBY) may not grab your attention like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) or Swiss neighbor Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS), but it’s as big and as powerful as all these other Big Pharmas.

Healthcare has been getting kicked around in recent months, as we’ve transitioned to the Donald Trump presidency. First, investors were bullish that a Republican-dominated White House and Congress would mean less regulation and a friendlier, more pro-business environment.
Then, Trump tweeted that he thought drug prices were too high. Then, Congress had the hot potato of the Affordable Care Act (aka, Obamacare) to repeal and replace, which added even more uncertainty into the mix.
One thing that is certain is the big players will have a seat at the table regardless of what transpires. And that is a distinct advantage.
What Does This Mean for RHHBY Stock?
What may not be so apparent is that RHHBY is the biggest Big Pharma by market cap, aside from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) which is so diversified that it’s a bit more than just a Big Pharma.
Roche has many of the top selling drugs in the market today — Neupogen, Anaprox, Avastin to name a few — and has a very strong pipeline.
It is also becoming very competitive in the immuno-oncology space with its drugs Perjeta and now Alecensa. These drugs target non-small-cell lung cancer, which is becoming a very crowded space for this new class of drugs. That’s the case because this specific cancer is not responsive to most therapies and is usually inoperable. This allows drugmakers to see how their drugs work on humans that have no real recourse to other therapies. For patients, there has been little hope other than newer versions of chemotherapy and radiation.
The good news is, these next-generation drugs are getting better and better. Now they’re getting months more to live, without the debilitating effects of chemotherapy.
NVS was first to market with its drug Xalkori. It has now released a new version dubbed Zykadia. But RHHBY is now making a splash with Alecensa; it seems to be better tolerated and it was just awarded its second ‘breakthrough’ designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Also, within the past week, Roche has announced that it is working with Germany-based BioNTech in venture worth $310 million to research and develop mRNA based individualized cancer vaccines.
The point is, RHHBY has not stopped its efforts to stay on the cutting edge, build a vital product pipeline and continue to provide great products. It’s also pretty shareholder friendly as well.
Currently, Roche is delivering a rock-solid 3.25% dividend, which helps smooth out the choppy waters that most healthcare stocks are now in.

History[edit]
Founded in 1896 by Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche, the company was early on known for producing various vitamin preparations and derivatives. In 1934, it became the first company to mass-produce synthetic vitamin C, under the brand name Redoxon. In 1957 it introduced the class of tranquilizers known as benzodiazepines (with Valium and Rohypnol being the best known members). It manufactures and sells several cancer drugs and is a leader in this field. In 1956, the first antidepressant, iproniazid, was accidentally created during an experiment while synthesizing isoniazid. Originally, it had been intended to create a more efficient drug at combatting Tuberculosis. Iproniazid, however, revealed to have its own benefits; some people felt it made them feel happier. It was withdrawn from the market in the early 1960s due to toxic side-effects.
In 1976, an accident at a chemical factory in Seveso, Italy, owned by a subsidiary of Roche caused a large dioxin contamination; see Seveso disaster. In 1982, the United States arm of the company acquired Biomedical Reference Laboratories for US$163.5 million. That company dated from the late 1960s, and was located in Burlington, North Carolina. That year Hoffmann–La Roche then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical became one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with 20 major laboratories and US$600 million in sales.[6]
Roche has also produced various HIV tests and antiretroviral drugs. It bought the patents for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique in 1992. In 1995 the era of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) was initiated by the United States FDA's approval of Hoffman LaRoche's HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir. Within 2 years of its approval (and that of ritonavir 4 months later) annual deaths from AIDS in the United States fell from over 50,000 to approximately 18,000 [7] On 28 April 1995 Hoffmann–La Roche sold Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. to National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc. (which then changed its name to Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings).[8] Roche acquired Syntex in 1994 and Chugai Pharmaceuticals in 2002.
Oseltamivir is considered to be the primary antiviral drug used to combat avian influenza, commonly known as the bird flu. Roche is the only drug company authorized to manufacture the drug, which was discovered by Gilead Sciences. Roche purchased the rights to the drug in 1996 and in 2005 settled a royalty dispute, agreeing to pay Gilead tiered royalties of 14–22% of annual net sales without adjusting the payments for manufacturing costs, as had been allowedin the original licensing agreement.[9]
On 20 October 2005, Hoffmann–La Roche decided to license other companies to manufacture Oseltamivir.[10]
Also in 2005, Roche acquired the Swiss company GlycArt Biotechnology in order to acquire technology to afucosylate antibodies; one of its products in development was obinutuzumab, which gained FDA approval in November 2013 for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.[11][12][13]
On 22 January 2008, Roche acquired Ventana Medical Systems for $3.4 billion.[14] On 2 January 2009, Roche acquired Memory Pharmaceuticals Corp.[15] On 26 March, Roche acquired Genentech for $46.8 billion.[16] On 12 March 2009 Roche agreed to fully acquire Genentech, in which it had held a majority stake since 1990,[17] after 8 months of negotiations. As a result of the Genentech acquisition, Roche closed its Palo Alto based research facilities and moved them to their campus that straddles the border between Clifton, New Jersey and Nutley, New Jersey while Roche's United States headquarters, located on the site since 1929, was moved to Genentech's facility in South San Francisco.[18] Genentech became a wholly owned subsidiary group of Roche on 25 March 2009.[19]
On 13 April, Roche acquired Medingo Ltd., for $160 million.[20] On 23 August 2010, Roche acquired BioImagene, Inc., for $100 million.[21] In 2011, the company received the ISPE Facility of the Year Award for Process Innovation for Roche’s "MyDose" Clinical Supply project.[22] On 15 March, Roche acquired PVT Probenverteiltechnik GmbH for up to 85 million EUR.[23] On 19 July, Roche acquired mtm laboratories AG for up to 190 million EUR.[24] On 17 October, Roche acquired Anadys Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for $230 million.[25]
On 26 June 2012, Roche announced the closure of the Nutley/Clifton campus, which was completed in 2013. The property is in the process of remediation.[26] On 2 July 2013, Roche Diagnostics acquired blood diagnostics company Constitution Medical Inc. for $220 million.[27]
On 7 April 2014, Roche announced its intention to acquire IQuum for up to $450 million,[28] as well as the rights to an experimental drug (ORY-1001) from Spanish company Oryzon Genomics for $21 million and up to $500 million in milestone payments.[29] On 2 June, Roche announced its intention to acquire Genia Technologies Inc. for up to $350 million.[30] In August 2014, the company agreed to purchase Californian-based pharmaceutical firm InterMune for $8.3 billion, at $74 a share this represents a 38% premium over the final share closing price.[31][32][33] In December 2014, the company acquired next-generation sequencing processing company Bina Technologies for an undisclosed sum.[34]
On 16 January 2015, the company announced that they would acquire Trophos for €470 million ($543 million) in order to increase the company's neuromuscular disease presence. The deal will centre on the Phase II and III spinal muscular atrophy drug olesoxime (TRO19622).[35] In August, the company announced its intention to acquire GeneWEAVE for up to $425 million in order to strengthen its microbial diagnostics business.[36] Days later the company acquired Kapa Biosystems focussing on next generation sequencing and polymerase chain reaction applications.[37] In October 2015, the company acquired Adheron Therapeutics for $105 million (plus up to $475 million in milestone payments).[38]
In January 2016, the company announced it would acquire Tensha Therapeutics for $115 million upfront, with $420 million in contingent payments.[39]
In January 2017, the company acquired ForSight Labs.[40] In June, the company acquired the diabetes management platform, mySugr for an undisclosed price.[41]

Price-fixing conspiracy[edit]
See also: Cartel
Stanley Adams, Roche's World Product Manager in Basel, contacted the European Economic Community in 1973 with evidence that Roche had been breaking antitrust laws, engaging in price fixing and market sharing for vitamins with its competitors. Roche was fined accordingly, but a bungle on the part of the EEC allowed the company to discover that it was Adams who had blown the whistle. He was arrested for unauthorised disclosure — an offence under Swiss law — and imprisoned. His wife, having learnt that he might face decades in jail, committed suicide.[44]
In 1999 the firm pleaded guilty to participation in a worldwide conspiracy to raise and fix prices for vitamins sold in the USA and globally. Hoffmann-La Roche paid $500 million in criminal fines to the United States.[45][44][46]
Collaborative research[edit]
In addition to internal research and development activities F. Hoffmann–La Roche is also involved in publicly funded collaborative research projects, with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox.[47][48] The company is expanding its activities in joint research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative of EFPIA and the European Commission.[49]

History[edit]
Founded in 1896 by Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche, the company was early on known for producing various vitamin preparations and derivatives. In 1934, it became the first company to mass-produce synthetic vitamin C, under the brand name Redoxon. In 1957 it introduced the class of tranquilizers known as benzodiazepines (with Valium and Rohypnol being the best known members). It manufactures and sells several cancer drugs and is a leader in this field. In 1956, the first antidepressant, iproniazid, was accidentally created during an experiment while synthesizing isoniazid. Originally, it had been intended to create a more efficient drug at combatting Tuberculosis. Iproniazid, however, revealed to have its own benefits; some people felt it made them feel happier. It was withdrawn from the market in the early 1960s due to toxic side-effects.
In 1976, an accident at a chemical factory in Seveso, Italy, owned by a subsidiary of Roche caused a large dioxin contamination; see Seveso disaster. In 1982, the United States arm of the company acquired Biomedical Reference Laboratories for US$163.5 million. That company dated from the late 1960s, and was located in Burlington, North Carolina. That year Hoffmann–La Roche then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical became one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with 20 major laboratories and US$600 million in sales.[6]
Roche has also produced various HIV tests and antiretroviral drugs. It bought the patents for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique in 1992. In 1995 the era of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) was initiated by the United States FDA's approval of Hoffman LaRoche's HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir. Within 2 years of its approval (and that of ritonavir 4 months later) annual deaths from AIDS in the United States fell from over 50,000 to approximately 18,000 [7] On 28 April 1995 Hoffmann–La Roche sold Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. to National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc. (which then changed its name to Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings).[8] Roche acquired Syntex in 1994 and Chugai Pharmaceuticals in 2002.
Oseltamivir is considered to be the primary antiviral drug used to combat avian influenza, commonly known as the bird flu. Roche is the only drug company authorized to manufacture the drug, which was discovered by Gilead Sciences. Roche purchased the rights to the drug in 1996 and in 2005 settled a royalty dispute, agreeing to pay Gilead tiered royalties of 14–22% of annual net sales without adjusting the payments for manufacturing costs, as had been allowedin the original licensing agreement.[9]
On 20 October 2005, Hoffmann–La Roche decided to license other companies to manufacture Oseltamivir.[10]
Also in 2005, Roche acquired the Swiss company GlycArt Biotechnology in order to acquire technology to afucosylate antibodies; one of its products in development was obinutuzumab, which gained FDA approval in November 2013 for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.[11][12][13]
On 22 January 2008, Roche acquired Ventana Medical Systems for $3.4 billion.[14] On 2 January 2009, Roche acquired Memory Pharmaceuticals Corp.[15] On 26 March, Roche acquired Genentech for $46.8 billion.[16] On 12 March 2009 Roche agreed to fully acquire Genentech, in which it had held a majority stake since 1990,[17] after 8 months of negotiations. As a result of the Genentech acquisition, Roche closed its Palo Alto based research facilities and moved them to their campus that straddles the border between Clifton, New Jersey and Nutley, New Jersey while Roche's United States headquarters, located on the site since 1929, was moved to Genentech's facility in South San Francisco.[18] Genentech became a wholly owned subsidiary group of Roche on 25 March 2009.[19]
On 13 April, Roche acquired Medingo Ltd., for $160 million.[20] On 23 August 2010, Roche acquired BioImagene, Inc., for $100 million.[21] In 2011, the company received the ISPE Facility of the Year Award for Process Innovation for Roche’s "MyDose" Clinical Supply project.[22] On 15 March, Roche acquired PVT Probenverteiltechnik GmbH for up to 85 million EUR.[23] On 19 July, Roche acquired mtm laboratories AG for up to 190 million EUR.[24] On 17 October, Roche acquired Anadys Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for $230 million.[25]
On 26 June 2012, Roche announced the closure of the Nutley/Clifton campus, which was completed in 2013. The property is in the process of remediation.[26] On 2 July 2013, Roche Diagnostics acquired blood diagnostics company Constitution Medical Inc. for $220 million.[27]
On 7 April 2014, Roche announced its intention to acquire IQuum for up to $450 million,[28] as well as the rights to an experimental drug (ORY-1001) from Spanish company Oryzon Genomics for $21 million and up to $500 million in milestone payments.[29] On 2 June, Roche announced its intention to acquire Genia Technologies Inc. for up to $350 million.[30] In August 2014, the company agreed to purchase Californian-based pharmaceutical firm InterMune for $8.3 billion, at $74 a share this represents a 38% premium over the final share closing price.[31][32][33] In December 2014, the company acquired next-generation sequencing processing company Bina Technologies for an undisclosed sum.[34]
On 16 January 2015, the company announced that they would acquire Trophos for €470 million ($543 million) in order to increase the company's neuromuscular disease presence. The deal will centre on the Phase II and III spinal muscular atrophy drug olesoxime (TRO19622).[35] In August, the company announced its intention to acquire GeneWEAVE for up to $425 million in order to strengthen its microbial diagnostics business.[36] Days later the company acquired Kapa Biosystems focussing on next generation sequencing and polymerase chain reaction applications.[37] In October 2015, the company acquired Adheron Therapeutics for $105 million (plus up to $475 million in milestone payments).[38]
In January 2016, the company announced it would acquire Tensha Therapeutics for $115 million upfront, with $420 million in contingent payments.[39]
In January 2017, the company acquired ForSight Labs.[40] In June, the company acquired the diabetes management platform, mySugr for an undisclosed price.[41]

Stanley Adams, Roche's World Product Manager in Basel, contacted the European Economic Community in 1973 with evidence that Roche had been breaking antitrust laws, engaging in price fixing and market sharing for vitamins with its competitors. Roche was fined accordingly, but a bungle on the part of the EEC allowed the company to discover that it was Adams who had blown the whistle. He was arrested for unauthorised disclosure — an offence under Swiss law — and imprisoned. His wife, having learnt that he might face decades in jail, committed suicide.[44]
In 1999 the firm pleaded guilty to participation in a worldwide conspiracy to raise and fix prices for vitamins sold in the USA and globally. Hoffmann-La Roche paid $500 million in criminal fines to the United States.[45][44][46]
Collaborative research[edit]
In addition to internal research and development activities F. Hoffmann–La Roche is also involved in publicly funded collaborative research projects, with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox.[47][48] The company is expanding its activities in joint research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative of EFPIA and the European Commission.[49]

F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG is a Swiss multinational healthcare company that operates worldwide under two divisions: Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. Its holding company, Roche Holding AG, has bearer shares listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange. The company headquarters are located in Basel.
The company controls the American biotechnology company Genentech, which is a wholly owned affiliate, and the Japanese biotechnology company Chugai Pharmaceuticals, as well as the United States-based Ventana. Roche's revenues during fiscal year 2016 were 50.58 billion Swiss francs,[2] or approximately US$50 billion. Roche is the third-largest pharma company worldwide.[3] Descendants of the founding Hoffmann and Oeri families own slightly over half of the bearer shares with voting rights (a pool of family shareholders 45%, and Maja Oeri a further 5% apart), with Swiss pharma firm Novartis owning a further third of its shares. Roche is one of the few companies increasing their dividend every year, for 2016 as the 30th consecutive year.[4] F.

History[edit]
Founded in 1896 by Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche, the company was early on known for producing various vitamin preparations and derivatives. In 1934, it became the first company to mass-produce synthetic vitamin C, under the brand name Redoxon. In 1957 it introduced the class of tranquilizers known as benzodiazepines (with Valium and Rohypnol being the best known members). It manufactures and sells several cancer drugs and is a leader in this field. In 1956, the first antidepressant, iproniazid, was accidentally created during an experiment while synthesizing isoniazid. Originally, it had been intended to create a more efficient drug at combatting Tuberculosis. Iproniazid, however, revealed to have its own benefits; some people felt it made them feel happier. It was withdrawn from the market in the early 1960s due to toxic side-effects.
In 1976, an accident at a chemical factory in Seveso, Italy, owned by a subsidiary of Roche caused a large dioxin contamination; see Seveso disaster. In 1982, the United States arm of the company acquired Biomedical Reference Laboratories for US$163.5 million. That company dated from the late 1960s, and was located in Burlington, North Carolina. That year Hoffmann–La Roche then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical became one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with 20 major laboratories and US$600 million in sales.[6]
Roche has also produced various HIV tests and antiretroviral drugs. It bought the patents for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique in 1992. In 1995 the era of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) was initiated by the United States FDA's approval of Hoffman LaRoche's HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir. Within 2 years of its approval (and that of ritonavir 4 months later) annual deaths from AIDS in the United States fell from over 50,000 to approximately 18,000 [7] On 28 April 1995 Hoffmann–La Roche sold Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. to National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc. (which then changed its name to Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings).[8] Roche acquired Syntex in 1994 and Chugai Pharmaceuticals in 2002.
Oseltamivir is considered to be the primary antiviral drug used to combat avian influenza, commonly known as the bird flu. Roche is the only drug company authorized to manufacture the drug, which was discovered by Gilead Sciences. Roche purchased the rights to the drug in 1996 and in 2005 settled a royalty dispute, agreeing to pay Gilead tiered royalties of 14–22% of annual net sales without adjusting the payments for manufacturing costs, as had been allowedin the original licensing agreement.[9]
On 20 October 2005, Hoffmann–La Roche decided to license other companies to manufacture Oseltamivir.[10]
Also in 2005, Roche acquired the Swiss company GlycArt Biotechnology in order to acquire technology to afucosylate antibodies; one of its products in development was obinutuzumab, which gained FDA approval in November 2013 for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.[11][12][13]
On 22 January 2008, Roche acquired Ventana Medical Systems for $3.4 billion.[14] On 2 January 2009, Roche acquired Memory Pharmaceuticals Corp.[15] On 26 March, Roche acquired Genentech for $46.8 billion.[16] On 12 March 2009 Roche agreed to fully acquire Genentech, in which it had held a majority stake since 1990,[17] after 8 months of negotiations. As a result of the Genentech acquisition, Roche closed its Palo Alto based research facilities and moved them to their campus that straddles the border between Clifton, New Jersey and Nutley, New Jersey while Roche's United States headquarters, located on the site since 1929, was moved to Genentech's facility in South San Francisco.[18] Genentech became a wholly owned subsidiary group of Roche on 25 March 2009.[19]
On 13 April, Roche acquired Medingo Ltd., for $160 million.[20] On 23 August 2010, Roche acquired BioImagene, Inc., for $100 million.[21] In 2011, the company received the ISPE Facility of the Year Award for Process Innovation for Roche’s "MyDose" Clinical Supply project.[22] On 15 March, Roche acquired PVT Probenverteiltechnik GmbH for up to 85 million EUR.[23] On 19 July, Roche acquired mtm laboratories AG for up to 190 million EUR.[24] On 17 October, Roche acquired Anadys Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for $230 million.[25]
On 26 June 2012, Roche announced the closure of the Nutley/Clifton campus, which was completed in 2013. The property is in the process of remediation.[26] On 2 July 2013, Roche Diagnostics acquired blood diagnostics company Constitution Medical Inc. for $220 million.[27]
On 7 April 2014, Roche announced its intention to acquire IQuum for up to $450 million,[28] as well as the rights to an experimental drug (ORY-1001) from Spanish company Oryzon Genomics for $21 million and up to $500 million in milestone payments.[29] On 2 June, Roche announced its intention to acquire Genia Technologies Inc. for up to $350 million.[30] In August 2014, the company agreed to purchase Californian-based pharmaceutical firm InterMune for $8.3 billion, at $74 a share this represents a 38% premium over the final share closing price.[31][32][33] In December 2014, the company acquired next-generation sequencing processing company Bina Technologies for an undisclosed sum.[34]
On 16 January 2015, the company announced that they would acquire Trophos for €470 million ($543 million) in order to increase the company's neuromuscular disease presence. The deal will centre on the Phase II and III spinal muscular atrophy drug olesoxime (TRO19622).[35] In August, the company announced its intention to acquire GeneWEAVE for up to $425 million in order to strengthen its microbial diagnostics business.[36] Days later the company acquired Kapa Biosystems focussing on next generation sequencing and polymerase chain reaction applications.[37] In October 2015, the company acquired Adheron Therapeutics for $105 million (plus up to $475 million in milestone payments).[38]
In January 2016, the company announced it would acquire Tensha Therapeutics for $115 million upfront, with $420 million in contingent payments.[39]
In January 2017, the company acquired ForSight Labs.[40] In June, the company acquired the diabetes management platform, mySugr for an undisclosed price.[41]

Stanley Adams, Roche's World Product Manager in Basel, contacted the European Economic Community in 1973 with evidence that Roche had been breaking antitrust laws, engaging in price fixing and market sharing for vitamins with its competitors. Roche was fined accordingly, but a bungle on the part of the EEC allowed the company to discover that it was Adams who had blown the whistle. He was arrested for unauthorised disclosure — an offence under Swiss law — and imprisoned. His wife, having learnt that he might face decades in jail, committed suicide.[44]
In 1999 the firm pleaded guilty to participation in a worldwide conspiracy to raise and fix prices for vitamins sold in the USA and globally. Hoffmann-La Roche paid $500 million in criminal fines to the United States.[45][44][46]
Collaborative research[edit]
In addition to internal research and development activities F. Hoffmann–La Roche is also involved in publicly funded collaborative research projects, with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox.[47][48] The company is expanding its activities in joint research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative of EFPIA and the European Commission.[49]
