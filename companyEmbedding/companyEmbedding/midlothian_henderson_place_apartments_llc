Overview
"It's like a whole other country," according to the motto of the state tourism board. Texas could truly be quite a large and successful country in its own right; it certainly has the size, economy and natural resources to do it up big, in typical Texas fashion. But at the same time, this is a quintessentially American land, where residents are patriotic, friendly, successful...and proud of it all.
What to Expect

The Lone Star State is famous for doing things on a grand scale, and the economy is certainly no exception. Texas leads the nation in total productivity and is the country's foremost supplier of oil, beef and cotton. The space industry, high-tech industries, natural gas and manufacturing are all important components of the state's economy as well. Of course, agriculture still plays a large role in the economy, as Texas boasts more farmland than any other state.
There are almost too many attractions and points of interest to catalog in Texas's 267,000 square miles; suffice it to say that you'll find plenty to do and see whatever your taste. For outdoor lovers, there's the Gulf Coast resort area and numerous state parks. Technology nerds will enjoy the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, while history buffs will want to visit the Alamo in San Antonio and the state capital in Austin. And, of course, there are enough opportunities for rodeo watching, line dancing and barbecur eating to satisfy any Texan, whether a native or a newcomer.
Where to Explore

Texas has an excellent overall cost of living and is the fourth most affordable state in the country. Housing prices alone—including apartments for rent—rank 20% below the national average. Plenty of apartments are available in the state's largest cities, which include Houston, Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, Fort Worth and Arlington.
Houston Apartments

The city of Houston, covering nearly 9.000 square miles and home to more than 2 million people, is a perfect microcosm of the things that make Texas great. With its signature blend of big-city diversity and down-home Texas hospitality, Houston is cosmopolitan and full of charm at the same time. A thriving economy, flourishing downtown and green parks combine with a mild year-round climate to make this one of the best places to live in the nation. Need more proof? The cost of living is lower than any other large metro in the country, and there are plenty of apartment rentals to choose from, most of which are reasonably priced. Look for the nicest housing options in the affluent neighborhoods in the west and southwest areas of town. Lower-income neighborhoods with more affordable apartments for rent can be found to the south and southeast of downtown. The average rent for apartments is $715 per month, with utilities averaging $105.
Dallas Apartments

The second-largest city in Texas with about 1.2 million residents, Dallas prides itself as being a cultural and educational center. Institutions of higher learning include Southern Methodist University, Paul Quinn College, the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas Baptist University, Dallas Christian College, Dallas Theological Seminary and the University of Texas at Dallas. Also of special note are the architecture of the downtown area and the West End Historic District, a collection of 19th-century warehouses converted into eclectic shops and restaurants. Dallas is famous for its pro sports teams, including the Dallas Cowboys pro football team, the Mavericks pro basketball team, Stars pro hockey team and Rangers baseball team. It's also famous for fans who are devoted to their teams and their successes each season. Within the city itself and in the greater metropolitan area, expect to pay an average of $750 for apartment rentals and about $100 for monthly utilities.
Austin Apartments

Truly a city on the rise, the state capital's population has been growing in recent decades thanks to the growth of high-tech industry, including computer technology and research organizations. Austin is also famous for its music scene, which has earned the city the nickname .The Live Music Capital of the World." The annual South by Southwest music festival introduces music lovers to hundreds of new bands of every musical genre, and the long-running PBS series Austin City Limits continues to be the most popular music show in town. The combination of high-tech companies, cutting-edge music and the city's importance as the center of Texan government gives Austin a young and trendy atmosphere that attracts thousands of newcomers every year. Apartments for rent run at an average monthly cost of $750, with utilities averaging $90 per month.Rent.com is a free rental site that offers a large selection of trusted apartments and houses for rent.

Located 28 miles southwest of Dallas and 29 miles southeast of Fort Worth, Midlothian, Texas, is a growing and friendly community. With a total population of more than 18,000 people, Midlothian is a comparably small city to its nearby neighbors. However, Midlothian is growing quickly: Between 2000 and 2010, its population grew by an incredible 141.1 percent. Numerous suburban-style new constructions have been built in recent years and many amenities have come to this once-sleepy Texas town. Located off regional highways 287 and 67, Midlothian is a convenient place to live for those who prefer peace and quiet over the hustle and bustle of Dallas.


Midlothian's first non-native settlers arrived throughout the 19th century as the American West began to develop. The longtime residents of the land had included the Tonkawa, Anadarko, Bidia, Kickapoo and Waco Native American tribes. Sam Houston's peace treaties with native peoples created the Republic of Texas in 1843, and families relocated to Texas from other areas throughout the following century. 


Modern-day Midlothian was incorporated in 1888 and began to grow around an agrarian economy that included cotton farming and ranching. As the industrial revolution permeated America, Midlothian's commerce and industry evolved with the rest of the country. However, it wasn't until after World War II that Midlothian would evolve to become the industrial center of the Dallas-Fort Worth area. To this day, numerous industrial, manufacturing and business centers are located throughout Midlothian. Those searching for Midlothian apartments for rent will undoubtedly enjoy the city's hard-working roots, family-friendly atmosphere and small-town charm.

Living in Midlothian, TX

Residents enjoy a variety of amenities, including easy access to regional hubs Dallas and Fort Worth. The city's growing population will enjoy Midlothian Community Park, whose layout includes trails, playgrounds, sports facilities, a fishing pond, an amphitheatre, picnic pavilions and a splash park. The city boats 11 total parks, a public golf course, a public library, four health and medical centers, a lake, and eight tennis courts.


Midlothian also offers a conference center for its residents' convenience and satisfaction. The Midlothian Conference Center boasts 39,000 square feet of space and a highly trained staff, and is available for weddings, birthday parties, family reunions, dances, business conferences, and other events.

Midlothian Work and Study

The closest institutes of higher learning are located between 15 and 25 miles away, and include Lincoln College of Technology, Dallas Baptist University, Mountain View College, University of Texas at Arlington and Texas Wesleyan University.


Because of its strong industrial and economic history, Midlothian offers numerous employment opportunities. In fact, the city sees its population grow about 23 percent during workdays due to commuting. Top employers in the area include Air Products & Chemicals, Baylor Family Medical Center, Ennis, General Chemical Co., Martech, the City of Midlothian, Holcim Texas and Gerdau Ameristeel.

Rentals in Midlothian, TX and Cost of Living

According to City-Data, the cost of living index in Midlothian is 93.4, which is 6.6 percent less than the U.S. average. Those searching for Midlothian rentals should not have a difficult time finding a rental property, as an average 23.5 percent of the city's homes are renter-occupied units. The median gross rent in Midlothian is $934 per month.

Midlothian Attractions and Special Events

Midlothian offers residents numerous opportunities to socialize, including children's activities, community events, and outdoor recreation. However, its annual Scarecrow Festival in Heritage Park is both fun and casual, and offers good old-fashioned Halloween fun. Local events like Kids' Fishing Derby, the Eighth Street Dance and Movies in the Park are reminiscent of times gone by and give Midlothian a distinct small-town feel.

Your Guide to Apartments in Midlothian

Whether you're new to Texas or fleeing the crowds and chaos of Dallas, we'd like to applaud your choice of Midlothian as your new place to call home. Lying a scant 25 miles southwest of the Big D, Midlothian is close enough to commute to work yet eons away in terms of lifestyle. As your leading apartment search specialists, it is our goal to help you find the perfect apartments in Midlothian and the surrounding areas and then help you get the most out of life once you move in.After you choose the perfect new place from the extensive listings of Midlothian apartments that are currently available, you might decide to dispense with the commute to DFW altogether. Don't be fooled by the city's Old West agrarian character, Midlothian offers lucrative job opportunities in industries that keep the country strong. We mean that literally. Due to its rich substrata of limestone, it is home to three major cement makers including Texas Industries who supplied the cement to build the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport. Adjacent to TXI's cement plant is a steel plant owned and operated by Gerdau Ameristeel, the second largest producer of structural steel products in America. Also, owing to its strategic location at the southern crossroads to both Dallas and Fort Worth, key players in commerce like Target, Toys R Us, and Keho Food Distributors chose Midlothian as the location of their round the busy distribution centers. Location is also the reason auto manufacturers Mazda, Toyota, and Kia utilize the services of Midlothian's 600 acre Auto Park's processing and distribution center.However life is absolutely more than about just work, and Midlothian prides itself as offering country quality of life with urban amenities. The area is ripe with opportunities to enjoy the outdoors with its many meticulously landscaped parks. You can kick back and take a breather at Heritage, Kimmel, and Civic Center Parks, explore the rich fauna and flora at Mockingbird Nature Park, or take part in your favorite athletic activity at the Midlothian Sports Complex. And much, much more.When you choose Midlothian, you're making an excellent choice and whether you need a spacious studio apartment for yourself or a three bedroom apartment for your family, you'll find your choice of apartments in Midlothian Texas at ApartmentLiving.com.

Copy URL above and paste away!mrschatttrqueen12/02/2011OverallRENTER BEWARE:It's a shame I h...RENTER BEWARE:It's a shame I had to even put a "1" star for Henderson....They don't deserve that much! The management is horrible, changed twice and has had numerous on site managers come through and some were much much better than who they currently have running the show and she is SO ARROGANT! PROMISE AFTER PROMISE which always resulted in a big fat NOTHING! Several yrs in the same apartment, no upgrades on flooring nor offers for carpet cleaning (which was promised) was also promised Henderson was going to "paint" all apartments with a new tan color...we were promised a time frame when to expect...again NOTHING...we painted ourselves and since Henderson was supposed to be painting anyway they could paint it THEIR new color once we moved out....We moved out 3mths ago and still no return of deposit. The onsite manager promised on all calls she would contact SUNGATE to get our full refund and call us back or would put it in the mail and it would never arrive....NOW 3mths later she surprizes us with only getting 50$ out of the deposit back....saying they had to repaint (which again they were going to do themselves anyway) and saying we left the apartment a mess. LIE...we left it spotless! The only thing that was dirty was the carpet because its more than 4 years old and Henderson never came through with the shampoo as she promised they would. NO COURTESY'S WHATSOEVER!! Now 3 months later when challenging the site manager, she wants to show us some bogus pictures of a little trash thrown in a circle on the floor of milk cartons and silly stuff and say we left it....LIE! you can tell it was staged the way it was layed out. No pictures of the paint they say we supposedly got on the ceiling which was another lie and nothing to back that up...Henderson will keep your deposit and make up things to say they should keep it. I've read complaints about the owners...THEY NEVER CALL BACK EITHER....SUNGATE MANAGEMENT is not wonderful! The receptionist which is put in place to take all the hard hits tries to be friendly but she is just doing her job and saying what scripts they tell her to say. The two owners are constantly in meetings or out of town. Their numbers to reach them directly are never allowed to be given out. O and of course you have the on site henderson manager who thinks she is just GOD to that place who NEVER EVER CALLS BACK and tries to be a bully and intimidating. WHATS RIGHT IS RIGHT!!! So curious how you can lay yalls heads down at night and get a good nights sleep knowing your really not honest and you make others lose sleep because of your dishonesty! Manager treats the complex as her COMPOUND and she's the WARDEN....Im surprized she doesn't call curfew and lights out! I WOULD NEVER EVER RECOMMEND and say goodbye to any chance of deposit refund...they prop fake pictures. I notice messages on here by voices venting (within their right) of their experiences are challenged and bullied back by the manager who apparently doesn't have enough to do!!

Henderson is a beautiful city located just south of Las Vegas and is full of affordable apartments to rent. The city has amenities you would find in most metropolitan areas but is still a relatively small community. According to the City of Henderson, the population of the community was approximately 270,000 people in 2013. With research, you can find the ideal apartment in Henderson to meet your needs.
Finding Apartments for Rent in Henderson, NV
There are units to rent in all sections of Henderson, but finding the right place that keeps your commute short and meets your space requirements takes careful selection. Apartments for rent near interstate 215 are ideal for those that have to travel to Las Vegas for work and social events. It is important to look at a number of factors including the state of the apartment and its amenities before making a financial selection.
Top Neighborhoods in Henderson, NV
Top neighborhoods in Henderson include Emerald Valley-Green Valley and Lake Wood Village, both of which are close to shopping centers, casinos and popular restaurants. If living in the Emerald Valley-Green Valley area, you are ideally situated to enjoy the best Henderson has to offer, plus you are close to McCarran International Airport, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and the Las Vegas Strip. Lake Wood Village is also close to all of the previously mentioned amenities and attractions, plus it’s within a short distance of Town Square, which is a popular venue for shopping and dining.
Cultural Attractions in Henderson, NV
The top cultural attractions near Henderson involve the Las Strip and the gaming industry. There are small local casinos in Henderson, but most people frequent the Las Vegas Strip when they want to spend a night out on the town. However, there are local attractions, such as the Clark County Museum, Las Vegas Distillery and the Henderson Bird Viewing Reserve, that are available for residents and guests to enjoy. It is hard to escape the attractions of the Las Vegas Strip if you live in Henderson, but there are things to do if you feel like spending time in town. Many people that work in Las Vegas opt to live in Henderson, given the quality of the housing, neighborhoods and distance from the hustle and bustle of tourist-oriented casinos and attractions.
Nightlife in Henderson, NV
There are a number of casino resorts in Henderson, including the Green Valley Ranch and the Sunset Station Hotel & Casino. The nightlife revolves around the casinos and the clubs inside the casinos, which are fun but not as popular as nearby venues on the Las Vegas Strip. There are popular restaurants in the shopping center near Green Valley Ranch, including Claim Jumper and the Elephant Bar Restaurant. Given the prevalence of gaming in Nevada, there are a number of local bars with gaming and gaming-related activities for you to enjoy. The University of Nevada, Las Vegas is close to Henderson, and sporting events also provide a good source of entertainment and nightlife.
Weather in Henderson, NV
The weather in the southern part of Nevada is variable with mild springs and falls, but extremely cold winters and hot summers. Sometimes it snows in the wintertime, which is counterintuitive for those unfamiliar with the weather patterns in the desert. The summer heat is shocking for those that are not from Nevada or used to living in an arid environment. However, the lack of precipitation year-round is ideal for those that prefer warm, relatively stable environments. Both Las Vegas and Henderson are prone to flash-floods, which is something residents should consider when selecting an apartment.
There are a number of apartments for rent in Henderson that are both high-quality and affordable. By living in Henderson, you get the benefits of residing in a small community along with having access to the Las Vegas nightlife. With careful searching, you can find the perfect apartment.

Seven Hills is a master-planned, gated community near Henderson and adjacent to the Henderson Executive Airport. Residents can workout at several area parks and visitors can enjoy a round of 18 at the nearby Rio Secco Golf Club. Off in the distance, view the Las Vegas skyline thanks to the higher elevations above the plains. 

Seven Hills sits approximately 19 miles due south of the city center. Take I-215 west to I-15 north, or take Highway 146 southwest to intersect I-15 north, and then travel to downtown Las Vegas. 

The Clark County School District provides highly rated schools such as Elise L. Wolff Elementary School, and Coronado High School.

Restaurants
Several casual eateries mix with ethnic cuisine establishments in and around Seven Hills. Most restaurants, including a few fast food chains, sit along Eastern Avenue just 2 miles east of the neighborhood. Nightlife includes several bar and grill restaurants. Fireside Restaurant and Tavern on Cactus Avenue, and Osaka Japanese Bistro along Eastern Avenue, mark the closest places to catch live music.

 Angelina's Pizza  on Seven Hills Drive creates custom pies from 8 inches up to 24 inches in diameter to feed one person or a small army. Shrimp alfredo pizza contains shrimp, alfredo sauce, parsley flakes, a bit of parmesan cheese and mozzarella. Cordon bleu pizza has chicken, ham, alfredo sauce, mushrooms, Swiss cheese and mozzarella. For a real treat, the sausage cacciatore comes with sausage sautéed in white wine, mushrooms, peppers and onions tossed in marinara and then served on linguine or fettuccine. If you don't like Italian cuisine, Angelina's has ribs, sub sandwiches, wraps and hamburgers.

 Janelas Restaurant and Bar  opens for breakfast and lunch at Rio Secco Golf Club. The overstuffed omelet contains your choice of bacon, ham or sausage alongside spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions and salsa. The Rio Secco breakfast casserole contains three scrambled eggs, bacon, ham and sausage served over a bed of hash browns and baked with cheese. Lunch includes the Harmon burger, a huge 16-ounce patty stuffed with jalapeños and cheddar cheese without the bun. 

 Fire Side Restaurant & Tavern  has live music from 9:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. every other Saturday, and the place stays open 24 hours with tons of electronic gaming choices. The dinner menu gets served until 11 p.m., and the late night menu kicks in from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. for night owls. Filet chili cheese fries on the appetizer menu represents a meal unto itself with filet mignon, chili and cheese served over french fries. Tenderloin chili contains beef tenderloin and is topped with cheese, onions and sour cream. Hamburgers mark the specialties of the house, including the gigantic Double Dog Dare You burger with 1 pound of ground beef, four slices of bacon, your choice of cheese and one fried egg between two grilled cheese sandwiches. The huge California burrito contains filet tips, peppers, onions, diced potatoes, bacon and mixed cheeses. 

 Remedy's Tavern  has a full menu, two happy hours and a VIP gaming club for electronic gaming. The place stays open 24 hours with daily food and drink specials for late night patrons and mid-afternoon partiers. Just like Las Vegas, the fun never stops here with delicious food and plenty of drinks.


History
Rio Secco Golf Club, the cornerstone of Seven Hills, was built in 1997 and includes several luxury homes. The gated community of Seven Hills grew as a condensed, master-planned project of 1,300 acres and 2,500 homes among several distinct areas. A large parcel of land just west of Seven Hills, known as Inspirada, sold in 2004 to expand the residential area.

The Carroll Shelby Heritage Museum represents the closest museum to the neighborhood. The historic cars on display include famous muscle cars made by Shelby, some of which come from the Las Vegas plant.

Clark County has several arts programs through the cultural arts program in Henderson. The Government Center Amphitheater hosts cultural events and festivals. Heritage Holidays at the Clark County Museum occurs every December, and families can see historic homes, hear holiday carolers and have fun with children's games and activities.


Transportation
Every street in Seven Hills has sidewalks to enjoy a stroll with your family, spouse or pooch. Many streets have dedicated bicycle lanes, including Horizon Ridge Parkway and St. Rose Parkway. The St. Rose Parkway Trail represents a concrete pathway for bicyclists that follows the road.

Seven Hills Drive marks the major north-south road through the neighborhood, while Sunridge Heights goes east and west. St. Rose Parkway to the north runs southwest to northeast. Take the St. Rose Parkway, also known as Highway 146, a few miles in either direction to reach Interstate 15 to the southwest or Interstate 215 to the northeast. Plenty of free parking exists at restaurants, bars and public spaces. Call one of several cab companies to pick you up if your car breaks down, and Uber rides are available.

The closest public transit stop for Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada buses is at Eastern Avenue and Horizon Ridge Parkway. Route 110 buses run 24 hours every hour or every half hour depending on the time of day.


Cost
Living costs more in Seven Hills than in downtown Las Vegas because of higher housing expenses. A one-bedroom apartment goes for $901 per month.

A pint of American beer runs $3 at the local pub. Gasoline typically goes for around 7 percent higher than the national average. A day pass on RTCSNV buses through residential routes costs $5.


Shopping
Many retail stores and shops sit along the intersection of Eastern Avenue and Horizon Ridge, with more storefronts further south of that junction. High-value chains intermingle with upscale stores to provide residents with plenty of options.

Vons and Trader Joe's are the closest supermarkets for your basic grocery needs. Country Fresh Farmers Market near I-215 represents the closest place to purchase locally grown produce. Peruse vendors every Thursday and Friday.

Nicole Beauty & Wigs carries massive amounts of wigs for virtually any style. Shop for medical wigs, hair extensions and fashionable wigs in the large showroom. The shop carries pieces ranging in price from $30 to $5,000 and the store has hair care products to match. Choose from more than 15 name brands and 10 types of hair extensions. The shop opens seven days a week.

A-Round of A-Paws Pet Boarding Resort & Spa caters to dogs and cats with extensive condo arrangements for each pet. Dogs stay in a room 4 feet by 6 feet with a cot, food and daily walks. Upgrade to deluxe accommodations with a television that features dog-themed movies. Cats get a "Kitty Condo" and cats from the same family can live in connected condos. Deluxe amenities for both pets include lambskin blanket. If your dog or cat needs a spa day, schedule a massage, pedicure, facial, hair dye or grooming for some serious pampering.


Parks
A few parks dot the landscape of Seven Hills. Sonata Park features a playground, tennis courts, basketball courts, a wide open field and walking trails. Vivaldi Park has a playground and small baseball field. Rossini Park has a playground for kids. Puccini Park has tennis courts, a basketball court and two volleyball courts. Seven Hills Trail, a concrete pathway, connects all of these parks together. Bring your leashed pooch to each one, and clean up after your pet. Outdoor facilities do not have a fee.

The Children's Festival represents the closest annual event in the Clark County parks system. Bring your children to the Winchester Cultural Center to enjoy a play land created for kids, including arts, crafts, exotic animals, carnival games and climbing walls.

Backing right up to the hills at the south edge of Henderson, Nev., MacDonald Ranch is one of the affluent and comfortable suburbs that makes sure its residents have all they need to make life enjoyable. Renowned for its parks system, Henderson works hard to form a community spirit through all its neighborhoods, and easy shopping, dining, and entertainment are close at hand. In addition, all the world-class dining, shows, and shops of the Las Vegas Strip sit only eight miles to the north.

Everyone from young families to retirees love the MacDonald Ranch area for its many amenities and tight-knit community, and the great school district provides an extra incentive for those with children to check out this neighborhood.

Restaurants
A wide variety of restaurants serve the residents of MacDonald Ranch, mostly clustered along Horizon Ridge Parkway or Eastern Avenue.

Rice bowls, lamb gyros, and chicken and filet mignon kabobs make customers very happy at Stephano's Greek & Mediterranean Grill on Eastern Avenue.  This quick-serve restaurant serves wheat pita that some guests love to eat on its own, dipping it in the creamy tzatziki sauce.  Don't forget to check in online to pick up some free baklava.

When you need a quick lunch or want to pick up dinner to save yourself the hassle of cooking, stop by the Great Harvest Bread Co. to grab a chicken berry pecan sandwich, a bowl of sausage soup, or a classic grilled cheese.  Don't be surprised when you're given a free sample of amazing bread.  Pick up a loaf of cinnamon raisin, challah, or pumpkin chocolate chip for breakfast the next morning.  

For another quick stop, swing by Pho MaiLan for a perfect banh mi sandwich and a bowl of flavorful pho.

Buon Gusto Ristorante feels like a classic restaurant from New York's Little Italy has been transplanted in the desert. This family owned place specializes in sausage and mushroom rigatoni, chicken Francese and penne alla vodka.  Before your meal even starts, enjoy the melt-in-your-mouth bread.

With the amazing nightlife of Vegas just up the road, MacDonald Ranch can focus on intimate bars and pubs that give the community casual places to hang out and enjoy life.  Just to the west of the neighborhood, you'll find Shakespeare's Grille and Pub, an old-school British pub that has something fun going on every night of the week.  Come show of your trivia expertise, grab a mic for karaoke, or just sit back on weekends to enjoy live music and the more than 120 beers available.



History
As one of the neighborhoods of Henderson, MacDonald Ranch was part of the local housing boom of the 1990s, prompted when a rocket-fuel factory in the formerly industrial area exploded in 1988, causing damage miles away. As Henderson expanded, many affluent subdivisions were developed in the city's southern hills, including MacDonald Ranch.

Although MacDonald Ranch doesn't house any museums, the Lion Habitat Ranch sits just to the west of the neighborhood. Home to almost 50 lions, mostly retired from the former MGM Grand Lion Habitat, this attraction lets you get up close and personal with the king of beasts.

For arts and entertainment, locals head north to Vegas, but they stay in town for recreation, including the Las Vegas Super Spartan Race, which covers about 10 miles over dirt trails with pre-set obstacles.


Transportation
You'll want a car if you live in MacDonald Ranch, since public transportation options are somewhat limited, and the vast distances of the desert tend to be difficult for pedestrians and cyclists to cope with in the summer heat. You'll find free public and residential parking readily available through all of Henderson, and proximity to Interstates 15 and 215 make it easy to get out of town or jaunt up to Vegas.

Public transportation is limited to RTC Transit bus lines, which connect Henderson to Las Vegas and other points in the Las Vegas Valley. Although cabs don't roam the streets of Henderson as they do the Las Vegas Strip, you can always call a taxi or boot up your phone's Uber app when you want door-to-door transportation. 


Cost
Life in the affluent suburb of MacDonald Ranch runs about 9 percent higher than the cost of living in Henderson overall. When you gas up your car, expect to pay 11 percent more than the national average. However, if you choose to use public transportation, the trip in to the Las Vegas Strip runs you only $2.

The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in MacDonald Ranch is $937. When you stop for a pint of beer with neighbors at a local pub, expect to pay about $6.


Shopping
World-class shopping, including shops by some of the top designers in the world, awaits MacDonald Ranch residents just up the road on the Las Vegas Strip.  In addition, convenient big-box stores like Target, Marshalls, and HomeGoods lies right in the neighborhood, as do many smaller specialty shops and boutiques.

In the absence of an Ikea store, ModernLV provides those wanting to inexpensively set up their new homes with a great service.  Just order what you want from the online Ikea catalog, and Modern LV not only delivers your purchases, they also assemble them.

MacDonald Ranch residents typically head to Smith's, Trader Joe's or Sprouts Farmers Market for their basic grocery shopping.  Branded Meats, just to the east of the neighborhood, gives you the convenience and luxury of an old-fashioned butcher shop that cuts your high-quality meats to order.  The Country Fresh Farmers Market on Green Valley Parkway sells farm-fresh produce, kettle corn, fresh-baked bread and loose-leaf tea every Friday afternoon.


Parks
MacDonald Ranch encompasses and backs up to many parks and recreational areas, making this neighborhood a haven for nature lovers. 

Head to Anthem Ranch Park for some roller hockey, basketball, soccer, football, baseball or volleyball. The park turns on its lights at night to allow teams to practice and play in the cool of the evening. Get a great workout climbing the hill, bring your dog for a walk, or drop off your teenager and his skateboard to practice in the skate park.

Sunridge Park features a shade-covered kids' playground carpeted with Astroturf so it's always green and soft. Horizon Crest Park includes three separate dog parks, as well as tube slides and swings for the kids.

Henderson's impressive parks system sponsors a wide range of free, family-friendly events throughout the year. Enjoy the fireworks on the Fourth of July, team up with other moms at the yearly Stroll 'n' Roll, and turn out with the whole family to participate in WinterFest.

A suburb of Henderson and a part of the Las Vegas metro area, Gibson Springs is a residential area with new-construction homes and wide streets. Known for its good schools, the neighborhood brings in families and professionals who work around Las Vegas.

Situated between the downtown areas of Las Vegas and Henderson, Gibson Springs affords residents with an ideal location for business and recreation. The glittering lights of Las Vegas lie 12 miles to the northwest, and Henderson sits just 5 miles to the southeast. With a short drive, residents can access the spectacular scenery and outdoor activities at Lake Mead, Red Rock Canyon and the Valley of Fire.

Restaurants
Chain restaurants dominate the dining landscape in Gibson Springs, serving a mix of American, Mexican and Asian cuisines. Most of the neighborhood's eateries lining Warm Springs Road and Stephanie Street fall into the low- or mid-price category.
 
While getting your car repaired in the Valley Auto Mall, stop by the 50s-themed Mustang Sally's Diner at the Ford dealership. In the mornings, fill up with the All-American F-150 breakfast, which comes with eggs, hash browns, toast and your choice of breakfast meat. Each menu item comes in at less than $10, so meals don't break the bank. Don't worry if you have a long wait for your repairs — the diner's free Wi-Fi can keep you entertained.

Enjoy a bowl of hot egg drop soup while you peruse the large menu at Cook on Wok, a classic Chinese restaurant on Stephanie Street. Locals love the kung pao chicken and the cheap lunch specials. When in a hurry, order online for takeout or delivery.

For a Middle Eastern meal, Gibson Springs residents head right to Flame Kabob on Warm Springs Road. Cool down with a glass of Persian rose water iced tea, and dig into a lamb Kubideh kabob, which comes wrapped in a made-to-order taftoon bread.

Nightlife options in Gibson Springs remain few and far between, but a few bar/restaurant combos sit near the edges of the neighborhood. Locals gather at Chilly Palmers for great service and a stocked bar. Sports fans head to Sierra Gold on game days. Don't worry about missing important plays — even the bathrooms feature large-screen TVs. For live music, head into downtown Henderson or Las Vegas.


History
For centuries, Gibson Springs was nothing more than an open stretch of desert. During the late 1900s, it held a gravel pit, a marshmallow factory and a PEPCON plant that made ammonium perchlorate. In 1988, massive explosions at the PEPCON facility leveled all of the industrial buildings in the area. The bulk of residential development took place in 2000 and later.

As a still young neighborhood, Gibson Springs does not have an established cultural scene. The Clark County Museum and Theatre in the Valley in Henderson keep residents educated and entertained. Although Gibson Springs does not host annual events, nearby Henderson draws residents with the Henderson Heritage Festival and the St. Patrick's Day Festival.


Transportation
Given its large size and the high Nevada temperatures, Gibson Springs requires a car for almost all errands. Residential areas feature sidewalks for safe recreational walking. Some streets feature bike lanes, and a small network of trails in the southwestern corner of the neighborhood enables convenient bike-commuter connections to the Union Pacific Railroad Trail. The neighborhood does not provide public transportation, but bus routes HDX and 217 run along Interstate 215 to the south.

Cabs can be difficult to hail on the street in most areas of Gibson Springs, so you should call ahead or schedule a ride with Uber. If you own a car, you'll find a wealth of free street parking throughout the area. Interstate 215 and Highway 95 run along the south and east edges of the neighborhood, enabling residents to get into Henderson or Las Vegas with ease.


Cost
The cost of living in Gibson Springs sits higher than the citywide average for Henderson and Las Vegas, but not by much. You'll find plenty of affordable housing options, particularly in comparison to Henderson. If you're looking to rent rather than buy, expect an average rental rate of $841.62.

Other than housing, costs in Gibson Springs tend to stay even with the rest of the Las Vegas metro area. A beer at a local bar generally goes for $5 or less, and an express bus ride into downtown Las Vegas costs $6. When you pull up to the gas pump, be prepared to pay about 10 percent more than the national gas average.


Shopping
You won't find many shopping options in Gibson Springs itself; the neighborhood houses little more than a few scattered chain stores. Fortunately for retail addicts, a few shopping centers sit just north of Gibson Springs. For clothing and high-end shopping, make the short drive to the Galleria Commons, Whitney Ranch Shopping Center and the Galleria at Sunset. 

Closer to home, local educators and parents love the Lakeshore Learning Store, which sells everything from school supplies to craft project kits. Whether you want a geography workbook or an educational toy, the store carries a product to suit. Don't hesitate to ask the knowledgeable staff for recommendations.

If you're in the market for soccer supplies, Soccer Zone on Warm Springs Road should be your first stop. Buy a Real Madrid or a New Zealand All Blacks jersey, or special-order equipment for your child's soccer team.

Multiple national grocery stores line the outer edge of Gibson Springs, including Wal-Mart, Smith's and WinCo Foods. Restock your wine cooler at Total Wine & More on Stephanie Street. Browse through the enormous beer selection to find a new craft brew, or participate in one of the store's education sessions. Pick up locally grown produce, fresh flowers and homemade bread at the Country Fresh Farmers Market in Henderson to the southeast.


Parks
Though Gibson Springs features just three parks, residents enjoy ample outdoor space. At the compact Trail Canyon Park, join a pickup game of basketball, or work on your aim at the horseshoe pits. Local families take advantage of the park's playground and lighted tennis courts. Fitness buffs in Gibson Springs make use of the Arroyo Grande Sports Complex, which covers 56 acres and includes ball fields, a disc golf course, running paths and bike trails. Bring your dog to the on-site dog park, or reserve the picnic shelters for special events.

Just to the south, the man-made lake at Cornerstone Park provides a welcome break from the Nevada desert views. Enjoy a long run on the park's extensive trail network, or get a tough workout on the exercise stairs. Local groups host events in the park throughout the year. All parks in Gibson Springs provide free entrance.
