                           worldwide
                           In November 1998, millions of television viewers watched as Thomas Youk died. Suffering from the late stages of Lou Gehrig's
                              disease, Youk had called upon the infamous Michigan pathologist, Dr. Jack Kevorkian, to help end his life on his own terms.
                              After delivering the videotaped death to 60 Minutes, Kevorkian was arrested and convicted of manslaughter, despite the fact
                              that Youk's family firmly believed that the ending of his life qualified as a good death." "Beyond the Good Death takes an
                              anthropological approach, examining the changes in our concept of death over the last several decades. As author James W.
                              Green determines, the attitudes of today's baby boomers differ greatly from those of their parents and grandparents, who spoke
                              politely and in hushed voices of those who had "passed away." Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, in the 1960s, gave the public a new
                              language for speaking openly about death with her "five steps of dying." If we talked more about death, she emphasized, it
                              would become less fearful for everyone." "The term "good death" reentered the public consciousness as narratives of AIDS,
                              cancer, and other chronic diseases were featured on talk shows and in popular books such as the best-selling Tuesdays with
                              Morrie. Green looks at a number of contemporary secular American death practices that are still informed by an ancient religious
                              ethos. Most important, perhaps, Beyond the Good Death provides an interpretation of the ways in which Americans react when
                              death is at hand for themselves or for those they care about

                           Pilot retention is a serious problem for the United States Air Force. Pilots are separating faster than replacements can be
                              trained. The purpose of this pilot retention research project is threefold: 1) gather retention information from three Air
                              University schools (SOS, ACSC, AWC); 2) develop conclusions as a result of the survey findings; and 3) make recommendations
                              on possible solutions to the Air Force pilot retention problem. Analyzing the survey results, the authors found many perceptual
                              differences between the three schools. This perceptual problem is the basis for this project. Since the authors represent
                              the top 20 percent of all Air Force majors and come from completely different backgrounds, their misconceived ideas could
                              be representative of other Air Force officers in similar positions. To check these gut feelings, the authors administered
                              a survey to pilots in SOS class 87-E, to the 88 ACSC class, and to the 1988 AWC class. This sample size represents the future
                              leaders of the Air Force at three different points in a career. The SOS students represent primarily the 5 to 11 year group,
                              the ACSC students represent the mid-level career officer, and the AWC students represent the immediate future leaders of the
                              Air Force with many proceeding directly into influential leadership positions after graduation in May. Keywords: Personnel

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREBeyond The Good Death: The Anthropology Of Modern Dyingby Green, James W.In November 1998, millions of television viewers watched as Thomas Youk died. Suffering from the late stages of Lou Gehrig's disease, Youk had called upon infamous Michigan pathologist Dr. Jack Kevorkian to help end his life on his own terms. After delivering the videotape to 60 Minutes, Kevorkian was arrested and convicted of manslaughter, despite the fact that Youk's family firmly believed that the ending of his life qualified as a good death.Death is political, as the controversies surrounding Jack Kevorkian and, more recently, Terri Schiavo have shown. While death is a natural event, modern end-of-life experiences are shaped by new medical, demographic, and cultural trends. People who are dying are kept alive, sometimes against their will or the will of their family, with powerful medications, machines, and "heroic measures." Current research on end-of-life issues is substantial, involving many fields. Beyond the Good Death takes an anthropological approach, examining the changes in our concept of death over the last several decades. As author James W. Green determines, the attitudes of today's baby boomers differ greatly from those of their parents and grandparents, who spoke politely and in hushed voices of those who had "passed away." Dr. Elisabeth K bler-Ross, in the 1960s, gave the public a new language for speaking openly about death with her "five steps of dying." If we talked more about death, she emphasized, it would become less fearful for everyone.The term "good death" reentered the public consciousness as narratives of AIDS, cancer, and other chronic diseases were featured on talk shows and in popular books such as the best-selling Tuesdays with Morrie. Green looks at a number of contemporary secular American death practices that are still informed by an ancient religious ethos. Most important, Beyond the Good Death provides an interpretation of the ways in which Americans react when death is at hand for themselves or for those they care about.Cultural, Death & DyingCondition: Used - GoodHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
