Prothena Corporation plc Key Developments

Prothena Corporation plc Announces Initiation of Phase 2 PASADENA Study of PRX002/RG7935 in Patients with Early Parkinson’s Disease
Jul 5 17
Prothena Corporation plc announced that the first patient has been enrolled in PASADENA, a global Phase 2 study of PRX002/RG7935 in patients with early Parkinson’s disease. PRX002/RG7935 is an anti-alpha-synuclein antibody under investigation as a disease-modifying treatment for Parkinson’s disease and is the focus of a worldwide collaboration between Prothena and Roche. The start of the study triggered a $30 million milestone from Roche to Prothena, which was earned in the second quarter of 2017. Prothena had previously received $45 million in upfront and development milestone payments. PASADENA is a two-part Phase 2 clinical study in early Parkinson’s disease patients that is being conducted by Roche. Part 1 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-arm study designed to enroll approximately 300 patients to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PRX002/RG7935 in patients over 52 weeks. In part 1, patients will be randomized on a 1:1:1 basis to receive one of two active doses (1,500 mg or 4,500 mg) of PRX002/RG7935 or placebo via intravenous infusion once every 4 weeks. Eligible patients must not be on dopaminergic therapy and must not be expected to require dopaminergic therapy for at least 52 weeks. Part 2 of the study is a 52-week blinded extension phase in which patients from the placebo arm of the study will be re-randomized onto one of two active doses on a 1:1 basis, so that all participants will be on active treatment. Patients who were originally randomized to an active dose will continue at that dose level for the additional 52 weeks. In part 2, patients will be allowed to use concomitant dopaminergic therapy. Any patient who medically requires initiation of dopaminergic therapy during part 1 will have their subsequent data censored for the primary endpoint analysis. The primary endpoint of this study is the comparison of change from baseline in the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) total score (sections 1, 2 and 3) at the completion of part 1 (week 52) in each treatment group vs. the placebo group. The study is designed with 80% power and a one-sided alpha of 0.10 to detect a 37.5% relative between group reduction from baseline to week 52. A prespecified exploratory analysis will compare the results of the two pooled treatment arms vs. placebo. Key secondary endpoints include safety, tolerability and DaT-SPECT imaging.

Dr. Zago, who has been Prothena’s Head of Research since 2015, will have responsibility for defining and executing the company’s research strategy and advancing the company’s drug discovery pipeline.

During his tenure at Prothena, he has led teams that have built a strong discovery pipeline and advanced four programs based on novel mechanisms through discovery and preclinical development into the clinic.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Careers – Prothena































 
 








CareersProthena’s success is driven by our people. We are dedicated to attracting individuals who share our vision to improve human health by putting patients first. But it’s not just about what we do at Prothena, it’s how we do it. That’s why we hire creative and courageous individuals who support one another and are not afraid to try new ideas. Our culture reflects our core values:  creative – in all that we do; courageous – driven to succeed; and selfless – for the greater good.  These values are brought to life every day by the following characteristics:


OUR CORE VALUES

Creative – in all that we do
We have a culture that fosters creativity, because we understand that being creative motivates employees to engage completely and take ownership and pride in their work. We recognize creativity is a key to new ideas and innovation.

Selfless – for the greater good
In order to achieve our vision of creating novel protein immunotherapies to transform patients’ lives, we must also be selfless. Putting the unmet needs of patients first is the driving force behind our efforts at Prothena.

Courageous – driven to succeed
Prothena employees must also be courageous. We believe that having the courage to trust in one’s own abilities, take on challenges and try new approaches equates to success.

Humor – enjoy the journey
We are passionate about our unwavering commitment to develop innovative new therapies for patients. In science, where obstacles are common, we believe that appreciating humor in the day-to-day is an indispensable advantage that allows us to embrace and tackle the challenges that we face along our complex journey.

The progress we have made as a company reflects our core values of creativity, courage and selflessness seen in each of our employees. For more on Prothena’s culture, read the recent article “Does Size Kill Culture? Prothena Doesn’t Think So,” by Kevin Hickey, VP, Human Resources.


Our passion is the patient. We’re working to develop new medicines to fundamentally alter the course of progressive diseases.


Cutting-edge science is what we do. “Tried-and-true” won’t produce breakthroughs. We challenge ourselves to target the root causes of many serious diseases to create treatments that are truly disease modifying.


We embrace creativity and risk-taking. Practice intelligent risk-taking to forge into uncharted scientific territory. Because that’s what innovation requires.


The team comes first. We’re in this together and everyone contributes toward the common goal of helping patients.
Collaboration is key. No one can do it alone. We believe in collaboration. You see it in all we do, starting with how we communicate and work together.


We’re in it for the long haul. It’s true, we have ambitious goals. We’re driven to succeed and believe in trying new approaches.


We love what we do. We celebrate our successes—the big ones, the little ones, and everything in between.


Compensation and Benefits
Prothena’s future success lies in the ability to attract and retain great employees. We recognize strong individual performance, and reward it accordingly with market-competitive salaries and cash and equity incentive compensation plans. In addition, our comprehensive benefits program is designed to meet the personal needs of our employees by offering choice and flexibility.
We offer highly competitive benefits across health & wellness, financial well-being and work/life balance categories, and invite you to find out more about current opportunities in our South San Francisco, California; Dublin, Ireland; Zug, Switzerland; and field locations.
