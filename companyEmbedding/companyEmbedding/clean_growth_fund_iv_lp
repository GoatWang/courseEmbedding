Overview

Asset classes are a result of a period strategic asset allocation process and approved by the CalPERS Board of Administration.
CalPERS' investment portfolio is diversified into several asset classes.
Strategic asset allocation is the dominant determinant of portfolio risk and return; a well-diversified portfolio shapes our long-term performance, protects the Retirement Fund, and ensures any weaknesses in one area are offset by gains in another.
To review the specific asset and investment types available for investment proposal submissions, including submissions documents and other items related to the proposal process, visit Investment Proposal Submission.

   More in Private Equity 




Private Equity Program Fund Performance Review

As of September 30, 2016, the since inception Net IRR is 10.7% and the Net Multiple is 1.4x.
The table below reflects the performance of all active PE partnership investments as of September 30, 2016. At the end of each quarter, the General Partners report on the value of invested capital. The General Partners have 120 days to provide Limited Partners with financial data, so there is generally a 2-quarter delay in performance reporting.



  How to Read the Performance Review Table  



The table is updated quarterly and provides information on the status of all active CalPERS private equity commitments; it doesn't include any exited partnership investments.

The Fund column lists the names of all active partnership investments.
Vintage Year is the year in which CalPERS’ first cash flow for the investment occurred.
Capital Committed identifies the original amount CalPERS committed to each fund.
Cash In represents capital contributed for investments and management fees.
Cash Out represents distributions CalPERS has received back from the fund.
Cash Out & Remaining Value represents the distributions CalPERS has received plus the reported value of the invested capital.
Net IRR is the Net Internal Rate of Return based on CalPERS’ actual cash flows and the reported value of the invested capital.
Investment Multiple is the Cash Out & Remaining Value divided by the Cash In.

In evaluating private equity performance, CalPERS emphasizes using both the realized Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Investment Multiple. Interim IRRs by themselves are not the best indicators of current or future fund performance.
The IRR is calculated based on CalPERS records of cash flows and financial statements from the investment managers.

1Not Meaningful: Funds with a vintage year of 2012 or later are in the initial stages of their investment life cycle. Any performance analysis done on these funds would not generate meaningful results as private equity funds are understood to be long-term investments.
2Partnership investment is using a cash adjusted market value.

North Sky Capital has closed its latest fund at $63 million, above its original $50 million target. Investors of Clean Growth Fund IV include foundations and family offices. The pool targets investments that create environmental and social benefits like renewable energy, resource efficiency and job creation. North Sky’s latest clean energy infrastructure fund, Alliance Fund II, raised $240 million earlier this year.
PRESS RELEASE
Minneapolis, MN – North Sky Capital is pleased to announce the closing of Clean Growth Fund IV at $63 million, which was above the original $50 million fundraising target.  This is North Sky Capital’s sixth impact fund.  Investors include prominent foundations and family offices from across the USA.  The goal of the fund is to generate an outstanding private equity return for investors, while also creating environmental and social benefits like renewable energy, resource efficiency and job creation.  The team has already made four investments and deployed 23% of the fund’s capital.
Gretchen Postula, Head of Investor Relations, said, “Since 2005, we have been in the vanguard of the impact investment movement but always with the top priority of producing great investment returns.  Our focus on industry sectors such as energy, food, water, transportation and industrial efficiency, means that a lot of environmental and social good will naturally emanate from our work.  However, the goal from day one has always been clear: returns, returns, returns.” 





Earlier this year, North Sky Capital closed its latest clean energy infrastructure fund, Alliance Fund II (“AF II”).  AF II is a $240 million fund that finances the construction and/or repowering of solar, wind, hydro, energy storage and other related projects.  Investors include Taft Hartley pension plans, foundations and family offices.  The returns, environmental and jobs creation goals of AF II are similar to Clean Growth Fund IV.  So far, the team has made six investments and deployed 45% of AF II’s capital.
Mike Pohlen, Managing Director, said, “This is an exciting time for us.  We are aware of other firms that have raised three or four impact funds, but I don’t think any other firm has raised six of them.  We have an unparalleled depth and breadth of view and understanding of private equity and infrastructure investment opportunities.  We are using our experience and leadership position to create value for our investors and make the world a better place.  We are very pleased with the investment opportunities we are seeing for CGF IV and AF II and the results so far.”
North Sky Capital is also happy to announce the addition of Kyle Kroeger to our clean energy infrastructure investment team.  “Kyle brings excellent deal sourcing, analysis and execution capabilities to the team, having previously worked at Terraform, an owner and operator of clean energy renewable assets,” said Danny Zouber, Managing Director.
North Sky Capital is a registered investment adviser and a leader in impact investing with $1.2 billion in committed capital across its various funds.  North Sky was established in 2000 and is based in Minneapolis, MN.  For more information, visit www.northskycapital.com.
