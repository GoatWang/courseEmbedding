Client Testimonials






Duncan Cowie - Director @ Fleming Yachts

“
Fleming Yachts enjoy working with Prestige Vision Inc, who operate in a very professional manner. We particularly like the fact that we can leave you to carry out a project without needing constant input and suggestions from us, you know what is needed and you make it happen - the end result is always a professional looking product.
”

 






Paul W. Ayres - Director @ USF Health, CAMLS

“
Communicating to our clients the benefits of utilizing CAMLS for their healthcare education programs has been one of the largest obstacles to overcome. The use of the virtual tours have been a tremendously helpful tool in brining CAMLS to the client allowing them to see for themselves the advantages of using the Center for their programs.
”

 






Mike Joyce - CEO @ Hargrave Yachts

“
The team from Prestige Vision are real pros - they get in and get out and don't upset the crew or the owners and the finished product speaks for itself. It's a great product at a great price and we recommend it to all our listings and believe it represents that competitive edge everyone is looking for in a crowded marketplace.

WHAT WE DO 








About Prestige Vision, Inc.


With offices in British Columbia, New York City and Manila, and photographers stationed in eight cities across three continents, Prestige Vision is a world leader in 360� Virtual Tours for boats, yachts, business aircraft, resort hotels and other luxury products. We believe in increasing sales, not sales effort. We believe in leveraging online, mobile and social technologies to connect with today�s luxury buyers. And we believe your customers should be able to fall in love with your product line 24/7 from anywhere in the world.
At Prestige Vision, we believe in showing smart � and selling fast!




Our Story



In 2007, an ambitious young yacht (boat) broker set out with an equally energetic programmer to change the way luxury products are marketed and purchased. Little more than 18 months later, Vincent Finetti and Michael Hrustaliov, co-founders of Prestige Vision, had done just that. In less than two years, Prestige Vision was working with more than 170 clients worldwide, including global leaders in the luxury yacht and business aircraft industries. The reason for our success is simple: we never compromise on quality, we treat every client�s bottom line as if it were our own, and we provide high quality, cost-effective marketing tools that move inventory by self-attracting qualified buyers and discouraging window-shoppers.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in California:













Does Prestige Inc carry a valid contracting license?



In California, any remodeling or construction project that exceeds $500 (labor and materials), requires a contractor to have an active license with the California Contractor State License Board (CSLB).
Prestige Inc currently holds license 943704 (General Building Contractor), which was Active when we last checked.











How important is contractor licensing in California?



The CSLB is one of the highest rated licensing boards in the US. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience. In addition, the CSLB requires all license holders to maintain at least $2,500 in operating capital and provides you with a range of other consumer protections.











Your liability risk when hiring Prestige Inc



Contractors in California are required to carry workers' compensation insurance if they have employees and proof of liability insurance with the cumulative limit of $1 million for licensees with five or fewer persons, and an additional 100,000 for each additional member over five, not to exceed $5 million total.











Financial recourse when hiring Prestige Inc



All licensed contractors in California are required to maintain a bond, which provides you with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations. If you feel as though you have been taken advantage of, you should leave feedback on the contractor's BuildZoom profile and file a complaint with the CSLB.
Prestige Inc has a $15,000 bond with American Safety Casualty Insurance Company. 











What else should I know before hiring Prestige Inc



California contractors are required to submit their fingerprints to the board, which are then checked against criminal records held by the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to obtaining a valid contracting license.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The California State License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
