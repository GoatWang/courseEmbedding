Fitch Affirms WFRBS 2013-C12 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms WFRBS 2013-C12
    





December 02, 2015 02:08 PM Eastern Standard Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 15 classes of WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 
      (WFRBS) commercial mortgage pass-through certificates series 2013-C12. A 
      detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations reflect the transaction's stable performance since 
      issuance and that the pool continues to perform as expected. There are 
      no delinquent or specially serviced loans. Based on the year-end (YE) 
      2014 net operating incomes (NOIs) for the 95% of the pool that reported, 
      the pool's overall NOI has increased 7.4% since issuance. There is, 
      however, a notable single tenant exposure within the transaction. Five 
      of the top 15 loans representing 19% of the pool are secured by 
      properties 100% leased to a single tenant.
    

      There are 14 loans (11.6%) on the master servicer's watchlist, of which 
      five (7.9%) are due to occupancy declines, three (1.7%) for lease 
      rollover concerns and two for deferred maintenance. Two of the watchlist 
      loans (1%) that are due to occupancy declines are considered Fitch Loans 
      of Concern.
    

      As of the November 2015 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been reduced by 3.3% to $1.19 billion from $1.23 
      billion at issuance. Per the servicer reporting, two loans (9.5% of the 
      pool) are defeased. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting class G.
    

      The largest loan in the pool is the Grand Beach Hotel loan (10.4% of the 
      pool), which is secured by a 424-room, 20-story, full-service oceanfront 
      hotel located in Miami Beach, Florida. Amenities at the property include 
      a fitness center, three pools, full service restaurant, meeting 
      facilities, a business center, and valet parking including 560 spaces. 
      As of September 2015, the debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) was 
      reported to be 2.41x compared to 2.13x at issuance. According to the 
      September 2015 STR report, the trailing 12 month (TTM) occupancy was 
      reported to be 69%, which ranks last in the property's competitive set. 
      Occupancy has been trending downward since 2013 when the TTM occupancy 
      was reported to be 83%. ADR and RevPar, however, have remained in the 
      middle of the competitive set for the last two years.
    

      The next largest loan in the pool is the RHP Portfolio II loan (9.6% of 
      the pool). The loan is collateralized by 18 manufactured housing 
      communities comprising 2,967 home pads with nine properties in Colorado 
      (1,814 pads), six in Wyoming (737 pads), two in Illinois (351 pads), and 
      one in Arizona (65 pads). As of September 2015, the occupancy and DSCR 
      was reported to be 92% and 1.85x respectively, which compares favorably 
      to 86% and 1.47x at issuance.
    

      The third largest loan in the pool, One South Wacker Drive (8%), is 
      fully defeased. The fourth largest loan in the pool is the Merrill Lynch 
      Office loan, which is secured by three class-A office buildings totaling 
      481,854 square-feet (sf) located in Hopewell, NJ. The buildings are part 
      of a larger 1.8 million sf Merrill Lynch campus. The properties are 100% 
      leased to Merrill Lynch through December 2024. As of YE 2014, the DSCR 
      for the interest-only loan was reported to be 3.08x.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlook for all classes remains Stable due to stable 
      collateral performance. Fitch does not foresee positive or negative 
      ratings migration unless a material economic or asset level event 
      changes the underlying transaction's portfolio-level metrics.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
