Andrew S. Rosen





Occupation
Chairman and CEO of Kaplan, Inc.


Andrew S. Rosen is current Chairman and CEO of Kaplan, Inc.,[1] a global education company that began as a test prep provider in 1938 and was purchased by The Washington Post Company, now Graham Holdings Company, in 1984.[2] Rosen joined Kaplan in 1992 and was named Chairman and CEO in November 2008 following the resignation of long-time Chairman and CEO Jonathan Grayer.[3]
Education and career[edit]
Rosen joined The Washington Post Company in 1986 as a staff attorney for The Washington Post newspaper and moved to Newsweek as Assistant Counsel in 1988. When he moved to Kaplan, he served as Center Administrator, Regional Director, and Vice President for Field Management prior to assuming the role of Chief Operating Officer in 1997. He was then named President of Kaplan, Inc. in 2002[4] and later assumed responsibility for all of Kaplan’s higher education operations, including Kaplan University, Concord Law School and Kaplan Virtual Education. Under his leadership, Kaplan Higher Education has grown to account for half of Kaplan’s $2 billion revenue.[5]
In October 2011, Rosen's first book, Change.edu: Rebooting for the New Talent Economy, was published. The book details Rosen's belief that the American higher education system has strayed from the goals of access, quality, affordability, and accountability and offers his ideas on how to restore those traits to America's higher education institutions.[6] Change.edu was listed on Bill Gates's "Reading List" in Foreign Policy magazine's December 2011 "The Foreign Policy Top 100 Global Thinkers" feature,[7] and Gates called the book "truly important for the debate on what needs to be done to improve the success of post-secondary education in America".[8] In a review on Amazon.com, former New York City Schools Chancellor Joel Klein wrote, "this is a must-read book for those who care about fixing our nation’s higher education problems".[9]
Rosen holds an A.B. degree from Duke University and a J.D. from Yale Law School.[10] Before joining The Washington Post Company, Rosen served as law clerk to the Hon. Levin H. Campbell, Chief Judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston.
Other roles[edit]
Rosen currently serves on the boards of Enterprise Florida, the Broward Workshop, Pine Crest School, the Broward Alliance and the Council for Educational Change.

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?

Description

                    It's no wonder American higher education is facing a crisis.
 While low-income students can't find a spot in their local community colleges for lack of funding, public four-year universities are spending staggering sums on luxurious residence halls, ever-bigger football stadiums, and obscure research institutes. We have cosseted our most advantaged students even as we deny access to the working adults who urgently need higher education to advance their careers and our economy. In Change.edu: Rebooting for the new talent economy Andrew S. Rosen clearly and entertainingly details how far the American higher education system has strayed from the goals of access, quality, affordability, and accountability that should characterize our system, and offers a prescription to restore American educational pre-eminence. To change, our system will have to end its reflexive opposition to anything new and different. Rosen describes how each new wave of innovation and expansion of educational access-- starting with the founding of Harvard in 1636, and continuing with the advent of land-grant colleges in the 19th century, community colleges in the 20th century and private sector colleges over the last two decades--has been met with misunderstanding and ridicule. When colleges like the University of California, Cornell and Purdue were founded, they were scorned as "pretenders to the title of university" - language that tracks later criticisms of community colleges and most recently for-profit colleges. Avoiding that condescension is just one of the reasons colleges have come under the sway of "Harvard Envy" - schools that were founded to expand access feel an inexorable tug to become more prestigious and exclusive. Even worse, the competition for the best students has led universities to turn themselves into full-fledged resorts; they've built climbing walls, French bistros and 20-person hot-tubs to entice students to their campuses. How can America address an incentive system in higher education that is mismatched to the challenges of the years ahead? In Change.edu, Rosen outlines "seven certainties" of education in the coming 25 years, and presents an imperative for how our system must prepare for the coming changes. He proposes a new "playbook" for dealing with the change ahead, one that will enable American higher education to regain its global primacy and be a catalyst for economic growth in the 21st century.show more

Review quote

                            ."..a smart, easy-to-read overview of the weaknesses of colleges and universities and the benefits of the fast-growing private-sector colleges...While this book will not quiet all the critics, it effectively identifies weaknesses in both the nonprofit and the public sectors and should stimulate college presidents to reconsider some of their priorities." "--School Library Journal" "Presently, this may be the subject of snide editorials and contemptuous hearings, but Rosen envisions a day when for-profit learning centers step up and fill the education gap much in the same way "land grant" and community colleges did in years past. The alternative, he fears, spells trouble for American supremacy in education." "--Kirkus Reviews""Andrew Rosen has written a great new book on higher education in America, Change.edu: Rebooting for the New Talent Economy. It is provocative, insightful, and mostly correct. Yet, I predict, it will be largely ignored by the higher-education community." --Richard Vedder, Innovations blog for "The Chronicle of Higher Education""Americans know that our primary and secondary schools are woefully under-performing but believe our colleges and universities are second to none. Andy Rosen blows a big hole in that belief, showing that, just when we need to grow the number of students getting a high-quality post-secondary education, our state universities are in financial distress and our private schools are quickly becoming too costly for all but the wealthy. This is a must-read book for those who care about fixing our nation's higher education problems before they become intractable." --Former New York City Schools Chancellor, Joel Kleinshow more
