(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  The following discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated interim financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  The statements in this discussion regarding industry trends, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on November 28, 2016, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Annual Report on Form 10-K/A filed with the SEC on December 14, 2016 (collectively, the "2016 Form 10-K") and "-Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and Part II, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" below. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements.  Unless otherwise noted in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the term "Wesco Aircraft" means Wesco Aircraft Holdings, Inc., our top-level holding company, and the terms "Wesco," "the Company," "we," "us," "our" and "our company" mean Wesco Aircraft and its subsidiaries. References to "fiscal year" mean the year ending or ended September 30. For example, "fiscal year 2017" or "fiscal 2017" means the period from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017.  Executive Overview  We are the world's leading distributor and provider of comprehensive supply chain management services to the global aerospace industry, based on annual sales. Our services range from traditional distribution to the management of supplier relationships, quality assurance, kitting, just-in-time ("JIT") delivery and point-of-use inventory management. We supply over 565,000 active stock-keeping units ("SKUs"), including C-class hardware, chemicals, electronic components, bearings, tools and machined parts. We serve our customers under both (1) long-term contractual arrangements ("Contracts"), which include JIT contracts that govern the provision of comprehensive outsourced supply chain management services and long-term agreements ("LTAs"), that typically set prices for specific products, and (2) ad hoc sales.  Founded in 1953 by the father of our current Chairman of the Board of Directors, Wesco has grown to serve over 7,000 customers, which are primarily in the commercial, military and general aviation sectors, including the leading original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") and their subcontractors, through which we support nearly all major Western aircraft programs. We also service industrial customers, which include customers in the automotive, energy, pharmaceutical and electronics sectors.  Industry Trends Affecting Our Business  We rely on demand for new commercial and military aircraft for a significant portion of our sales. Commercial aircraft demand is driven by many factors, including the global economy, industry passenger volumes and capacity utilization, airline profitability, introduction of new models and the lifecycle of current fleets. Demand for business jets is closely correlated to regional economic conditions and corporate profits, but also influenced by new models and changes in ownership dynamics. Military aircraft demand is primarily driven by government spending, the timing of orders and evolving U.S. Department of Defense strategies and policies.  Aftermarket demand is affected by many of the same trends as those in OEM channels, as well as requirements to maintain aging aircraft and the cost of fuel, which can lead to greater utilization of existing planes. Demand in the military aftermarket is further driven by changes in overall fleet size and the level of U.S. military operational activity domestically and overseas.  Supply chain service providers and distributors have been aided by these trends along with an increase in outsourcing activities, as OEMs and their suppliers focus on reducing their capital commitments and operating costs.  Commercial Aerospace Market  Over the past three years, major airlines have ordered new aircraft at a robust pace, aided by strong profits and increasing passenger volumes. At the same time, volatile fuel prices have led to greater demand for fuel-efficient models and new engine options for existing aircraft designs. The rise of emerging markets has added to the growth in overall demand at a  Table of Contents  stronger pace than seen historically. More recently, several airlines have slowed the pace of orders with large commercial OEMs in response to rapidly changing macroeconomic conditions. In spite of this development, large commercial OEMs have indicated that they continue to expect a high level of deliveries, primarily due to their unprecedented level of backlogs. Business aviation has lagged the larger commercial market, reflecting a deeper downturn in the last recession and an uncertain economic outlook. Overall business aviation production levels remain well below their pre-recession peak, though newer models have seen a greater acceptance in the marketplace than older and previously owned aircraft.  Military Aerospace Market  Military build-rates have declined for the past few years (and they may continue to decline going forward), which has negatively affected this portion of our business. We believe the diversity of the military aircraft programs we support can help mitigate the impact of new program delays, changes or cancellations. In particular, we believe the services we provide the Joint Strike Fighter program will benefit our future business as production for that program increases. Increased sales for other established aircraft programs that directly benefit from such changes also help moderate build-rate declines.  Other Factors Affecting Our Financial Results  Fluctuations in Revenue  There are many factors, such as changes in customer aircraft build rates, customer plant shut downs, variation in customer working days, changes in selling prices, the amount of new customers' consigned inventory and increases or decreases in customer inventory levels, that can cause fluctuations in our financial results from quarter to quarter. To normalize for short-term fluctuations, we tend to look at our performance over several quarters or years of activity rather than discrete short-term periods. As such, it can be difficult to determine longer-term trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons. Ad hoc business tends to vary based on the amount of disruption in the market due to changes in aircraft build rates, new aircraft introduction, customer or site consolidations, and other factors. Fluctuations in our ad hoc business tend to be partially offset by our Contract business as most of our ad hoc revenue comes from our Contract customers.  We will continue our strategy of seeking to expand our relationships with existing ad hoc customers by transitioning them to Contracts, as well as expanding relationships with our existing Contract customers to include additional customer sites, additional SKUs and additional levels of service. New Contract customers and expansion of existing Contract customers to additional sites and SKUs sometimes leads to a corresponding decrease in ad hoc sales as a portion of the SKUs sold under Contracts were previously sold to the same customer as ad hoc sales. We believe this strategy serves to mitigate some of the fluctuations in our net sales. Our sales to Contract customers may fail to meet our expectations for a variety of reasons, in particular if industry build rates are lower than expected or, for certain newer JIT customers, if their consigned inventory, which must be exhausted before corresponding products are purchased directly from us, is greater than we expected.  If any of our customers are acquired or controlled by a company that elects not to utilize our services, or attempt to implement in-sourcing initiatives, it could have a negative effect on our strategy to mitigate fluctuations in our net sales. Additionally, although we derive a significant portion of our net sales from the building of new commercial and military aircraft, we have not typically experienced extreme fluctuations in our net sales when sales for an individual aircraft program decrease, which we believe is attributable to our diverse base of customers and programs.  Fluctuations in Margins  Our gross margins are impacted by changes in product mix. Generally, our hardware products have higher gross profit margins than chemicals and electronic components.  We also believe that our strategy of growing our Contract sales and converting ad hoc customers into Contract customers could negatively affect our gross profit margins, as gross profit margins tend to be higher on ad hoc sales than they are on Contract-related sales. However, we believe any potential adverse impact on our gross profit margins is outweighed by the benefits of a more stable long-term revenue stream attributable to Contract customers.  Our Contracts generally provide for fixed prices, which can expose us to risks if prices we pay to our suppliers rise due to increased raw material or other costs. However, we believe our expansive product offerings and inventories, our ad hoc sales and, where possible, our longer-term agreements with suppliers have enabled us to mitigate this risk. Some of our Contracts are denominated in foreign currencies and fixed prices in these Contracts can expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates with the U.S. dollar.  Table of Contents  Fluctuations in Cash Flow  Our cash flows are affected by fluctuations in our inventory. When we are awarded new programs, we generally increase our inventory to prepare for expected sales related to the new programs, which often take time to materialize, and to achieve minimum stock requirements, if any. As a result, if certain programs for which we have procured inventory are delayed or if certain newer JIT customers' consigned inventory is larger than we expected, we may experience a more sustained inventory increase.  Inventory fluctuations may also be attributable to general industry trends. Factors that may contribute to fluctuations in inventory levels in the future could include (1) strategic purchases (a) to take advantage of favorable pricing, (b) made in anticipation of the expected industry growth cycle, (c) to support new customer Contracts or (d) to acquire high-volume products that are typically difficult to obtain in sufficient quantities; (2) changes in supplier lead times and the timing of inventory deliveries; (3) purchases made in anticipation of future growth (particularly growth in our MRO business); and  Our accounts receivable balance as a percentage of net sales may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. These fluctuations are primarily driven by changes, from quarter to quarter, in the timing of sales within the quarter and variation in the time required to collect the payments. The completion of customer Contracts with accelerated payment terms can also contribute to these quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. Similarly, our accounts payable may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which is primarily driven by the timing of purchases or payments made to our suppliers.  Segment Presentation  We conduct our business through two reportable segments: North America and Rest of World. We evaluate segment performance based on segment income or loss from operations. Each segment reports its results of operations and makes requests for capital expenditures and acquisition funding to our chief operating decision maker (CODM). Our Chief Executive Officer serves as our CODM.  Key Components of Our Results of Operations  The following is a discussion of the key line items included in our financial statements for the periods presented below under the heading "Results of Operations." These are the measures that management utilizes to assess our results of operations, anticipate future trends and evaluate risks in our business.  Net Sales  Our net sales include sales of hardware, chemicals, electronic components, bearings, tools and machined parts, and eliminate all intercompany sales. We also provide certain services to our customers, including quality assurance, kitting, JIT delivery and point-of-use inventory management. However, these services are provided by us contemporaneously with the delivery of the product, and as such, once the product is delivered, we do not have a post-delivery obligation to provide services to the customer. Accordingly, the price of such services is generally included in the price of the products delivered to the customer, and revenue is recognized upon delivery of the product, at which point, we have satisfied our obligations to the customer. We do not account for these services as a separate element, as the services generally do not have stand-alone value and cannot be separated from the product element of the arrangement.  We serve our customers under both Contracts, which include JIT contracts and LTAs, and ad hoc sales. Under JIT contracts, customers typically commit to purchase specified products from us at a fixed price, on an if-and-when needed basis, and we are responsible for maintaining high levels of stock availability of those products. LTAs are typically negotiated price lists for customers or individual customer sites that cover a range of pre-determined products, purchased on an as-needed basis. Ad hoc customers purchase products from us on an as-needed basis and are generally supplied out of our existing inventory. In addition, Contract customers often purchase products that are not captured under their Contract on an ad hoc basis.  Income from Operations  Income from operations is the result of subtracting the cost of sales and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses from net sales, and is used primarily to evaluate our performance and profitability.  Table of Contents  The principal component of our cost of sales is product cost, which was 94.4% and 92.8% of our total cost of sales for the six months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The remaining components are freight and expediting fees, import duties, tooling repair charges, supplies and contract labor costs.  Product cost is determined by the current weighted average cost of each inventory item, except for chemical parts for which the first-in, first-out method is used, and includes charges, if any, to write down excess and obsolete ("E&O") inventory to its net realizable value. The charge to write down E&O inventory is calculated by comparing our forecasted demand for each part to the quantity we currently have on hand. We review inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence quarterly. For a description of our E&O inventory policy, see Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Inventory" in the 2016 Form 10-K. During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded a charge of $3.1 million and $4.4 million, respectively, and during the six months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded a charge of $5.3 million and $6.4 million, respectively, to cost of sales to write down E&O inventory to its net realizable value.  The principal components of our SG&A expenses are salaries, wages, benefits and bonuses paid to our employees; stock-based compensation; commissions paid to outside sales representatives; travel and other business expenses; training and recruitment costs; marketing, advertising and promotional event costs; rent; bad debt expense; professional services fees (including legal, audit and tax); and ordinary day-to-day business expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense is also included in SG&A expenses, and consists primarily of scheduled depreciation for leasehold improvements, machinery and equipment, vehicles, computers, software and furniture and fixtures. Depreciation and amortization also includes intangible asset amortization expense.  Other Expenses  Interest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net consists of the interest we pay on our long-term debt, fees on our revolving facility (as defined below under "-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Credit Facilities-Senior Secured Credit Facilities") and our line-of-credit and deferred financing costs, net of interest income.  Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net is primarily comprised of foreign currency exchange gain net of foreign currency exchange loss associated with transactions denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currency of the reporting subsidiary, partially offset by the gain or loss on foreign currency forward contracts.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on-going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from what we anticipate, and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results. For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, see Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" in the 2016 Form 10-K.

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
