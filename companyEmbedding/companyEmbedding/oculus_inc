In 1994 when we formed Oculus Inc., we made the decision to be a different kind of architecture firm. We chose not to name the company after its principals. Instead, we sought to create an identity that would reflect our belief that the contributions of all participants are important.
This year we are celebrating our 22nd year supporting clients, creating beautiful places, and managing change.

	Description

	The Easygraph offers the ideal solution to practices struggling with limited space.  Mounting directly on the slit lamp, this space-saving corneal topographer incorporates assessment of the cornea directly into the examination process. The Easygraph uses the same precise measuring technology as the Keratograph® and is both a topographer and a keratometer combined into one unit. Numerous analysis and display formats support you in the quantitative classification of the cornea. The optionally available Contact Lens Fitting and OxiMap® Software modules can also be integrated to add confidence and trust to all contact lens consultations.
