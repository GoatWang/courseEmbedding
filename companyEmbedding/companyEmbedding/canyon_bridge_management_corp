(Repeats to additional customers with no changes to text)
By Liana B. Baker
June 15 (Reuters) - China-backed Canyon Bridge Capital
Partners LLC disclosed on Monday it had refiled its proposed
$1.3 billion acquisition of Lattice Semiconductor Corp
with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States
(CFIUS) for the second time.
This followed Canyon Bridge partner Ray Bingham's
resignation from two corporate boards, Cypress Semiconductor
Corp and Oracle Corp, over claims of potential
conflict of interest.
Here's a look at the latest twist and turns in Canyon
Bridge's attempted acquisition of Lattice:
- February 2016: Lattice approaches Cypress Semiconductor Corp
to gauge its interest in making an acquisition offer.
Cypress declined.
- April 8, 2016: Financial advisers for China Reform Fund
Management Co contact Lattice's advisers to express interest in
discussing "a strategic transaction involving Lattice."
- May 5, 2016: Lattice CEO Darin Billerbeck and the company's
financial adviser Morgan Stanley meet with Benjamin Chow,
a representative of China Reform to discuss a potential deal.
- August 2016: Ray Bingham meets Chow and discusses serving in
an advisory role for a private equity fund.
- August 2016: Lattice and China Reform discuss China Reform's
most recent deal proposal. During those talks, Chow states that,
after discussions with China Reform, he was considering leaving
China Reform to form a new private equity fund, which one of
China Reform’s affiliates, CVC, had agreed to invest in. This
fund eventually became Canyon Bridge.
- September 2016: Chow informs Bingham that Canyon Bridge had
received an initial $1.5 billion funding commitment, and that it
was in active negotiations with a potential target in the United
States.
- September 2016: Cypress turns down another opportunity to make
an acquisition offer for Lattice.
- October 2016: Cypress Semiconductor Corp executive
chairman Ray Bingham reaches an understanding with Ben Chow
about how they would work together.
- November 2, 2016: Lattice's board holds a meeting with its
advisers where they discuss the proposed merger agreement at
length, including the experience and reputations of Canyon
Bridge’s co-founders, Bingham and Chow. Morgan Stanley informs
Lattice that the $8.30 per share offer from Canyon Bridge is a
fair price to the company’s shareholders.
- November 3, 2016: Canyon Bridge's $1.3 billion acquisition of
Lattice is announced. Bingham is quoted in the press release as
a co-founder of Canyon Bridge praising the transaction. Cypress
first learns of Bingham's status as a partner of Canyon Bridge
from the press release.
- November 4, 2016: Cypress' board holds a meeting where Bingham
tells the board he is considering joining Canyon Bridge as a
minority partner part-time. Cypress' board finds no apparent
conflict of interest for Bingham, but agrees to continue
monitoring the situation.
- December 23, 2016: Bingham joins Canyon Bridge as a partner.
His employment is backdated to October 18.
- January 27, 2017: T.J. Rodgers, founder and former CEO of
Cypress, files a lawsuit against Bingham, alleging he had an
"irreconcilable conflict of interest" in joining Canyon Bridge,
which he says competes "head-to-head" with it.
- March 2017: Bingham resigns from Oracle's board after being
told to choose between the technology giant and Canyon Bridge.
Oracle expressed concern Bingham's relationship with Canyon
Bridge could compromise Oracle's business with the United States
government, according to court documents.
- March 24, 2017: Lattice and Canyon Bridge refile their CFIUS
application, seeking more time to secure U.S. approval of the
deal with CFIUS beyond the standard period of 75 days.
- June 9, 2017: After the 75 days lapsed from its previous CFIUS
application, Lattice and Canyon Bridge agree to refile their
CFIUS application for the second time. They extend their merger
agreement from August 1 to September 30, to allow more time for
the deal to be approved.
- June 11, 2017: Bingham resigns from Cypress' board.
Sources unless otherwise specified: Lattice's proxy statement to
shareholders, Cypress proxy statement and supplements, court
documents from Delaware's Court of Chancery.

CypressFirst Sends Letter To Cypress Semiconductor Stockholders









Cypress Should Not Tolerate an Overcompensated and Conflicted Executive Chairman

Urges Stockholders to Protect and Enhance Stock Value by Voting the GOLD Proxy Card at the Annual Meeting FOR the Election of Dan McCranie and Camillo Martino

 

SAN JOSE, Calif., May 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Camillo Martino and J. Daniel McCranie, nominees for election to the Cypress Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:    CY) ("Cypress" or "the Company") Board of Directors at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholder scheduled to be held on June 8, 2017, and T.J. Rodgers, founder and former CEO of Cypress and the Company's largest individual stockholder, (collectively "CypressFirst") today issued the following open letter to Cypress stockholders regarding the upcoming election of directors. The full text of the letter is reprinted below.
The CypressFirst letter, urging Cypress Semiconductor stockholders to vote the GOLD proxy card FOR the election of Dan McCranie and Camillo Martino, can be found at www.CypressFirst.com or on the website of the Securities and Exchange Commission (www.sec.gov).

This Election Contest is about Ethics, Good Governance and "Doing What's Right for Cypress"—and Its Stockholders
Dear Fellow Cypress Stockholder:
Only a few weeks remain before the Cypress Annual Meeting of Stockholders on June 8, at which you will have the choice to replace Ray Bingham, the executive chairman, and Eric Benhamou, the lead director, with two better-qualified directors, both of whom are semiconductor veterans, having held between them three CEO positions and 12 directorships. The purpose of this letter is to step back from the fray of the election and examine a few, simple facts that show why the Cypress Board needs change.
Cypress and its stockholders deserve better than Bingham and Benhamou. Cypress should not be forced to compete with its own executive chairman, who has received a compensation package from Cypress worth $5.38 million in cash and stock, and also stands to make millions more by working for Canyon Bridge, a private equity firm funded by the Chinese government, which focuses on acquiring semiconductor companies—in direct competition with Cypress.
Cypress also deserves a lead director who holds the Board accountable to the Company's clear ethical standards, and Benhamou has failed his duties in this regard.
Cypress stockholders have the power to rectify these problems of excess compensation and conflict of interest by voting the GOLD Proxy FOR Dan McCranie and Camillo Martino to replace Ray Bingham and Eric Benhamou.
We fully support CEO Hassane El-Khoury and his management team—they are not the problem. But we do believe that Cypress and its stockholders urgently need two new directors who have strong ethical principles and extensive governance experience—directors who will follow, rather than evade, Cypress's ethical standards as stated in the Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.  As new directors, Dan McCranie and Camillo Martino would work diligently and creatively—without millions of dollars in excessive compensation—to assist management not only in bringing better governance to Cypress, but also in solving its chronic problem of low gross margin.
Ray Bingham, whom we are seeking to replace, took control of Cypress on April 28, 2016, and thus has been the top executive of the company for over a year without making any progress on improving gross margin. Indeed, in the most recent quarter, gross margin declined by nearly 1% to 39.3%.  Better results are promised by the end of 2017 and in 2018—but without substantial gross margin improvement, Cypress will not be able to pay down its debt, increase its dividend, or improve its bottom line and thus share price.  Which directors do you believe can better help CEO El-Khoury and the management team in addressing low gross margin: Dan McCranie and Camillo Martino, both of whom have semiconductor operational experience—or Ray Bingham and Eric Benhamou, neither of whom has any prior semiconductor operational experience?
Cypress Should Not Tolerate an Executive Chairman Who Serves Two Masters
The Cypress Board's latest, strident attack letter is an attempt to divert your attention from the critical Bingham conflict of interest and overcompensation issues with irrelevant attacks on our motives. We focus here on the issues themselves. There are two simple and undeniable facts related to Bingham's conflict of interest problem:

Cypress and Canyon Bridge compete for potential M&A candidates every day. 
Bingham cannot simultaneously serve two masters who have the same objectives. This conflict of interest problem will fester until he decides—or the stockholders decide for him—which of his competing jobs he will leave.

Despite the Board's diversionary claims, the ongoing conflict of interest problem has never been about the Lattice Semiconductor acquisition by Canyon Bridge; rather, it has always been about the direct, head-to-head competition between Canyon Bridge and Cypress to find and acquire semiconductor companies. This is an untenable situation with Ray Bingham on both sides of the fence. How can Cypress stockholders be properly served by an executive chairman who, upon learning of a new M&A opportunity, must decide which of his two masters to serve?
Ray Bingham, Eric Benhamou and the Cypress Board have resisted all of our efforts to learn about and disclose to stockholders the true story of Bingham's involvement with Canyon Bridge. They continue to misrepresent and omit facts in their communications to stockholders, despite rulings by the Delaware Chancery Court that forced them to turn over relevant documents. They are still fighting us—document by document—to prevent you from receiving that relevant information. What have they got to hide? If Cypress has "effective conflict of interest policies at every level," as the Board claims, why do they continue to fight at your expense in the Delaware Court?
The fact that Ray Bingham's two employers compete with each other, and have glaring conflicts on opportunities, is as plain as day for all to see—except for Bingham, Benhamou and the Board.
Another diversionary tactic used by the Cypress Board is to insist that Canyon Bridge is not a Cypress competitor by claiming that there was no conflict of interest because Cypress did not attempt to buy Lattice after the Company's latest discussions in 2016. The fact that both Cypress and Canyon Bridge were at times interested in acquiring the same company simply illustrates that a structural conflict of interest exists.  What acquisition opportunities does Ray Bingham know about—right now—that he has not passed on to Cypress?  If there are any, he would be in violation of one of his fiduciary duties as a Cypress director.
Consider the following facts:

Canyon Bridge states in an SEC filing1 that it "focuses on acquiring interests in companies in the technology sector (specifically, companies in the semi-conductor industry)." 
Cypress has acquired 32 semiconductor companies—about one per year over its history.  Furthermore, well over 50% of Cypress's revenue today comes from acquired businesses. 
Cypress's recent successes, proudly touted as part of "Cypress 3.0," are heavily dependent on prior acquisitions. Where would Cypress be today if its M&A efforts had not been successful in these three critical market segments: Automotive (Fujitsu and Spansion acquisitions); Communications (Broadcom's IoT Group acquisition); and USB Type-C (three USB acquisitions)?

Lead Director Benhamou Must Share the Blame
As lead director, Mr. Benhamou has a duty not to turn a blind eye on this conflict of interest problem, but rather to enforce within the Board the Cypress Code of Ethics, which establishes these principles:
1. Source: SEC Form ADV Part 2 Brochure: "Canyon Bridge Management Corp.," 1/26/17

"Conflict of interest:  A conflict of interest exists where the interests of one person or entity conflict with the interests or benefits of the Company (Cypress)." 
"Our policies prohibit any employee from accepting simultaneous employment of any kind without written permission of the Company, and prohibit any employee from accepting simultaneous employment with a Company supplier, customer, developer or competitor." 
"It is a conflict of interest to serve as a director of any company that competes with the Company." 
"Although you may serve as a director of another company, our policy requires that you first obtain approval from the Company's Chief Financial Officer before accepting a directorship." 
"Additionally, you must disclose to the Company any interest that you have that may conflict with the business of the Company." 
"Employees, agents, or contractors should always try to avoid even the appearance of impropriety."

Why do Eric Benhamou, Ray Bingham and the Board desperately want you to agree that Canyon Bridge and Cypress don't compete? We believe it is because Bingham obviously is violating the Company's crystal-clear Code of Ethics and therefore the Board needs a reason to continue ignoring Bingham's conflicts.
Why has this all happened—and why is the Cypress Board resisting our reasonable settlement proposals and fighting to prevent disclosures to its own stockholders? If you look past the diversionary attacks, we think that the answers are simple and obvious:

Ray Bingham wants to wear "two hats." He wants to be paid millions as the part-time executive chairman of Cypress, and millions more as an owner and co-founder of Canyon Bridge. 
According to the Canyon Bridge SEC filing2, the Canyon Bridge Management Corp., which is owned by just three individuals—Ray Bingham, Benjamin Chow and Hong John Kao—will receive a 2% "management fee" every year on total invested funds, currently $1.515 billion. 
That adds up to $30 million per year.  The Chinese investors have already paid $6 million in management fees for just the last ten-and-one-half weeks of 2016, and a further $30 million in advance for 2017 management fees. 
In addition, Ray Bingham, Benjamin Bin Chow and Hong John Kao are also the owners of another corporation, the Canyon Bridge Private Equity Fund, which will receive a "carried interest" of 20% of the fund's profits.3 We believe this data helps answer the prior question of which master Bingham will serve.  We are worried it will be the one who pays millions in management fees, plus a cut of the profits, not Cypress.

Given these newly uncovered facts, do you really want Mr. Bingham as your executive chairman—or even as a member of the Cypress Board?
Eric Benhamou also does not deserve your support:

He was the Chairman of the Compensation Committee that recommended and locked in Bingham's egregious executive compensation package, forcing a single yes-or-no vote on creating the executive chairman position.

2. Source: SEC Form ADV Part 2 Brochure: "Canyon Bridge Management Corp.," 1/26/17
3. From dispositions of investments made by the Private Equity Fund after the return of invested capital and preferred returns to the limited partners. 

Stockholders can rightly ask to see Benhamou's claimed study by compensation experts that justified an $877,500 annual salary plus target bonus for a job to which Bingham showed up just two days per week. And how is it remotely rational that Bingham should be paid $4.5 million in RSUs with three-year time vesting for his "transitionary" role to mentor Hassane El-Khoury? 
Benhamou allowed Bingham to become the only Cypress executive whose equity compensation is not performance-based. 
Finally, Benhamou, in his capacity as lead director, is responsible for making sure that you as stockholders were given all the facts in the Proxy Materials dealing with the election of directors. You were not. That's why Cypress was forced to file a "Supplement to the Proxy Statement" on May 17, 2017. (See our other letter dated May 19, 2017, which discusses the inadequacies of the latest Cypress Supplement)

In a May 15, 2017, letter, the Board now publicly admits that Bingham's executive chairman role should end, spinning it as, "The Company will transition away from the executive chairman structure by the end of the current year."

We believe Cypress should "transition" on June 8, and remind stockholders that their vote will make that change happen. 
Why won't Cypress give stockholders a break and end Bingham's make-work job on June 8? 
Or—will the Board quietly arrange for Bingham to get all of his unvested and unearned RSUs?

Eric Benhamou should be leading the effort to return to stockholders Ray Bingham's unnecessary $4.5 million equity package and his $877,500 salary plus target bonus.
Eric Benhamou should also be held accountable as lead director for the Board's cover-up of Bingham's ethical violations.
It's time for the Cypress Board to "Do What's Right for Cypress" and allow full disclosure of all the facts to stockholders.
We continue to offer a solution that will end the proxy contest, lawsuits and festering governance problems: We will accept enlarging the Cypress Board to nine directors, if Dan McCranie and Camillo Martino are added to the Cypress Board under acceptable terms and with acceptable committee assignments, and if Mr. Bingham returns to receiving normal Cypress directors' pay on June 8. If our offer is accepted, we will not seek to replace Bingham and Benhamou at the Annual Meeting.
Finally, if our offer is rejected again by the Board, remember that you, the stockholders, have the power to end this conflict, restore good governance and send a clear message to the Cypress Board that you will not tolerate self-enrichment at the stockholders' expense. Please vote to elect our two new, superlatively qualified directors to replace Ray Bingham and Eric Benhamou.
We appreciate your support and strongly recommend your prompt vote on the GOLD Proxy FOR Dan McCranie and Camillo Martino to be elected to the Cypress Board.
Sincerely,
/s/ J. Daniel McCranie                    /s/ Camillo Martino                         /s/ T.J. RodgersJ. Daniel McCranie                           Camillo Martino                                T.J. Rodgers

Baker, Greg Roumeliotis and Koh Gui Qing7 Min Read(Reuters) - Canyon Bridge Capital Partners LLC, the China-backed buyout fund that agreed to acquire Lattice Semiconductor Corp (LSCC.O) in November for $1.3 billion, has resubmitted the deal for U.S. government review, three people familiar with the matter said. The move comes after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a government panel which reviews acquisitions by foreign entities for potential national security risks, did not complete its assessment by Friday, within the maximum time of 75 days that is awarded for assessing applications. Refiling the deal with CFIUS resets the clock and gives it additional time of up to another 75 days for it to complete its national security review and discuss potential issues with the companies, the sources said. Another factor in Canyon Bridge and Lattice resubmitting the application was that the vacancies left in senior positions at several government agencies more than two months after the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump have reduced the panel's capacity to review cases expeditiously, two of the sources added. The development does not necessarily spell trouble for the deal. Some transactions which previously refiled their application with CFIUS, including ChemChina's $43 billion acquisition of Swiss seeds and pesticide maker Syngenta AG (SYNN.S), were subsequently approved.  Canyon Bridge and Lattice had previously said they had expected the deal to close in early 2017. "Since announcing our partnership with Canyon Bridge in November 2016, we have had continued, ongoing and productive discussions with CFIUS. We look forward to working closely with the committee throughout its review," Lattice said in a statement. Lattice declined to comment on the refiling of the deal with CFIUS. Canyon Bridge also offered no comment.  CFIUS did not respond to requests for comments. From Outright Acquirer to Sole Investor Canyon Bridge co-founder Benjamin Chow's intention was to create a deal structure that would minimize U.S. government scrutiny, three sources told Reuters. A China-born American, Chow was working for a Chinese state-backed entity called China Reform Fund Management when he decided, in the middle of deal talks with Lattice last August, to set up Canyon Bridge in Palo Alto, California, according to Lattice's proxy statement to its shareholders. For a timeline on the deal, click This changed the role of China Reform, which is controlled by the top decision-making body of the Chinese government, from outright Lattice acquirer to sole investor in Canyon Bridge. China Reform did not respond to requests for comment. Reuters revealed last November that China Reform Fund Management was the sole investor in Canyon Bridge. After that story, several U.S. lawmakers wrote to U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew asking for U.S. regulators to block the deal.  Lattice has argued that its chips do not have military applications, and are not therefore a security risk. The company's shares, however, are trading at around $7 per share, well below the deal price of $8.30 per share, indicating investor concern that CFIUS could find that some of its chips have potential to be used in military equipment in the future. Most foreign buyers of U.S. companies with activities that potentially affect national security file their deals with CFIUS. When they register, they indicate whether they think the deal requires a full review, known in CFIUS terminology as a covered transaction.     While Chow was not seeking to conceal the involvement of China Reform in the deal, he believed a buyout fund based in the United States bidding for Lattice would trigger the minimum amount of scrutiny by CFIUS compared with a Chinese buyer, according to three people close to the deal, who requested anonymity to discuss the deliberations. Chow's plan called for registering the deal with CFIUS as a non-covered transaction, indicating its position to CFIUS that no review was merited, according to the sources. Chow told Reuters in a statement that he created Canyon Bridge "to attract a broad base of general partners and limited partners," though he did not identify any new investors beyond China Reform. He did not comment on whether Canyon Bridge was also aimed at minimizing CFIUS scrutiny, but added that he always expected to file for a CFIUS review. Covered Transaction  CFIUS decisions are not made public, making it difficult for acquirers to know in advance how CFIUS would likely view a case without the advice of regulatory lawyers who deal regularly with the secretive panel.  Canyon Bridge's U.S. law firm, Jones Day, supported Chow's plan, taking the view that a U.S. limited partnership backed by Chinese investment with no governance rights over the U.S. partnership would not be viewed as a foreign-controlled entity by CFIUS, and therefore the deal would not trigger a review, according to the sources. A Jones Day spokesman did not respond to several requests for comment by telephone and email. Lattice and its lawyers disagreed because of Canyon Bridge's reliance on a single Chinese-controlled investor, according to the sources. They convinced Canyon Bridge to call in law firm Covington & Burling LLP for a second opinion, which also backed Lattice's view, the sources said. Covington & Burling did not respond to a request for comment. Lattice eventually convinced Chow that they should both plan to file the deal with CFIUS as a covered transaction, indicating to CFIUS it should get a review. "As we made clear at the time of our announcement and in our proxy statement, we have always been committed to the CFIUS process. We first reached out to CFIUS months before selecting a strategic partner and reached out to it again after entering negotiations with Canyon Bridge, but before signing an agreement," Lattice said in a statement.     By that stage however, Canyon Bridge was already formed. While it only had one investor, Chow wanted to keep it to potentially attract more investors in the future, the sources said. The deal was announced on Nov. 3, with Canyon Bridge, rather than China Reform, as the acquirer. Reporting by Liana B.
