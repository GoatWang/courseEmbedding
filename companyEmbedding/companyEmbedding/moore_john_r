Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

About John Moore


      John Moore first fought terrorism in 1967.  He is still
      fighting it today.
      Walking patrol in Vietnam, at night, alone, he searched for
      terrorist booby traps.  He searched for terrorist bombs in
      his jeep and saw what happened to those who did not find them.
      J.R. flew 57 combat missions (as a crew member) over Vietnam and
      Cambodia, many of those being hit by enemy gunfire.
      John went on to join the Green Berets at Fort Bragg where he
      trained to invade the Middle East.  He also did classified
      studies of Middle-East terrorists for the Special Forces.
      Special operations, covert operations, psychological operations,
      undercover operations, surveillance operations, bodyguard for
      executives and stars like Ambassador Alan
        Keyes, Jane Fonda (John initially turned turned down
        the assignment.  After learning he could prevent collateral
        damage to innocent parties, he accepted the assignment.)
      Charleton
        Heston and Pat Buchanan,
      private investigator and homicide detective: these are the jobs
      that have kept J.R. busy..
      John has seen the consequences of terrorism first hand.  He
      has heard the cries of the wounded and smelled the smoke of the
      bombs.
      In research delving into the issue of Planet "X", aka Nibiru, he
      has interviewed dozens of US Navy submarine and surface fleet
      veterans on the subject of rapid global sea level rise, gleaning
      information from the questions he asks, questions the main stream media is afraid to ask. 


















      His investigative prowess has allowed him to produce two major videos on the subject of
      Planet "X"; videos that are backed up by diligent research,
      documented history and scientific fact.
 John Moore also broke the story in the
        alternative media on the actual stoppage of
          the Gulf Stream in June of 2010.  Through his
        carefully cultivated ties with noted domestic and international
        scientists and with learned academics, he was able to bring to
        the public's attention the potentially devastating effects of
        current's termination off of the coast of Cape Hatteras. 
        Unfortunately, the Winters of 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 have borne
        out his fore-stated hypothesis of bitterly cold winters
        afflicting the UK and much of Western Europe.

      Currently, John uses his experience to help others be safe from
      terrorism.  The author of a book on personal security, the
      producer of a seminar on video about being safe from terrorism,
      John is appearing on talk shows around the country.
      With his book and videos, you can now have John Moore as your
      personal bodyguard instructor.  Learn and listen well, IT
      COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE.

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;








        





      Ladies and Gentlemen,

      The following presentation has too many consistencies with what I
      know and have been stating publicly for years to ignore. 

      My many decades of interviewing witnesses makes me wary of third
      party information. However, what this gentleman states is so close
      to describing the Mississippi River Valley becoming an inland sea,
      thus "splitting the country", I can't just ignore it. The concerns
      he heard expressed about "the weight of the water" conforms
      precisely to what the U.S. Navy tells their men in their own
      classified briefings about the weight of the water on the New
      Madrid Seismic Zone triggering three 9 point+ earthquakes.

      His statements about the weight of the water on the coasts could
      only refer to the consequences of increased sea levels. There is
      no second option.

      Watching and listening to this man reminds me of several
      apocalyptic films wherein the scientists are ignored until it's
      too late for the officials in charge of disaster preparedness to
      properly mitigate and protect the people.


      Regards,

      John Moore
      April 19, 2016
      &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;
