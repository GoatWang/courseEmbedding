Ronald D. Croatti, the chief executive of UniFirst, who spent his entire professional life supplying uniforms and apparel to some of the biggest manufacturing companies, died on Tuesday in Boston. He was 74.The cause was complications of pneumonia, a company representative said.At UniFirst, Mr. Croatti led what began in 1936 as a family-owned business run by his father, Aldo, from a converted horse barn in Boston, where one washing machine cleaned uniforms for factory workers. He turned it into the second-largest supplier and cleaner of uniforms and garments in the United States, with about $1.5 billion in annual revenue.When he took over as chief executive in 1991, succeeding his father, UniFirst, based in Wilmington, Mass., had about $100 million in revenue.Today, UniFirst supplies uniforms to nearly two million people working for 300,000 businesses in the United States, Canada and Europe, many in the food service, health care and energy industries. Archer Daniels Midland, Berkshire Hathaway, Coca-Cola, Costco and Goodyear are among its customers. Continue reading the main story

It also specializes in decontaminating garments worn by workers at nuclear facilities.Mr. Croatti gave the company a promotional boost in 2011 when he put on a green UniFirst uniform, a mustache and a shoulder-length gray wig for an episode of the CBS reality series “Undercover Boss.” Pretending to be a new employee named Mike Daniels, he visited several of UniFirst’s 240 facilities, where workers taught him how to load dirty uniforms into giant washing machines and package clothes for delivery.

Undercover Boss - Preview: 'UniFirst' Video by CBS

The original broadcast was viewed by more than 13 million people, and the company has credited Mr. Croatti’s appearance with attracting new business.“Ron took a huge risk by doing this, as we had no editing rights,” said Adam Soreff, UniFirst’s director of marketing. “It ended up being great advertising and huge exposure.”In the episode, Mr. Croatti revealed some of his personal life, including his grandfather’s death in an accident involving an industrial clothes washer. The program also showed him relaxing at his home in Londonderry, N.H., playing with his model train collection.UniFirst, which went public in 1983 under the name Interstate Uniform Service Company, has remained in the hands of the Croatti family, which controls a majority of the voting shares. Mr. Croatti’s sister, Cynthia, is a board member and executive vice president. Two of his sons, Michael and Matthew, work for the company, which changed its name to UniFirst in 1984.

Last year, for the first time, Mr. Croatti joined the list of the 200 best-paid chief executives in the United States, according to an annual ranking done by Equilar for The New York Times. He made the list because of a large stock award that pushed the value of his 2016 pay package to $17.69 million.

Ronald Daniel Croatti was born on April 20, 1943, in Boston. His mother was the former Alba Olney. His paternal grandparents had emigrated from Rimini, Italy, in 1909.Mr. Croatti was 14 when he began working, on and off, at UniFirst. At that time, the company was called National Overall Dry Cleaning Company. He was hired officially in 1965, not long after he graduated from San Diego State University.Besides his sons Michael and Matthew and his sister, he is survived by his wife, Carol; another son, Aldo; a daughter, Melissa; and nine grandchildren.In the “Undercover Boss” episode, Mr. Croatti mentioned that he was grooming his son Michael, a senior vice president, to succeed him. But Cynthia Croatti said no decision had been made as to who would become chief executive.One of the first items of business for his successor may be the company’s growing competition. Its main rival, Cintas, recently acquired another uniform rental company, G&K Services, to create a company with an estimated $6 billion in revenue. (UniFirst has also grown through acquisitions, adding Arrow Uniform, a Michigan-based company, in a $122 million deal last year.)Ms. Croatti said she had been impressed by her brother’s appearance on “Undercover Boss.”“He was extremely comfortable in front of the cameras,” she said. “He could have been an actor.”

Croatti Scholarship programs.Both scholarship programs, founded to further expand UniFirst’s dedication to academic and professional enrichment for its employee Team Partners, are named for the company’s two past leaders, founder Aldo Croatti and his son Ronald Croatti, former chairman, CEO and president who passed away in May 2017. Aldo Croatti founded UniFirst as a startup industrial laundry service, in 1936, cleaning area worker coveralls out of a converted horse barn in Boston and grew the business to about $100 million in annual revenues. In 1991, Ronald Croatti took over as its chief executive and, under his leadership, more than quintupled UniFirst annual revenues to more than $1.5 billion. Today, UniFirst supplies uniforms to nearly 2 million workers at 300,000 customer locations and employs 13,000 Team Partners.The Aldo Croatti Scholarship was established in 2004 to encourage and assist children of UniFirst employee Team Partners in their academic pursuits. Since its inception, UniFirst has granted 167 scholarships totaling more than $334,000. The 2017 Aldo Croatti Scholarship recipients are as follows:       Kourtney Brown Clarion, Pa. Clarion University of Pennsylvania           Kaycee Cross Austin, Texas University of Texas at Austin           Elizabeth Fairchild Winter Park, Fla.

North Carolina State University Each year, 12 Aldo Croatti scholarships are awarded to students enrolled or enrolling in full-time undergraduate studies at an accredited two- or four-year college or vocational/technical school. Applications are open to children of full-time UniFirst or subsidiary employee Team Partners who have a minimum of one year of employment with the company.“I’m extremely grateful to UniFirst for awarding me the Aldo Croatti Scholarship,” said Jacob Marcus, one of the 2017 scholarship recipients. “I’m proud that my academic achievements were recognized and thankful for the scholarship money, which will go a long way toward funding my college education.” The Ronald D. Croatti Scholarship, established in 2015, offers financial assistance to full-time UniFirst employee Team Partners who enroll in full- or part-time undergraduate or graduate study at an accredited two- or four-year college or vocational/technical school for an entire academic year. Team Partners are recommended by their supervisors for continuing education in one of three areas: information technology (IT), sales leadership, or business administration/leadership.To date, UniFirst has awarded 24 scholarships totaling more than $91,000 since its inception.

We’re a family at UniFirst and it’s only fitting that their legacies will benefit many generations of our UniFirst family who place the same value on education and expanding their academic pursuits.”About UniFirstHeadquartered in Wilmington, Mass., UniFirst Corporation (UNF) is a North American leader in the supply and servicing of uniform and workwear programs, as well as the delivery of facility service programs.
