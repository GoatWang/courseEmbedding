                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch to Rate Morgan Stanley Bank of America Merrill Lynch Trust Series 2016-C30; Presale Issued | Business Wire


























































      Fitch to Rate Morgan Stanley Bank of America Merrill Lynch Trust Series 
      2016-C30; Presale Issued
    





September 14, 2016 02:59 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on Morgan Stanley Bank of 
      America Merrill Lynch Trust Series 2016-C30 commercial mortgage 
      pass-through certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$34,300,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$4,400,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$47,200,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$13,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$24,452,000ab class X-E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$38,901,000a class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$24,452,000a class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      The following classes are not expected to be rated:
    

      --$10,004,000a class F 'NR';
    

      --$30,009,448a class G 'NR';
    

      --$10,004,000ab class X-F 'NR';
    

      --$30,009,448ab class X-G 'NR'.
    

      a - Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      b - Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Sept. 14, 2016.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 49 loans secured by 59 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of $889,168,449 as of 
      the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by Morgan 
      Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC, Bank of America, National 
      Association, Starwood Mortgage Funding III LLC and CIBC Inc.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 78.8% of the properties by balance and 
      asset summary reviews, and cash flow analysis of 85.5% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loans: Four loans representing 21.65% of 
      the pool are credit opinion loans. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (8.72%) has an 
      investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBB-sf*' on a stand-alone basis. 
      Easton Town Center (8.43%) has an investment-grade credit opinion of 
      'A+sf*' on a stand-alone basis. The Shops at Crystals (2.25%) has an 
      investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBB+sf*' on a stand-alone basis. 
      International Square (2.25%) has an investment-grade credit opinion of 
      'AA-sf*' on a stand-alone basis.
    

      Above-Average Fitch Leverage: The transaction overall has lower leverage 
      than other recent Fitch-rated transactions. The pool's weighted average 
      (WA) Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.29x is greater than 
      both the YTD 2016 average of 1.18x and the 2015 average of 1.18x. The 
      pool's WA Fitch loan-to-value (LTV) of 97.8% is better than both the YTD 
      2016 average of 106.5% and the 2015 average of 109.3%. Excluding the 
      credit opinion loans, the Fitch DSCR falls to 1.23x and the Fitch LTV 
      increases to 108.5%.
    

      Sponsor Concentration: The sponsor concentration for the pool is 703, 
      significantly higher than the recent averages of 428 and 367 for YTD 
      2016 and 2015, respectively. The largest sponsor within this transaction 
      is Simon Property Group, LP ('A/F1'/Stable Outlook), with four loans 
      representing 19.7% of the pool.
    

      Higher Pool Concentration: The top 10 loans make up 56.5% of the pool, 
      which is higher than the recent averages of 55.3% and 49.3% for YTD 2016 
      and 2015, respectively. Additionally, the loan concentration index (LCI) 
      index is 433, more than the YTD 2016 average of 428 and the 2015 average 
      of 367.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 11.9% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI); for properties for which 
      a full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period.
    

      Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could result in 
      higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans and in potential 
      rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to MSBAM 
      2016-C30 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivities to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBBsf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 10.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with due diligence information from Deloitte & Touche 
      LLP. The due diligence focused on a comparison and re-computation of 
      certain characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. 
      Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did 
      not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence 
      Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be 
      obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating 
      action commentary.

      Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on Morgan Stanley Bank of 
      America Merrill Lynch Trust Series 2016-C30 commercial mortgage

      --$38,901,000a class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$24,452,000a class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      The following classes are not expected to be rated:
    

      --$10,004,000a class F 'NR';
    

      --$30,009,448a class G 'NR';
    

      --$10,004,000ab class X-F 'NR';
    

      --$30,009,448ab class X-G 'NR'.
    

      a - Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      b - Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Sept. 14, 2016.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 49 loans secured by 59 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of $889,168,449 as of 
      the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by Morgan 
      Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC, Bank of America, National 
      Association, Starwood Mortgage Funding III LLC and CIBC Inc.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 78.8% of the properties by balance and 
      asset summary reviews, and cash flow analysis of 85.5% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loans: Four loans representing 21.65% of 
      the pool are credit opinion loans. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (8.72%) has an 
      investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBB-sf*' on a stand-alone basis. 
      Easton Town Center (8.43%) has an investment-grade credit opinion of 
      'A+sf*' on a stand-alone basis. The Shops at Crystals (2.25%) has an 
      investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBB+sf*' on a stand-alone basis. 
      International Square (2.25%) has an investment-grade credit opinion of 
      'AA-sf*' on a stand-alone basis.
    

      Above-Average Fitch Leverage: The transaction overall has lower leverage 
      than other recent Fitch-rated transactions. The pool's weighted average 
      (WA) Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.29x is greater than 
      both the YTD 2016 average of 1.18x and the 2015 average of 1.18x. The 
      pool's WA Fitch loan-to-value (LTV) of 97.8% is better than both the YTD 
      2016 average of 106.5% and the 2015 average of 109.3%. Excluding the 
      credit opinion loans, the Fitch DSCR falls to 1.23x and the Fitch LTV 
      increases to 108.5%.
    

      Sponsor Concentration: The sponsor concentration for the pool is 703, 
      significantly higher than the recent averages of 428 and 367 for YTD 
      2016 and 2015, respectively. The largest sponsor within this transaction 
      is Simon Property Group, LP ('A/F1'/Stable Outlook), with four loans 
      representing 19.7% of the pool.
    

      Higher Pool Concentration: The top 10 loans make up 56.5% of the pool, 
      which is higher than the recent averages of 55.3% and 49.3% for YTD 2016 
      and 2015, respectively. Additionally, the loan concentration index (LCI) 
      index is 433, more than the YTD 2016 average of 428 and the 2015 average 
      of 367.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 11.9% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI); for properties for which 
      a full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period.
    

      Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could result in 
      higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans and in potential 
      rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to MSBAM 
      2016-C30 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivities to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBBsf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 10.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with due diligence information from Deloitte & Touche 
      LLP. The due diligence focused on a comparison and re-computation of 
      certain characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. 
      Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did 
      not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence 
      Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be 
      obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating 
      action commentary.

After Fitch issued its expected ratings on Sept. 14, 2016, the $3.9 
      million West Plaza Shopping Center loan was removed from the pool. The 
      mortgage loan was 0.4% of the initial pool balance and the subsequent 
      Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and loan to value (LTV) of the 
      pool are 1.29x and 97.8%, respectively. The removal did not materially 
      impact Fitch's credit analysis and had no impact on the ratings.


                                        








The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 48 loans secured by 58 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of $885,234,845 as of 
      the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by Morgan 
      Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC, Bank of America, National 
      Association, Starwood Mortgage Funding III LLC and CIBC Inc.


                                        








Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 78.7% of the properties by balance and 
      asset summary reviews, and cash flow analysis of 85.5% of the pool.


                                        








KEY RATING DRIVERS


                                        








Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loans: Four loans representing 21.7% of 
      the pool are credit opinion loans. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (8.8%) has an 
      investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBB-sf*' on a stand-alone basis. 
      Easton Town Center (8.5%) has an investment-grade credit opinion of 
      'A+sf*' on a stand-alone basis. The Shops at Crystals (2.3%) has an 
      investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBB+sf*' on a stand-alone basis. 
      International Square (2.3%) has an investment-grade credit opinion of 
      'AA-sf*' on a stand-alone basis.


                                        








Above-Average Fitch Leverage: The transaction overall has lower leverage 
      than other recent Fitch-rated transactions. The pool's weighted average 
      (WA) Fitch DSCR of 1.29x is greater than both the year-to-date (YTD) 
      2016 average of 1.18x and the 2015 average of 1.18x. The pool's WA Fitch 
      LTV of 97.8% is better than both the YTD 2016 average of 106.5% and the 
      2015 average of 109.3%. Excluding the credit opinion loans, the Fitch 
      DSCR falls to 1.23x and the Fitch LTV increases to 108.6%.


                                        








Sponsor Concentration: The sponsor concentration for the pool is 709, 
      significantly higher than the recent averages of 428 and 367 for YTD 
      2016 and 2015, respectively. The largest sponsor within this transaction 
      is Simon Property Group, LP ('A/F1'/Stable Outlook), with four loans 
      representing 19.8% of the pool.


                                        








Higher Pool Concentration: The top 10 loans make up 56.8% of the pool, 
      which is higher than the recent averages of 55.3% and 49.3% for YTD 2016 
      and 2015, respectively. Additionally, the loan concentration index (LCI) 
      index is 436, more than the YTD 2016 average of 428 and the 2015 average 
      of 367.


                                        








RATING SENSITIVITIES


                                        








For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 11.9% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI); for properties for which 
      a full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period.


                                        








Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could result in 
      higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans and in potential 
      rating actions on the certificates.


                                        








Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to MSBAM 
      2016-C30 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivities to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBBsf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 10.


                                        








DUE DILIGENCE USAGE


                                        








Fitch was provided with due diligence information from Deloitte & Touche 
      LLP. The due diligence focused on a comparison and re-computation of 
      certain characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. 
      Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did 
      not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence 
      Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be 
      obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating 
      action commentary.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch��EUR �s factual investigation and the scope of the 
      third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of 
      the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.


                                        








The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.


                                        








For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia
