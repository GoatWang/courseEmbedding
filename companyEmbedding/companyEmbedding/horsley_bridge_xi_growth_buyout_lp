Top Private Equity Fund of Funds | Horsley Bridge | Early Stage Venture Capital 















Horsley Bridge










About
SUPERIOR RETURNS THROUGH FUNDS OF CAREFULLY SELECTED PRIVATE EQUITY PARTNERSHIPS.

KNOWLEDGE THROUGH EXPERIENCE
Horsley Bridge Partners (“HBP”) has been investing with the world’s leading private equity funds since 1983. Our track record of success reflects a highly focused strategy – the pursuit of top investment opportunities with outsized return potential. We measure ourselves not only by the returns earned, but by the integrity of our process and the longstanding relationships built with our clients, investment partners, and peers.


ACCESS TO INNOVATION
HBP’s venture capital approach is highly selective, focusing on early stage strategies in technology sectors. We work in close partnership with the leading seed and early stage venture investors, maintaining enduring relationships built on trust and honest counsel. Our firm’s mission is to provide our clients unparalleled access to the most coveted new investment opportunities and early, meaningful exposure to the next generation of technology leaders.


TRANSFORMATION AND GROWTH
In the buyout space, HBP partners with ambitious teams executing differentiated strategies – groups who enhance businesses through active ownership and by accelerating growth. We emphasize smaller funds in hard-to-find places, where company-building expertise is most impactful. Recognizing selectivity is paramount to achieving outsized returns, we build concentrated portfolios where every investment can truly move the needle.


GLOBAL REACH
With offices in San Francisco, London, and Beijing, HBP has applied its knowledge and experience in pursuit of opportunities in Europe, Asia, and other emerging markets for over two decades. Our international relationships often have close ties to the leading U.S. firms and practice a similar brand of hands-on investing. Innovation is more pervasive than ever. Our partnership with the leading international investors connects us to the ideas and opportunities shaping our collective future.
