	Proxy Statement dated January 26, 2017






	Shareholders as of the close of business on the record date will be entitled to one vote for each share held.  All properly executed proxies received prior to the meeting will be voted at the meeting.  Each proxy will be voted in accordance with its instructions; if no instruction is given, an executed proxy will authorize the persons named on the respective proxy card enclosed as proxies, or any of them, to vote in favor of the election of each Trustee.  An executed proxy delivered to a Fund is revocable by the person giving it prior to its exercise by a signed writing filed with the Funds Secretary, by executing and delivering a later dated proxy, or by attending the meeting and voting the shares in person.  Merely attending the meeting will not revoke a previously executed proxy.  If you hold Fund shares through an intermediary (such as a broker, bank, adviser or custodian), please consult with the intermediary regarding your ability to revoke voting instructions after they have been provided.


	If you are a record holder of Fund shares and plan to attend the meeting in person, you must show a valid photo identification (such as a drivers license) to gain admission to the meeting.  If you hold Fund shares through an intermediary and plan to attend the meeting in person, you will be required to show a valid photo identification and authority to vote your shares (referred to as a legal proxy) to gain admission to the meeting.  You must contact your intermediary to obtain a legal proxy for your shares.


	The Boards of Trustees of the Funds know of no business other than that mentioned in Item 1 of the Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders that will be presented for consideration.  If any other matters are properly presented, it is the intention of the persons named as proxies to vote on such matters in accordance with their judgment.





	PROPOSAL 1.  ELECTION OF TRUSTEES


	Each Funds Agreement and Declaration of Trust provides that a majority of the Trustees shall fix the number of the entire Board and that such number shall be at least two and no greater than fifteen.  Each Board has fixed the number of Trustees at twelve.  Under the terms of each Funds Agreement and Declaration of Trust, the Board of Trustees is divided into three classes, each class having a term of three years to expire on the date of the third annual meeting following its election.  An effect of staggered terms is to limit the ability of entities or persons to acquire control of a Fund.












	Proxies will be voted for the election of the following nominees:






	 




	a.




	three Class III Trustees, Mark R. Fetting, Helen Frame Peters and Harriett Tee Taggart, to be elected by the holders of each Fund's Common Shares, APS and iMTP, voting together as a single class; and






	 




	b.




	one Class III Trustee, William H. Park, to be elected by the holders of each Fund's APS and iMTP, voting separately as a single class.






	The Board of Trustees recommends that shareholders vote FOR the election of the Trustee nominees of each Fund.


	Each nominee is currently serving as a Trustee of his or her respective Fund and has consented to continue to so serve.  In the event that a nominee is unable to serve for any reason (which is not now expected) when the election occurs, the accompanying proxy will be voted for such other person or persons as the Board of Trustees may recommend.  Election of Trustees is non-cumulative. Shareholders do not have appraisal rights in connection with the proposal in this proxy statement. The Trustees of each Fund shall be elected by the affirmative vote of a plurality of the shares of the Fund entitled to vote.  Proxies cannot be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named.  No nominee is a party adverse to his or her respective Fund or any of its affiliates in any material pending legal proceeding, nor does any nominee have an interest materially adverse to such Fund.


	Under the terms of each Funds By-laws, as amended, the holders of the APS are entitled as a class, to the exclusion of the holders of the Common Shares, to elect two Trustees of each Fund. Mr. Park has been nominated for election by holders of each Fund's Preferred Shares at this meeting.  Each Funds By-laws further provide for the election of the other nominees named above by the holders of the Common Shares and the APS, voting together as a single class.

	Proxy Statement dated January 26, 2017

Information in the table below about a Trustee's position with a Fund, the period as a Trustee and the current term of each Trustee are for each Fund unless otherwise noted.

	Each Trustee holds office until the annual meeting for the year in which his or her term expires and until his or her successor is elected and qualified, subject to a prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal.  Under the terms of each Funds Trustee retirement policy as currently in effect, a Trustee must retire as a Trustee on the first day of July following his or her 74th birthday unless such retirement would cause a Fund to be out of compliance with Section 16 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), in which case the retirement and resignation will occur on the first day thereafter on which a Fund would be in compliance with Section 16.  Section 16 requires in substance that at least two-thirds of the Trustees be elected by shareholders. Consistent with the Trustee retirement policy, Mr. Verni is currently expected to retire as a Trustee of all Eaton Vance funds effective July 1, 2017.


	Interested Trustee

	Board Meetings and Committees


	The Board of Trustees (the Board) has general oversight responsibility with respect to the business and affairs of each Fund. The Board has engaged an investment adviser and (if applicable) a sub-adviser (collectively the adviser) to manage each Fund and an administrator to administer each Fund and is responsible for overseeing such adviser and administrator and other service providers to the Fund. The Board is currently composed of twelve Trustees, including eleven Trustees who are not interested persons of a Fund, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act (each a noninterested Trustee). In addition to six regularly scheduled meetings per year, the Board holds special meetings or informal conference calls to discuss specific matters that may require action prior to the next regular meeting. As discussed below, the Board has established six committees to assist the Board in performing its oversight responsibilities.


	The Board has appointed a noninterested Trustee to serve in the role of Chairperson. The Chairpersons primary role is to participate in the preparation of the agenda for meetings of the Board and the identification of information to be presented to the Board with respect to matters to be acted upon by the Board. The Chairperson also presides at all meetings of the Board and acts as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys, and other Board members generally between meetings. The Chairperson may perform such other functions as may be requested by the Board from time to time. In addition, the Board may appoint a noninterested Trustee to serve in the role of Vice-Chairperson.  The Vice-Chairperson has the power and authority to perform any or all of the duties and responsibilities of the Chairperson in the absence of the Chairperson and/or as requested by the Chairperson.  Except for any duties specified herein or pursuant to each Funds Declaration of Trust or By-laws, the designation of Chairperson or Vice-Chairperson does not impose on such noninterested Trustee any duties, obligations or liability that is greater than the duties, obligations or liability imposed on such person as a member of the Board, generally.

	Proxy Statement dated January 26, 2017






	Each Fund is subject to a number of risks, including, among others, investment, compliance, operational, and valuation risks. Risk oversight is part of the Boards general oversight of each Fund and is addressed as part of various activities of the Board and its Committees. As part of its oversight of each Fund, the Board directly, or through a Committee, relies on and reviews reports from, among others, Fund management, the adviser, the administrator, the principal underwriter, the Chief Compliance Officer (the CCO), and other Fund service providers responsible for day-to-day oversight of Fund investments, operations and compliance to assist the Board in identifying and understanding the nature and extent of risks and determining whether, and to what extent, such risks can or should be mitigated. The Board also interacts with the CCO and with senior personnel of the adviser, the administrator, the principal underwriter and other Fund service providers and provides input on risk management issues during meetings of the Board and its Committees.  Each of the adviser, the administrator, the principal underwriter and the other Fund service providers has its own independent interest and responsibilities in risk management, and its policies and methods for carrying out risk management functions will depend, in part, on its individual priorities, resources and controls. It is not possible to identify all of the risks that may affect a Fund or to develop processes and controls to eliminate or mitigate their occurrence or effects.  Moreover, it is necessary to bear certain risks (such as investment-related risks) to achieve a Funds goals.


	The Board, with the assistance of management and with input from the Boards various committees, reviews investment policies and risks in connection with its review of Fund performance. The Board has appointed a Fund CCO who oversees the implementation and testing of each Fund compliance program and reports to the Board regarding compliance matters for the Funds and their principal service providers. In addition, as part of the Boards periodic review of the advisory, subadvisory (if applicable), distribution and other service provider agreements, the Board may consider risk management aspects of their operations and the functions for which they are responsible. With respect to valuation, the Board approves and periodically reviews valuation policies and procedures applicable to valuing each Funds shares. The administrator and the adviser are responsible for the implementation and day-to-day administration of these valuation policies and procedures and provides reports to the Audit Committee of the Board and the Board regarding these and related matters. In addition, the Audit Committee of the Board or the Board receives reports periodically from the independent public accounting firm for each Fund regarding tests performed by such firm on the valuation of all securities, as well as with respect to other risks associated with mutual funds. Reports received from service providers, legal counsel and the independent public accounting firm assist the Board in performing its oversight function.


	Each Funds Declaration of Trust does not set forth any specific qualifications to serve as a Trustee.  The Charter of the Governance Committee also does not set forth any specific qualifications, but does set forth certain factors that the Committee may take into account in considering noninterested Trustee candidates.  In general, no one factor is decisive in the selection of an individual to join the Board. Among the factors the Board considers when concluding that an individual should serve on the Board are the following: (i) knowledge in matters relating to the mutual fund industry; (ii) experience as a director or senior officer of public companies; (iii) educational background; (iv) reputation for high ethical standards and professional integrity; (v) specific financial, technical or other expertise, and the extent to which such expertise would complement the Board members existing mix of skills, core competencies and qualifications; (vi) perceived ability to contribute to the ongoing functions of the Board, including the  ability and commitment to attend meetings regularly and work collaboratively with other members of the Board; (vii) the ability to qualify as a noninterested Trustee for purposes of the 1940 Act and any other actual or potential conflicts of interest involving the individual and each Fund; and (viii) such other factors as the Board determines to be relevant in light of the existing composition of the Board.


	Among the attributes or skills common to all Board members are their ability to review critically, evaluate, question and discuss information provided to them, to interact effectively with the other members of the Board, management, sub-advisers, other service providers, counsel and independent registered public accounting firms, and to exercise effective and independent business judgment in the performance of their duties as members of the Board.  Each Board members ability to perform his or her duties effectively has been attained through the Board members business, consulting, public service and/or academic positions and through experience from service as a member of the Boards of the Eaton Vance family of funds (Eaton Vance Fund Boards) (and/or in other capacities, including for any predecessor funds), public companies, or non-profit entities or other organizations as set forth below.  Each Board members ability to perform his or her duties effectively also has been enhanced by his or her educational background, professional training, and/or other life experiences.


	In respect of each current member of the Board, the individuals substantial professional accomplishments and experience, including in fields related to the operations of registered investment companies, were a significant factor in the determination that the individual should serve as a member of the Board.  The following is a summary of each Board members particular professional experience and additional considerations that contributed to the Boards conclusion that he or she should serve as a member of the Board:

	partner in charge of leading the audit; and (vi) prepare, as necessary, audit committee reports consistent with the requirements of applicable Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and stock exchange rules for inclusion in the proxy statement for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Fund.  Each Funds Board of Trustees has adopted a written charter for its Audit Committee, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit A.  The written charter is also available on the Eaton Vance website, www.eatonvance.com, by selecting Individual Investors followed by Tools & Resources and then Fund Corporate Governance.  The Audit Committees Report is set forth below under Additional Information.


	Messrs. Eston (Chairperson), Fetting, Gorman, Park and Wennerholm, and Mmes. Frost, Mosley, Peters, Sutherland and Taggart are members of the Contract Review Committee.  The purposes of the Contract Review Committee are to consider, evaluate and make recommendations to the Board concerning the following matters: (i) contractual arrangements with each service provider to each Fund, including advisory, sub-advisory, transfer agency, custodial and fund accounting, distribution services (if any) and administrative services; (ii) any and all other matters in which any of each Funds service providers (including Eaton Vance or any affiliated entity thereof) has an actual or potential conflict of interest with the interests of the Fund or its shareholders; and (iii) any other matter appropriate for review by the noninterested Trustees, unless the matter is within the responsibilities of other Committees of the Board.  


	Mmes. Peters (Chairperson), Frost and Mosley, and Mr. Fetting are members of the Portfolio Management Committee. The purposes of the Portfolio Management Committee are to: (i) assist the Board in its oversight of the portfolio management process employed by each Fund and their investment adviser and sub-adviser(s), if applicable, relative to the Funds stated objective(s), strategies and restrictions; (ii) assist the Board in its oversight of the trading policies and procedures and risk management techniques applicable to the Funds; and (iii) assist the Board in its monitoring of the performance results of all funds, giving special attention to the performance of certain funds that it or the Board of Trustees identifies from time to time.


	Messrs. Gorman (Chairperson), Eston, Verni and Wennerholm, and Mmes. Sutherland and Taggart are members of the Compliance Reports and Regulatory Matters Committee. The purposes of the Compliance Reports and Regulatory Matters Committee are to: (i) assist the Board in its oversight role with respect to compliance issues and certain other regulatory matters affecting the Funds; (ii) serve as a liaison between the Board of Trustees and the Funds CCO; and (iii) serve as a qualified legal compliance committee within the rules promulgated by the SEC.


	Mmes. Mosley (Chairperson) and Peters, and Mr. Gorman are members of the Ad Hoc Committee for Closed-End Fund Matters. The purpose of the Ad Hoc Committee for Closed-End Fund Matters is to consider, evaluate and make recommendations to the Board with respect to issues specifically related to Eaton Vance Closed-End Funds.


	Mmes. Taggart (Chairperson), Frost, Mosley, Peters and Sutherland, and Messrs. Eston, Fetting, Gorman, Park, Verni and Wennerholm are members of the Governance Committee.  Each Governance Committee member is independent under applicable listing standards of the NYSE MKT or New York Stock Exchange (as applicable).  The purpose of the Governance Committee is to consider, evaluate and make recommendations to the Board with respect to the structure, membership and operation of the Board and the Committees thereof, including the nomination and selection of noninterested Trustees and a Chairperson of the Board and the compensation of such persons.


	Each Funds Board of Trustees has adopted a written charter for its Governance Committee, a copy of which is available on the Eaton Vance website, www.eatonvance.com, by selecting Individual Investors followed by Tools & Resources and then Fund Corporate Governance.  The Governance Committee identifies candidates by obtaining referrals from such sources as it deems appropriate, which may include current Trustees, management of the Fund, counsel and other advisors to the Trustees, and shareholders of the Funds who submit recommendations in accordance with the procedures described in the Committees charter.  In no event shall the Governance Committee consider as a candidate to fill any vacancy an individual recommended by management of the Funds, unless the Governance Committee has invited management to make such a recommendation.  The Governance Committee will, when a vacancy exists, consider a nominee for Trustee recommended by a shareholder, provided that such recommendation is submitted in writing to the Funds Secretary at the principal executive office of the Fund.  Such recommendations must be accompanied by biographical and occupational data on the candidate (including whether the candidate would be an interested person of the Fund), a written consent by the candidate to be named as a nominee and to serve as Trustee if elected, record and ownership information for the recommending shareholder with respect to the Fund, and a description of any arrangements or understandings regarding recommendation of the candidate for consideration. The Governance Committees procedures for evaluating candidates for the position of noninterested Trustee are set forth in an appendix to the Committees charter.


	The Governance Committee does not have a formal policy to consider diversity when identifying candidates for the position of noninterested Trustee.  Rather, as a matter of practice, the Committee considers the overall diversity of the Boards composition when identifying candidates.  Specifically, the Committee considers how a particular candidate could be expected to contribute to overall diversity in the backgrounds, skills and experiences of the Boards members and thereby enhance the effectiveness of the Board.  In addition, as part of its annual self-evaluation, the Board has an opportunity to consider the diversity of its members,

	Proxy Statement dated January 26, 2017






	including specifically whether the Boards members have the right mix of characteristics, experiences and skills.  The results of the self-evaluation are considered by the Governance Committee in its decision-making process with respect to candidates for the position of noninterested Trustee.


	Communications with the Board of Trustees


	Shareholders wishing to communicate with the Board may do so by sending a written communication to the Chairperson of the Board of Trustees, the Chairperson of any Committee of the Board of Trustees or to the noninterested Trustees as a group, at the following address:  Two International Place, Boston, Massachusetts 02110, c/o the Secretary of the applicable Fund.


	Remuneration of Trustees


	Each noninterested Trustee is compensated for his or her services according to a fee schedule adopted by each Board of Trustees, and receives a fee that consists of an annual retainer and a committee service component.  Each Fund currently pays each noninterested Trustee a pro rata share, as described below, of:  (i) an annual retainer of $260,000; (ii) an additional annual retainer of $125,000 for serving as the Chairperson of the noninterested Trustees; (iii) an additional annual retainer of $60,000 for Committee Service; (iv) an additional annual retainer of $30,000 for serving as the Governance Committee Chairperson, the Audit Committee Chairperson, the Compliance Committee Chairperson, the Contract Review Committee Chairperson or the Portfolio Management Committee Chairperson (to be split evenly in the event of Co-Chairpersons); (v) the Chairperson of an Ad Hoc Committee will receive $5,000 for any six-month period the Ad Hoc Committee is in existence, with the six-month periods being October 1 through March 31 and April 1 through September 30; and (vi) out-of-pocket expenses.  The pro rata share paid by each Fund is based on the Funds average net assets as a percentage of the average net assets of all the funds in the Eaton Vance family of funds.  For the fiscal year ended November 30, 2016, the Trustees of each Fund earned the compensation set forth below in their capacities as Trustees of each Fund, and assumes they served for the entire period.  For the calendar year ended December 31, 2016, the Trustees earned the compensation set forth below in their capacities as members of the Eaton Vance Fund Boards

	As of January 10, 2017, the Eaton Vance fund complex consists of 176 registered investment companies or series thereof.  The compensation schedule disclosed above reflects the current compensation schedule, which may not have been in place for each Funds full fiscal year ended November 30, 2016 or the full calendar year ended December 31, 2016.  Amounts do not include expenses reimbursed to Trustees for attending Board meetings, which in the aggregate amounted to $75,009 for the calendar year ended December 31, 2016.  Messrs. Fetting and Wennerholm began serving as Trustees effective September 1, 2016, and thus the compensation figures listed for each Fund and the Fund and Fund Complex are estimated based on amounts each would have received if they had been Trustees for the full fiscal year ended November 30, 2016 and the full calendar year ended December 31, 2016.

	Includes deferred compensation as follows:  California - $520; Massachusetts - $221; Michigan - $173; Municipal - $1,456; New Jersey - $334; New York - $408; Ohio - $231; and Pennsylvania - $205.



	(3)



	Includes deferred compensation as follows:  California - $920; Massachusetts - $392; Michigan - $306; Municipal - $2,577; New Jersey - $591; New York - $723; Ohio - $409; and Pennsylvania - $363.

	Proxy Statement dated January 26, 2017






	Trustees of each Fund who are not affiliated with Eaton Vance may elect to defer receipt of all or a percentage of their annual fees in accordance with the terms of a Trustees Deferred Compensation Plan (the Deferred Compensation Plan).  Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, an eligible Trustee may elect to have his or her deferred fees invested in the shares of one or more funds in the Eaton Vance family of funds, and the amount paid to the Trustees under the Deferred Compensation Plan will be determined based upon the performance of such investments.  Deferral of Trustees fees in accordance with the Deferred Compensation Plan will have a negligible effect on the assets, liabilities, and net income of a participating Fund, and will not obligate a Fund to retain the services of any Trustee or obligate a Fund to pay any particular level of compensation to the Trustee.  No Fund has a retirement plan for its Trustees.


	The Board of Trustees recommends that shareholders vote FOR the election of the Trustee nominees of each Fund.


	NOTICE TO BANKS AND BROKER/DEALERS


	Each Fund has previously solicited all Nominee and Broker/Dealer accounts as to the number of additional proxy statements required to supply owners of shares.  Should additional proxy material be required for beneficial owners, please call 1-866-864-4942, send an email to corporateservices@astfundsolutions.com or forward such requests to AST Fund Solutions, LLC, 55 Challenger Road, Suite 201, Ridgefield Park, NJ 07660.


	ADDITIONAL INFORMATION




	Audit Committee Report


	Each Audit Committee reviews and discusses the audited financial statements with Fund management.  Each Audit Committee also discusses with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by SAS 61 (Communication with Audit Committees), as modified or supplemented.  Each Audit Committee receives the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1 (Independence Discussions with Audit Committees), as modified or supplemented, and discusses with the independent registered public accounting firm their independence.


	Based on the review and discussions referred to above, each Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Trustees that the audited financial statements be included in the Funds annual report to shareholders for filing with the SEC.  As mentioned, the Audit Committee is currently comprised of Messrs. Verni (Chairperson), Eston, Gorman, Park and Wennerholm.


	Auditors, Audit Fees and All Other Fees


	Deloitte & Touche LLP (Deloitte), 200 Berkeley Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02116, serves as the independent registered public accounting firm of each Fund.  Representatives of Deloitte are not expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, but have been given the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available should any matter arise requiring their presence.


	Aggregate audit, audit-related, tax, and other fees billed to each Fund by the Funds independent registered public accounting firm for the relevant periods are set forth on Exhibit B hereto.  Aggregate non-audit fees (i.e., fees for audit-related, tax, and other services) billed for the relevant periods to (i) each Fund by the Funds independent registered public accounting firm; and (ii) the Eaton Vance Organization by the Funds independent registered public accounting firm are also set forth on Exhibit B hereto.


	Each Funds Audit Committee has adopted policies and procedures relating to the pre-approval of services provided by the Funds independent registered public accounting firm (the Pre-Approval Policies).  The Pre-Approval Policies establish a framework intended to assist the Audit Committee in the proper discharge of its pre-approval responsibilities.  As a general matter, the Pre-Approval Policies (i) specify certain types of audit, audit-related, tax, and other services determined to be pre-approved by the Audit Committee; and (ii) delineate specific procedures governing the mechanics of the pre-approval process, including the approval and monitoring of audit and non-audit service fees.  Unless a service is specifically pre-approved under the Pre-Approval Policies, it must be separately pre-approved by the Audit Committee.  The Pre-Approval Policies and the types of audit and non-audit services pre-approved therein must be reviewed and ratified by each Funds Audit Committee at least annually.  Each Funds Audit Committee maintains full responsibility for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the work of the Funds independent registered public accounting firm.


	Each Funds Audit Committee has considered whether the provision by the Funds independent registered public accounting firm of non-audit services to the Funds investment adviser, as well as any of its affiliates that provide ongoing services to the Fund, that were not pre-approved pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(ii) of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the independent registered public accounting firms independence.


	In connection with Deloittes annual required communication regarding all relationships between Deloitte and its affiliates (Deloitte Entities) and the Eaton Vance family of funds and their affiliates, Deloitte informed the Audit Committee that certain






	12


	Proxy Statement dated January 26, 2017






	relationships between Deloitte Entities and its lenders who are record owners of more than 10% of the shares of one or more funds  within the Eaton Vance family of funds implicate Rule 2-01(c)(1)(ii)(A) of Regulation S-X (the Loan Rule), calling into question Deloittes independence with respect to the Eaton Vance family of funds.  The Loan Rule prohibits an accounting firm, such as Deloitte, from having certain financial relationships with its audit clients and affiliated entities. Specifically, the Loan Rule provides, in relevant part, that an accounting firm generally would not be independent if it receives a loan from a lender that is a record or beneficial owner of more than ten percent of the audit clients equity securities. The Funds are providing this disclosure to explain the facts and circumstances as well as Deloittes conclusions concerning Deloittes objectivity and impartiality with respect to the audits of the Funds.


	Deloitte advised the Audit Committee of its conclusion that, in light of the facts surrounding its lending relationships, Deloittes objectivity and impartiality in the planning and conduct of the audits of Each Funds financial statements will not be compromised, Deloitte is in a position to continue as the auditor for Each Fund and no actions need to be taken with respect to previously issued reports by Deloitte.  Deloitte has advised the Audit Committee that these conclusions were based in part on the following considerations: (1) Deloitte Entity personnel responsible for managing the lending relationships have had no interactions with the audit engagement team; (2) the lending relationships are in good standing and the principal and interest payments are up-to-date; and (3) the lending relationships are not significant to the Deloitte Entities or to Deloitte.


	On June 20, 2016, the SEC issued no-action relief to another mutual fund complex (see Fidelity Management & Research Company et al., No-Action Letter (June 20, 2016) (the No-Action Letter)) related to the auditor independence issue described above.  In the No-Action Letter, the SEC indicated that it would not recommend enforcement action against the fund group if the auditor is not in compliance with the Loan Rule provided that: (1) the auditor has complied with PCAOB Rule 3526(b)(1) and 3526(b)(2); (2) the auditors non-compliance under the Loan Rule is with respect to certain lending relationships; and (3) notwithstanding such non-compliance, the auditor has concluded that it is objective and impartial with respect to the issues encompassed within its engagement as auditor of the funds.  Based on information provided by Deloitte, the requirements of the No-Action Letter appear to be met with respect to Deloittes lending relationships described above. After giving consideration to the guidance provided in the No-Action Letter, Deloitte affirmed to the Audit Committee that Deloitte is an independent accountant with respect to Each Fund within the meaning of the rules and standards of the PCAOB and the securities laws and regulations administered by the SEC. The SEC has indicated that the no-action relief will expire 18 months from its issuance.


	Officers of the Funds


	The officers of the Funds and their length of service are set forth below.  The officers of the Funds hold indefinite terms of office.  Because of their positions with Eaton Vance and their ownership of EVC stock, the officers of the Funds will benefit from any advisory and/or administration fees paid by each Fund to Eaton Vance.  Each officer affiliated with Eaton Vance may hold a position with other Eaton Vance affiliates that is comparable to his or her position with Eaton Vance listed below. Information in the table below about an officer's position with a Fund and the period as an officer are for each Fund unless otherwise noted.

	Proxy Statement dated January 26, 2017






	Investment Adviser and Administrator


	Eaton Vance Management, with its principal office at Two International Place, Boston, Massachusetts 02110, serves as the investment adviser and administrator to each Fund.


	Proxy Solicitation and Tabulation


	The expense of preparing, printing and mailing this Proxy Statement and enclosures and the costs of soliciting proxies on behalf of the Board of Trustees of each Fund will be borne ratably by the Funds.  Proxies will be solicited by mail and may be solicited in person or by telephone or facsimile by officers of a Fund, by personnel of its administrator, Eaton Vance, by the transfer agent, AST Fund Solutions, LLC, by broker-dealer firms, or by a professional solicitation organization.  The expenses associated with the solicitation of these proxies and with any further proxies will be borne by the applicable Fund.  A written proxy may be delivered to a Fund or its transfer agent prior to the meeting by facsimile machine, graphic communication equipment or similar electronic transmission.  A Fund will reimburse banks, broker-dealer firms, and other persons holding shares registered in their names or in the names of their nominees, for their expenses incurred in sending proxy material to and obtaining proxies from the beneficial owners of such shares.  Total estimated proxy solicitation costs are approximately $28,000 and will be paid by the Funds pro rata based on the number of shareholder accounts.


	All proxy cards solicited by the Board of Trustees that are properly executed and received by the Secretary prior to the meeting, and which are not revoked, will be voted at the meeting.  Shares represented by such proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions thereon.  If no specification is made on the proxy card with respect to Proposal 1, it will be voted FOR the matters specified on the proxy card.  All shares that are voted and votes to ABSTAIN will be counted towards establishing a quorum, as will broker non-votes.  (Broker non-votes are shares for which (i) the beneficial owner has not voted and (ii) the broker holding the shares does not have discretionary authority to vote on the particular matter.)  Accordingly, abstentions and broker non-votes, which will be treated as shares that are present at the meeting but which have not been voted, will assist a Fund in obtaining a quorum but will have no effect on the outcome of Proposal 1.


	A quorum requires the presence, in person or by proxy, of a majority of the outstanding shares of a Fund entitled to vote.  In the event that a quorum is not present at the meeting, or if a quorum is present at the meeting but sufficient votes by the shareholders of a Fund in favor of the Proposal set forth in the Notice of this meeting are not received by March 23, 2017, the persons named as proxies may propose one or more adjournments of the meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies.  Any such adjournment will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of that Fund present in person or by proxy at the session of the meeting to be adjourned.  The persons named as proxies will vote in favor of such adjournment those proxies which they are entitled to vote in favor of the Proposal for which further solicitation of proxies is to be made.  They will vote against any such adjournment those proxies required to be voted against such Proposal.  The costs of any such additional solicitation and of any adjourned session will be borne by the Fund.


	Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance


	Based solely upon a review of the copies of the forms received by the Funds, all of the Trustees and officers of each Fund, EVM and its affiliates, and any person who owns more than ten percent of a Funds outstanding securities have made all filings required under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regarding ownership of shares of the Funds for the Funds most recent fiscal year end.



	Each Fund will furnish without charge a copy of its most recent Annual and Semi-Annual Reports to any shareholder upon request.  Shareholders desiring to obtain a copy of such reports should call 1-866-864-4942, send an email to corporateservices@astfundsolutions.com or write to the Fund c/o AST Fund Solutions, LLC, 55 Challenger Road, Suite 201, Ridgefield Park, NJ 07660.  Shareholder reports are also available on the Eaton Vance website, www.eatonvance.com, by selecting Individual Investors followed by Products and then Closed-End Funds - Documents.






	SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS


	To be considered for presentation at a Funds 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, a shareholder proposal submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 must be received at the Funds principal office c/o the Secretary of the Fund on or before September 29, 2017.  Written notice of a shareholder proposal submitted outside of the processes of Rule 14a-8 must be delivered to the Funds principal office c/o the Secretary of the Fund no later than the close of business on December 23, 2017 and no earlier than November 23, 2017.  In order to be included in the Funds proxy statement and form of proxy, a shareholder proposal must comply with all applicable legal requirements.  Timely submission of a proposal does not guarantee that such proposal will be included.

	The Board of Trustees or Directors (the Board) of each registered investment company or series thereof (each, a Fund and collectively, the Funds) sponsored by the Eaton Vance organization (Eaton Vance) has established an Audit Committee (the Committee) of the Board and has approved this Charter for the operation of the Committee.  The purposes of the Committee are as follows:


	1.


	To oversee each Funds accounting and financial reporting processes, its internal control over financial reporting, and, as appropriate, the internal control over financial reporting of certain service providers;


	2.


	To oversee or, as appropriate, assist Board oversight of the quality and integrity of the Funds financial statements and the independent audit thereof;


	3.


	To oversee, or, as appropriate, assist Board oversight of, the Funds compliance with legal and regulatory requirements that relate to the Funds accounting and financial reporting, internal control over financial reporting and independent audits;


	4.


	To approve prior to appointment the engagement and, when appropriate, replacement of the independent registered public accountants (independent auditors), and, if applicable, nominate independent auditors to be proposed for shareholder ratification in any proxy statement of a Fund;


	5.


	To evaluate, or, as appropriate, assist Board oversight of, the qualifications, independence and performance of the independent auditors and the audit partner in charge of leading the audit; and


	6.


	To prepare such audit committee reports consistent with the requirements of applicable Securities and Exchange Commission, NYSE MKT and New York Stock Exchange rules for inclusion in the proxy statement for the annual meeting of shareholders of a Fund.


	The primary function of the Committee is oversight.  The Committee is not responsible for managing the Funds or for performing tasks that are delegated to the officers of any Fund, any investment adviser to a Fund, the custodian of a Fund, and other service providers for the Funds, and nothing in this Charter shall be construed to reduce the responsibilities or liabilities of management or the Funds service providers, including the independent auditors.  It is managements responsibility to maintain appropriate systems for accounting and internal control over financial reporting.  Specifically, management is responsible for: (1) the preparation, presentation and integrity of the financial statements of each Fund; (2) the maintenance of appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles and policies; and (3) the maintenance of internal control over financial reporting and other procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and related laws and regulations.  The independent auditors are responsible for planning and carrying out an audit consistent with applicable legal and professional standards and the terms of their engagement letter, and shall report directly to the Committee.  In performing its oversight function, the Committee shall be entitled to rely upon advice and information that it receives in its discussions and communications with management, the independent auditors and such experts, advisors and professionals as may be consulted by the Committee.   


	II.  Composition of the Committee.


	The Committee shall be comprised of at least three members appointed by the Board, which shall also determine the number and term, if any, of such members, in each case upon the recommendation of the Governance Committee of the Board.  All members of the Committee shall be Trustees or Directors who are not interested persons (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act)) of any Fund or of the investment adviser, sub-adviser or principal underwriter of any Fund (each, an Independent Trustee and collectively, the Independent Trustees).  In the event that a resignation, retirement, removal or other event or circumstance causes the number of Committee members to fall below the minimum set forth above, the Committee shall nevertheless be authorized to take any and all actions otherwise permitted under this Charter pending the appointment, within a reasonable time, of one or more Independent Trustees to fill the vacancy created thereby.  






	A-1






	The following requirements shall also be satisfied with respect to the membership and composition of the Committee:


	1.


	each member of the Committee shall have been determined by the Board to have no material relationship that would interfere with the exercise of his or her independent judgment;


	2.


	no member of the Committee shall receive any compensation from a Fund except compensation for service as a member or Chairperson of the Board or of a committee of the Board;


	3.


	each member of the Committee shall also satisfy the applicable Committee membership requirements imposed under the rules of the NYSE MKT LLC (NYSE MKT) (formerly NYSE AMEX and the American Stock Exchange) and New York Stock Exchange (and any other national securities exchange on which a Funds shares are listed), as in effect from time to time, including with respect to the members former affiliations or employment and financial literacy;


	4.


	at least one member of the Committee must have the accounting or related financial management expertise and financial sophistication required under applicable rules of the NYSE MKT and New York Stock Exchange; and


	5.


	unless it determines that no member of the Committee qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 3 of Form N-CSR, the Board will identify one (or in its discretion, more than one) member of the Committee as an audit committee financial expert.


	III.  Meetings of the Committee.


	Meetings of the Committee shall be held, upon reasonable notice, at such times (but not less frequently than annually with respect to each Fund), at such places and for such purposes (consistent with the purposes of the Committee set forth in this Charter) as determined from time to time by the Committee, the Chairperson of the Committee, the Board or the Chairperson of the Board.  The Committee shall periodically meet separately with any independent auditors rendering reports to the Committee.  A majority of the members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting, and the decision of a majority of the members present and voting at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall determine any matter submitted to a vote.  The Committee may adopt such procedures or rules not otherwise inconsistent with the terms of this Charter as it deems appropriate to govern its conduct under this Charter, which procedures or rules, if any, shall be included as an appendix to this Charter.  Notices of all meetings of the Committee shall be provided to all Independent Trustees and all Independent Trustees shall be entitled to attend such meetings.  Materials provided to the members of the Committee in connection with meetings of the Committee shall be made available to each Independent Trustee.


	IV.  Chairperson of the Committee.


	A member of the Committee shall be appointed Chairperson of the Committee by the Board, upon the recommendation of the Governance Committee, for a term of not more than four years, and such member may serve as Chairperson of the Committee for more than one term.  The Chairperson of the Committee, or another member of Committee designated by the Chairperson, shall preside at meetings of the Committee.  The Chairperson of the Committee shall be authorized to determine the agenda of such meetings, the materials to be provided in connection with such meetings, the topics to be discussed, the amount of time to be devoted to such topics and the order in which the topics are to be addressed.  The Chairperson of the Committee may from time to time establish one or more working groups comprised of members of the Committee to assist the Chairperson and the Committee in performing their duties and responsibilities, and shall promptly notify the Chairperson of the Board upon the establishment of any such working group.  The Chairperson of the Committee shall provide oral or written reports to the Board at regular meetings of the Board regarding the activities of the Committee (and any working group thereof), including any approval by the Chairperson of the Board of expenditures by the Committee not previously reported to the Board.  The Chairperson of the Committee shall be primarily responsible for interfacing with the Chairperson of the Board and with the Chairperson of each other committee of the Board with respect to matters potentially affecting the activities of the Committee.  The Chairperson of the Committee shall also be primarily responsible, on behalf of the Committee, for interfacing with those individuals identified by Eaton Vance from time to time as being primarily responsible for responding to requests of the Committee.  The Board may, upon the recommendation of the Governance Committee, appoint a Vice-Chairperson of the Committee with the power and authority to perform any or all of the duties and responsibilities of the Chairperson of the Committee in the absence of the Chairperson of the Committee and/or as requested by the Chairperson of the Committee.  The Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson, if any, of the Committee shall receive such compensation as determined from time to time by the Board upon the recommendation of the Governance Committee.






	A-2






	V.  Duties and Responsibilities of the Committee.


	To carry out its purposes, the Committee shall have the following duties and responsibilities:


	1.


	To meet to review and discuss with management and the independent auditors the audited financial statements and other periodic financial statements of the Fund (including the Funds specific disclosures under the item Managements Discussion of Fund Performance); provided that discussion with the independent auditors shall not be required with respect to any periodic financial statement of the Fund that was not the subject of a review by such auditors.


	2.


	To consider the results of the examination of the Funds financial statements by the independent auditors, the independent auditors opinion with respect thereto, and any management letter issued by the independent auditors.


	3.


	To review and discuss with the independent auditors: (a) the scope of audits and audit reports and the policies relating to internal auditing procedures and controls and the accounting principles employed in the Funds financial reports and any proposed changes therein; (b) the personnel, staffing, qualifications and experience of the independent auditors; and (c) the compensation of the independent auditors.


	4.


	To review and assess the performance of the independent auditors and to approve, on behalf of the Board, the appointment and compensation of the independent auditors.  Approval by the Committee shall be in addition to any approval required under applicable law by a majority of the members of the Board who are not interested persons of the Fund as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act.  In performing this function, the Committee shall: (a) consider whether there should be a regular rotation of the Funds independent auditing firm; (b) discuss with the independent auditors matters bearing upon the qualifications of such auditors as independent under applicable standards of independence established from time to time by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and other regulatory authorities; and (c) shall secure from the independent auditors the information required by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1, Independence Discussions with Audit Committees, as in effect from time to time.  The Committee shall actively engage in a dialogue with the independent auditors with respect to any disclosed relationships or services that may impact the objectivity and independence of the independent auditors.


	5.


	To pre-approve: (a) audit and non-audit services provided by the independent auditors to the Fund; and (b) non-audit services provided by the independent auditors to the adviser or any other entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the adviser that provides on-going services to the Fund (Adviser Affiliates) if the engagement of the independent auditors relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Fund, as contemplated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) and the rules issued by the SEC in connection therewith (except, in the case of non-audit services provided to the Fund or any Adviser Affiliate, those within applicable de minimis statutory or regulatory exceptions), and to consider the possible effect of providing such services on the independence of the independent auditors.


	6.


	To adopt, to the extent deemed appropriate by the Committee, policies and procedures for pre-approval of the audit or non-audit services referred to above, including policies and procedures by which the Committee may delegate to one or more of its members authority to grant such pre-approval on behalf of the Committee (subject to subsequent reporting to the Committee).  The Committee hereby delegates to each of its members the authority to pre-approve any non-audit services referred to above between meetings of the Committee, provided that: (i) all reasonable efforts shall be made to obtain such pre-approval from the Chairperson of the Committee prior to seeking such pre-approval from any other member of the Committee; and (ii) all such pre-approvals shall be reported to the Committee not later than the next meeting thereof.


	7.


	To consider the controls implemented by the independent auditors and any measures taken by management to ensure that all items requiring pre-approval by the Committee are identified and referred to the Committee in a timely fashion.






	A-3









	8.


	To receive at least annually and prior to the filing with the SEC of the independent auditors report on the Funds financial statements, a report from such independent auditors of:  (i) all critical accounting policies and practices used by the Fund (or, in connection with any update, any changes in such accounting policies and practices), (ii) all material alternative accounting treatments within GAAP that have been discussed with management since the last annual report or update, including the ramifications of the use of the alternative treatments and the treatment preferred by the accounting firm, (iii) other material written communications between the independent auditors and the management of the Fund since the last annual report or update, (iv) a description of all non-audit services provided, including fees associated with the services, to any fund complex of which the Fund is a part since the last annual report or update that was not subject to the pre-approval requirements as discussed above; and (v) any other matters of concern relating to the Funds financial statements, including any uncorrected misstatements (or audit differences) whose effects management believes are immaterial, both individually and in aggregate, to the financial statements taken as a whole.  If this information is not communicated to the Committee within 90 days prior to the audit reports filing with the SEC, the independent auditors will be required to provide an update, in the 90 day period prior to the filing, of any changes to the previously reported information.


	9.


	To review and discuss with the independent auditors the matters required to be communicated with respect to the Fund pursuant to communications pursuant to applicable auditing standards, as in effect from time to time, and to receive such other communications or reports from the independent auditors (and managements responses to such reports or communications) as may be required under applicable listing standards of the national securities exchanges on which the Funds shares are listed, including a report describing: (1) the internal quality-control procedures of the independent auditors, any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, or peer review, of the independent auditors, or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional regulatory authorities, within the preceding five years, respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the independent auditors, and any steps taken to deal with any such issues; and (2) all relationships between the independent auditors and the Fund and any other relationships or services that may impact the objectivity and independence of the independent auditors.  To the extent unresolved disagreements exist between management and the independent auditors regarding the financial reporting of the Fund, it shall be the responsibility of the Committee to resolve such disagreements.


	10.

	13.


	To discuss generally the Funds earnings releases, as well as financial information and guidance provided to analysts and rating agencies, in the event a Fund issues any such releases or provides such information or guidance.  Such discussions may include the types of information to be disclosed and the type of presentation to be made.  The Committee need not discuss in advance each earnings release or each instance in which earnings guidance may be provided.


	14.


	To consider the Funds major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures, including guidelines and policies to govern the process by which risk assessment and management is undertaken.


	15.


	To review and report to the Board with respect to any material accounting, tax, valuation, or record-keeping issues which may affect the Fund, its respective financial statements or the amount of their dividend or distribution rates.






	A-4









	16.


	To establish procedures for:  (a) the receipt, retention, and treatment of complaints received by the Fund regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters; and (b) the confidential, anonymous submission by employees of the Fund or its service providers (including its investment advisers, administrators, principal underwriters and any other provider of accounting related services to the Fund) of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.  


	17.


	To direct and supervise investigations with respect to the following: (a) evidence of fraud or significant deficiencies in the design or implementation of internal controls reported to the Committee by the principal executive or financial officers of the Fund pursuant to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules; and (b) any other matters within the scope of this Charter, including the integrity of reported facts and figures, ethical conduct, and appropriate disclosure concerning the financial statements of the Funds.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market volatili ty, the Fund's current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. The Fund's performance at market price will differ from its results at NAV. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value or market  price (as applicable) with all distributions reinvested and includes management fees and other expenses. Until the reinvestment of Fund distributions is completed, returns are calculated using the lower of the net asset value or market price of the shar es on the distribution ex date.  Once the reinvestment is complete, returns are calculated using the average reinvestment price.  Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative.

About Risk: 
An imbalance in supply and demand in the municipal market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. There generally is limited public information  about municipal issuers. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. Longer-term bonds typically are more sensitive to interest-rate changes than shorter-term bonds. Investments in income securities may be affect ed by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer’s ability to make princi pal and interest payments. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as "junk") are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments. Derivative instruments can be used to take both long an d short positions, be highly volatile, result in economic leverage (which can magnify losses), and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying instrument on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk.  If a counterparty is unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in the return of collateral or other assets held by the counterparty. Borrowing to increase investments (leverage) will ex aggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of Fund investments. No Fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a Fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks.



1. Distribution Rate at NAV and Market Price is calculated by dividing the last distribution paid per share (annualized) by NAV or market price, respectively. For National Municipal Funds, Taxable-Equivalent Distribution Rate at NAV and Market Price is calc ulated using a 43.4% tax rate (equals maximum individual federal tax rate adjusted for the Medicare surtax). For Single-State Municipal Funds, Taxable-Equivalent Distribution Rates also reflect maximum effective individual state income tax rates. Local i ncome taxes that may apply are not considered.

This data reflects distributions paid on Fund shares held for the full calendar year and is not predictive of the tax character of current or future distributions.  Fund shareholders should refer to the individual IRS Form 1099-DIVs provided to them shor tly after each year-end to determine the appropriate federal income tax treatment of the distributions they receive.  Eaton Vance is not responsible for any errors in tax reporting that may result from using the above data. Exempt-interest dividends are  not subject to regular federal income tax. Exempt-interest dividends derived from specified private activity bonds are subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT). Non-qualified ordinary dividends are subject to federal income tax at ordinary rates. Cap ital gains distributions are taxable at long-term capital gain rates. Nondividend distributions, also known as return of capital distributions, are not subject to current federal income tax. Instead, the tax cost basis of each shareholder receiving a ret urn of capital distribution is reduced by the amount of the distribution.

About Risk: 
An imbalance in supply and demand in the municipal market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. There generally is limited public information  about municipal issuers. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. Longer-term bonds typically are more sensitive to interest-rate changes than shorter-term bonds. Investments in income securities may be affect ed by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer’s ability to make princi pal and interest payments. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as "junk") are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments. Derivative instruments can be used to take both long an d short positions, be highly volatile, result in economic leverage (which can magnify losses), and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying instrument on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk.  If a counterparty is unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in the return of collateral or other assets held by the counterparty. Borrowing to increase investments (leverage) will ex aggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of Fund investments. No Fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a Fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks.

 Insights & Analysis  Commentary
A Word On The Markets as of  Mar 31, 2017
The U.S. municipal bond market posted positive returns for the first quarter of 2017, with the Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index (the Index)5 returning 1.6% for the three-month period. After experiencing a significant amount of volatility foll owing Donald Trump's presidential election victory during the fourth quarter of 2016, the municipal market stabilized during the first quarter. During the period, short-term municipal yields declined 20-25 basis points, while intermediate- and longer-ter m yields were flat to slightly higher.
After experiencing significantly negative outflows during the last six weeks of 2016, mutual fund flows stabilized and turned positive in January, as some investors sought to take advantage of both higher municipal yields and attractive relative valuatio ns. Despite this expression of confidence at the beginning of the year, mutual fund flows for the entire quarter were fairly tepid with overall inflows totaling just under $5 billion. Issuance during the quarter declined to $88 billion compared to $100 b illion during the fourth quarter of 2016. The slowdown in issuance was largely related to the a decline in refunding activity due to higher interest rates and the uncertainty surrounding President Trump's agenda for health care, tax reform and infrastruc ture spending.
Compared to the sharp sell-off during the fourth quarter, the municipal market was relatively quiet during the first quarter. Treasury yields traded in a fairly tight range and the curve was more or less unchanged. Meanwhile, the municipal yield curve st eepened significantly as two- and five-year yields declined 19 and 24 basis points, respectively, while 30-year yields increased 1bp. As a result, short term municipals outperformed longer-term municipals with the five-and seven-year part of the curve le ading the way.
In terms of credit quality, lower quality municipals outperformed higher quality as BBB's within the Index returned 2.2% compared to AAAs up 1.4%. Similarly, after underperforming significantly during the fourth quarter, the Bloomberg Barclays High Yield  Municipal Bond Index6 returned 4.1%, significantly outperforming investment grade. This outperformance was primarily due to higher carry, spread tightening and renewed strength in the tobacco sector, which returned 13.1%. Finally, Puerto Rico cred its underperformed significantly following the release of its Certified Financial Plan in mid-March, which proved to be more negative for all bondholders than previously anticipated.


Performance Summary 
Eaton Vance Municipal Income Trust (the Trust) (EVN) underperformed the Index7 at net asset value for the quarter. The Fund's security selection within zero coupon bonds and Electric/Power sector bonds hurt performance relative to the index for the qu arter. The Fund's security selection within the IDR/ PCR (industrial development revenue and pollution control revenue) sector bonds aided relative performance. In addition, the Fund's security selection within insured Puerto Rico bonds bolstered perform ance. The Fund's use of leverage employed through TOBs and auction preferred shares aided from performance relative to the Index. These securities act as a financing mechanism allowing investors to borrow at short-term rates and invest in higher-yielding  bonds.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market volatili ty, the Fund's current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. The Fund's performance at market price will differ from its results at NAV. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value or market  price (as applicable) with all distributions reinvested and includes management fees and other expenses. Until the reinvestment of Fund distributions is completed, returns are calculated using the lower of the net asset value or market price of the shar es on the distribution ex date.  Once the reinvestment is complete, returns are calculated using the average reinvestment price.  Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative.

Investment Outlook And Fund Positioning 
We believe munis continue to be attractive on both an absolute and relative level. Intermediate- and longer-term municipals stabilized during the quarter, and the 10- and 30-year municipal-to-Treasury ratios ended the quarter at 94% and 101%, respectivel y.
Lackluster mutual fund flows and the ongoing expectation of lower taxes under the Trump administration have combined to keep municipal valuations attractive, in our view. In addition, we continue to lack specific details related to the specifics of Trump 's policies, what will get through Congress, and when. As a result, there are a wide range of potential outcomes.
In our view, the historic move higher in yields during the fourth quarter of 2016 created an emerging opportunity to lock in higher yields and potentially generate higher future returns. After the first three months of 2017, we believe this opportunity r emains in place. In recent history, the municipal market has proven to be resilient and sharp increases in municipal yields have resulted in buying opportunities and rewarded investors with strong returns in subsequent months. Therefore, we continue to b elieve that municipal yields could move back down a bit in 2017. There are other factors that could cause rates to retrace a bit, especially on the longer end of the Treasury curve. First, U.S. Treasury yields are still historically low, but very attract ive when compared with other developed markets such as Europe and Japan. Second, following the failure to reform the Affordable Care Act, uncertainty surrounding President Trump's ability to deliver on the policy front has increased. And finally, after i ncreasing the fed Funds rate by 25 basis points during the first quarter, the Federal Reserve is forecasting two more rate hikes in 2017, demonstrating a willingness to squeeze off inflationary pressures, if necessary.
Given this outlook, we believe tax-sensitive investors continue to be offered the opportunity to scale into munis at attractive yields and valuations. In addition, we believe municipals will continue to act as an anchor to provide diversification in the  context of an overall portfolio.8
