Really bright, lots of enthusiasm and energy, incredibly polite, VERY eager to get a job done well and not afraid to ask questions or seek additional direction.  When he is done with a project, he comes to you immediately to ask for the next assignment.

Though having completed only a year in college when he worked for us - and it was his first office position - his attitude, intelligence, curiosity, drive and ability to absorb what we were trying to accomplish made him an ideal intern.  These skills will no doubt make him a great team member in any area where he focuses his energy.  I recommend him highly and wish him all the best in his future endeavors.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended DavidGroupsAlpha Kappa PsiThe Fraternity of Phi Gamma DeltaVanderbilt Alumni GroupView David’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact David directlyView David’s Full ProfileNot the David you’re looking for?
