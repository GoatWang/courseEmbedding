Air data[edit]
IS&S produces both air data computers, as well as the instruments necessary to display the information. Digital displays (LCDs) are incorporated within round dials, providing more information then traditional instruments. Another display option is to use a primary flight display (PFD). IS&S air data units comply with RVSM rules and the company is a major supporter of the new technology.[1]

Cockpit display systems[edit]
IS&S has developed a number of full cockpit display solutions. Packages include a Boeing 757/Boeing 767 retrofit cockpit, C-130 retrofit cockpit, and a brand new Eclipse 500 Avio Next-Generation cockpit. The retrofit products include multiple PFDs and MFDs which replace a large number of traditional instruments. The Avio Next Generation cockpit is a brand new display system developed for new Eclipse 500 very light jets.[4]

On March 5, 2007, shortly after its announcement to part with Avidyne, Eclipse Aviation published an announcement that described the Next Generation Avio System and its suppliers. Innovative Solutions & Support, Inc. was listed as the main supplier and will provide the bulk of the package, including the PFD and MFD displays and the software included with them.[5] This agreement is one of the biggest for IS&S. The day after the announcement, IS&S stock increased almost 20%, closing at $23.10, a 20-month high. Volume increased over 500% to just over 1 million shares.[6]

Innovative Solutions & Support, Inc. was listed as the main supplier and will provide the bulk of the package, including the PFD and MFD displays and the software included with them.[5] This agreement is one of the biggest for IS&S. The day after the announcement, IS&S stock increased almost 20%, closing at $23.10, a 20-month high. Volume increased over 500% to just over 1 million shares.[6]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Products[edit]
Air data[edit]
IS&S produces both air data computers, as well as the instruments necessary to display the information. Digital displays (LCDs) are incorporated within round dials, providing more information then traditional instruments. Another display option is to use a primary flight display (PFD). IS&S air data units comply with RVSM rules and the company is a major supporter of the new technology.[1]
Engine and fuel data[edit]
Engine and fuel information is also displayed on flat panel displays, or digital versions of traditional instruments. IS&S instruments can display a number of different measurements from various sensors placed in the engine and fuel system.[2][3]
Cockpit display systems[edit]
IS&S has developed a number of full cockpit display solutions. Packages include a Boeing 757/Boeing 767 retrofit cockpit, C-130 retrofit cockpit, and a brand new Eclipse 500 Avio Next-Generation cockpit. The retrofit products include multiple PFDs and MFDs which replace a large number of traditional instruments. The Avio Next Generation cockpit is a brand new display system developed for new Eclipse 500 very light jets.[4]
Eclipse Partnership[edit]
On March 5, 2007, shortly after its announcement to part with Avidyne, Eclipse Aviation published an announcement that described the Next Generation Avio System and its suppliers. Innovative Solutions & Support, Inc. was listed as the main supplier and will provide the bulk of the package, including the PFD and MFD displays and the software included with them.[5] This agreement is one of the biggest for IS&S. The day after the announcement, IS&S stock increased almost 20%, closing at $23.10, a 20-month high. Volume increased over 500% to just over 1 million shares.[6]

Innovative Solutions & Support, Inc. Announces Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Financial Results






Business Wire




May 10, 2017 4:30 PM EDT













 


















































  Innovative Solutions & Support, Inc. ("IS&S" or the "Company") ( ISSC) today announced its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 ended March 31, 2017.  For the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company reported net sales of $4.7 million, compared to second quarter fiscal 2016 net sales of $8.7 million. In the second quarter of 2017, as a result of the previously announced settlement of the lawsuit with Delta Airlines, Inc. ("Delta"), the Company recognized $4.1 million of other income. During the term of the litigation, expenses incurred by the Company were recognized as a component of operating expenses. Furthermore, selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 include the reversal of a $3.6 million reserve for an unbilled receivable, representing the balance of the $7.75 million the Company received in settlement of this lawsuit. The Company reported net income of $5.9 million, or $0.35 per fully diluted share, for the second quarter of 2017 compared to net income of $1.6 million, or $0.09 per fully diluted share in the second quarter a year ago. In the year ago quarter, the Company recognized a $1.2 million benefit when it reversed deferred revenue and a contract loss accrual as the result of a contract renegotiation. (1)  Geoffrey Hedrick, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of IS&S, said, "We are pleased with the $7.75 million settlement and the end of the distraction of the lawsuit with Delta. We obtained a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Supplemental Type Certification (STC) and delivered the first of our PC12 flight deck, further expanding our product portfolio. We contracted with one of the world's leading MROs, Lufthansa Technik, dramatically expanding our worldwide distribution network. These are both strong contributors to our future growth. The new STC'd PC-12 NextGen Flight Deck, is fully integrated with our Turbo Prop Autothrottle. This is a first of its kind a product for which we have an STC pending, and for which there are strong growth expectations. We believe the steady progress we are achieving is further solidifying our ability to provide the best price-for-performance solutions to the impending demands from the implementation of NextGen mandates."

      believe the steady progress we are achieving is further solidifying our 
      ability to provide the best price-for-performance solutions to the 
      impending demands from the implementation of NextGen mandates.”
    

      At March 31, 2017, the Company had $23.7 million of cash on hand, an 
      increase of $5.5 million over the prior quarter.
    

      New orders in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 were $4.6 million and 
      backlog, as of March 31, 2017, was $5.9 million, essentially unchanged 
      from the end of the first quarter. Backlog excludes potential future 
      sole-source production orders from products in development under the 
      Company’s engineering development contracts, including the Eclipse 550, 
      the Pilatus PC-24, and the KC-46A, all of which the Company expects to 
      remain in production for more than decade following completion of their 
      respective development phases. The Company expects that these contracts 
      will add to production sales already in backlog.
    

      Shahram Askarpour, President of IS&S, added, "Product sales increased 
      over the first quarter, from which we generated margins of 52 percent. 
      Our agreement with Lufthansa Technik will enable owners and operators to 
      purchase and have installed our Cockpit/IP® Flat Panel Display System 
      (FPDS) for Classic Series Boeing 737 and 757/767 and its Integrated 
      Standby Unit at all of their global locations. The IS&S retrofit is 
      being offered on a global basis at all of Lufthansa Technik’s 35 
      subsidiaries and affiliates and is already in service on over 320 Boeing 
      757/767 aircraft. We also continue to internally fund research and 
      development to develop new products. Together with our new MRO 
      agreement, the STC for the Pilatus PC-12 NextGen Flight Deck and a PC-12 
      Auto-throttle STC pending we are making steady progress with our 
      strategy to establish a broad product portfolio on a global platform 
      that is responsive to the demand expected to arise from impending 
      NextGen mandates. By capitalizing on this large and growing market, we 
      can build value for our shareholders.”
    

Six Months Results


      Total net sales for the six months ended March 31, 2017 were $8.0 
      million, compared to $15.2 million for the six months ended March 31, 
      2016. Net income for the six months ended March 31, 2017 was $4.7 
      million, or $0.28 per fully diluted share compared to $1.4 million, or 
      $0.08 per fully diluted share for the first half of fiscal 2016. Six 
      month results for both fiscal 2017 and 2016 include the non-recurring 
      items recognized in their respective second quarters; the settled 
      lawsuit with Delta of $7.75 million and the $1.2 million benefit when 
      the Company reversed deferred revenue and a contract loss accrual as the 
      result of a contract negotiation.
    

      ______________________________________
    

(1)In January 2016, the Company renegotiated an agreement 
      with a customer whereby $1.3 million of unbilled receivables and our 
      obligations associated with certain product levels were canceled. The 
      bad debt expense related to the impairment of the unbilled receivable 
      was previously recognized in the Company's September 30, 2015 audited 
      financial statements. In addition, as a result of the changes to the 
      agreement, we recognized an approximately $1.2 million positive impact 
      to the statement of operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 
      resulting from a reversal of $1.2 million in associated liabilities 
      consisting of deferred revenue and a contract loss accrual.

Products[edit]
Air data[edit]
IS&S produces both air data computers, as well as the instruments necessary to display the information. Digital displays (LCDs) are incorporated within round dials, providing more information then traditional instruments. Another display option is to use a primary flight display (PFD). IS&S air data units comply with RVSM rules and the company is a major supporter of the new technology.[1]
Engine and fuel data[edit]
Engine and fuel information is also displayed on flat panel displays, or digital versions of traditional instruments. IS&S instruments can display a number of different measurements from various sensors placed in the engine and fuel system.[2][3]
Cockpit display systems[edit]
IS&S has developed a number of full cockpit display solutions. Packages include a Boeing 757/Boeing 767 retrofit cockpit, C-130 retrofit cockpit, and a brand new Eclipse 500 Avio Next-Generation cockpit. The retrofit products include multiple PFDs and MFDs which replace a large number of traditional instruments. The Avio Next Generation cockpit is a brand new display system developed for new Eclipse 500 very light jets.[4]
Eclipse Partnership[edit]
On March 5, 2007, shortly after its announcement to part with Avidyne, Eclipse Aviation published an announcement that described the Next Generation Avio System and its suppliers. Innovative Solutions & Support, Inc. was listed as the main supplier and will provide the bulk of the package, including the PFD and MFD displays and the software included with them.[5] This agreement is one of the biggest for IS&S. The day after the announcement, IS&S stock increased almost 20%, closing at $23.10, a 20-month high. Volume increased over 500% to just over 1 million shares.[6]

Quality Assurance - Innovative Solutions & Support










































Innovative Solutions & Support





















Quality Assurance
Quality Assurance
Quality Management Philosophy – Six Sigma
Product quality is of vital importance to Innovative Solutions and Support and its customers. We have taken steps to enhance the overall quality of our products. We utilize the Six Sigma program, which is a process evaluation program based on the premise that efficient companies can reduce to a very low level the number of defects and inefficient processes. Under this program, we are continuously seeking to improve our operational efficiencies, including our design and manufacturing processes and thus the general quality of our products. In particular, our Six Sigma program allows us to analyze our development processes and reduce the risks inherent in shortening our development cycle times.
ISO 9001/AS9100
IS&S is ISO 9001:2008 and AS9100 Revision C certified, by the independent registrar DEKRA Certification, Inc., for both design and manufacturing. Our goal is to ensure that we can consistently deliver our products and related services in a manner that meets or exceeds customer quality requirements. As an ISO 9001/AS9100 certified manufacturer, we can represent to our customers that we maintain high quality industry standards in the education of our employees and the design and manufacture of our products. Our products undergo extensive quality control testing prior to being delivered to customers. As part of our quality assurance procedures, we maintain detailed records of test results and our quality control processes.
Variability Reduction Efforts
Innovative Solutions and Support is well versed in the philosophy that variation causes defects. Before year 2001, the majority of our SMT Printed Wiring Assemblies were outsourced. As part of our growth and knowledge in trying to control and reduce variability, IS&S made significant capital expenditures to bring surface mount technology (SMT) capabilities in-house. Rather than be at the mercy of our subassembly subcontractors, this investment resulted in a significant reduction of solder joint defects along with a significant cycle time reduction. The overall quality and reliability of our products have been improved by bringing this technology in-house.
Variation can be attributed to a lack of understanding the process. Therefore, IS&S takes employee training seriously. We have 100% participation in Electro-Static Discharge (ESD) and Hazardous Communication (HAZCOM) training. IS&S currently has manufacturing and inspection personnel trained to the requirements of IPC-A-610 (Acceptability of Electronic Assemblies), and J-STD-001 (Requirements for Soldered Electrical and Electronic Assemblies). We have internal ISO 9001/AS9101 auditors. Departmental training is on going to ensure awareness to ISO work instructions.
FAA and Customer Relationships
The Boeing Company has approved our Quality Management System to BQMS D6-82479, Appendix A and Addendum 2. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has surveyed IS&S’ production quality system and has issued approval to 14 CFR FAA Part 21, Subpart 0 for Technical Standard Order (TSO) Authorizations. IS&S is also a FAA Production Approval Holder (PAH) under facility/project number PQ0929NE. Our latest Aircraft Certification Systems Evaluation Program (ACSEP) audit was held on 7-11 December 2009. The FAA has issued more than 100 Technical Standard Orders (TSO), 12 Supplemental Type Certificates (STC) and 11 Parts Manufacturing Approvals. In addition, IS&S holds a 14 CFR FAA Part 145 Repair Station Air Agency Certificate with a Limited Accessory and Instrument Rating, Air Agency Certificate Number I72R916X and European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Part-145 Approval, Reference EASA.145.6021.

Announces Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Financial ResultsBusiness WireMay 10, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareEXTON, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Innovative Solutions & Support, Inc. (“IS&S” or the “Company”) (ISSC) today announced its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 ended March 31, 2017.For the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company reported net sales of $4.7 million, compared to second quarter fiscal 2016 net sales of $8.7 million. In the second quarter of 2017, as a result of the previously announced settlement of the lawsuit with Delta Airlines, Inc. (“Delta”), the Company recognized $4.1 million of other income. During the term of the litigation, expenses incurred by the Company were recognized as a component of operating expenses. Furthermore, selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 include the reversal of a $3.6 million reserve for an unbilled receivable, representing the balance of the $7.75 million the Company received in settlement of this lawsuit. The Company reported net income of $5.9 million, or $0.35 per fully diluted share, for the second quarter of 2017 compared to net income of $1.6 million, or $0.09 per fully diluted share in the second quarter a year ago. In the year ago quarter, the Company recognized a $1.2 million benefit when it reversed deferred revenue and a contract loss accrual as the result of a contract renegotiation.(1)Geoffrey Hedrick, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of IS&S, said, “We are pleased with the $7.75 million settlement and the end of the distraction of the lawsuit with Delta. We obtained a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Supplemental Type Certification (STC) and delivered the first of our PC12 flight deck, further expanding our product portfolio. We contracted with one of the world’s leading MROs, Lufthansa Technik, dramatically expanding our worldwide distribution network. These are both strong contributors to our future growth. The new STC’d PC-12 NextGen Flight Deck, is fully integrated with our Turbo Prop Autothrottle. This is a first of its kind a product for which we have an STC pending, and for which there are strong growth expectations. We believe the steady progress we are achieving is further solidifying our ability to provide the best price-for-performance solutions to the impending demands from the implementation of NextGen mandates.”At March 31, 2017, the Company had $23.7 million of cash on hand, an increase of $5.5 million over the prior quarter.New orders in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 were $4.6 million and backlog, as of March 31, 2017, was $5.9 million, essentially unchanged from the end of the first quarter. Backlog excludes potential future sole-source production orders from products in development under the Company’s engineering development contracts, including the Eclipse 550, the Pilatus PC-24, and the KC-46A, all of which the Company expects to remain in production for more than decade following completion of their respective development phases. The Company expects that these contracts will add to production sales already in backlog.Shahram Askarpour, President of IS&S, added, "Product sales increased over the first quarter, from which we generated margins of 52 percent. Our agreement with Lufthansa Technik will enable owners and operators to purchase and have installed our Cockpit/IP® Flat Panel Display System (FPDS) for Classic Series Boeing 737 and 757/767 and its Integrated Standby Unit at all of their global locations. The IS&S retrofit is being offered on a global basis at all of Lufthansa Technik’s 35 subsidiaries and affiliates and is already in service on over 320 Boeing 757/767 aircraft. We also continue to internally fund research and development to develop new products. Together with our new MRO agreement, the STC for the Pilatus PC-12 NextGen Flight Deck and a PC-12 Auto-throttle STC pending we are making steady progress with our strategy to establish a broad product portfolio on a global platform that is responsive to the demand expected to arise from impending NextGen mandates. By capitalizing on this large and growing market, we can build value for our shareholders.”Six Months ResultsTotal net sales for the six months ended March 31, 2017 were $8.0 million, compared to $15.2 million for the six months ended March 31, 2016. Net income for the six months ended March 31, 2017 was $4.7 million, or $0.28 per fully diluted share compared to $1.4 million, or $0.08 per fully diluted share for the first half of fiscal 2016. Six month results for both fiscal 2017 and 2016 include the non-recurring items recognized in their respective second quarters; the settled lawsuit with Delta of $7.75 million and the $1.2 million benefit when the Company reversed deferred revenue and a contract loss accrual as the result of a contract negotiation.Read More______________________________________(1)In January 2016, the Company renegotiated an agreement with a customer whereby $1.3 million of unbilled receivables and our obligations associated with certain product levels were canceled. The bad debt expense related to the impairment of the unbilled receivable was previously recognized in the Company's September 30, 2015 audited financial statements. In addition, as a result of the changes to the agreement, we recognized an approximately $1.2 million positive impact to the statement of operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 resulting from a reversal of $1.2 million in associated liabilities consisting of deferred revenue and a contract loss accrual.Conference CallThe Company will be hosting a conference call on Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 10:00 a.m. ET to discuss these results and its business outlook.
