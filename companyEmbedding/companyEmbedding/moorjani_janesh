Infoblox Appoints Janesh Moorjani as Chief Financial Officer
January 4, 2016
Santa Clara, Calif. - 
Infoblox Inc. (NYSE:BLOX), the network control company, today announced that Janesh Moorjani has joined Infoblox as executive vice president and chief financial officer, effective immediately. Moorjani is responsible for managing the company’s worldwide finance operations.
Moorjani (www.infoblox.com/company/overview/leadership) joins Infoblox from VMware, where he was senior vice  president of finance, responsible for corporate, field, and global business  unit finance functions across all of the company’s product and service lines.  Prior to VMware, Moorjani had a successful finance and sales career at Cisco,  where he started in finance in the US and rose through management positions across  APAC, ultimately to managing director of India sales. Previously, Moorjani worked  at Goldman Sachs, rising to vice president in the firm’s merchant banking  division in Silicon Valley.
In his new role, Moorjani reports to Infoblox president and chief executive officer Jesper Andersen, and is driving global finance operations to accelerate the company’s strategy for growth, built on extending Infoblox industry leadership in DNS, DHCP, and IP address management (DDI) into categories such as security, cloud, and analytics.
 “Janesh brings a rare combination of finance and sales experience to Infoblox, giving him unique perspective on executing against our growth strategies to maximize business success,” said Andersen. “We are delighted to have an executive of Janesh’s caliber join Infoblox to help extend our global industry leadership.”
“I’m incredibly excited to join an outstanding management team that’s ready to address very attractive growth opportunities,” said Moorjani. “This is an unprecedented time in the networking industry when, more than ever before, we believe customers need the control, reliability, security, and scalability provided by Infoblox.”
