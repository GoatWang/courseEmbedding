      Building relationships is really at the core of what I do. My mission is to make your real estate transaction as stress free as possible and exceed your expectations with outstanding customer service.
      











Get to know Debra J Perry




I am Debra J Perry and I decided living in the picturesque Mountains of Sussex County was what I wanted to do; stop commuting and work closer to home where me and my two children Live, Work and Play. In July 2010, I became a Licensed New Jersey Real Estate Agent. My real estate experience began 15 years ago in Property Management; I became certified in Commercial, Residential, and Light Industrial Properties, as well as HUD/LIHTC. I realized my specialty was in Leasing and Contract Negotiations. With these skills I entered the Telecom Industry and earned my Project Management Certification.  This is where I learned important teamwork and budgeting skills for acquiring raw land for development and construction, while learning the idiosyncrasies of the NJ municipal zoning laws. In 2006, I obtained my Bachelors in Operations and HR Management.  I am a driven individual who is adaptable, competitive and a problem-solver, as well as skeptical, tough minded and determined. Because I have a lot of energy and tend to be enthusiastic about my theories and projects, I can be very persuasive. I am eager to make an impact on those around me. There is nothing that inspires me more than helping each one of my client's realize their real estate dreams and goals. A New Jersey native, I am someone whose energy and enthusiasm are invigoratingly fresh and contagious; I make the most of every opportunity, and believe that one should "Take control of their destiny, by believing in yourself and ignoring those who try to discourage you.  Never give up or give in." 






Certifications




What excites me about Real Estate here in Sussex County New Jersey is that there are endless opportunities available to me in the real estate industry and building relationships is really at the core of what I do. The key to my success is my empowering work ethic and emphasis on building long term, sustainable relationships with my clients and co-workers, by developing my ability to connect with each of them individually with outstanding customer service and collaborative communication and my innate ability to create long lasting relationships with other real estate professionals, mortgage lenders, attorneys and others serves to benefit everyone throughout the process.She does this by being honest demonstrating integrity and treating each client with the respect they deserve by focusing her efforts on what her clients want, not what she thinks they need. I build relationships with my clients and actively listens to exactly what their needs and requirements are. My 'platinum' rule I live by, "Treat people the way THEY would like to be treated".
