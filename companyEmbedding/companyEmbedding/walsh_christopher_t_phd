Christopher A. Walsh, MD, PhD


Dr. Christopher Walsh completed his B.S. degree at Bucknell University in chemistry and his MD (1985) and PhD (1983) in neurobiology at the University of Chicago.  After completing his residencies at Massachusetts General Hospital, Dr. Walsh became a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School.  During his fellowship, he performed some of the first direct studies of cell lineage and cell migration in the developing cortex of mammals.  Dr. Walsh established his own lab in 1993, the goal of which is to identify and analyze the genes that regulate the development and normal function of the human cerebral cortex.  Most of the genetic work of the lab has benefited from worldwide collaborations, especially with physicians in countries where marriage between cousins is common because this creates genetic effects that greatly simplify the identification of rare, recessive mutations.
 

As Chief of the Genetics Division at Children's Hospital Boston, Dr. Walsh is working to leverage his lab's gene discovery efforts to harness new technology to improve genetic diagnosis in the clinical setting, as well as to collaborate with other members of the Division to develop improved treatments for children with neurological disorders.
 
Since establishing his lab in 1993, Dr. Walsh has been fortunate to receive a number of awards, including the Derek Denny-Brown Award (American Neurological Association), Dreiffus-Penry Epilepsy Award (American Academy of Neurology), Jacob Javits Distinguished Investigator Award (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke), Epilepsy Research Award (American Epilepsy Society), and Jacoby Research Award (American Neurological Association).  In 2010 he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 2013, Dr.Walsh was elected to the Institute of Medicine.
 
Dr. Walsh is Bullard Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School, Chief of the Division of Genetics at Children's Hospital Boston, Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at Children's Hospital Boston, and the former Director of the Harvard-MIT MD-PhD Program.

ABOUT OUR RESEARCH



							Developmental disorders of the human brain can cause 
                            epilepsy, intellectual disability and/or autism. We 
                            study the genetics and molecular biology of the 
                            developing cerebral cortex, the brain's largest 
                            structure, to advance the understanding, diagnosis 
                            and management of human neurological disease.

Christopher A. Walsh Laboratory - Research on Developmental Disorders of the Brain



























 






































 
SpecialtyClinics












 
At our Brain Development and Genetics (BrDG) Clinic at Children's Hospital Boston, we evaluate children with a wide range of brain development disorders. In many of these conditions, the brain does not develop normally before birth. These can be called brain malformations or malformations of cortical development.

BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND GENETICS CLINIC 

The Brain Development and Genetics (BrDG) clinic is designed to bridge the services of neurology and genetics and provide a multi-disciplinary approach to diagnosing, treating and counseling patients with brain malformations, as well as their families. Brain malformations (or malformations of cortical development) are disorders in which the brain does not develop normally before birth. They can arise from many different genetic or non-genetic causes. In some cases, brain malformations can be due to a genetic change (mutation) that is inherited in a family, while in other cases they can result from non-genetic problems during pregnancy, such as certain maternal infections.

The diagnosis of a brain malformation often leaves families with many questions and looking for more information. These conditions are rare and information about them is often hard to find. The BrDG clinic combines our specialties of neurology, genetics, genetic counseling and research to provide a comprehensive approach to working with children and adults with brain malformations, and to help address their unanswered questions.

Our team of doctors can review a diagnosis and supporting clinical test results as well as discuss potential treatment options for neurological symptoms. Patients and their families can meet with a genetic counselor to learn about the inheritance of brain malformations. We can also provide information about participating in research studies looking for genes involved in brain development.

Some of the specific conditions seen in our clinic include:


		Polymicrogyria (PMG) including:

                    Perisylvian PMG, also called Perisylvian Syndrome
                    Bilateral Frontal PMG (BFP)
                    Bilateral Frontoparietal Polymicrogyria (BFPP)
                    Diffuse PMG


		Heterotopias including:

                    Periventricular Heterotopia (PH), also called periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH or PVNH)
                    Subcortical Heterotopias
                    Subcortical Band Heterotopia (SBH), also called Double Cortex Syndrome


		Lissencephaly (LIS) including:

                    Lissencephaly with Cerebellar Hypoplasia (LCH)
                    Incomplete lissencephaly, also called variant lissencephaly


		Microcephaly

		Pachygyria

		Double Cortex Syndrome (DCS)

		Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD), also called focal brain malformations

		Hemimegalencephaly

		Joubert syndrome

		Interhemispheric Cysts with Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum (IHC/ACC)

		Schizencephaly

		Walker-Warburg Syndrome (WWS) and related conditions

We welcome inquires regarding other conditions not listed here but which might be similar or related to disorders of brain development.

GENERAL GENETIC SERVICES

The Division of Genetics and Genomics at BCH is available to see children and young adults with a wide range of medical conditions. These conditions might or might not involve problems affecting brain development. If a child has not had a general genetics evaluation, this could be suggested prior to or after being seen in the BrDG clinic depending on a child's symptoms and history.

Current ResearchDevelopment of the Human Cerebral CortexChristopher Walsh is interested in genes that regulate the development and function of the human cerebral cortex. Mutations in these genes cause autism and epilepsy, as well as intellectual disability and other learning disorders. Not only are these genes vital to the normal development of the cortex, but also some appear to have been altered evolutionarily to allow the unique aspects of the brain that underlie human cognitive abilities.Read more ›The diversity of developmental disorders of the human brain...

Walsh hadn't selected the course and knew nothing about psychology, but fortunately he…A month before Christopher Walsh went to Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, an acceptance into Honors Psychology 101 arrived in his mailbox. Walsh hadn't selected the course and knew nothing about psychology, but fortunately he decided to sign up. The teacher was Alan Leshner, who later directed the National Institute on Drug Abuse and now publishes the journal Science. "He got me really excited about neuroscience," says Walsh, who had gone to college with "no clue about what I wanted to do."
After Walsh's freshman year, his brother-in-law (a neurosurgical resident) found him a summer job at Columbia University's Neurological Institute of New York, working for neuroradiologist Sadek Hilal. The same summer, the institute acquired its first CT scanner. "I still remember Dr. Hilal holding up one of the pictures and saying, 'This is the future of neurology,'" Walsh recalls.
These two events were pivotal to his career, Walsh says. Today, he is an expert on the development of the cerebral cortex and the developmental missteps that produce mental retardation.
After Walsh graduated in chemistry in 1978, he entered the University of Chicago's MD/PhD program, interested in brain chemistry and disorders such as schizophrenia. But when he began to study brain development, he was struck by the similarity between the brain's physical structure and philosopher Immanuel Kant's ideas about the structure of perception, which he had encountered during a college course. "I became interested in the fact that the structure of consciousness is built out of biological nuts and bolts," Walsh explains.
Little was known about brain construction when Walsh became a postdoc at Harvard Medical School after completing his internship and residencies. Therefore, he decided to label cells in the developing brain to see where they ended up. At that time, it was thought that a dividing cell gave rise to a patch of similar cells that remained in that location, but that proved to be only partly true. "To my complete surprise, we saw some daughter cells being scattered as far as the eye could see," Walsh says.
Other scientists were skeptical of this finding, which Walsh and colleagues reported in Science in 1988. But over the next 10 years, the paper became very influential. Scientists now know that excitatory neurons cluster together during brain development but that inhibitory neurons migrate to other parts of the brain. "Nature has found it easier to make the inhibitory neurons for the entire forebrain in one place and then cause these cells to migrate far and wide than to form similar cell types in multiple places," Walsh says.
When Walsh established his own lab in 1993, he was unsure how to combine basic science with medicine. But after hearing a former professor's talk about an inherited brain malformation, Walsh decided to study human genetics. And he began to look for genes that affect neuronal migration.
By studying children who suffer from double cortex syndrome, in which an extraneous cortex forms beneath the cerebral cortex, his group discovered its first new gene for a human disease. Dubbed doublecortin, this gene encodes a signaling protein that structures the cellular skeleton of neurons. When it is faulty, neurons that should migrate long distances through the developing brain get stuck en route, forming the second cortex. The patients—usually girls because this recessive gene lies on the X chromosome—have epilepsy and mental retardation.
"This discovery was a major highlight for me because of the tremendous logic of genetics," Walsh says. "You focus on a disorder for a long period and then come up with a very simple explanation in terms of mutations in a specific gene." While it is difficult to envision therapies for gross malformations of the brain, Walsh adds, having a genetic diagnosis can help families decide whether to bear more children. "Having a disabled child is so defining for many families," he says. "To get an understanding of where the disorder came from—whether it is inherited or, more commonly, a spontaneous mutation—can be very useful."
Over the years, his group has discovered many more genes that affect neuronal migration and cause severe malformations when faulty. For example, they isolated a gene called ASPM, which controls brain size. When ASPM is mutated, the human brain grows to only about half its normal size. Walsh's group and others subsequently showed that this gene has changed markedly during primate evolution, as the brain has become bigger. An interest in developing better therapies has driven him to investigate the genetics of intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorders as well, since in these conditions the brain appears generally normal in its shape and size, so that therapies intended to make the brain function better look promising. "Doing disease genetics gives you moments of discovery because you start with an inherited disorder, track the gene to a particular neighborhood of the genome, find the gene, and then determine the specific changes in that gene that result in the disorder."
Looking back over this work, Walsh is surprised by the number of things that can go wrong with brain development. "But the brain uses 10,000 to 15,000 genes, and Nature has probably put them all there for good reason," he says. "We try very hard to categorize the disorders of kids as precisely as we can. Someday, I expect we will understand that, say, autism is hundreds of different disorders."
To better understand that complex disease, Walsh is collaborating with physicians in countries, such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia, where families are large and people often marry distant relatives, increasing the risk of genetic disease. He actively recruits collaborators at international scientific meetings, but sometimes finds them closer to home. He recently gave a talk at his alma mater on a malformation of the brain's right, but not left, hemisphere, which he had observed in one family. Afterward, a classmate from medical school said she was treating three siblings with the same condition, so two families are now available for study. In 2013, their lab described mutations that can disrupt the development of just one hemisphere of the brain, while the other appears to develop and function normally, and found that some of these mutations are present in brain cells, but not always in the blood of the same patient. The idea that different cells in the body have different genomes from one another has become an increasing focus of his lab.
Walsh's world is now expanding beyond the brain, thanks to a new collaboration with geneticist and cardiologist Ming Hui Chen. Also on the Harvard faculty, Chen is Walsh's wife and the mother of their 19- and 16-year-old girls. Since some brain disorders include cardiac effects, the couple is studying filamin A, which has been implicated in neuronal migration. In December 2006, they reported that this protein is needed to establish junctions between cells in the developing heart and blood vessels. "Those moments of insight are one of the addictive things about genetics," Walsh says.

Christopher T. Walsh



 
            Christopher T. Walsh                      



From:
Harvard Medical School |
Boston, Massachusetts



Year:
2014


Subject:
Chemistry


Award:
Benjamin Franklin Medal


Citation:
For seminal studies at the interface of chemistry, biology and medicine that revolutionized the development of antibiotics for the treatment of disease and provided the foundation for the new field of Chemical Biology. 




During the past two centuries, as science's tools and techniques have become ever more refined, so have scientists become increasingly focused and specialized in their individual careers. The generalists of the past, the Galileos and Ben Franklins, whose interests and talents ranged across a broad spectrum of knowledge, have little place in a world that demands specialists who can focus narrowly on one field or even on a single scientific problem. But there are notable exceptions—scientists who resist being restricted to defined boundaries between scientific disciplines. Such scientists recognize the principle of what biologist E. O. Wilson calls "consilience"—the essential, ultimate unity and commonality of all fields of knowledge. One such scientist is Christopher Walsh, who has spent his life working at the interface of biology, chemistry, and medicine.After earning his Ph.D. at The Rockefeller University, Walsh began his career as a post-doc at Brandeis University. He worked under Robert Abeles, with whom he studied enzymology, specifically the mechanisms of enzyme inhibition. He took a position at MIT in 1972, where he extended his work on enzymes to investigate "suicide substrates," a special class of enzyme inhibitors. These, along with other enzyme-inhibiting mechanisms he developed, were instrumental in the creation of new and useful drugs. He also studied and elucidated previously unknown enzymatic transformations such as flavin-dependent redox active cofactors. In all of this work, Walsh was approaching the study of biological mechanisms through a chemistry-tinted lens, laying the groundwork for the new discipline of chemical biology.In 1987, after five years as chair of the MIT Chemistry Department, Walsh took on a new position with a title indicative of the broad-ranging character of his work: chair of the Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology at Harvard Medical School. He built on his earlier research on enzymatic processes to look at the workings of antibiotics and anti-tumor drugs, exploring ways to combat the ever-growing problem of antibiotic and drug resistance. When other drugs fail to stop life-threatening bacterial infections such as MRSA, the traditional last resort has been vancomycin, despite its dangerous side effects and toxicity. In recent years, even this powerful pharmaceutical weapon has been compromised by increasing bacterial resistance. Probing into the new anti-drug defenses evolved by bacteria, Walsh found that five different genes were needed to create vancomycin resistance, and isolated and characterized all of them. This new understanding promises the development of a new family of vancomycin derivatives that can overwhelm the newly-resistant bacterial strains.Walsh has continued to perform vitally important research on the action, resistance mechanisms, and biosynthesis of antibiotics, including the identification of the non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) pathways through which biologically active small molecules are formed. Such knowledge is crucial both for the improvement and refinement of existing drugs, but also for the synthesis of new pharmaceuticals with enhanced, better-targeted therapeutic characteristics.Walsh has served as president and CEO of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (1992-1995), as a member of the Scientific Review Board of HHMI and the National Academy of Sciences, among many other prestigious organizations, and as a consultant to major pharmaceutical companies. He is now Hamilton Kuhn Distinguished Professor at Harvard Medical School. Walsh’s first book, Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms, published in 1979, is widely recognized as a classic in its field, as are his two succeeding volumes. He has published more than 800 papers and he has trained a whole new generation of chemical biologists.From its beginning to the present day, Christopher Walsh's career has been about bringing together disparate pieces of knowledge from different and sometimes unexpected sources—and how, much as the enzymatic mechanisms he studies, new and important reactions are created in the process. Walsh himself has made perhaps the most apt observation of his own scientific impact: "As befits an enzymologist, my contributions have been catalytic."Information as of April 2014
