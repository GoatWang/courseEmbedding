RELEASE: pr6766-13














November 6, 2013 
CFTC Charges Donald R. Wilson and his Company, DRW Investments, LLC, with Price Manipulation
Defendants allegedly manipulated the IDEX USD Three-Month Interest Rate Swap Futures Contract by “Banging the Close”
Washington, DC – The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today filed a civil enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Donald R. Wilson (Wilson) and his company, DRW Investments, LLC (DRW).  The CFTC’s Complaint charges Wilson and DRW with unlawfully manipulating and attempting to manipulate the price of a futures contract, namely the IDEX USD Three-Month Interest Rate Swap Futures Contract (Three-Month Contract) from at least January 2011 through August 2011.  The Complaint alleges that as a result of the manipulative scheme, the defendants profited by at least $20 million, while their trading counterparties suffered losses of an equal amount. 
According to the Complaint, in 2010 the Three-Month Contract was listed by the International Derivatives Clearinghouse (IDCH) and traded on the NASDAQ OMX Futures Exchange, and was publicized as an alternative to over-the-counter, i.e., off-exchange, products.  Wilson and DRW believed that they could trade the contract for a profit based on their analysis of the contract.  At the end of 2010, Wilson caused DRW to acquire a large long (fixed rate) position in the Three-Month Contract with a net notional value in excess of $350 million.  The daily value of DRW’s position was dependent upon the daily settlement price of the Three-Month Contract calculated according to IDCH’s methodology.  As Wilson and DRW knew, the methodology relied on electronic bids placed on the exchange during a 15-minute period, the “settlement window,” prior to the close of each trading day.  In the absence of such bids, the exchange used prices from over-the-counter markets to determine its settlement prices.  Wilson and DRW anticipated that the value of their position would rise over time.
The market prices did not reach the level that Wilson and DRW had hoped for and expected, according to the Complaint.  Rather than accept that reality, Wilson and DRW allegedly executed a manipulative strategy to move the Three-Month Contract market price in their favor by “banging the close,” which entailed placing numerous bids on many trading days almost entirely within the settlement window, none of which resulted in actual transactions as DRW regularly cancelled the bids.  Under the exchange’s methodology, DRW’s bids became the settlement prices, and in this way DRW unlawfully increased the value of its position, according to the Complaint. 
Gretchen L. Lowe, the CFTC’s Acting Director of Enforcement, stated: “Traders cannot engage in manipulative acts to affect the price of futures contracts to achieve their desired profits, regardless of the so-called motive.  Today’s action demonstrates that the Commission will vigorously prosecute such cases to protect the integrity of the markets.”
According to the Complaint, Wilson and DRW allegedly caused and profited from artificial prices on the Three-Month Contract over a period of at least 118 trading days.  Because Wilson and DRW allegedly caused artificial prices in multiple maturities of the Three-Month Contract each day, the manipulative scheme allegedly affected the prices of over 1,000 futures contracts, according to the Complaint.
The Complaint alleges that by engaging in such conduct, Wilson violated, or aided and abetted in the violation of, Sections 6(c) and 9(a)(2) of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), 7 U.S.C. §§ 9 and 13(a)(2) (2006 & Supp. IV).  The Complaint further alleges that, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 13c(b) (2006 & Supp. IV), Wilson is liable as a controlling person for DRW’s violations of Sections 6(c) and 9(a)(2) of the  CEA.  The Complaint charges DRW with vicarious liability for the violations of its agents and/or employees, including Wilson, pursuant to Section 2(a)(1)(B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. § 2(a)(1)(B) (2006 & Supp. IV). 
In its ongoing litigation, the CFTC is seeking permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement, restitution, civil monetary penalties, trading suspensions and bans, and payment of costs and fees.  
The following CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members are primarily responsible for this case: A. Daniel Ullman II, Jason Mahoney, Sophia Siddiqui, Jordon Grimm, Joan Manley, and Paul G. Hayeck.

      Narrative Summary         Narrative for 0474952 - DRW COMMODITIES LLCFollowing a full evidentiary hearing on the merits, on April 15, 2014, a Panel of the NYMEX Business Conduct Committee (“Panel”) issued a written decision finding that DRW Commodities, LLC (“DRW”), a NYMEX member, violated NYMEX Rule 562.  The Panel found that on June 20, 2011, DRW reached an intraday long position of 3,734 July 2011 Crude Oil (“JUL11 Crude”) contracts, consisting of 2,973 long JUL11 Crude positions executed as Trading at Settlement (“TAS”) transactions and 761 long JUL11 Crude non-TAS positions, which was 734 contracts or 24.5% over the 3,000 lot position limit that was in effect on trade dates June 17, 20, and 21, 2011.   Based on the evidence presented, the Panel found that market participants had fair notice that positions established via TAS were included with non-TAS positions in the same underlying contract for purposes of determining compliance with the Exchange’s position limits.  The Panel found that fair notice to market participants was established through, among other things, the placement of TAS Rule 524 in Chapter 5 of the NYMEX Rulebook, the absence of contract specifications or contract chapters identifying TAS transactions as a separate product, and the numerous publicly available communications issued by the Exchange over the years defining TAS as an order type or method of execution that clears as the same product as a non-TAS transaction.  The Panel further found that TAS, since its inception, has never been its own independent contract.   Based on the record and the Panel’s findings and conclusions, the Panel ordered DRW to pay a $10,000 fine.  The Panel considered a stipulation executed by Market Regulation and DRW that if the Panel found DRW violated Rule 562, then it was agreed that DRW realized profits in the amount of $20,701.40 as a result of the violation.  Accordingly, the Panel ordered DRW to disgorge profits in the amount of $20,701.40.  This action became final on April 15, 2014 and effective April 30, 2014.             

































Who We Are – Meet Don Wilson & the DRW Team
 | DRW













 
























warning! 


























Get to know us
A rich history meets a forward looking approach







Our History
DRW was founded by Don Wilson, who got his start trading on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in the late 1980s. Every trader on the floor had a three letter acronym for identification—Don chose his initials, DRW, and the name stuck. Over the past 25 years, DRW has expanded globally while staying true to what has always set us apart…our ability to identify and capture opportunities by leveraging technology, research and risk management.
Our Approach
We characterize our trading activity as following three general approaches —


Liquidity providing: making markets, buying and selling products every day, with execution on a trading floor, over the phone and electronically 
Risk taking: doing our homework, formulating a view and putting on a position. Some positions are held for a few days, some for a few months or even years.
Latency sensitive: combining research and risk management with superior technology and execution



Trading in any asset class might include just one of these or may bring together all three; it all depends on what we see as the right strategy in that market. Our knowledge of the markets, pricing and modeling skills, risk management, and leading technology work together to create liquidity, improve market efficiency, and capture opportunities.
Our Culture
DRW combines the best of both worlds:  the opportunity and spirit of a startup and the stability of an established, experienced firm. Our employees work hard to solve interesting problems, and their results are rewarded. We value continuous learning—from our outcomes, from the environment and from each other. It’s a place of high expectations, deep curiosity, and constant collaboration, with some of the smartest, most passionate people you’ll meet.
