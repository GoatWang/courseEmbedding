LITTLE FALLS, N.J., March 22, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Cantel Medical Corp. (NYSE:   CMN) today announced the appointment of Ann E. Berman to serve as an independent member of Cantel's Board of Directors.
Ms. Berman is the former Chief Financial Officer (2002-2006) of Harvard University. As CFO of Harvard, Ms. Berman was responsible for an operating budget of more than $2.8 billion, and net assets in excess of $30 billion. As CFO, Ms. Berman brought a focus on the quality of financial management and "best practice" standards to Harvard. She was responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate and effective internal control structure within the University, and worked closely with the University's audit committee to minimize risk. Her areas of responsibility included financial strategy and policy; Treasury functions, including debt issuance and cash management; risk management and audit services; oversight and administration of government sponsored research; financial reporting; financial operations; and budget and financial planning. 
In her role on the Harvard Management Company Board, Ms. Berman participated in the work of the Finance/Audit Committee and the Valuation Committee. She was responsible for a governance review of the Management Company and its Board.
Ms. Berman serves on the Board of Directors and Audit Committee of Loews Corporation, a diversified holding company, and as a board member and the Chair of the Audit Committee of Eaton Vance Corporation, an investment manager of over $150 billion in investment funds and separate accounts. 
Before moving into higher education administration, Ms. Berman was a partner at Richard A. Eisner & Co., a New York-based regional accounting firm, where she specialized in tax and consulting work for a wide range of corporate and individual clients. She began her career with Price Waterhouse & Co., where she worked in both audit and taxation. Ms. Berman holds a B.A. from Cornell University where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. She is also a certified public accountant.
Charles M. Diker, Cantel's Chairman, commented, "We are delighted to have somebody as accomplished as Ann join our board, and we look forward to benefitting from her broad experience and expertise in financial management, reporting, and corporate governance."

As CFO, Ms. Berman brought a focus on the quality of financial management and "best practice" standards to Harvard. She was responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate and effective internal control structure within the University, and worked closely with the University's audit committee to minimize risk.

Ms. Berman serves on the Board of Directors and Audit Committee of Loews Corporation, a diversified holding company, and as a board member and the Chair of the Audit Committee of Eaton Vance Corporation, an investment manager of over $150 billion in investment funds and separate accounts. 
Before moving into higher education administration, Ms. Berman was a partner at Richard A. Eisner & Co., a New York-based regional accounting firm, where she specialized in tax and consulting work for a wide range of corporate and individual clients. She began her career with Price Waterhouse & Co., where she worked in both audit and taxation. Ms. Berman holds a B.A. from Cornell University where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. She is also a certified public accountant.

About the Series
In 2011, thirty years since its founding, The Kentucky Quilt Project, Inc., has created another “first” – a nine-part documentary series titled Why Quilts Matter: History, Art & Politics. The series takes a fresh look at quilts and spreads the word about their unique position at the center of a startlingly broad grid of topics, ranging from women’s studies to the contemporary art market.

 Visit Why Quilts Matter: History, Art & Politics on our YouTube channel
 
Executive Producer and Host for the series, Shelly Zegart, a co-founder of The Kentucky Quilt Project, Inc., The Alliance for American Quilts, and an expert at the forefront of quilt study for over three decades, has created the first series for television to show the world that quilts are bigger than people think. Using hundreds of examples from quilt makers past and present, Zegart introduces viewers to a group of enlightened academics, savvy dealers, and passionate quilt makers who share their personal stories, experiences and opinions.
“The making of this documentary has been an extraordinary experience and one that I am very proud to bring to the public,” explains Zegart. “Quilts are our windows into the history, art and politics of this country. However, the subject of quilts and the people who make them is frequently misunderstood as they have long been relegated to discussions of grandma’s patterns and fabric history. The nine episodes of Why Quilts Matter: History, Art & Politics spotlight both the passion and the differing points of view surrounding the quilt and its culture.”
Written by Ann E. Berman, author and former art world journalist, and produced by Doug Jefferson, founder of Focal Point Productions, Why Quilts Matter: History, Art & Politics was independently produced and funded.
Shelly Zegart
Shelly Zegart, executive producer and host, was a founding director of The Kentucky Quilt Project, Inc. (1981), the first state documentation project — a model used around the world, and The Alliance for American Quilts (1993). She curates exhibitions, lectures and writes on all aspects of quilt history and aesthetics. Exhibition projects include Mosaic Textiles: In Search of the Hexagon, Rouen, France (2003) and antique quilt exhibitions curated for the Great International Quilt Festival in Tokyo (2005, 2007, 2008). Her book, American Quilt Collections: Antique Quilt Masterpieces was published by Nihon Vogue in Tokyo (1998). Her article “Myth and Methodology: Shelly Zegart Unpicks African American Quilt Scholarship” was published in Selvedge Magazine, London, England, (2008). She bought and sold fine quilts for more than 30 years, building many significant public and private collections.  A member of Appraisers Association of America, Zegart appraises public and private quilt collections. Her personal collection was acquired and exhibited by The Art Institute of Chicago (2002).  For the past two and a half years Zegart has been working on producing the documentary series, Why Quilts Matter: History, Art and Politics.  Zegart holds a B.A. in education from the University of Michigan.
Ann E. Berman
Ann E. Berman is an author and retired art world journalist. After earning an M.A. in American material culture and museum curatorship from the University of Pennsylvania, she became a paintings specialist at Christie’s in New York, and a member of the American Society of Appraisers. Since then, she has written for many periodicals including Architectural Digest, Forbes, Martha Stewart Living, Town & Country, and the Leisure and Arts page of the Wall Street Journal. She was also a longtime contributing editor at Art & Auction and a contributing writer at Traditional Home. Her book credits include the catalogue raisonnee for the artist Reynolds Beal (1989), Living with Quilts for Phyllis George (1998), Buying and Wearing Classic Vintage Clothes with Tiffany Dubin (2000) and Good Things from Tag Sales and Flea Markets for Martha Stewart (2002). Berman has appeared on Conseulo Mack Wealth Track on PBS and contributed numerous interviews to HGTV On the Radio. She is currently president of the Mandell and Madeleine Berman Foundation and a board member of the Jewish Home Lifecare System and the Smithsonian Archives of American Art.

“The time for this series is now. For too long Grandma’s hope chest and Sunbonnet Sue have dominated quilt discussions. In ‘Why Quilts Matter: History, Art & Politics’ history and heritage count, but so does cutting-edge art.”
