Our Story

			Here at SensorShare LLC, we believe in improving the quality of your life. In fact, we are absolutely passionate about it. We envision the “internet of things” as being the future and a means to accomplish that mission. Our company, which focuses on creating specialized sensors and software, has recently been acquired by Conner Trebour, who has enthusiastically assumed the role of CEO. Under his new management, SensorShare has been revived and we have some incredibly exciting projects in the works. 
		

			When Conner first approached SensorShare, he was considering it simply as an investment. After hearing more about the company and realizing just how much their focus aligned with his own passions and interests, he decided to acquire the company instead. Conner saw a huge amount of potential in SensorShare; the concept was different and filled a new space in an untapped market. At the time of the acquisition, SensorShare was on the brink of dissolution and left uncared for by previous management. Where some may have lost hope, Conner was energized by the challenge and propelled into action to rebuild the company. Unwilling to give up on an incredible product with undeniable potential, Conner jumped in feet first and began assembling an innovative new team to resurrect the company.   
		

			SensorShare’s struggling product was the BeerBug: the first ever real-time digital hydrometer that avid homebrewers could use to track the progress of their precious brew. Conner and the new team got right to work, not knowing exactly what issues they were going to face, but that a lot of time, money, and effort would be necessary to get BeerBugs up and running again. Under Connor’s direction, two main focuses were prioritized. The first was to vastly improve customer service. The team was greeted by an overwhelming response from consumers who once loved the product, but were now at their wits end with the unreliable software and lack of communication from the previous management team. The SensorShare team has used this knowledge to fuel their second focus - solutions and moving forward. Throughout the long and grueling restoration process, the team has made every effort to keep their eager customers updated on the product’s progress and ask for feedback.  
		

			Today, SensorShare can proudly say that there are thousands of BeerBug owners around the world that would be unable to use their devices with no chance of recovery without the team’s hard work over these first few months of ownership. The BeerBug would not be where it is today without the team’s unwavering determination to restore the BeerBug and passion for its success.
		

			The SensorShare team is looking forward to a bright future of expanding in the technology and lifestyle industries. The team is constantly seeking feedback to discover new ways to improve the consumer’s lifestyle in future versions of the current product, as well as branching out to introducing complementary products. “I am looking forward to being able to chart our own path in terms of who we are as a company and how to grow in this industry,” says Trebour, “We are excited to continue to improve our current products and, in time, expand and grow in the internet of things market,” We hope that you are just as excited as us to see what SensorShare has in store for your future!

						Our Team
					



								Conner Trebour
								

									CEO and Co-Owner
								


 All products were once just an idea, but it takes someone with vision and dedication to take the idea and grow it into a successful company… this is where Conner comes in. Conner has a passion for helping small businesses focus and optimize their place in the market. After completing his degree in Business Management from Christopher Newport University, Conner began working with private companies to raise investment capital and assumed management roles with various startups. In August of 2016, Conner came across SensorShare as a possible investment opportunity and immediately saw the potential that lay ahead with a device as unique as the BeerBug! As CEO, Conner directs the company’s growth and has big plans to broaden SensorShare’s product offerings within the technology market.
							



								Chris Trebour
								

									Co-Owner and President, Covintus
								


 Throughout his career, Chris has continually searched to be a part of teams working on “cool stuff” and it is this desire that drew him to SensorShare. Chris is our biggest asset in bridging the gap between what our consumers dream of and creating a software team that can make it happen. In 2011, Chris with a few partners began Covintus, Inc., a software development firm that assists in the development of customized software and web interfaces. Using his Business Management background from Virginia Tech, Chris works to create crowdsourced teams of developers and designers hand-picked specifically for the client’s needs. With Chris’s expertise, SensorShare’s software capabilities are limitless!
							



								Cassie Raithel
								

									Chief Marketing Officer
								


 Few people get excited about brainstorming...but Cassie certainly does and you should see the idea board in her office! To Cassie, marketing is a puzzle that requires finding just the right combination of things to match your product with your customers. Using her multi-faceted education in Business Marketing and Graphic Design from Christopher Newport University, Cassie develops engaging user interfaces, website content, advertising, graphics design  and manages social media and public relations. Tapping into her love for puzzle solving, Cassie partners with Conner as the liaison between listening to customers and working with the technology team to develop a product and community that fits the needs of the market.

									Electrical Engineer
								


								With a team full of big dreamers, Karim is the hardware genius our SensorShare team needed!

FacebookEmail or PhonePasswordForgot account?Sign UpHomePostsVideosPhotosAboutCommunityCreate a PageVisitor PostsShawn McBrideYesterday at 9:44amAfternoon! I wanted to reach out and check the status of the current... Beer Bug. I was part of the original kick starter and meet Taylor and another member of your team  up at a my local homebrew store here in Charlotte NC where Taylor happily swapped out my original bug with a new version he said was much better. I was never able to get that device to properly work either.  The readings were horribly inaccurate when compared to my hydrometer so I still have it sitting in a box. But then I noticed you had posted some updates recently and are still selling the device. Does this new version accurately work? Maybe it was a software issue?
