 About McRae Capital Management



It’s important that you know your investment adviser.

We at McRae feel it’s even more important that we know you, your goals and your personal preferences. As we begin to understand each other, we are confident we’ll build the kind of long term relationship we enjoy with all of our clients.
McRae Capital Management is an independent investment counseling firm. We manage the assets of both individual and institutional investors. We carefully construct and diligently monitor a portfolio of stocks, bonds, or both, based on the goals and preferences of each of our clients.
Our basic approach is selective. We believe, above all, in high quality issues. We are growth oriented, but remain dedicated to our primary objective: preservation of capital. We are bound to only one proposition, and that is the well being of our clients.
McRae is NOT a broker, we do not receive commission income when initiating transactions on our clients behalf. Our only income is a fee based on the assets we manage.
Therefore, we have no incentive to trade for your account, unless we believe it is in your best interests. We build our relationships on two fundamental precepts: consistent performance, and personal trust.
If after looking around you would like more information, feel free to send us e-mail, or call us.

 Our Services – Divorce
Divorce is a difficult, stressful, and financially draining experience. During the process, most of the effort involves determining how to split up marital assets with the goal to get as much as possible.  But not all assets are the same! Some assets are easier to convert to cash than others.  Many assets have different tax implications for the account holder.  Moreover, after the divorce is complete, many clients are confronted with the task of managing these assets.  McRae Capital Management has decades of experience working with clients who have experienced the stress of divorce.

Evaluating assets during the divorce process

One of the most important parts of a divorce settlement is to identify what kinds of assets one might receive.  Cash and marketable securities are much more liquid than real estate and other hard assets.  If a settlement includes large portions of a retirement account such as an IRA or company 401(k), the recipient needs to consider possible taxes and penalties incurred to access the cash.  McRae Capital Management can help you evaluate your marital assets before your settlement distribution to ensure you understand the ramifications of the assets you receive.


Qualfied Domestic Relations Order (QDRO)

A QDRO is a legal order that establishes an ex-spouse’s right to a qualified retirement plan or pension. The QDRO also allows the ex-spouse to withdraw assets from the plan and roll them into them into an account in their own name.  McRae Capital Management can help explain the ramifications of a QDRO and help transfer those assets into your own account


College Planning

After a divorce, college planning for your children can become more difficult.  Often there are two separate parties that have some responsibility to funding future education for your children.  McRae can help analyze your new situation and recommend strategies to help with the college planning process.


Budgeting

Often after a divorce, we feel like we are starting all over again and it can be a daunting task.  Past financial plans need to be reconstructed for a life that we hadn’t planned for.  It is important to take small steps as we need to learn to feel comfortable with our new life.  The best place to start is with a simple budget and McRae Capital Management can help. Some items we deal with every week, such as food, fuel and clothing. Some items occur on a monthly basis such as mortgage /rent, utilities, and auto payments.  Yet some other items occur quarterly or annually like taxes, insurance, and health care costs.  McRae can help you set up a budget in place that will take into account all of these costs and see how they compare with your assets and the income they can generate.

 Our Services – College Planning
With the cost of higher education spiraling out of control, planning for college is one of the most difficult aspects of financial planning.  It is difficult for three reasons.  First, it is a daunting task because the cost are so high and constantly climbing. Second, there seem to be an endless number of different types of accounts,  scholarship opportunities, tax and gift considerations, and loans options that make the process extremely complex and difficult to understand.  Third,  all the rules and associated strategies keep changing so a strategy that may make sense at one point may not in the future.  Between new parents who have just started a family, clients with children who are approaching college age, and grandparents who want to help the younger generation, we probably get more questions about college planning than anything else.

Setting up accounts to save for college.

There are many strategies for saving money for college and each has a different impact with respect to taxes, possible financial aid, and scholarships. Trust accounts, 529 plans, Roth IRAs, student personal accounts, parents personal accounts are a few of the ways to pay for college.  It is important to recognize that every situation is unique.  McRae Capital Management advisors can help set up the right accounts for your specific situation.


Where to save for college. 

Different accounts are treated differently in the FASFA process for demonstrated need for financial aid.  Funds titled directly in the students name are viewed differently than assets in a 529 account or a parents account.  Let a McRae Advisor help organize your assets in the best way possible for your student and family.


Paying for college when the student matriculates . 

Saving money for college is only part of the game.  Based on your unique situation, how you actually pay the bill when your student starts school can have tax and financial aid ramifications.  How you pay for senior year may be completely different from freshman year.  It may make sense to take loans for the early years, and use gifted funds for the later years.  Consult a McRae Advisor to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of how the bills are actually paid.


The rules change

As we pointed out above, it seems the rules and strategies change rapidly.  The escalating costs of college and the mound of student debt the public is accumulating is daily news.  There is a lot of pressure to address these issues, and we expect to see new rules and options over the years.  Speak with a McRae Advisor to stay current with college investment strategies that are current.

 About McRae Capital Management



It’s important that you know your investment adviser.

We at McRae feel it’s even more important that we know you, your goals and your personal preferences. As we begin to understand each other, we are confident we’ll build the kind of long term relationship we enjoy with all of our clients.
McRae Capital Management is an independent investment counseling firm. We manage the assets of both individual and institutional investors. We carefully construct and diligently monitor a portfolio of stocks, bonds, or both, based on the goals and preferences of each of our clients.
Our basic approach is selective. We believe, above all, in high quality issues. We are growth oriented, but remain dedicated to our primary objective: preservation of capital. We are bound to only one proposition, and that is the well being of our clients.
McRae is NOT a broker, we do not receive commission income when initiating transactions on our clients behalf. Our only income is a fee based on the assets we manage.
Therefore, we have no incentive to trade for your account, unless we believe it is in your best interests. We build our relationships on two fundamental precepts: consistent performance, and personal trust.
If after looking around you would like more information, feel free to send us e-mail, or call us.
