About Organic By John Patrick

Since then, his eco-conscious Organic line has grown to focus on wearable separates and slouchy knits. Organic by John Patrick collections feature minimalist essentials infused with a modern bohemian mood. Patrick’s use of wholly organic fabrics and sustainable practices – such as incorporating botanical dyes, recycled materials and organic wool yarns into the production of his pieces – has helped to advance green fashion.
