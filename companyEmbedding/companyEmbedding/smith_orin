Lettris






Lettris is a curious tetris-clone game where all the bricks have the same square shape but different content. Each square carries a letter. To make squares disappear and save space for other squares you have to assemble English words (left, right, up, down) from the falling squares. 



boggle
Boggle gives you 3 minutes to find as many words (3 letters or more) as you can in a grid of 16 letters. You can also try the grid of 16 letters. Letters must be adjacent and longer words score better. See if you can get into the grid Hall of Fame !

There were praises, cheers, and stories at the last Starbucks annual shareholders meeting. This was the last meeting for one of Starbucks' most successful executives, Orin Smith. As the 62-year old Smith retires this month as Starbuck's CEO, he will be remembered for his leadership in the company by turning the inspiration and vision behind Starbucks into a reality. When previous CEO Howard Shultz approached Smith to join the Starbucks team in 1990, there were only approximately 45 stores in the U.S. and Canada combined (Starbucks). Today, there are around 9,000 stores occupied over 39 countries in addition to the 1,500 planned to open this year (Ouchi A1). 

Executive Background
While studying at the University of Washington, Smith decided to take time off to work as an engineer for Boeing Enterprises. During his tenure, he recalls rows and rows of engineers sitting at their desks, reminding him of the assembly line. Seeing this unattractive future, he decided to switch to a Business orientation and eventually enrolled into Harvard Business School in pursuant of an M.B.A. (Smith). 

In 1987, Howard Shultz purchased the Starbucks name and assets and presided as the new CEO. Three years later, he approached Smith, who was then working at Danzas (a freight shipping company) to enlist him as the company's CFO. Smith was able to see the vision and future potential of Starbucks. It was then, that Smith began driving Starbucks through its delicate years of raising capital, becoming a public company, and developing goals for future growth (Moix 1).

Management Style
"Before you can have an emotional connection with your customers, you have to have an emotional connection with your people." (Ouchi A1).

The success of Starbucks is partly due to Smith's strong emphasis on relationships between management and lower ranked employees (also called partners). Similar to JetBlue's CEO David Neeleman, Smith believes that a good relationship between management and employees will translate into a good relationship between the employees and the customers. In the past, both CEOs have been known to practice a hands-on' approach by stepping onto the front lines' of the business. Every quarter, Smith spends at least a couple of days behind the counter as part of their Adopt a Store' program for the senior executives. Smith believes that this is not only an excellent way for executives to interact with employees and customers first hand, but also a good opportunity to keep executives "connected with the spirit of the company." (Smith).

 Smith also has a good sense of how the company needs to address the issue of expansion internationally. One of the most important things that Smith stressed when Starbucks was in the initial stages of going overseas was to not assume that the market or consumers in other countries are similar to Americans. The operating concepts used in the U.S. rarely work overseas. Smith realizes that operating in different markets require a lot of knowledge about the culture, real-estate, market, and operating environment. In order for Starbucks to obtain this knowledge, it hires local managers; they are better able to understand how to conduct business successfully. Starbucks even has partnerships with other companies for stores in Europe to give them further knowledge about the operating environment. 

Aside from improving relations between the strategic side of management and the operations side, Smith has also improved Starbucks' information systems, financing, and legal affairs (Ouchi A1).

Corporate Strategy
In the early 1990s, Smith and Shultz were able to see the importance of the environment in which coffee was sold. In the past, coffee was generally treated as a commodity and quality was considered secondary to cost. Both men saw the opportunity to expand this experience, particularly the interactions between the customers and employees. To change this, Smith and Shultz created an appealing...

...COMPANY VIEW
A statement by Howard Schultz, Chairman and Chief Global Strategist of Starbucks
Corporation and Orin C. Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer of Starbucks
Corporation, follows. This has been taken from the company's 2003 Annual Report.
From the early days of Starbucks history, we have eagerly embraced possibilities and
let our imagination propel us to create new experiences instead of accepting
 the
status quo. That spirit, combined with our belief that a company can indeed achieve
the delicate balance between social and fiscal responsibility, and, frankly, our genuine
love for a great cup of coffee, has guided Starbucks on an amazing journey from a
single store in Seattle to a global presence with more than 7,000 locations worldwide.
That journey, which has yielded some wonderful rewards, is still in its early stages.
In a challenging economic environment where enduring success is extremely difficult
to achieve, Starbucks continues to thrive. The overwhelming global acceptance of the
Starbucks brand has resulted in the strongest performance in our history. Fiscal 2003
was marked by consolidated net revenues of $4.1 billion (up 24 percent from $3.3
billion in fiscal 2002), annual comparable store sales growth of 8 percent, and
increased market capitalization from approximately $300 million in 1992 to
approximately $12 billion...

Case Study 2: Starbucks: Forbidden in the Forbidden City

1. Why is China, traditionally a non-coffee drinking culture, an important market for Starbucks?

China contains large number of population. For Beijing’s Forbidden City, which is China’s top tourists attraction, as a destination of choice for both Chinese and foreign
 visitors, hosts millions of visitors each year. As evidence of the potential of the coffee market in China, domestic and international companies are selling high-priced reports on demand forecasts, trends, and development in the Chinese coffee market. Because the North America Market has been saturated, Starbucks continues to look farther afield for potential markets, highlighting an international focus in its mission. Chinese consumers want a Western experience. They have interest on and become excited about the environment, atmosphere and the fresh-brewed process brought by Starbucks. 









2. Do you think it was a good decision to house Starbucks in a world heritage site? What could Starbucks have done differently to be better accepted in the Forbidden City?

Yes，it is a good decision to house Starbucks in a world heritage site. Because Starbucks is the coffee shop a famous of the world. The world...

Employees are called â€œpartnersâ€ Store managers are called weekly to be applauded for good work. The success of the company is directly related to its corporate structure. ii.	It is not clear from the case, however, I believe
 that Starbucks has a corporate structure that is clearly understood by everyone, they try to make all employees feel like they are part of the team. iii. Their corporate structure is consistent with their current corporate objectives as well as strategies, policies and international operations which are run in a similar way. They run their international stores very similar to the ones they have in the US, keeping the no smoking policy and others. This might not be a good strategy for them because different cultures have different habits, it is not necessary that all Starbucks stores, regardless of location, are run in the same manner. b.	Corporate culture i. Starbucks does have a well defined corporate culture. They spent very little money on advertising and believe that having the best coffee and customer loyalty are the keys to success. They treat their employees very well offering competitive wages and good benefit packages. The culture in the...

Subject: Starbucks
Starbucks

“To say Starbucks purchases and roasts high-quality whole bean coffees is very true.  That’s the essence of what we do- but it hardly tells the whole story…(Starbucks, 2013, pg 1)”  Starbucks is known for not only their high quality products but also their great efforts in social responsibility.  They give back to the community while striving to have genuine
 service and an inviting atmosphere.  Their mission statement is as follows, “It has always been, and will always be, about quality.  We’re passionate about ethically sourcing the finest coffee beans, roasting them with great care, and improving the lives of people who grow them.  We care deeply about all of this; our work is never done (Starbucks, 2013, pg 1).”  They have done a tremendous job at having their mission statement hold true to their regular consumers while keeping them paying the higher costs of their product.

Analysis

Starbucks, in 2009, used economic analysis on elasticity in order to increase sales of their famous coffee drinks and use its reputation and premium brand drinks to take away sales from McDonalds which introduced a new line of lower priced espresso drinks that have proved to be popular.  Starbucks has decided to increase the cost of some of their drinks like the Frappuccinos and caramel Macchiatos by an average of 10...

                                                Starbucks Essay                                            

...without having to step out of your Mustang. Or perhaps you want a Frappuccino, but don't want to find a parking spot for your Audi. Well, Starbucks has you covered. Their goal is to have 1,500 new locations that will include drive-thru windows. It's a big departure from the Starbucks concept that most of its customers currently experience, but the company's been seeing strong sales at the handful of stores that already offer drive-thru service. So its plan is to
 cash in on hurried drivers. 

Brews over Burgers
	Mickey D's introduced Mc-Cafe drinks five years ago, allowing diners to opt for lattes or iced caramel mocha brewed drinks to go with their Big Macs and fries. Other fast food chains have been following suit. Starbucks hasn't missed a beat, despite the burger flippers pushing into its bean business. Beyond a brief stretch early in the recent recession, comparable-store sales have remained largely positive at Starbucks. However, as rushed morning commuters grow accustomed to being able to grab a caramel hot chocolate or premium roast coffee without having to leave their cars, Starbucks knows it doesn't want to be left behind.
	 The aromatic scents of freshly brewed java are so important that the chain scrapped several breakfast items a few years ago after they were making the place smell like -- well -- a McDonald's. Now Starbucks wants to take a page out of the Mickey D's...

...2. SWOT ANALYSIS
Strengths
 Brand Image:
Starbucks is amongst one of the very few companies that have managed to successfully create market awareness and stir up consumer interest in specialty coffee while at the same time preserving brand dominance. Its focus on consistency in delivering positive consumer experience stresses the point about consumer visits to its cafes being an ‘Experience’ rather than just seeing it as another coffee maker (workforce.com).
Unique
 Strategy:
The Ability to capture key locations and open stores in close nearness to each other is a unique strategy for Starbucks. This ensures that franchises that don’t meet set achievements are closed down. Therefore only the most profitable stores that maintain high sales, and retain the most customers survive.
Valued and motivated employees:
Starbucks promotes an environment that encourages team working and collaboration. As such it encourages managers to follow its motto of ‘hire the personality, train the skill’. Hence through exceptional service, customers keep coming back. (workforce.com)
The strengths provide a favourable impact.
 Weaknesses
Over-reliance on home market:
Although the American coffee market is worth over $18 Billion (e-importz.com), over-reliance on this market leaves Starbucks vulnerable to unforeseen changes that might occur in such market. E.g. recession affects disposable income for customers and subsequently,...
