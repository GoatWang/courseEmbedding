Physical Therapist Find Success in Cannabis-Testing

Marijuana Trends & Articles Feb 23, 2016 0 1200 



 
A successful physical therapist, and entrepreneur, from Morris County, is gambling his entire future on the growth of the medical marijuana experimentation industry. But not to worry, David Cunic has not completely devoted his life to working with cannabis forever.
“Most people say ‘Oh, if you need a tester, I’ll test a joint for you,’ ” Cunic, from Denville and graduate of the Delbarton School, where he played basketball with NBA star Troy Murphy, stated. “And I say, ‘No, it’s not that type of testing.’ “
Cunic as well as his very successful corporation, Pazoo Inc., is now looking at a more scientific approach when experimenting on cannabis in laboratories substances that may harm consumers before the product is distributed at legal dispensaries in states where therapeutic cannabis is legal.
“We don’t grow cannabis, we don’t sell cannabis, we test it,” Cunic added during an interview with the Daily Record in his Whippany office on Route 10, which will soon be vacant once he moves to a larger facility. “We make sure that the end-user is getting the safest product out there.”
Although medical cannabis has been allowed in New Jersey since 2011, strict regulations and laws have not allowed much distribution and access to those that need it. Albeit those difficulties, testing the substances is not needed in the Garden State.
“When I talk to patients who are taking cannabis here in New Jersey, I say ‘Do you know what you’re putting in your body?’ They go ‘Yeah, it was tested.’ No, it’s not,” Cunic answered. “It’s not mandatory here in New Jersey to have your cannabis tested, so you don’t know what you’re putting in your body. It could be doing more harm than good. There could be pesticides, heavy metals, we even find dog feces. Excuse my terminology, but there could be a lot of crap in there.”




 


 


$PZOO Subsidiary Adds Patented Product

Marijuana Stocks News Sep 9, 2015 0 1154 



Pazoo Wholly-Owned Subsidiary, CannabisKing Distribution, Adds A Revolutionary One-Of-A-Kind Patented Water Conservation Product
WHIPPANY, N.J., Sept. 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ — Pazoo, Inc. (OTC Pinks: PZOO) (German WKN#: A1J3DK), is pleased to report that 100% wholly owned subsidiary CannabisKing Distribution, LLC, has added another product offering.  This product is a one-of-a-kind patented water conservation product, which guarantees at least a 10%, to as much as a 30%, savings in commercial property owner’s water bill. There is also the benefit of significant conservation of water as well. Pazoo calls this product “The Green Valve.”
There is proof of concept as this product has been installed into more than 1,000 accounts already, and has proven to work as advertised. The product is not for single family residential use.  Instead, this product is designed for office buildings, apartment complexes, Universities, irrigation centers, grow facilities and similar high consumption water users.  It provides measurable savings on a product that is maintenance free, and basically invisible once installed.  Pazoo became a distributor of this product just this week and already has garnered the interest from numerous potential accounts.
This product is so well received because it is proven with actual results. Some facility owners have experienced a return on investment in as low as four months. The savings are dramatic even if only a 10% savings is achieved. For example a building with a $500,000 per year water bill will achieve a minimum of a $50,000 per year savings. Some facilities Pazoo is talking with have water bills in the $2 to $5 million dollar range per year. This product is ideal for all marijuana grow facilities, especially in the western United States where drought conditions are persistent as this product also conserves water.
David Cunic, CEO of Pazoo, states, “This Green Valve is an absolutely amazing product that we feel very strongly about. There is not a single grow facility that should not have this installed.  Frankly, there is not a single business that has a water bill of $50,000 or more per year that should not have this installed as this savings goes straight to a company’s bottom line. In fact, we welcome anyone seeing this press release that has a water bill or knows someone with a water bill of $50,000 or more a year to call us at 973-884-0136. We expect to close on our first accounts for this state-of-the-art product very soon.”
Testimonials:
“We are reducing our line item for water and sewer charges by $50,000 (from $240,000 to $ 190,000), based upon savings realized over past 2 years after installation of your product.”
– Bob P., GM Grand Central at Kennedy
“We have purchased and installed 12 valves in our apartment properties over past 6 months. Savings have ranged from 11% to 23%.”
– Greg C.T.R.C. Management Co.

Media & Technology, Micro Cap Insider




Pazoo Inc (OTCMKTS:PZOO) has been making new lows in recent weeks as the debt conversions that plagued this one in the past seem to be continuing.
The stock initially hit the bb’s back in 2012 at around a dime and quickly ran to highs over $0.40 before collapsing downward. PZOO received a ton of speculation back in the day that it would be used for the next AwesomePennyStock APS pick but that never happened.
Pazoo Inc (OTCMKTS:PZOO) delivers information, services and products through direct response digital and TV, retail stores and its website; pazoo.com, a health and wellness online portal with an array of experts delivering vital information to improve and enhance the enjoyment of living a full and enriching life.
Pazoo.com features industry experts from the health and wellness industry as well as the pet industry. On the website an individual can find a limited, and high quality, selection of merchandise, including fitness consumables, nutritional supplements, apparel, and wellness/safety products.
PZOO entered the red hot pot sector when they formed a partnership with MA & Associates, LLC, a cannabis testing lab that recently received a two-year exclusive contract with another grower for 100,000 square feet of grow with the intention of expanding its operation to 875,000 square feet of grow within the next two years.
Back in February PZOO said its Las Vegas affiliate, MA & Associates, LLC, (which to clarify is a cannabis testing lab and has never grown, distributed or sold marijuana products) is in the final phase of the build out of its state of the art marijuana testing facility. All of the testing equipment will be calibrated with Steep Hill Halent’s revolutionary marijuana testing procedures.
While the Las Vegas lab is expected to be fully completed, with machinery in place and ready to be operational, by the beginning to middle of April, there will be a ceremonial grand opening on the infamous date of 4/20 (April, 20, 2015). It is expected that growers will be delivering their first product to be tested on or before the end of April this year.

PZOO has been getting some big news recently; in September they announced they have received a $200,000 Loan to be paid back from the revenue and earnings of the Las Vegas Facility. There can be no debt to equity conversion as this is a more conventional form of financing.
The Note holder was so impressed by the Las Vegas Lab, and more so by the amount of growers that have committed to exclusively test with Pazoo, Inc subsidiary MA & Associates, LLC, that he was comfortable to be paid back from the revenue and earnings that will be generated from the Lab. In fact, based on the commitments from growers, Pazoo management is confident that the lab will be at least break even within the first 30 days of operation, and will quickly transition to profitability.
On November 9 PZOO announced it is now generating revenue under a consulting agreement from the operations of a marijuana testing lab. Pazoo last week signed the operational advisory agreement directly with Harris Lee Colorado, LLC (HLCO) for the Denver Colorado marijuana testing laboratory.
Pazoo, through wholly-owned subsidiary Harris Lee, LLC will begin to earn a fee per test once the transfer of ownership of the Denver testing lab is completed to Harris Lee Colorado. Pazoo currently is also earning a consulting fee during this interim step of HLCO as being the advisory manager and advisor on the proper marketing, sales, testing and overall management of the facility. The final approval from the MED for the complete transfer of the license is expected soon.

Currently trading at a $1.3 million market valuation PZOO has little assets, no revenues and rising short term debt that has resulted in significant dilution in the past; the stock has also been slapped with the dreaded skull & crossbones designation from Otcmarkets. Currently trading at the bottom of its trading range PZOO does have some big irons in the fire such as the marijuana testing facility which is now bringing in revenues. The stock already has liquidity and a ready audience when it chooses to run. We will be updating on PZOO when more details emerge so make sure you are subscribed to Microcapdaily so you know what’s going on with PZOO.

Pazoo, Inc. is Growing Up Fast in 2017 Posted on  June 1, 2017 by Stuart Smith


In one of the latest segments of SmallCapVoice.com’s Online Business Briefing, host Stuart T. Smith interviewed the CEO and co-founder, David Cunic, about his innovative company, Pazoo, Inc, that specializes in testing marijuana for safety and consistency. The opinion of David is that when parents give their children antibiotics or any other type of medicine, they want to be sure that the medicine is safe and the proper dosage. The only way to do that is through continuous testing of the product. The same goes for marijuana, whether it is used for medical or recreational use.
To look at it another way, consider moonshine, David asks of the listener. If you had the choice of buying moonshine from the liquor store where it has passed regulations and testing before hitting the shelves or from a batch made in some stranger’s back yard, you’re going to choose the former. Again, the same goes for marijuana. In fact, David stresses the idea UCS which stands for Use Cannabis Safely. When Pazoo Inc does it’s testing, it looks for impurities, contaminants and other irregularities that could make the product unsafe.
According to David, just three years ago pain management doctors didn’t even want to talk about cannabis for their patients, however that is all changing. Now, doctors are starting to ask questions and one of them is “how can I prescribe my patient safe cannabis?” One of the reasons for this change could very well be the opiate addiction sweeping the United States. With so many people addicted to prescribed drugs and making the leap to street drugs, like heroine, it’s now wonder doctors are looking at an alternative.
David’s answer to their question is simple: consistency and regulation. Both require means lots and lots of testing. The subsidiary to David’s company, MA & Associates, is based in Nevada, which happens to have the strictest marijuana testing laws in the country. In fact, a test is required by law to be performed for every five pounds of marijuana produced and packaged for consumer use. That is a lot of testing and Pazoo Inc. is truly a pioneer marijuana testing company because of the location they choose to work in. They believe that all fifty states should offer their residents access to cannabis, especially since people are looking for alternative pain medication, and that cannabis should be tested before hitting the shelves.
Pazoo, Inc.’s Good News
Pazoo, Inc. has some good news for their investors. Pazoo subsidiary, MA & Associates, LLC (MA), a State of Nevada licensed marijuana testing laboratory in Las Vegas, has recorded its first transaction resulting in billing its first revenues. David Cunic stated, “Everyone at Pazoo as well as MA is extremely excited about the lab bringing in revenues. This has been a long time coming, and to see it finally become a reality is amazing. We wanted to ensure lab operations and account services were done the proper way before taking in revenue. With that being said, we want to thank the shareholders, the investors, and our customers for their patience as they were all very eager to have us open. We look forward to reconnecting with the many operators who asked to work with us as new customers, turning our LOI’s into paying customers, and servicing the State of Nevada with our much needed testing services.”
They are now a revenue producing company as healthy as their company’s mission, which is to focus on health, wellness, and safety and to provide the “safest cannabis on the market.”
The Future of Pazoo, Inc.
CEO of Pazoo, Inc., David Cunic said, “We couldn’t be more thrilled with the direction the Las Vegas laboratory has taken. Our goal is simple. We want to provide testing options for both recreational and medicinal marijuana. By taking all the correct steps and being proactive, the team is moving forward, accordingly.” In fact, the company is looking to open laboratories in other states, which can only mean another step would be taken toward making cannabis safe for people all over the country, whether used for recreational and/or medicinal reasons.
