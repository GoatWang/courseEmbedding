An Interview with Virginia P. Ruesterholz, President, Verizon Telecom


Editors’ Note  Virginia Ruesterholz joined New York Telephone as a manager in 1984. After the Bell Atlantic/NYNEX merger, Ruesterholz was named Vice President – Complex Installation and Maintenance for Network Services and, later, Vice President – Operations Assurance. After the Bell Atlantic/GTE merger, Ruesterholz was named Senior Vice President of Wholesale Markets, and she most recently served as President of Verizon Partner Solutions. She will begin serving as President of Verizon Services Corp. on January 1, 2009. Ruesterholz is a recipient of the prestigious Crain’s New York Business 40 Under 40 award and the inaugural New York Women’s Agenda Rising Star award. She is a member of the board of trustees at Stevens Institute of Technology and is a director of the Manhattan Theatre Club. Ruesterholz graduated from Stevens Institute of Technology with a degree in chemical engineering in 1983. She earned an M.S. in telecommunications management from Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in 1991.
Company Brief
 Verizon Telecom (www.verizon.com) offers voice, data, and video services to consumers, small and medium-sized businesses, and wholesale customers in 25 states and Washington, D.C. Verizon Telecom is deploying the nation’s most ambitious fiber optics project, offering Verizon FiOS (fiber optic services) voice, data, and video services over a single high-speed connection. Verizon Telecom is the only major telecom company installing fiber-optic lines directly to customers’ homes and to businesses across the country.
How would you categorize Verizon Telecom, after years of considerable change in the telecommunications industry?
Verizon Telecom, which is a business group of Verizon Communications, is a $30 billion broadband and entertainment company with over 100,000 employees. We provide communications services to consumer and small business customers in 25 states, as well as wholesale services to other communications carriers. Verizon is not your father’s phone company. We’ve spent the better part of the past decade transforming our company to grow and compete in the digital era. We believe that having the best network is key to being the best communications company, so we continue to differentiate our business through network quality.
In today’s challenging economic environment, what is your outlook for growth for Verizon Telecom, and where do you foresee that growth coming from?
Even in today’s challenging environment, customer demand is still the driving force in the communications and entertainment markets. With both the Internet and TV services, customers want more choice and more control over their digital experiences. We’ve seen our customers move from being passive consumers of information to being active participants in the creative process, using more social media and other two-way services. Specifically, they’re looking for faster Internet connections and more high-definition [HD] video than their current providers are able to deliver.
As the Internet continues to evolve, from basic e-mail and Web surfing into a dynamic, two-way interactive digital experience, we see a whole host of bandwidth-intensive services on the horizon. These include 3-D gaming, high-definition social networks, as well as the growth of broadband applications like telework, medical monitoring, distance learning, smart buildings and so much more. Our future growth will come from having the best network technology for these and other advanced digital applications.
Verizon Telecom is deploying high-speed fiber-optic technology, known as FiOS. Would you provide an overview of this technology?
Verizon is the only company delivering fiber-optic technology all the way to customers’ homes on a mass scale. The immense bandwidth of a direct fiber connection allows us to offer the fastest broadband speeds of any Internet provider. When it comes to TV, we can deliver high-definition signals to customers without compressing the content, like some cable providers do, which results in stunning picture and sound quality that customers remark on time and again. Our network also has the capacity to deliver a wide range of programming choices, including more HD, more video on demand, and more program diversity.
Our fiber network is also “future proof,” which means that we can easily upgrade to provide additional bandwidth as our customers’ needs evolve. So as Internet sites offer higher bandwidth applications and networks make more HD channels available, Verizon is well positioned to provide those advanced digital services that our customers will require. Verizon’s FiOS network currently passes 12 million homes, and we’re expanding at a rate of three million homes passed a year.
What has made Verizon Telecom such a leader in network innovations?
Meeting the needs of information-age customers requires physical and intellectual assets that only a handful of companies can deliver, and Verizon happens to be one of those companies. Our fiber-optic network is a huge competitive advantage, and we’ve devoted years of intellectual and financial capital to delivering a superior experience to our customers.
The commitment to innovation and investment in our network has been crucial to our growth and has made Verizon a leader in delivering the speed and capacity needed in today’s digital world. The superiority of our fiber network surpasses other commercial broadband and video technologies, and it will continue to support our growth.
Is this industry, and Verizon in particular, attracting women?
I believe we are attracting women. Can we do more? No doubt. Women make up almost half of the available U.S. labor pool, and Verizon employs close to that percentage. In addition, we’ve been recognized consistently for being a best place to work for women, including being honored by Working Mother magazine as a best place for working mothers, as well as by the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council as one of the top American corporations for women’s business enterprises.

Frontier Communications Elects Virginia P. Ruesterholz to Board of Directors

 STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Frontier Communications Corporation (NASDAQ: FTR) today announced the

      election of Virginia P. Ruesterholz, former President of Verizon

      Services Operations, to its Board of Directors. Ms. Ruesterholz will

      serve on the Board's Compensation Committee and its Retirement Plan

      Committee.

    


      "Virginia Ruesterholz had a leading role in developing Verizon's

      network, technology and growth strategies. Her in-depth knowledge of

      communications — wireline, IP, video and more — and expertise in all

      aspects of operations and customer and vendor support -- will help

      Frontier enhance shareholder and customer value," said Maggie

      Wilderotter, Chairman and CEO of Frontier.

    

Howard L. Schrott, Lead Director of the Frontier Board, added, "As a

      veteran of a Dow 30 company focused on innovation and traditional and

      nontraditional growth, operational and technical excellence and

      multichannel strategies, Virginia will be a valued member of our Board."

    


      In July 2012, Ms. Ruesterholz retired as Executive Vice President of

      Verizon Communications where she was responsible for overseeing key

      strategic initiatives. She previously served as President of Verizon

      Services Operations, a $10 billion global business unit of 25,000

      employees that operates the company's wireline networks and shared

      service operations. As President, she accelerated Verizon's

      sustainability practices, positioning it as a green leader and award

      winner for sustainability achievements. At the same time, her efficiency

      and productivity initiatives drove wireline margin growth and achieved

      significant gains in operational efficiencies and cost management.

    


      Earlier, as President of Verizon Telecom, she was responsible for sales,

      customer service, operations and IT for domestic consumer, general

      business and wholesale markets and drove the rollout of FiOS. As

      President of Verizon Partner Solutions, she oversaw the company's

      wholesale customers and enterprise business accounts. Other senior

      positions held by Ms. Ruesterholz include President of Verizon Wholesale

      Markets and roles in regional operations and operations assurance.

    


      A graduate of Stevens Institute of Technology with a Bachelor's degree

      in Chemical Engineering, Ms. Ruesterholz earned a Master's of Science

      degree in Telecommunications Management from the Polytechnic Institute

      of Brooklyn (now the Polytechnic Institute of New York University). She

      received an Honorary Doctorate of Engineering from Stevens Institute of

      Technology and is currently Chairman of its Board of Trustees. Ms.

      Ruesterholz also serves on the Board of Directors for The Hartford, a

      leader in property and casualty insurance, group benefits and mutual

      funds.

We want others to have the journey we had.” Meet Virginia and Kevin Ruesterholz, Sponsors of the Ruesterholz Admissions Center Stevens will always have a special place in the lives of Virginia and Kevin Ruesterholz, who met on campus while they were students.“We love this place,” Virginia said. “It’s given us so much, and we want to give back. We want others to have the journey we had.”“We graduated from here, and I was lucky enough to meet my best friend and my partner for life here,” Kevin added. “So to come back and give to Stevens makes us very happy and very proud.”A Welcoming Environment for Prospective Students and FamiliesThanks to their generosity, Virginia and Kevin Ruesterholz will always have a special place in the future of Stevens. Together they sponsored the new Ruesterholz Admissions Center, which is helping Stevens recruit talented students and propelling the Power of Stevens goal of creating a Vibrant Campus.“We sincerely hope the new Ruesterholz Admissions Center is a valuable asset to university admissions and makes a positive impression on prospective students far into the future,” Virginia said. “Our goal was to have an admissions center here where students can come and feel the real beauty of Stevens – the views of New York City and the feeling of standing on top of the world here at Castle Point, as well as the history and charm of the university.”Virginia, who retired from Verizon in 2012 as Executive Vice President and President of Verizon Service Operations, has served as Chair of the Stevens Board of Trustees since 2013, the first woman to hold that leadership position. Kevin, who has worked for AT&T and Lucent Technologies, practices as an attorney with Ruesterholz Law in Morristown, New Jersey, and has served as Co-Chair of the Edwin A.

He added that the new admissions center is an important ingredient in a strategic plan to expand and grow the university. Raising a glass of champagne, he made a toast to Virginia and Kevin, thanking them for their extraordinary generosity.

Hoboken, N.J. – Virginia P. Ruesterholz, a longtime executive at Verizon and a 1983 graduate of Stevens Institute of Technology, has been elected chairman of the Board of Trustees of her alma mater.  Ruesterholz will be the first woman to hold the position of chairman at the 143- year old institution.  Her term will begin in May.
Ruesterholz, a chemical engineering major while an undergraduate at Stevens, holds an M.S. in telecommunications management from Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute and an honorary doctorate of engineering from Stevens (2008).  She has served on the Board of Trustees since 2007 and currently serves as vice chair. Her contributions to Stevens over the decades have included serving as chair of the advisory board of the School of Systems and Enterprises; co-chair, with her spouse, Kevin, of the Edwin A. Stevens Society, where she led the dynamic membership growth of this leadership society for annual giving to Stevens; and championing an initiative which led to the Verizon Foundation’s sponsorship of a grant to launch Stevens’ K-12 engineering education initiative.  With her spouse, she has also established a scholarship fund for Stevens students in the field of engineering management.
“Virginia has already had an immeasurable impact on the Stevens community,” said President Nariman Farvardin.  “A role as Chairman of the Stevens Board of Trustees is a natural progression given Virginia’s stellar track record of enterprise management and her unwavering commitment to this university.  She is simply the right person for this important position to guide the continued success of Stevens.”
Ruesterholz had a nearly 30-year career at Verizon before retiring in 2012.  She began her career as a manager in one of the company’s predecessors and rose to executive vice president and president of Verizon Services Operations, a global business group that operates Verizon's wireline network as well as the finance operations, real estate, and supply chain services that support all Verizon companies.  In her prior assignment, she served as president of Verizon Telecom, where she led the rollout of Verizon’s high speed fiber optic technology nationwide.
“Now more than ever, the world is calling on innovators and entrepreneurs to address society’s most pressing challenges and drive economic growth.  This is Stevens’ particular forte.  I plan to continue the direction of the current board and Chairman Babbio, working closely with President Farvardin, to expand Stevens’ already significant footprint and impact regionally, nationally and globally,” Ruesterholz said.
Ruesterholz assumes the chairmanship at a time when Stevens is accelerating its own efforts to address the historic gender gap in science, math and engineering.  The university’s 10-year strategic plan lists as an objective an increase in student diversity, including raising the percentage of women in its undergraduate population to at least 40 percent by 2022.  The Fall 2012 incoming class was 31 percent female, well above the national average, and a seven-point increase over just a year prior.  According to the American Society of Engineering Education, Stevens is fifth in the nation in the percentage of engineering doctoral degrees awarded to women (34 percent).
Ruesterholz succeeds Lawrence T. Babbio, former vice chairman and president of Verizon, whose term limit as Board chair ends in May after having served as Chairman of the Board since October 1997.
“I have worked closely with Virginia at Verizon and as a Trustee at Stevens and am delighted that she has accepted this responsibility,” said Babbio.  “I wholeheartedly endorse her assuming this important role as Chairman of the Stevens Board of Trustees.  Virginia’s intellect, leadership, business acumen, and her deep affection for Stevens combine to ensure that the university will continue its ascent in the next decade to meet and exceed the goals of the Strategic Plan.”
Verizon colleague and Stevens alumna Annmarie Rizzo added, “I cannot think of a more deserving person than Virginia to be appointed as Chairman of the Board of Trustees at Stevens.  Her competence and vision will surely propel Stevens to new heights. I have known Virginia for many years and am thrilled for her.  Stevens will thrive under her leadership!”
