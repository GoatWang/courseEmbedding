History[edit]
The company has grown rapidly since its founding in June 1997, thanks in part to its investment in search engine technology[5] and massively multiplayer online role-playing gaming. Fantasy Westward Journey, an MMORPG developed internally by NetEase, is an online game in China.
Ding Lei (Chinese: 丁磊; pinyin: Dīng Lěi, born October 1971), also known as William Ding, is the founder and CEO of NetEase. He made significant contributions to the development of computer networks in mainland China. According to Hurun Report's China Rich List 2013 he is the 25th wealthiest person in China with an estimated fortune of $4.2 billion. He was the wealthiest man in China at one point.

2004: NetEase's founder and chief architect William Ding (Ding Lei) won the Wharton Infosys Business Transformation Award for his innovative use of information technology. Ding became one of the wealthiest individuals in China after founding NetEase.

2008: The 163.com domain attracted at least 1.8 million visitors annually by 2008 according to a Compete.com survey.[6]
2010: The site was the 28th most visited site in the world according to Alexa's internet rankings[7] and in August 2010, the site was the 27th most visited site drawing more traffic than the websites of AOL, BBC, Flickr, Craigslist, Apple, CNN, LinkedIn, Adobe, CNet, ESPN.
2012: The company's official English name was changed from NetEase.com, Inc to NetEase, Inc.[8] In April 2012, NetEase began testing a restaurant recommendation mobile app called "Fan Fan".[9][10] The company collaborated with coursera.org to provide Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) in China.[11]
2017: NetEase makes an agreement with the American company Marvel Comics to develop a comic based off a Chinese superhero, in addition 12 comic copies by Marvel will be released online such as The Amazing Spider-Man, Captain America, and Guardians of the Galaxy.

Expansion[edit]
NetEase launched their first Western Headquarters in August 2014 bringing one of the largest tech companies in China to the US.[16] In 2015, NetEase North America, the San Francisco-based arm of the Chinese technology giant, announced a new funding initiative for independent developers. Known as the NetEase Success Fund, the scheme offers an alternative to traditional publishing by providing up to $500,000 for each accepted developer to fund marketing and advertising. Furthermore, developers awarded funding retain the rights, creative control, and full ownership of their products. In December 2015, NetEase Capital Venture arm has made a $2.5 million investment into Reforged Studios, a privately held game studio based in Helsinki.
Music streaming service[edit]
Main article: NetEase Music
NetEase has an on-demand music-streaming service; 网易云音乐 (roughly "NetEase cloud music").[17]
Significance of the number 163[edit]
NetEase's URL is 163.com. This is confusing to many non-Chinese because there seems to be no logical connection between the firm and its URL. While the URL might seem to be a case of Chinese numerology, it is not. Rather, the URL exists because of recent Chinese history: before the availability of broadband internet, users had to dial 163 to get online.[18] Therefore, early internet users recognized the numbers as implying a way to access the internet.

Expansion[edit]
NetEase launched their first Western Headquarters in August 2014 bringing one of the largest tech companies in China to the US.[16] In 2015, NetEase North America, the San Francisco-based arm of the Chinese technology giant, announced a new funding initiative for independent developers. Known as the NetEase Success Fund, the scheme offers an alternative to traditional publishing by providing up to $500,000 for each accepted developer to fund marketing and advertising. Furthermore, developers awarded funding retain the rights, creative control, and full ownership of their products. In December 2015, NetEase Capital Venture arm has made a $2.5 million investment into Reforged Studios, a privately held game studio based in Helsinki.
Music streaming service[edit]
Main article: NetEase Music
NetEase has an on-demand music-streaming service; 网易云音乐 (roughly "NetEase cloud music").[17]
Significance of the number 163[edit]
NetEase's URL is 163.com. This is confusing to many non-Chinese because there seems to be no logical connection between the firm and its URL. While the URL might seem to be a case of Chinese numerology, it is not. Rather, the URL exists because of recent Chinese history: before the availability of broadband internet, users had to dial 163 to get online.[18] Therefore, early internet users recognized the numbers as implying a way to access the internet.

He made significant contributions to the development of computer networks in mainland China.

2012: The company's official English name was changed from NetEase.com, Inc to NetEase, Inc.[8] In April 2012, NetEase began testing a restaurant recommendation mobile app called "Fan Fan".[9][10] The company collaborated with coursera.org to provide Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) in China.[11]

Expansion[edit]
NetEase launched their first Western Headquarters in August 2014 bringing one of the largest tech companies in China to the US.[16] In 2015, NetEase North America, the San Francisco-based arm of the Chinese technology giant, announced a new funding initiative for independent developers. Known as the NetEase Success Fund, the scheme offers an alternative to traditional publishing by providing up to $500,000 for each accepted developer to fund marketing and advertising. Furthermore, developers awarded funding retain the rights, creative control, and full ownership of their products. In December 2015, NetEase Capital Venture arm has made a $2.5 million investment into Reforged Studios, a privately held game studio based in Helsinki.
Music streaming service[edit]
Main article: NetEase Music
NetEase has an on-demand music-streaming service; 网易云音乐 (roughly "NetEase cloud music").[17]
Significance of the number 163[edit]
NetEase's URL is 163.com. This is confusing to many non-Chinese because there seems to be no logical connection between the firm and its URL. While the URL might seem to be a case of Chinese numerology, it is not. Rather, the URL exists because of recent Chinese history: before the availability of broadband internet, users had to dial 163 to get online.[18] Therefore, early internet users recognized the numbers as implying a way to access the internet.

History[edit]
The company has grown rapidly since its founding in June 1997, thanks in part to its investment in search engine technology[5] and massively multiplayer online role-playing gaming. Fantasy Westward Journey, an MMORPG developed internally by NetEase, is an online game in China.
Ding Lei (Chinese: 丁磊; pinyin: Dīng Lěi, born October 1971), also known as William Ding, is the founder and CEO of NetEase. He made significant contributions to the development of computer networks in mainland China. According to Hurun Report's China Rich List 2013 he is the 25th wealthiest person in China with an estimated fortune of $4.2 billion. He was the wealthiest man in China at one point.

2004: NetEase's founder and chief architect William Ding (Ding Lei) won the Wharton Infosys Business Transformation Award for his innovative use of information technology. Ding became one of the wealthiest individuals in China after founding NetEase.

2008: The 163.com domain attracted at least 1.8 million visitors annually by 2008 according to a Compete.com survey.[6]
2010: The site was the 28th most visited site in the world according to Alexa's internet rankings[7] and in August 2010, the site was the 27th most visited site drawing more traffic than the websites of AOL, BBC, Flickr, Craigslist, Apple, CNN, LinkedIn, Adobe, CNet, ESPN.
2012: The company's official English name was changed from NetEase.com, Inc to NetEase, Inc.[8] In April 2012, NetEase began testing a restaurant recommendation mobile app called "Fan Fan".[9][10] The company collaborated with coursera.org to provide Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) in China.[11]
2017: NetEase makes an agreement with the American company Marvel Comics to develop a comic based off a Chinese superhero, in addition 12 comic copies by Marvel will be released online such as The Amazing Spider-Man, Captain America, and Guardians of the Galaxy.

Expansion[edit]
NetEase launched their first Western Headquarters in August 2014 bringing one of the largest tech companies in China to the US.[16] In 2015, NetEase North America, the San Francisco-based arm of the Chinese technology giant, announced a new funding initiative for independent developers. Known as the NetEase Success Fund, the scheme offers an alternative to traditional publishing by providing up to $500,000 for each accepted developer to fund marketing and advertising. Furthermore, developers awarded funding retain the rights, creative control, and full ownership of their products. In December 2015, NetEase Capital Venture arm has made a $2.5 million investment into Reforged Studios, a privately held game studio based in Helsinki.
Music streaming service[edit]
Main article: NetEase Music
NetEase has an on-demand music-streaming service; 网易云音乐 (roughly "NetEase cloud music").[17]
Significance of the number 163[edit]
NetEase's URL is 163.com. This is confusing to many non-Chinese because there seems to be no logical connection between the firm and its URL. While the URL might seem to be a case of Chinese numerology, it is not. Rather, the URL exists because of recent Chinese history: before the availability of broadband internet, users had to dial 163 to get online.[18] Therefore, early internet users recognized the numbers as implying a way to access the internet.

Why NetEase Inc. Stock Popped Today
The Chinese internet products specialist jumped after a strong quarterly report.











                Steve Symington
            

                (TMFSymington)

What happened
Shares of NetEase Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES) were up 12.1% as of 11:30 a.m. EST Thursday after the Chinese internet technology company announced strong fourth-quarter 2016 results.
So what
Quarterly revenue climbed 53.1% year over year, to 12.099 billion Chinese renminbi (RMB), or roughly $1.7426 billion, which translated to adjusted net income of RMB 4.0 billion, or $569.9 million. Adjusted net income was $4.30 per diluted American depositary share (ADS), up from $2.56 in the same year-ago period. By contrast, analysts' consensus estimates called for fourth-quarter revenue of just $1.58 billion and adjusted earnings of $3.44 per ADS.
According to CEO William Ding:

Our focus on innovation and quality has served us well, enabling NetEase to create significant value for each of our major constituencies: our players, our partners and our shareholders. In 2016, we brought best-in-class products and services to our community and continued to grow our business. As we move through 2017 we will look toward the future, designing products and services that address fluid market dynamics, enabling continued growth and value creation.


IMAGE SOURCE: NETEASE. 






Now what
In the end, these results were far above the heady growth even the most optimistic investors were expecting, so it's unsurprising to see NetEase stock hitting new highs today. If NetEase can sustain this momentum in the coming year, and as Wall Street mulls its relative outperformance, I won't be surprised to see shares continue to rise going forward.

NetEase: A Chinese Company With A Great Portfolio - NetEase, Inc (NASDAQ:NTES) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»NetEase: A Chinese Company With A Great PortfolioSep.17.15 | About: NetEase, Inc (NTES) Bohdan Kucheriavyi Small-cap, research analyst, momentumSummaryOver the years, NetEase proved that it can be a strong player in the internet and entertainment businesses.Its portfolio of products and services represents great value for long-term investors.Recent success in the mobile gaming sphere will only increase shareholder value in a rising mobile market.Its stock buyback program and dividend policy are only increasing the attractiveness of the company.Because of the global uncertainty and the recent financial situation in China, NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) stock along with other public companies took a huge fall. However, this opens a great opportunity for value investors that are interested in having a trusted Chinese company in its portfolio. Over the years, NetEase proved that it can be a strong player in the internet and entertainment businesses and rewarded those who are willing to wait. The company's main advantage in this kind of market is its portfolio of products and services that I believe represent a great value for long-term investors.
Portfolio
NetEase has a diversified line of products from different business sectors in its portfolio. This is the company's main advantage against its competitors and different market meltdowns.
First, there are PC and mobile games where NetEase develops and provides online gaming clients and quality smartphone games for users in China. It has six self-developed online games in its portfolio, one of which is Fantasy Westward Journey that surpassed a mark of 300 million registered users since its launch and had a record of 2.71 million people playing at the same time. To keep its customers engaged with the content and to grow its audience, NetEase frequently releases different kinds of expansion packs and helps its titles to stay popular.
NetEase also licenses and publishes popular game titles of well-known giants in the industry like Blizzard Entertainment (NASDAQ:ATVI). It has a license to distribute and manage franchises like World of Warcraft, Diablo and StarCraft in China.
In the last few quarters, the company saw a rising trend in revenues of its online games:


(Source: Q2 2015 Investor Presentation)
NetEase also launched more than 35 self-developed and licensed mobile games. Its game Fantasy Westward Journey was released at the end of March and quickly seized the No. 1 spot in the China iOS app store's top grossing chart and the fourth highest-grossing mobile game in the world.
With its mobile success, NetEase put itself on a map of big players in the industry and will only benefit from the rise of the Chinese mobile gaming market:

At the same time, NetEase has Internet media businesses in its portfolio. It controls a number of websites and mobile apps in different areas like Entertainment and Education. Those platforms provide a massive interactive marketing platform for advertisers.
In the last quarter, there was a big rise of revenue from its advertising services:

(Source: Q2 2015 Investor Presentation)
NetEase also operates in the e-commerce and e-mail services fields. The company heavily invested in its cross-platform commerce site Kaola.com. The platform offers its customers a wide range of products such as baby products, beauty and personal care products and health foods. To strengthen its position in this field and compete with giants such as Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), at the beginning of this year, NetEase formed a strategic partnership with one of China's largest logistic companies Sinotrans Limited (598.HK) and is planning to establish a Tokyo office to sell its goods in Japan.

NetEase also is a large Chinese e-mail service provider with more than 790 million registered users.
In the last few quarters, there was a remarkable growth in revenue from its e-mail and e-commerce services:

(Source: Q2 2015 Investor Presentation)
Conclusion
Over the years, NetEase successfully adapted to a rapidly changing market environment and proved that it can be a strong player in different business segments. Its stock along with other public companies took a hit in the last few weeks:

(Source: Bloomberg)
However, I believe that this represents a great opportunity for long-term investors that are interested in Chinese companies.
The company has strong R&D capabilities that enable them to offer a number of upgrades and expansion packs for its products. The long-term partnership with well-known companies in the gaming industry is driving growth in revenue, and recent success in the mobile gaming sphere will only increase shareholder value in a rising mobile market.
To secure trust from its investors, at the beginning of September, NetEase's board of directors approved a $500 million stock buyback program and paid a dividend of $0.44 per share for the second quarter of 2015. These actions will only increase the attractiveness of the company and you might want to take a closer look at it.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

History[edit]
The company has grown rapidly since its founding in June 1997, thanks in part to its investment in search engine technology[5] and massively multiplayer online role-playing gaming. Fantasy Westward Journey, an MMORPG developed internally by NetEase, is an online game in China.

He made significant contributions to the development of computer networks in mainland China. According to Hurun Report's China Rich List 2013 he is the 25th wealthiest person in China with an estimated fortune of $4.2 billion. He was the wealthiest man in China at one point.

2012: The company's official English name was changed from NetEase.com, Inc to NetEase, Inc.[8] In April 2012, NetEase began testing a restaurant recommendation mobile app called "Fan Fan".[9][10] The company collaborated with coursera.org to provide Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) in China.[11]
2017: NetEase makes an agreement with the American company Marvel Comics to develop a comic based off a Chinese superhero, in addition 12 comic copies by Marvel will be released online such as The Amazing Spider-Man, Captain America, and Guardians of the Galaxy.

Expansion[edit]
NetEase launched their first Western Headquarters in August 2014 bringing one of the largest tech companies in China to the US.[16] In 2015, NetEase North America, the San Francisco-based arm of the Chinese technology giant, announced a new funding initiative for independent developers. Known as the NetEase Success Fund, the scheme offers an alternative to traditional publishing by providing up to $500,000 for each accepted developer to fund marketing and advertising. Furthermore, developers awarded funding retain the rights, creative control, and full ownership of their products. In December 2015, NetEase Capital Venture arm has made a $2.5 million investment into Reforged Studios, a privately held game studio based in Helsinki.
Music streaming service[edit]
Main article: NetEase Music
NetEase has an on-demand music-streaming service; 网易云音乐 (roughly "NetEase cloud music").[17]
Significance of the number 163[edit]
NetEase's URL is 163.com. This is confusing to many non-Chinese because there seems to be no logical connection between the firm and its URL. While the URL might seem to be a case of Chinese numerology, it is not. Rather, the URL exists because of recent Chinese history: before the availability of broadband internet, users had to dial 163 to get online.[18] Therefore, early internet users recognized the numbers as implying a way to access the internet.

History[edit]
The company has grown rapidly since its founding in June 1997, thanks in part to its investment in search engine technology[5] and massively multiplayer online role-playing gaming. Fantasy Westward Journey, an MMORPG developed internally by NetEase, is an online game in China.
Ding Lei (Chinese: 丁磊; pinyin: Dīng Lěi, born October 1971), also known as William Ding, is the founder and CEO of NetEase. He made significant contributions to the development of computer networks in mainland China. According to Hurun Report's China Rich List 2013 he is the 25th wealthiest person in China with an estimated fortune of $4.2 billion. He was the wealthiest man in China at one point.

2004: NetEase's founder and chief architect William Ding (Ding Lei) won the Wharton Infosys Business Transformation Award for his innovative use of information technology. Ding became one of the wealthiest individuals in China after founding NetEase.

2008: The 163.com domain attracted at least 1.8 million visitors annually by 2008 according to a Compete.com survey.[6]
2010: The site was the 28th most visited site in the world according to Alexa's internet rankings[7] and in August 2010, the site was the 27th most visited site drawing more traffic than the websites of AOL, BBC, Flickr, Craigslist, Apple, CNN, LinkedIn, Adobe, CNet, ESPN.
2012: The company's official English name was changed from NetEase.com, Inc to NetEase, Inc.[8] In April 2012, NetEase began testing a restaurant recommendation mobile app called "Fan Fan".[9][10] The company collaborated with coursera.org to provide Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) in China.[11]
2017: NetEase makes an agreement with the American company Marvel Comics to develop a comic based off a Chinese superhero, in addition 12 comic copies by Marvel will be released online such as The Amazing Spider-Man, Captain America, and Guardians of the Galaxy.

Expansion[edit]
NetEase launched their first Western Headquarters in August 2014 bringing one of the largest tech companies in China to the US.[16] In 2015, NetEase North America, the San Francisco-based arm of the Chinese technology giant, announced a new funding initiative for independent developers. Known as the NetEase Success Fund, the scheme offers an alternative to traditional publishing by providing up to $500,000 for each accepted developer to fund marketing and advertising. Furthermore, developers awarded funding retain the rights, creative control, and full ownership of their products. In December 2015, NetEase Capital Venture arm has made a $2.5 million investment into Reforged Studios, a privately held game studio based in Helsinki.
Music streaming service[edit]
Main article: NetEase Music
NetEase has an on-demand music-streaming service; 网易云音乐 (roughly "NetEase cloud music").[17]
Significance of the number 163[edit]
NetEase's URL is 163.com. This is confusing to many non-Chinese because there seems to be no logical connection between the firm and its URL. While the URL might seem to be a case of Chinese numerology, it is not. Rather, the URL exists because of recent Chinese history: before the availability of broadband internet, users had to dial 163 to get online.[18] Therefore, early internet users recognized the numbers as implying a way to access the internet.

The company has grown rapidly since its founding in June 1997, thanks in part to its investment in search engine technology[5] and massively multiplayer online role-playing gaming. Fantasy Westward Journey, an MMORPG developed internally by NetEase, is an online game in China.
Ding Lei (Chinese: 丁磊; pinyin: Dīng Lěi, born October 1971), also known as William Ding, is the founder and CEO of NetEase. He made significant contributions to the development of computer networks in mainland China. According to Hurun Report's China Rich List 2013 he is the 25th wealthiest person in China with an estimated fortune of $4.2 billion. He was the wealthiest man in China at one point.

2004: NetEase's founder and chief architect William Ding (Ding Lei) won the Wharton Infosys Business Transformation Award for his innovative use of information technology. Ding became one of the wealthiest individuals in China after founding NetEase.

2008: The 163.com domain attracted at least 1.8 million visitors annually by 2008 according to a Compete.com survey.[6]
2010: The site was the 28th most visited site in the world according to Alexa's internet rankings[7] and in August 2010, the site was the 27th most visited site drawing more traffic than the websites of AOL, BBC, Flickr, Craigslist, Apple, CNN, LinkedIn, Adobe, CNet, ESPN.
2012: The company's official English name was changed from NetEase.com, Inc to NetEase, Inc.[8] In April 2012, NetEase began testing a restaurant recommendation mobile app called "Fan Fan".[9][10] The company collaborated with coursera.org to provide Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) in China.[11]
2017: NetEase makes an agreement with the American company Marvel Comics to develop a comic based off a Chinese superhero, in addition 12 comic copies by Marvel will be released online such as The Amazing Spider-Man, Captain America, and Guardians of the Galaxy.

Expansion[edit]
NetEase launched their first Western Headquarters in August 2014 bringing one of the largest tech companies in China to the US.[16] In 2015, NetEase North America, the San Francisco-based arm of the Chinese technology giant, announced a new funding initiative for independent developers. Known as the NetEase Success Fund, the scheme offers an alternative to traditional publishing by providing up to $500,000 for each accepted developer to fund marketing and advertising. Furthermore, developers awarded funding retain the rights, creative control, and full ownership of their products. In December 2015, NetEase Capital Venture arm has made a $2.5 million investment into Reforged Studios, a privately held game studio based in Helsinki.
Music streaming service[edit]
Main article: NetEase Music
NetEase has an on-demand music-streaming service; 网易云音乐 (roughly "NetEase cloud music").[17]
Significance of the number 163[edit]
NetEase's URL is 163.com. This is confusing to many non-Chinese because there seems to be no logical connection between the firm and its URL. While the URL might seem to be a case of Chinese numerology, it is not. Rather, the URL exists because of recent Chinese history: before the availability of broadband internet, users had to dial 163 to get online.[18] Therefore, early internet users recognized the numbers as implying a way to access the internet.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
