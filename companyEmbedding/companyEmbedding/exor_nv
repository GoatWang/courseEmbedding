History[edit]
In 1957 IFI acquired control of Istituto Commerciale Laniero Italiano, which conducted activities in the financial field, particularly in the textile and wool sector. In 1963 it extended its operations to the banking system and changed its name to Istituto Bancario Italiano Laniero. Three years later, having spun off the banking business to Banca Subalpina, the company became Istituto Finanziario Italiano Laniero (IFIL), playing a parallel role to that of IFI and conducting similar investment management activities.
IFI gained holdings in numerous firms over the decades, including Unicem and 3M, many of which have since been divested. IFI listed preference shares on the Borsa Italiana in 1968. A reorganisation of the Agnelli family's holdings in 2008 led to the merger of IFI and IFIL to create Exor, the new name being taken from the French company (then the majority owner of Perrier water and the Château Margaux estate) which it acquired in 1991.[5]
The family firm Giovanni Agnelli B.V. owns 52.99% of the share capital.
Exor is ranked 19th largest company by revenue according to the 2015 and 2016 Fortune Global 500 lists.[3]
Mergers, shares and acquisitions[edit]
PartnerRe[edit]
In 2015 Exor bought PartnerRe with a bid of $140 per share (total $6.9 billions).[6] Originally it had offered $130 per share and in response Axis Re offered $120.31 per share in paper plus $11.50 in a pre-closing dividend.[7]
The Economist[edit]
On August 12, 2015, the editor announced that Exor will purchase three-fifths of the Economist Group shares currently owned by Pearson PLC.[8] Exor held shares in the Economist Group prior to this purchase.[8] This is considered to be the "most important change to The Economist's shareholding structure in almost 90 years."[8] Pearson PLC which also owns the Financial Times has had a non-controlling 50% stake in the Economist Group since 1928. The Economist Group will buy back the remained two-fifths of Pearson shares.[9][8]
Cushman & Wakefield[edit]
On September 2, 2015 Exor closed the sale of Cushman & Wakefield to Chicago-based DTZ for $1,28 billion in net, generating a capital gain of $722 million for the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family.[10]

A reorganisation of the Agnelli family's holdings in 2008 led to the merger of IFI and IFIL to create Exor, the new name being taken from the French company (then the majority owner of Perrier water and the Château Margaux estate) which it acquired in 1991.[5]
The family firm Giovanni Agnelli B.V. owns 52.99% of the share capital.
Exor is ranked 19th largest company by revenue according to the 2015 and 2016 Fortune Global 500 lists.[3]
Mergers, shares and acquisitions[edit]
PartnerRe[edit]
In 2015 Exor bought PartnerRe with a bid of $140 per share (total $6.9 billions).[6] Originally it had offered $130 per share and in response Axis Re offered $120.31 per share in paper plus $11.50 in a pre-closing dividend.[7]
The Economist[edit]
On August 12, 2015, the editor announced that Exor will purchase three-fifths of the Economist Group shares currently owned by Pearson PLC.[8] Exor held shares in the Economist Group prior to this purchase.[8] This is considered to be the "most important change to The Economist's shareholding structure in almost 90 years."[8] Pearson PLC which also owns the Financial Times has had a non-controlling 50% stake in the Economist Group since 1928. The Economist Group will buy back the remained two-fifths of Pearson shares.[9][8]
Cushman & Wakefield[edit]
On September 2, 2015 Exor closed the sale of Cushman & Wakefield to Chicago-based DTZ for $1,28 billion in net, generating a capital gain of $722 million for the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family.[10]

History[edit]
In 1957 IFI acquired control of Istituto Commerciale Laniero Italiano, which conducted activities in the financial field, particularly in the textile and wool sector. In 1963 it extended its operations to the banking system and changed its name to Istituto Bancario Italiano Laniero. Three years later, having spun off the banking business to Banca Subalpina, the company became Istituto Finanziario Italiano Laniero (IFIL), playing a parallel role to that of IFI and conducting similar investment management activities.
IFI gained holdings in numerous firms over the decades, including Unicem and 3M, many of which have since been divested. IFI listed preference shares on the Borsa Italiana in 1968. A reorganisation of the Agnelli family's holdings in 2008 led to the merger of IFI and IFIL to create Exor, the new name being taken from the French company (then the majority owner of Perrier water and the Château Margaux estate) which it acquired in 1991.[5]
The family firm Giovanni Agnelli B.V. owns 52.99% of the share capital.
Exor is ranked 19th largest company by revenue according to the 2015 and 2016 Fortune Global 500 lists.[3]

History[edit]
In 1957 IFI acquired control of Istituto Commerciale Laniero Italiano, which conducted activities in the financial field, particularly in the textile and wool sector. In 1963 it extended its operations to the banking system and changed its name to Istituto Bancario Italiano Laniero. Three years later, having spun off the banking business to Banca Subalpina, the company became Istituto Finanziario Italiano Laniero (IFIL), playing a parallel role to that of IFI and conducting similar investment management activities.
IFI gained holdings in numerous firms over the decades, including Unicem and 3M, many of which have since been divested. IFI listed preference shares on the Borsa Italiana in 1968. A reorganisation of the Agnelli family's holdings in 2008 led to the merger of IFI and IFIL to create Exor, the new name being taken from the French company (then the majority owner of Perrier water and the Château Margaux estate) which it acquired in 1991.[5]
The family firm Giovanni Agnelli B.V. owns 52.99% of the share capital.
Exor is ranked 19th largest company by revenue according to the 2015 and 2016 Fortune Global 500 lists.[3]
Mergers, shares and acquisitions[edit]
PartnerRe[edit]
In 2015 Exor bought PartnerRe with a bid of $140 per share (total $6.9 billions).[6] Originally it had offered $130 per share and in response Axis Re offered $120.31 per share in paper plus $11.50 in a pre-closing dividend.[7]
The Economist[edit]
On August 12, 2015, the editor announced that Exor will purchase three-fifths of the Economist Group shares currently owned by Pearson PLC.[8] Exor held shares in the Economist Group prior to this purchase.[8] This is considered to be the "most important change to The Economist's shareholding structure in almost 90 years."[8] Pearson PLC which also owns the Financial Times has had a non-controlling 50% stake in the Economist Group since 1928. The Economist Group will buy back the remained two-fifths of Pearson shares.[9][8]
Cushman & Wakefield[edit]
On September 2, 2015 Exor closed the sale of Cushman & Wakefield to Chicago-based DTZ for $1,28 billion in net, generating a capital gain of $722 million for the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family.[10]
Board of Directors[edit]
