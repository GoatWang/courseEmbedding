Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement.

What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Product Description
Mark Wolfinger – Create Your Own Hedge Fund

 
Discover a practical trading strategy that combines options and ETFs. Create Your Own Hedge Fund explains how exchange-traded funds can be used in conjunction with an options strategy to attain steady growth. Beginning with a tutorial on options and ETFs, the book goes on to describe both investment approaches in great detail providing you with a trading strategy that generates higher returns than buy-and-hold investing — and allows you to reduce risk by adopting a hedging strategy. Filled with in-depth insights and expert advice, this book is intended for you if you’re a sophisticated individual investor or a professional investor, trader, or other money manager looking to update your arsenal of investment tools. Order your copy today!
From the Inside Flap
Millions of investors have lost trillions of dollars to turbulent markets over the past five years. Millions of others, however, have used innovative strategies to hold their own and even see their portfolios increase in value. Create Your Own Hedge Fund outlines one such strategy using exchange traded funds (ETFs) and options.
ETFs such as DIAMONDs and VIPERS are fast replacing traditional mutual funds among investors attracted by their reduced expenses and increased versatility and variety, along with the fact—critical to the book’s strategies—that ETFs trade on exchanges and are optionable. Option writing, on the other hand, has proven to give investors more winning positions, fewer losing positions (with smaller losses when they do occur), and less fluctuation in portfolio value.
Create Your Own Hedge Fund combines the best aspects of both ETFs and options into an investing program that works well in both bull and bear markets, is affordable for the bulk of investors, and provides overall package returns that are steadier and more predictable than those provided by its component pieces. This results-driven book is divided into four parts that fully examine each element:
PART I discusses the foundation of the book’s program, Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), and why MPT makes it difficult, if not impossible, for investors to beat the market. It then introduces the advantages and drawbacks of hedge funds, and how to invest like a hedge fund with less risk and lower cost.
PART II discusses mutual funds, both traditional and newer exchange traded funds, and explains why ETFs are a superior alternative for the majority of investors.
PART III covers the basics and mechanics of options and option writing, a strategy that is historically considered risky but actually entails far less risk than traditional buy-and-hold.
PART IV provides the payoff, explaining how to construct a foundation portfolio and choose an option to write, then providing detailed examples of option writing in action.
Create Your Own Hedge Fund details an uncomplicated investment program that utilizes the best aspects of a hedge fund to provide market-beating returns while significantly reducing risk. Straightforward and understandable, it will show you how to remove heart-stopping swings from your portfolio’s performance—without sacrificing the performance itself.
Mark Wolfinger has been in the options business since 1977 when he became a market maker on the trading floor of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). He left the exchange is 2000.
Since then he has been an educator. He has published three books for the option beginner and teaches individual investors to use options to enhance profits and reduce risk. He offers individual and group seminars and operates Options for Rookies (https://www.mdwoptions.com/Premium/home-page/), a low-cost service that provides a true options education.
Born in Brooklyn, New York, he currently resides in Evanston, Il with his life partner Penny.
He received a BS degree from Brooklyn College and a PhD from Northwestern University.

About Mark Wolfinger - StockTrader.com













































StockTrader.comInvesting Online Made EasyAbout Mark Wolfinger
 Posted by Blain Reinkensmeyer | Last modified on Sep 16th, 2010 | Published Apr 10th, 2009
Mark D. Wolfinger grew up in Brooklyn and holds a BS degree from Brooklyn College and a PhD (chemistry) from Northwestern University. After working as a research chemist for Monsanto Company, in December 1976 he packed his belongings, left a career as a research chemist behind, and headed to Chicago to become a market maker on the trading floor of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).
Over the next 23 years, Mark Wolfinger worked primarily as a floor trader, and also held a variety of positions in the industry, including risk manager, and coach for new market makers.  As a trader on the exchange floor, he observed too many public investors adopting unprofitable strategies.  That prompted him to help educate investors on how to use options.  His goal is to demonstrate that  conservative strategies make it more likely that an individual investor can make money from his/her stock market investments.
After leaving the CBOE in 2000, he began writing and has published three books and numerous magazine articles. As an educator, he stresses the conservative methods detailed in his newest book, The Rookie’s Guide to Options (Read STTG’s review).
He currently resides in Evanston IL with his life-partner, Penny.
