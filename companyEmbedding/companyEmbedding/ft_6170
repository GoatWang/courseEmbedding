Description
This 12-foot spacer wire is specifically designed for use with the Diogen commercial grade LED lighting system. Using patented, state of the art technology, the splitter uses a coaxial connection that screws together with a weatherproof coupling cap so the lights are less likely separate or short due to moisture. This quick connect accessory lets the professional Christmas light installer create more design options without a reduction in lighting intensity.
