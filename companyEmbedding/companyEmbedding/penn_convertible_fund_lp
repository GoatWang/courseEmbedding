High Yield Bond Fund 










Sub-Adviser - T. Rowe Price Associates:
Since 1937, the T. Rowe Price Associates investment approach strives to achieve superior performance, but is always mindful of the risks incurred relative to the potential rewards. T. Rowe Price's consistent investment philosophy helps mitigate unfavorable changes and take advantage of favorable ones, all while providing its clients with world-class investment guidance and attentive service.
Objective:
Seeks to realize high current income.
Fund Highlight:
Invests primarily in high-yield corporate bonds that are rated below investment grade, as well as income producing convertible securities and preferred stocks.






Investment Matrix
Maturity:
Intermediate-term - Funds whose bonds have an average effective maturity greater than or equal to four years, but less than or equal to ten years, qualify as intermediate-term bond funds.
Quality:
Low - Funds that have an average credit quality rating lower than BB are categorized as low quality. These ratings are due to the insurance on the bonds in the portfolio and not on the funds themselves. The ratings or the insurance do not remove market risk.

 Educational Background



 


Fordham University

                  Fordham University is a private, nonprofit, coeducational research university based in New York City, United States. It was founded by the Catholic Diocese of New York in 1841 as St. John's College, placed in the care of the Society of Jesus shortly thereafter, and has since become an independent institution under a lay board of trustees, which describes the University as "in the Jesuit tradition."

Fordham is composed of ten constituent colleges, four of which are for undergraduates and six of which are for postgraduates. It enrolls approximately 15,000 students across three campuses in New York State: Rose Hill in the Bronx, Lincoln Center in Manhattan, and Westchester in West Harrison. In addition to these campuses, the University maintains a study abroad center in the United Kingdom and field offices in Spain and South Africa. Fordham awards the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, and Bachelor of Fine Arts degrees, as well as various master's and doctoral degrees.                




 


Wittenberg University

                  Wittenberg University is a private four-year liberal arts college in Springfield, Ohio, US serving 2,000 full-time students representing 37 states and approximately 30 foreign countries.Wittenberg was founded in 1845 by a group of pastors in the English Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Ohio. German American Reverend Ezra Keller was the principal founder and first president of the college. Its initial focus was to train clergy. One of its main missions was to "Americanize" Lutherans by teaching courses in English instead of German, unlike Capital University in Columbus, Ohio.

Penn Capital US High Yield Credit



The high yield corporate debt market consists of corporate debt issues with credit ratings below BBB (non-invest grade). Due to the non-investment grade ratings assigned to their debt, issuers in this class offer higher yields based on higher perceived default risk.
By constructing a diversified portfolio of over 100 corporate debt issuers, an investor can materially reduce the risk of principal loss caused by a default or credit downgrade without sacrificing aggregate yield and return opportunities. Further, by applying a rigorous research and examination process on issuers, one can materially reduce the portfolio default experience.
This marketplace remains inefficient and largely misunderstood. History has shown that a diversified portfolio of debt issued by solvent, US based corporations that have passed our fundamental research screening process can provide attractive returns with a fraction of the volatility associated with other asset classes and similar return structures.
Penn Capital's team oriented security selection and portfolio construction process, refined for almost 30 years, has enabled us to produce attractive long term track records.
