 The Galactic Cap has been featured across a number of media platforms and outlets. Below is a small selection:- MEL Magazine- Cosmopolitan- The Daily Mail- Gizmodo- GQ- Huffington Post- LA Weekly 




News- On January 1, 2016 we reduced the price of the Galactic Cap prototypes in conjunction with Valentines's Day, Feb. 14th the most romantic day of the year. Nothing is better than an intimate skin to skin love making session that enhances the sexual pleasure for both partners. The Galactic Cap is the world's first condom that fits safely and securely on the head of the penis. It’s a condom people WANT to use…instead of HAVE to use.



- In 2015, we redesigned the Galactic Cap to make it a one piece device and have received rave reviews. Here are testimonials from some of our customers: 		“It was the finest condom experience I have ever had”.		“Thrilling”,		“Wonderful”		“Unbelievably good”.		“Easy to apply"		"It is really fantastic, don't want anything else"		"The feeling for me was great."		"Best condom I've used yet."		"I would say it's the closest thing to nothing but skin I've found."		"I ordered a ten pack. I've used 5 so far. Your condom is batting 5 for 5 no leaks!"		"My wife reported that she thought they were the best condom we have ever used!"		"These are perfect! Please send me more"		"Go forward, I need more!"- On August 1, 2014 we have launched a way to preorder a Galactic Cap via our website on the pre-order page.- On July 30, 2014 we exceeded our crowd funding goal and raised $100,557. This will take us to the next phase in bringing the Galactic Cap to the masses.- On June 1, 2014 - The Galactic Gap will debut on crowd funding platform Indie GoGo - to help us with our campaign please visit www.igg.me/at/gcap- We have now joined Facebook and Twitter.

9 Condom Concepts that Could Make Safe Sex Better

Powell Development Group's Top Hat
In the second round of the Gates Foundation's grants for the Next Generation Condom, they specified that they would not award funding to any condoms that offer only partial coverage. The reasoning behind this is that many STDs can be transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. However, Charles Powell, president and CEO of Powell Development Group Inc. thinks the avoidance of partial coverage condoms is a massive oversight. He is developing a condom called the Galactic Cap, which covers only the head of the penis, leaving the coronal ridge and shaft exposed for skin-to-skin sensation. The Galactic Cap is polyurethane cap that is fixed to the penis with a pre-applied adhesive strip, which makes an airtight reservoir over the head. Since he was ineligible for Gates Foundation funding, Powell has now turned to Indiegogo for support, which he is optimistic about. "They're going to cover the full penis and that's like so what? What we've got is the biggest design advance in over 400 years," he says. Although full condoms may be better for riskier situations, Powell sees his invention as a potential third option between traditional condoms and no condom at all.
