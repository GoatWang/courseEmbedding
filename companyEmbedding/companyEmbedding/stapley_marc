This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Illumina CFO Marc Stapley: Learn the Business Inside and Out







For Marc Stapley, chief financial officer of Illumina—a global life science company that develops, manufactures and markets life science tools and systems for analysis of genetic variation and function—four lessons have helped prepare him for his role: Don’t waste the moments that matter, make tough decisions, learn your business inside and out, and never compromise on hiring talented people. Mr. Stapley promotes the virtue of being low maintenance and describes one of the CFO’s roles as making life easier for the CEO, the board of directors, fellow executives and employees. Speaking at Deloitte’s Next Generation CFO Academy, he added, “There’s nothing that finance can’t touch. Any opportunity you see to make something more effective, solve a problem or prevent a conflict should be a top priority.”
Q: When you became CFO at Illumina in 2012, it was your first CFO position. Did you feel fully prepared?
Marc Stapley
Marc Stapley: Yes, but I knew there were a few areas where I wanted to develop my strengths and fill in some gaps. The first was in investor relations. I started to focus on this when I attended the Deloitte CFO Next Generation Academy four years ago as my direct contact with Wall Street was limited at that point. Before becoming CFO, I don’t think I had an appreciation for how knowledgeable and strategic those in the investment community were, and even how different their terminology could be. I was amazed by how well investors knew the business and the industry, and how skilled they were at assimilating information.
The second gap was dealing with the board of directors. In my previous position, I had attended one board meeting and two audit committee meetings, which represented the extent of my board experience. Fortunately, the failed hostile take-over of Illumina by Roche, which commenced just one day after I joined the company, threw me into hundreds of investor meetings and dozens of board meetings in just the first two months of my tenure.
Another gap was fully understanding Illumina’s business, including the science behind it. I had to learn the basics of biology—that DNA consisted of four bases—A, C, T and G—something my kids learned in seventh grade! To be effective, I committed to learning all aspects of our business, not just about the finances but the science and biology that serves as the foundation for genetics.
Q: How do you see the CFO’s role with respect to influencing company strategy?
Marc Stapley: The CFO not only has a key role in setting the strategy for the company, but also in executing that strategy. He or she needs to have the courage of conviction to challenge something that he or she doesn’t feel is right for the company strategically, but it’s also important to be supportive once there is agreement on a strategy. For example, we had an acquisition a few years ago over which the management team spent some time debating. I had my position and voiced my views. At the end of the day, we decided to make the acquisition, and at that point, everyone was supportive irrespective of their initial position. It turned out to be a great decision for us.
So once you’ve had all the dialogue and the decisions have been made, it’s important for CFOs to be a staunch supporter. You’re lucky if you ever get a unanimous management team around big strategic shifts in a company, and it’s rare to find every executive and every board member agreeing all of the time. Management teams, executives and boards need to be allowed to have candid conversations. But the outcomes need to be owned by the management team when a decision has been made.
Q: Which leadership traits have you found to be effective?
Marc Stapley: I’ve worked for seven companies in my time and there are four rules that have worked for me in every single company. The first is, respect people who work with you and for you, and respect the skills and experience they bring to their position. The second is, always give the benefit of the doubt. A CFO must have a healthy amount of skepticism, and while you do need to trust, you should always verify, while giving the benefit of the doubt. Always assume the best intentions, unless you have a good reason not to. The third trait is to be low maintenance. As CFO, one of your jobs is to make your CEO’s job easier, to make the board’s job easier, and to make your fellow executives and employees’ job easier. There’s nothing that finance can’t touch. Any opportunity you see to make something more effective, solve a problem or prevent a conflict, you should take on.
Finally, my favorite one—transparency, which means a lot of things to me: Integrity, trust, honesty and accountability. I believe in transparency with stakeholders at all times. That’s not the same thing as unfiltered candor; I’m talking about transparency with sensitivity to your audience and to the situation you’re in. It’s one of the best things you can do in terms of earning people’s trust, and that works with investors, it works with the board, it works with management, I’ve yet to find situations where it doesn’t work well!
Q: How have you found working for a (relatively) smaller organization, compared to the larger organizations you have been with?
Marc Stapley: It’s really not that different. The challenges are similar, albeit the scale is different. It is easier to get your arms around a smaller organization, and some might feel you can be more impactful, but I’ve always felt that I was able to have an impact at the larger organizations that I’ve been fortunate to work with. It’s actually working for a high growth organization that presents the most differences, and that was one of the reasons that I came to Illumina, having spent 11 years helping large organizations transform their income statement. Interestingly though, one thing is similar, but for a different reason, and that’s the resource challenge. In high growth the work comes in faster than you can grow the workforce, whereas in transforming businesses the work doesn’t go away fast enough as the workforce is declining. Either way there’s the perpetual challenge of getting more done with fewer people, and that’s something CFOs need to help the entire organization to balance.
Q: What advice do you have for those aspiring to the CFO post?
Marc Stapley: Make tough decisions. Be prepared to take some risks, personally and professionally. Life is full of tough decisions. For example, leaving Pfizer for Illumina and moving from the East Coast to the West Coast was the hardest decision my family and I ever had to make, even harder than moving from the United Kingdom to the United States. But it was a great decision. You’ve got to have no regrets. You’ve got to try different things and think longer term.
Second, learn your business inside and out. To do that you’ve really got to be passionate about it. And I don’t mean just the financials; I mean every aspect of the business. CFOs can and should ask questions. And they might precede it with, “This is probably a stupid question but….” A CFO will be able to connect operational cause and financial effect much more effectively if he or she knows the ins and outs of the business. It has made me far more effective at doing my job.
Third, don’t compromise on hiring great people. It’s very tempting to compromise, especially when there might be a perceived talent shortage. But you must refrain. Getting the A-player is going to put you in very good stead. So always identify and seek the best talent.
Fourth, learn how to challenge appropriately, and never blindside people. A no-surprise approach has always worked for me. If there are issues, work with your leader or colleagues to address them and be transparent in your approach.
If someone aspiring to be CFO follows those four guideposts, I think he or she will do incredibly well.

Leading International Growth: Charles Holley, CFO-in-Residence

                          Many CFOs are being tasked by their CEOs with taking a greater hand in driving growth. Often, that means looking to other countries for new market opportunities. Leading an international growth effort challenges CFOs to tailor the capabilities they need to operate in a domestic market to the unique aspects of operating globally, says Charles Holley, retired CFO of Walmart and an independent senior advisor to Deloitte. He discusses what it takes to lead global expansion from the CFO’s seat, and describes practices he found helpful in leading international growth.
                        



Capital Allocation Decisions: Bringing the Board of Directors on Board

                          Continued uncertainty about the economy and increased regulation across several industries have required a more informed and efficient use of capital. Working with management, the board of directors can play a fundamental role in the capital allocation process through its oversight function, including participating in strategy development, examining risks, comparing strategy to results and focusing on key investment terms. Understand how boards can help guide the capital allocation process by challenging business plans and strategy, and reviewing capital allocation alternatives, among other efforts.
                        



Stressed Out? How Business Chemistry Can Help You and Your Team

                          The Deloitte Greenhouse™ Experience team recently surveyed more than 23,000 professionals about their stress levels at work and matched their responses to their Business Chemistry® type. Knowing which employees are experiencing the most stress can have implications for productivity, health and performance. By viewing stress through the lens of Business Chemistry, CFOs can help their team not only cope effectively with stress, but maybe even reframe it as a catalyst for better ways of working. And like other senior business leaders, CFOs have to keep their own stress levels in check.

Four Ways CFOs Can Avoid a Digital Talent Crunch

                          Technology is redefining how work gets done, both in the back office and in frontline operations. While the rapid growth of digital technologies creates new opportunities for finance, it also creates the potential for a digital divide: If members of the finance team lack the necessary skillsets and business acumen, they may not be able to make the most of these new digital capabilities.  Learn how CFOs can help their organization advance its digital efforts by focusing on leadership, culture, skills development and engagement.
                        



Keeping Finance Talent Relevant to Changing Needs: Charles Holley, CFO-in-Residence

                          It’s no secret that talent is key to a CFO’s success, yet talent is a perennial top challenge for CFOs. That’s partly due to the continually changing definition of what it means to have a talented finance team, says Charles Holley, an independent senior advisor to Deloitte. Drawing on his extensive leadership experiences, he explains how to identify, recruit and develop the people best suited for the fast-changing demands of finance. The key, he says, is finding the best athletes and keeping their capabilities relevant and aligned to the needs of the business.
                        



FP&A: Why Talent Counts and What CFOs Can Do to Improve It

                          To elevate the strategic contribution that a finance organization’s FP&A team can make, CFOs should focus on developing the team’s technical, professional and leadership competencies. Specifically, they can use a four-part model that provides opportunities to gain education and experience with exposure to key decision-makers and the expectation that FP&A will function more strategically. Rotating talent from FP&A into the business and back again can also help team members acquire both a broader understanding of the organization and the specialized knowledge that can make this function integral to the organization’s success.

New Market Dynamics Bring Change to CFO Searches

                          The disruption characterizing the business climate appears to be spilling into the CFO job market, impacting what companies seek in their next CFO and how they conduct their searches, according to Jenna Fisher, who leads the Global Corporate Officers Sector at executive search firm Russell Reynolds Associates. She discusses a host of recent trends she is seeing in CFO searches, including rising interest in “best athlete” candidates and those with global- and strategy-setting experience, a decrease in internal CFO promotions and an increase in confidential searches.
                        



China Spotlight: How CFOs Can Monitor and Mitigate Directional Shifts in China’s Currency—An Update

Illumina CEO Details 2.5-Year Quest for CFO

                        Jan 5, 2012 12:50 pm  ET

Illumina set a high bar in its search for a new finance chief, which is why it took two-and-a-half years to land Pfizer’s Marc Stapley. Stapley, 42, was most recently Pfizer’s senior vice president in charge of global finance, and helped the drug giant digest its acquisitions of Wyeth and King Pharmaceutical, and before Pfizer he worked at Alcatel-Lucent, and was the Franco-American telecommunication company’s CFO for its Americas region.
The maker of genetic testing systems is at an inflection point in its corporate life, which made it difficult to find the right person for that job. It has matured from a development stage company with less than $1 million of annual revenue a decade ago to being on pace to report $1 billion in sales a year, and is growing both organically and through acquisition. That size company is big enough to warrant having a CFO with large-company experience, but it’s not large enough to offer career advancement possibilities to the sitting CFO of another large company.
Illumina Chief Executive Jay Flatley told CFO Journal the company needed someone with “large-company experience,” as Illumina is growing rapidly and most of its management team, including Flatley, spent the balance of their careers at start-ups. Also, Illumina typically makes three to five “small to moderate” acquisitions a year, he said, so a CFO with merger experience was key.
Flatley said Illumina’s San Diego headquarters made finding a new CFO even more difficult. San Diego is known for being home to many biotechnology firms, but most of those companies are development stage and Illumina wasn’t interested in CFOs from those. However, sitting CFOs at companies with market capitalizations larger than Illumina’s roughly $4 billion are hard to poach, he said, ruling many of them out as candidates. And for some promising candidates who are married with children, San Diego itself was a deal-breaker, despite the city’s beautiful beaches, Flatley said, because they didn’t want to relocate their families.
Stapley starts on Jan. 20, and Flatley said he’ll help the company figure out the best way to structure its balance sheet and evaluate uses of cash, like share repurchases, while helping Illumina set up a new system to manage its global supply chain, inventory and resources.
That will allow current CFO Christian Henry to focus all of his attention on his primary role, general manager of Illumina’s genetic analysis business. Flatley praised Henry’s financial acumen, which he said made it easier for Illumina to take its time in finding the right permanent fit.
Goldman Sachs analyst Isaac Ro praised Stapley’s hire, and said in a Wednesday research note that the firm believes “this key hire reduces execution risk at [Illumina] and brings the potential for more sophisticated operations and financial oversight as the company continues to grow.”
Ro said Goldman Sachs’s investigations into Stapley suggest he was “well regarded” at Pfizer and “his areas of expertise included a range of operational responsibilities with a focus on global tax/trade and systems migration.” Goldman Sachs believes Stapley will help with Illumina’s expansion into new businesses and with its use of capital, as “capital deployment becomes more critical to the investment outlook.”
About the only thing Stapley lacks that Illumina had on its prospective-CFO checklist, Flatley said, is investor relations experience. Though it might take some time for Stapley to get to know the investment community, there’s no urgency, as Illumina is “very well funded” and doesn’t need to raise cash, Flatley said.
Stapley’s annual base salary will be $435,000, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and he’ll earn a signing bonus of $350,000 that he gets to keep as long as he doesn’t quit or get fired for “gross negligence or misconduct” during his first year. He’ll also get 24,500 restricted shares that vest over four years and would be worth about $775,000 if they vested today, along with options to buy 136,500 Illumina shares that vest over four years.
Henry’s salary for the fiscal year ended in January 2011 was $410,139, in addition to stock and option awards valued at $1.5 million and a $277,526 cash bonus, for total compensation of $2.2 million.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
