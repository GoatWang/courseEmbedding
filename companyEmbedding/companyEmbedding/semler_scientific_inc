	Semler Reports Fourth Quarter and Annual
	2016 Financial Results




	 





	Continuing to Increase Market Penetration
	of its QuantaFlo


	™


	product




	 



	PORTLAND, Ore

	. – March 10, 2017 – Semler
	Scientific, Inc. (OTCQB: SMLR; “Semler”),

	an emerging growth company that provides
	technology and software solutions to improve the clinical effectiveness of healthcare providers, today

	reported financial
	results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2016.


	 


	“During the fourth quarter, we continued to increase the
	market penetration of our QuantaFlo™ product, which we believe is due to the clinical benefits associated with its use,”
	said Doug Murphy-Chutorian, M.D., chief executive officer of Semler. “Our financial goal in 2017 is to generate cash from
	operating activities by growing revenue, controlling expenses while at the same time minimizing stockholder dilution,” he
	added.


	 



	FINANCIAL RESULTS



	 


	For the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to corresponding
	period of 2015, Semler had:


	 







	·



	Revenue of $2,316,000, a decrease of $618,000, compared to $2,934,000, primarily due to $1,444,000 less revenue from having
	de-emphasized sales of the lower margin WellChec™ service, which was partially offset by an increase of $826,000, or 55%
	growth, from concentrating on sales of the higher margin vascular testing products (e.g. QuantaFlo™)









	·



	Total operating expense, which includes cost of revenue, of $2,419,000, a decrease of $4,721,000, compared to $7,140,000
	primarily due to a decrease of $1,978,000 in stock compensation expense and a decrease of $1,621,000 in WellChec™
	expenses









	·



	Cost of revenue of $525,000, a decrease of $1,435,000, compared to $1,960,000, primarily due to the change in product mix mentioned

	·



	Revenue of $7,434,000, an increase of $433,000, compared to $7,001,000, primarily due to an increase of $2,288,000 from
	our vascular testing products, partially offset by a decrease of $1,855,000 from de-emphasizing the lower margin
	WellChec™ service









	·



	Total operating expense, which includes cost of revenue, of $9,593,000, a decrease of $5,827,000, compared to $15,420,000,
	primarily due to a decrease of $2,305,000 in stock compensation expense and a decrease of $1,499,000 in WellChec™ expenses.









	·



	Cost of revenue of $1,873,000, a decrease of $974,000, compared to $2,847,000 primarily due to the change in product mix mentioned
	above




	 




	 





	 




	 







	·



	Net loss of $2,554,000, or $0.50 per share, a decrease of $5,947,000, compared to a net loss of $8,501,000, or $1.72 per share




	 


	For the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to three
	months ended September 30, 2016, Semler had:


	 







	·



	Revenue of $2,316,000, an increase of $334,000, or 16.8%, compared to $1,982,000, during both of these three-month periods,
	revenue was solely from our vascular testing products









	·



	Total operating expense, which includes cost of revenue, of $2,419,000, an increase of $182,000, compared to $2,237,000

	had:







	·



	Cash of $622,000, an increase of $217,000, compared to $405,000




	 



	2016 Highlights



	 


	The major accomplishments of 2016 were as follows:


	 






	1)


	Increased the established base of QuantaFlo™ installations




	 






	2)


	Migrated customers to QuantaFlo™ from its lower-priced predecessor product




	 






	3)


	Contracted with home risk assessment (“HRA”) companies to use QuantaFlo™ in order to enhance their wellness
	services




	 


	In 2017, revenue from QuantaFlo™ is expected to continue
	to grow due to an increasing number of installations, higher average pricing as compared to its predecessor product, and the recurring
	revenue business model.


	 


	In 2017, as in the second half of 2016, Semler prefers to work
	as a secondary vendor to its HRA customers rather than be a primary vendor for its WellChec™ business. WellChec™ was
	responsible for both substantial revenue growth and associated start-up costs in 2015. By focusing on its QuantaFlo™ business
	and being a secondary vendor for wellness services, Semler intends to better leverage capital, have lower financial risk and require
	less operational expertise, while potentially having a higher margin business.


	 


	“

	We continue to
	grow QuantaFlo

	™

	revenue and to reduce our net operating loss as we near profitability

	,”
	said Dr. Murphy-Chutorian. “Our immediate objective is to become the standard of care for testing to identify patients at
	risk for heart attacks and strokes to enable better preventive medical care

	,

	”
	he added.

	FIRST QUARTER 2017 HIGHLIGHTS



	 


	The major accomplishments of the first quarter were as follows:


	 






	1)


	Increased inventory and manufacturing capacity for our vascular testing product, QuantaFlo™, in preparation for anticipated
	continued customer base growth in 2017




	 






	2)


	Received new and expanded orders for QuantaFlo™, which we expect to be installed in the second quarter, resulting in
	continued sequential quarterly revenue growth as part of our recurring revenue model




	 






	3)


	Migrated more customers to QuantaFlo™ from its lower-priced predecessor product




	 






	4)


	Developed additional cybersecurity protections that are intended to aid our customers in complying with regulations regarding
	safeguarding personal health information




	 


	In 2017, revenue from QuantaFlo™ is expected to grow due to an increasing
	number of installations, higher average pricing as compared to its predecessor product and the recurring revenue business models
	that we employ. We have received new and expanded orders in the first quarter that we have installed in the second quarter of 2017.


	 


	Sequential results for first quarter 2017 compared to fourth quarter 2016
	showed some decreases due to lower revenue from our fee-per-test customers, who primarily include home risk assessment service
	providers and who we believe historically conduct more business in the latter half of the calendar year than in the earlier months.
	Also in the first quarter of 2017, operating expenses were impacted by higher expenditures, such as those for increased manufacturing
	and fulfillment capabilities, projects to improve cybersecurity measures and research and development projects.


	 


	“Our immediate objective is to become the standard of care for testing
	to identify patients at risk for heart attacks and strokes to enable better preventive medical care,” said Dr. Murphy-Chutorian.
	“The first quarter performance was outstanding in this regard, particularly in growing our order book for fulfillment in
	the second quarter of 2017

	,

	” he concluded.

	About Semler Scientific, Inc.:



	 


	Semler Scientific, Inc. is

	an emerging
	growth company that provides technology solutions to improve the clinical effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare providers.
	Our mission is to develop, manufacture and market innovative proprietary products and services that assist our customers in evaluating
	and treating chronic diseases.

	Our first patented and U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, cleared product, introduced
	commercially in 2011, measured arterial blood flow in the extremities to aid in the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease.
	In March 2015 we received FDA 510(k) clearance for the next generation version of this product named QuantaFlo™, which was
	commercially launched in August 2015 to more comprehensively evaluate our customers’ patients for risk of heart attacks
	and strokes

	.

	We believe we are positioned to provide valuable information to our insurance
	company and physician customers, which in turn permit them to better guide patient care. Additional information about Semler can
	be found at

	semlerscientific.com

	.

					Full Description



Semler Scientific, Inc., incorporated on September 24, 2013, develops, manufactures and markets products and services that assist healthcare insurers and physician groups in evaluating and treating chronic diseases. The Company markets QuantaFlo and WellChec to its customers. QuantaFlo is an approximately four-minute in-office blood flow test. WellChec is the Company's multi-test service platform. The Company offers QuantaFlo product to cardiologists, internists, nephrologists, endocrinologists, podiatrists, and family practitioners and organizations, including healthcare insurance plans, integrated delivery networks, independent physician groups and companies contracting with the healthcare industry. It offers WellChec service platform to health insurance plans and other healthcare organizations.The Company's QuantaFlo features a sensor clamp that is placed on the toe or finger as current pulse oximetry devices. Infrared light emitted from the clamp on the dorsal surface of the digit is scattered and reflected by the red blood cells coursing through the area of illumination. Returning light is sensed by the sensor. A blood flow waveform is instantaneously constructed by the Company's software algorithm and displayed on the video monitor. Both index fingers and both large toes are interrogated, which takes approximately 30 seconds for each. A hardcopy report form is generated that displays over four waveforms and the ratio of each leg measurement compared with the arms. Results are classified as flow obstruction or no flow obstruction. The routine office usage of the QuantaFlo has ranges from few tests per week to over 10 tests per day. The Company also offers contracts in which it invoices on a per test basis for use of QuantaFlo, or as part of the WellChec multi-test platform.QuantaFlo is also the centerpiece of the Company's wellness diagnostic testing service, WellChec. WellChec provides testing equipment and third-party personnel to perform tests and examinations of patients for the Company's customers. The Company invoices on a fee per test or per examination basis for this service. The tests performed are for chronic disease states, which include respiratory disease, vascular disease, eye disease, bone disease, heart disease, neuropathy and diabetes.
