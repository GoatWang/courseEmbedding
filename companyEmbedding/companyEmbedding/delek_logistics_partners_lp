Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Delek Logistics Partners, LP, incorporated on April 24, 2012, owns and operates logistics and marketing assets for crude oil, and intermediate and refined products. The Company's business primarily consists of certain crude oil, intermediate and refined products pipelines and transportation, storage, wholesale marketing, terminaling and offloading assets, which were previously owned, operated or held by Delek US Holdings, Inc. (Delek), and assets acquired from unrelated third parties. The Company operates through two segments: Pipelines and Transportation segment, and Wholesale Marketing and Terminalling segment. The Company engaged in the gathering, transporting and storing crude oil; storing intermediate products and feed stocks, and marketing, distributing, transporting, offloading and storing refined products. The Company also provides crude oil, intermediate and refined products transportation services for terminaling, and marketing services to third parties primarily in Texas, Tennessee and Arkansas.Pipelines and Transportation segmentThe pipelines and transportation segment consists of assets, including pipelines and trucks and ancillary assets that provide crude oil gathering and crude oil, intermediate and finished products transportation and storage services primarily in support of Tyler and El Dorado refineries. Additionally, this segment provides crude oil and other products transportation services to certain third parties. As of December 31, 2016, its pipeline assets included approximately 400 miles of operable crude oil transportation pipelines, approximately 366 miles of refined product pipelines and approximately 600 miles of crude oil gathering and trunk lines. Its Lion Pipeline System is a system of common carrier pipelines that transport crude oil to, and refined products from, Delek's El Dorado Refinery. The Lion Pipeline System consists primarily of the Magnolia Pipeline system; the El Dorado Pipeline system; multiple short crude oil pipelines located at the El Dorado Refinery and its Sandhill Station; the Magnolia Station located west of the El Dorado Refinery; a Refined Products Pipeline system, and certain related crude oil pipelines. The Magnolia Pipeline is an approximately 77-mile crude oil pipeline, with a capacity of approximately 68,500 barrels per day (bpd) that runs from a connection with ExxonMobil's LOLA System near Shreveport, Louisiana to its Magnolia Station, where the crude oil is then stored and transferred to its El Dorado Pipeline. In addition, third-party pipelines connect the Magnolia Pipeline near Haynesville, Louisiana, which allows for the receipt of crude oil transported from Longview, Texas. The El Dorado Pipeline is a 28-mile, 12-inch crude oil pipeline, with a capacity of approximately 22,000 bpd that transports crude oil from its Magnolia Station to Delek's Sandhill Station adjacent to the El Dorado Refinery. In addition, the Magnolia Station has storage facilities with approximately 220,000 barrels of active shell capacity, which includes the addition of a new 85,000 barrel crude oil storage tank. It also owns two refined product pipelines that transport gasoline and diesel from the El Dorado Refinery to the nearby Enterprise TE Products Pipeline El Dorado Station (the Refined Products Pipelines). As of December 31, 2016, the Company leased capacity of approximately 11,000 bpd on the Enterprise Products Pipeline from Enterprise's El Dorado Station to its refined products terminal in Memphis, Tennessee. The Refined Products Pipelines along with the leased capacity are collectively referred to as the Refined Products Pipeline System. The pipelines in the Lion Pipeline System also have injection points where crude oil gathered from the SALA Gathering System can be injected and then transported to the El Dorado Refinery. The Lion Pipeline System is capable of transporting crude oil offloaded from rail cars at or near the El Dorado Refinery, including at the two crude oil rail offloading racks.The SALA Gathering System is a system of common carrier pipelines that primarily gathers and transports crude oil and condensate that is purchased from various crude oil producers in Arkansas, Texas and Louisiana by Delek or a third party to whom Delek has assigned certain of its rights. The SALA Gathering System includes approximately 600 miles of 2 to 8 inch crude oil gathering and transportation lines in southern Arkansas and northern Louisiana, located primarily within a 60-mile radius of the El Dorado Refinery. In addition, the gathering system transports small volumes of crude oil that are received from other sources and condensate that is purchased from a third party in east Texas. All such crude oil and other products are transported to the El Dorado Refinery for processing. In addition, a pipeline within the SALA Gathering System transports minimal crude oil for third party shippers pursuant to a common carrier tariff. As of December 31, 2016, the SALA Gathering System included 53 crude oil storage tanks and breakout tanks with a total combined active shell capacity of approximately 0.8 million barrels (including Tank 192 and approximately 42,000 barrels of capacity it leases to an unrelated third party), 14 truck receipt locations, approximately 500 pipeline gathering and receiving stations and 17 relay stations to deliver crude oil to the Magnolia Station, the El Dorado Pipeline System or directly to the El Dorado Refinery. The Company's Paline Pipeline System is primarily a 195-mile, 10-inch crude oil pipeline, with a capacity of approximately 36,000 bpd, running from Longview, Texas to the Phillips 66-operated Beaumont terminal in Nederland, Texas. It includes a three-mile section that runs north from Kilgore, Texas. Its Paline Pipeline System is operated as a common carrier pipeline and the service is regulated by the FERC.The Company's East Texas Crude Logistics System includes two owned and operated crude oil pipeline systems and their related tank farms, which serve the Tyler Refinery: the Nettleton pipeline, a bi-directional 36-mile pipeline, with a capacity of approximately 38,000 bpd, that is capable of transporting crude oil from its tank farms in and around Longview, Texas to the Bullard Junction at the Tyler Refinery and to other of its tank farms in and around Longview, Texas, and the McMurrey Pipeline System, a 65-mile pipeline system, with a capacity of approximately 28,000 bpd, that transports crude oil from its tank farms in and around Longview, Texas and runs roughly parallel to the Nettleton Pipeline. Its East Texas Crude Logistics System also includes five owned or leased crude oil storage terminals, at which it stores crude oil owned by Delek for the Tyler Refinery. As of December 31, 2016, the LaGloria Station consisted of two tanks with an active shell capacity of approximately 450,000 barrels. As of December 31, 2016, the Nettleton Station consisted of five tanks with an active shell capacity of approximately 222,000 barrels.

The Big Sandy Terminal has 13 tanks with an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 177,000 barrels. As of December 31, 2016, the Tyler Tank Assets consisted of 96 storage tanks and certain ancillary assets (such as pumps and piping) located at and adjacent to the Tyler Refinery with an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 2.0 million barrels. The El Dorado Tank Assets consist of 158 storage tanks and certain ancillary assets (such as pumps and piping) located at and adjacent to the El Dorado Refinery with an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 2.5 million barrels. The Greenville-Mount Pleasant Pipeline is a 76-mile pipeline, connecting the Greenville Storage Facility and the Mount Pleasant Terminal. The service provided on the Greenville-Mount Pleasant Pipeline is regulated by the Texas Railroad Commission, subject to a tariff on file with that Commission. The Greenville Storage Facility has four tanks with an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 330,000 barrels and is connected to the Explorer Pipeline System. Its terminal in North Little Rock, Arkansas has five tanks with an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 180,000 barrels. As of December 31, 2016, it owned 123 trucks and 205 trailers used to haul primarily crude oil and other products for third parties and Delek.

The Tyler Crude Tank is a crude oil storage tank and certain ancillary assets located adjacent to the Tyler Refinery. As of December 31, 2016, the Tyler Crude Tank had approximately 350,000 barrels of shell capacity and primarily supported the Tyler Refinery.Wholesale Marketing and Terminalling segmentThe wholesale marketing and terminalling segment provides wholesale marketing and terminaling services to Delek's refining operations and to independent third parties from whom the Company receives fees for marketing, transporting, storing and terminaling refined products. The wholesale marketing and terminalling segment provides marketing services for the refined products output of the Tyler refinery; engages in wholesale activity at its Abilene and San Angelo, Texas terminals, as well as at terminals owned by third parties, whereby it purchases light products for sale and exchange to third parties, and provides terminaling services to independent third parties and Delek. The Company markets the refined products output of the Tyler refinery, other than jet fuel and petroleum coke.In west Texas marketing operations, it generates revenue by purchasing refined products from independent third-party suppliers and from Delek for sale and exchange to third parties at its San Angelo and Abilene, Texas terminals and at third-party terminals located elsewhere in Texas. As of December 31, 2016, the Company owned approximately 104 miles of product pipelines in west Texas that connect its San Angelo and Abilene, Texas terminals to the Magellan Orion Pipeline. The Company provides terminaling services for products to independent third parties and Delek through light products terminals it owns in Nashville, Tennessee and to Delek, or certain third parties to whom Delek has assigned its rights, through its light products terminals in Memphis, Tennessee; Tyler, Texas; Big Sandy, Texas; Mount Pleasant, Texas; El Dorado, Arkansas; and North Little Rock, Arkansas.
