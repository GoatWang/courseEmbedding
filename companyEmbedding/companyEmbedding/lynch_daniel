Daniel J. Moran, Jr.Senior Vice President-Wealth ManagementSenior Financial AdvisorDan has been with Merrill Lynch his entire career, which began in 1988.  His focus is on developing strategies and solutions for high-net-worth individuals, their families and their businesses based upon the client's risk tolerance, time horizon, liquidity needs and overall investment goals.   Dan's approach to wealth management is consultative, objective and committed to excellence. First, he takes the time to listen to and review client financial situations, preferences and goals. Second, he offers recommendations for asset allocations designed to accurately reflect each client's income and growth expectations. And third, he follows up with discussions covering a wide range of opportunities, including investments, retirement, estate planning services and philanthropy. Dan is a specially qualified Senior Portfolio Advisor who, in addition to providing traditional advice and guidance, can draw from his experience to help clients pursue their objectives by building and managing custom investment strategies, selecting from a wide range of Merrill Lynch model portfolios and third-party investment strategies. When servicing clients through the firm’s Investment Advisory Program, a Senior Portfolio Advisor may manage those strategies on a discretionary basis, which allow  his clients to have  more time with their families, their careers and their hobbies.Dan is a 1985 graduate of St. Olaf College, with a B.A. in biology and religion.  Dan currently serves on the boards of St. Paul's Outreach, The Convent of the Visitation school and  Family Fest Ministries, Inc.

May 23-25, 2013

 


Daniel C. Lynch
Daniel C. Lynch is an associate professor of international relations at USC and is a member of the USC U.S.-China Institute’s executive board. Lynch received his Ph.D. in political science from the University of Michigan, concentrating on Chinese and East Asian domestic politics and international relations.
He is the author of two books: Rising China and Asian Democratization: Socialization to “Global Culture” in the Political Transformations of Thailand, China, and Taiwan (Stanford University Press, 2006) and After the Propaganda State: Media, Politics, and “Thought Work” in Reformed China (Stanford University Press, 1999).
Lynch has published scholarly articles on topics ranging from Chinese thinking on the future of international relations to prospects for the People’s Republic of China’s democratization, as well as op-ed pieces on subjects such as China’s post-2008 economic difficulties, troubles in the consolidation of Thai democracy, the implications of the January 2012 Taiwan elections, and more.  In May 2013, Lynch will submit to his publisher a new book manuscript—the product of several years’ research—on how Chinese political and intellectual elites “conceptualize the Chinese trajectory;” that is, how they envision the future of China’s economy, domestic political system, media and the Internet, and foreign policy.
