	Built from the ground up in 2006 by a team of experienced industry executives, SAExploration Holdings, Inc. ("SAE") is an international geophysical services company offering a full range of 2D,3D and 4D seismic data acquisition services, including surveying, program design, logistical support, data acquisition, processing, camp services, catering, environmental assessment and community relations. The Company services its multinational client base from offices in Canada, Alaska, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand and Brazil.

	Working with many of the world’s largest international oil companies, SAE operates in land, transition zone and shallow water marine areas, with particular strength in challenging environments and delicate ecosystems. The Company works on a fully contracted basis, choosing not to engage in unfunded or partially funded speculative libraries, which have significantly more risk and uncertainty.

	SAE is often the initial entry into a region or area in which a major oil company will operate for decades to come. SAE assumes this responsibility by consistently operating in a sustainable fashion, with cultural sensitivity to local populations and an outstanding Quality, Health, Safety, and Environmental performance record.

	SAE is driven by its core values of Respect, Accountability, Integrity and Teamwork.

The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or more of your initial investment, and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading, and seek advice from your broker and or an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.

					Full Description



SAExploration Holdings, Inc., incorporated on February 2, 2011, is an internationally focused oilfield services company. The Company offers a range of seismic data acquisition and logistical support services in Alaska, Canada, South America and Southeast Asia to customers in the oil and natural gas industry. In addition to the acquisition of two-dimensional (2D), three-dimensional (3D), time-lapse four-dimensional (4D) and multi-component seismic data on land, in transition zones between land and water, and offshore in depths reaching approximately 3,000 meters, the Company offers a suite of logistical support and in-field processing services. The Company operates crews around the world that are supported by over 29,500 owned land and marine channels of seismic data acquisition equipment and other leased equipment as needed to complete particular projects. Seismic data is used by its customers, including integrated oil companies, national oil companies and independent oil and gas exploration and production companies, to identify and analyze drilling prospects. The Company provides a range of seismic data acquisition services, including in-field data processing, and related logistics services. The Company's seismic data acquisition services include program design, planning and permitting, camp services, survey, drilling, recording, reclamation and in-field processing.The Company assesses and recommends acquisition parameters and technologies to the customer. The Company analyzes the requests and works with the customer to put an operational, personnel and capital resource plan in place to execute and complete the project. Once a seismic program is designed, the Company works with the customer to obtain the necessary permits from governmental authorities and accesses rights of way from surface and mineral estate owners or lessees where the survey is to be conducted. The Company has developed processes for assembling, operating and disassembling field camps in project locations. The Company owns over 10 supply and personnel river vessels to gain access to jungle areas. The Company also has over five jungle camps and a series of 40 fly camps that act as advance camps from the main project camp. Each of these jungle base camps contains a medical facility with doctors and nurses. The camps are equipped with kitchens, sleeping and recreational quarters, power supply, communications links, air support, water purification systems, black water purification systems, offices, repair garages, fuel storage and other support services.The Company's survey crew lays out the line locations to be recorded and, if explosives are being used, identifies the sites for shot-hole placement. The drilling crew creates the holes for the explosive charges that produce the necessary acoustical impulse. In North America, its vibroseis source units consist of the source technology, including over eight AHV IV 364 Commander Vibrators and six IVI mini vibrators. In South America and Southeast Asia, the Company performs its own surveying and drilling, which is supported by approximately 200 drilling units. The Company utilizes vibrator energy sources or explosives depending on the nature of the program. All of its systems record equivalent seismic information but vary in the manner by which seismic data is transferred to the central recording unit. The Company provides reclamation in the areas where work has been performed. These programs include reforestation or other activities to restore the natural landscape at its worksites. Its quality control applications identify and analyze ambient noise, evaluating field parameters and supporting obstacle-recovery strategies. It electronically manages customer data from the field to the processing office.The Company competes with Compagnie Generale de Geophysique, Geokinetics, Inc., Global Geophysical Services, Inc., BGP, Inc. and Dawson Geophysical Company.
