                Shaza Andersen            








 



The basics
Background: A part-time teller through college, Andersen chose the banking field for its built-in management training. And 15 years later, she opened her own bank, the first to be chartered in D.C. After encountering four banking commissioners in three years, Andersen, now 44, moved the bank to Reston, expanding it to 10 branches, 68 employees and nearly $450 million in assets.













 Enlarge






                            Shaza Andersen                        










 


Education: Bachelor’s degree in European studies, George Mason University
First job: As a sales clerk for The Limited. It was a big, exciting thing to work there and spend your paycheck on the clothes.
Family: Husband Marc and two kids, Katie, 15, and Danny, 10, in Great Falls
Business strategy




How’s business? I almost feel bad saying it, but we had our best year last year despite the economic downturn. Our income went up drastically. We maintained our quality — having good loans. We never were out there trying to do risky loans. That paid off for us.
Guiding principles: Being fair. You don’t prefer one kid over the other; you don’t prefer one employee over the other. Have you ever read “The One Minute Manager?” I live by it. One-minute compliment, one-minute reprimand, one-minute planning. I’m a big planner. If I don’t have a plan, I feel lost.
What do you always ask during interviews? I like to know what makes them tick. Because if they’re happy, I’m happy.
How do you avoid the next recession? Make sure that you always look at the ups and downs of an interest rate risk at all times, even when times are good. Because you don’t know when things will change.
On the Troubled Asset Relief Program: We currently have TARP. TARP was a great program the Treasury came up with. It was a cheap capital source to be able to grow. We’re definitely one of the first banks to apply for this small business loan fund, and we’ll be paying TARP off with that.

Judgment calls




 


Your worst days: Dealing with personnel issues. Trying to make everybody happy.
Your best days: I have people I meet with — I talk about their business or brainstorm about what they should do financially and how they should structure deals. It’s fun.
Craziest career decision: Starting a bank. That’s a scary proposition. We had gotten our pre-approvals, the pre-audit. It was the night before we were going to open the doors — April 14, 2004 — gosh, I don’t think I could sleep. I remember looking at my husband and saying, ‘Oh my gosh, what if the customers don’t come?’ That was a real fear.
On being D.C.’s guinea pig: We loved it. We loved charting new grounds. All the new commissioners were great, but they were short-lived, so you couldn’t really develop a relationship. But as far as starting from scratch, it was exciting.
True confessions
What do most not know about bankers? It’s not bankers’ hours. I live the bank!
On being a woman in a man’s world: I don’t feel like I’m treated differently. Or if they do, they don’t tell me to my face.
Your own craziest financial move: I can’t tell you that! My husband will read it.
Guilty pleasure: Impulse shopping
Favorite book: Other than business reading, my pleasure reading is John Grisham.
Favorite movie: I’m a movie person. That’s what my husband and I do on date night, go to the movies. I like action movies and romantic comedies. And I loved all the John Grisham movies.
Favorite place outside of the office: Palm Beach, Fla. We bought a house there because we went there too many times.
What do most people not know about you? I don’t cook. It’s not one of my talents.

Energy Efficient Replacement Windows: Affordable Windows, Projects and Options
By Nicole Seaton

					One of the smartest and cost-effective ways to save money on your monthly bills is to replace the windows in your home. Compared to other expensive and time-consuming home improvements, window replacement is an upgrade that can help retain the heat in your home and greatly minimize your heating bill. If you live in an older residence, you might have single-pane windows that do not have today's innovative technology that keeps the cold out and the warmth inside. In the summer months, modern windows perform the opposite function: some even have special protection against ultraviolet rays, deflecting the sun on the hottest summer days.
				










Double the pane equals financial gain

					The first consideration in upgrading your windows is, "Single or double-pane?" Although single-pane windows are less expensive, double pane windows offer added protection from the heat and cold, and they also protect your home from dust, debris and pests. You might think that you're saving money by purchasing cheap windows, but if you spend a little more, you'll see an instant return on your investment: when you open your next power bill! High-quality, modern double pane windows should adhere to industry standards set by the National Fenestration Rating Council. If your windows have an NFRC label, you can be sure they are high-quality windows that can last for generations.
				

					Windows with multiple panes can be filled with gases like krypton and argon, which helps reduce heat loss and increases R-values, or resistance to heat loss. The higher the R-value, the better your new windows can protect against heat loss. Another factor to consider is the window's U-value, or its resistance to heat transfer. When researching window options, both R-value and U-value information should be available for the entire window: some manufacturers only offer this information for the middle of the window.
				

					There are many styles of modern windows to choose from, but not every option may fit your budget. Some options companies offer don't necessarily make a difference in savings. For instance, window companies might try to talk you into double pane windows with more than one inch between the windows. While this space between the windows creates better insulation, more than an inch does not make for more energy efficient windows- it's actually wasted space.
				










Window companies and installers: get multiple estimates before buying

					Now is a great time to find affordable windows that meet your budget. Many window companies will come directly to your home to show you the different kinds of replacement windows and window materials. It's a good idea to get more than one estimate: some companies have seasonal sales or special incentives for first-time customers. By shopping around, you'll be able to find energy efficient, affordable windows.
				

					Whether you are hiring a professional contractor to install your new windows or you're armed with do-it-yourself know-how, the more research you do, the better prepared you will be to choose the best windows for your location, time frame and budget. The effects of new home windows are immediate: they increase the value and aesthetic appeal of your home while efficiently maintaining a comfortable temperature. By making this simple and cost-effective improvement to your home, you will reap the visual and financial rewards for years to come.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
