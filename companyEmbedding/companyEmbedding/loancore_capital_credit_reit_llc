GENERAL
LOAN TERMS




2.1 The Loan
. Subject to and upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein, Lender is making a loan (the “
Loan ”) to Borrower on the date hereof, in the
original principal amount of $33,750,000, which shall mature on the
Stated Maturity Date. Borrower acknowledges receipt of the Loan,
the proceeds of which are being and shall be used to
(i) acquire the Property,
 
23


(ii) fund certain of the Subaccounts, and
(iii) pay transaction costs. Any excess proceeds may be used
for any lawful purpose. Borrower shall receive only one borrowing
hereunder in respect of the Loan and no amount repaid in respect of
the Loan may be reborrowed. The Loan shall be evidenced by the Note
and shall be repaid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
the Note and the other Loan Documents.

2.2 Interest; Monthly
Payments .

2.2.1 Generally
. From and after the date hereof,
interest on the unpaid Principal shall accrue at the Interest Rate
and be due and payable as hereinafter provided. On the date hereof,
Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid Principal at the Interest
Rate from the date hereof through and including September 8,
2016. On October 9, 2016 and each Payment Date thereafter
through and including the Maturity Date, Borrower shall pay
interest on the unpaid Principal which has accrued through the last
day of the Interest Period immediately preceding such Payment Date.
All accrued and unpaid interest and unpaid Principal shall be due
and payable on the Maturity Date. If the Loan is repaid on any date
other than on a Payment Date (whether prior to or after the Stated
Maturity Date), Borrower shall also pay interest that would have
accrued on such repaid Principal at the Interest Rate through and
including the last day of the Interest Period in which such payment
is made.

2.2.2 Default
Rate . After the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the
entire unpaid Debt shall bear interest at the Default Rate,
calculated from the date such payment was due or such underlying
Default shall have occurred without regard to any grace or cure
periods contained herein, and shall be payable upon demand from
time to time, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

2.2.3 Unavailability or
Illegality of LIBOR . If, at any time, Lender determines (which
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Borrower absent
manifest error) that (a) Dollar deposits in an amount
approximately equal to the then outstanding principal amount of the
Loan are not generally available at such time in the London
interbank Eurodollar market for deposits in Eurodollars,
(b) reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR,
(c) the LIBOR Rate would be in excess of the maximum interest
rate that Borrower may by law pay or (d) it shall become
illegal for Lender to maintain the Loan on the basis of the LIBOR
Rate, Lender shall promptly give notice of such fact to Borrower
together with a reasonable explanation of such determination (a
“ LIBOR Notice ”), and upon and from the
expiration of the then-current Interest Period, the Interest Rate
shall be the rate equal to Prime Rate plus the Prime Rate Spread
until the Maturity Date or such earlier date that the conditions
referred to in this Section 2.2.3 no longer exist (as
determined by Lender, Lender agreeing to give prompt notice to
Borrower if such conditions no longer exist).

2.2.4 Taxes
.

(a) Any and all payments by Borrower
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall be made free and
clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future
taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and
all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding taxes imposed on
Lender’s income, and franchise taxes imposed on Lender by the
law or regulation of any Governmental Authority (all such
non-excluded taxes, levies,
 
24


imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and
liabilities being hereinafter referred to in this
Section 2.2.4 as “ Applicable Taxes
”). If Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any
Applicable Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to
Lender, the following shall apply: (i) the sum payable shall
be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required
deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums
payable under this Section 2.2.4 ), Lender receives an
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made; (ii) Borrower shall make such
deductions; and (iii) Borrower shall pay the full amount
deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in
accordance with applicable law. Payments pursuant to this
Section 2.2.4 shall be made within ten (10) days
after the date Lender makes written demand therefor.

(b) Prior to the date that any
lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the
United States of America becomes a party hereto, such lender shall
deliver to Borrower such certificates, documents or other evidence,
as required by the IRS Code or Treasury Regulations issued pursuant
thereto (including Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8ECI and
W-8BEN, as applicable, or appropriate successor forms), properly
completed, currently effective and duly executed by such lender
establishing that payments to it the Loan Documents are
(i) not subject to United States federal backup withholding
tax and (ii) not subject to United States Federal withholding
tax under the Code. Each such lender shall (A) deliver further
copies of such forms or other appropriate certifications on or
before the date that any such forms expire or become obsolete and
after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most
recent form delivered to Borrower and (B) obtain such
extensions of the time for filing, and renew such forms and
certifications thereof, as may be reasonably requested by Borrower.
If a payment made to a lender under or in respect of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document would be subject to United States
federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA and such lender fails to
comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA, such
lender shall deliver (y) a certification signed by the chief
financial officer, principal accounting officer, treasurer or
controller, and (z) other documentation reasonably requested
by Borrower sufficient for Borrower to comply with its obligations
under FATCA and to determine that such lender has complied with
such applicable reporting requirements. Borrower shall not be
required to pay any amount pursuant to Section 2.2.4(a)
hereof to any lender that is organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction outside of the United States of America if such lender
fails to comply with the requirements of this
Section 2.2.4(b) . Borrower will not be required to pay
any additional amounts in respect of United States federal income
tax pursuant to Section 2.2.4(a) hereof to any lender
if the obligation to pay such additional amounts would not have
arisen but for a failure by lender to comply with its obligations
under this Section 2.2.4(b) .

2.2.5 Change in Law;
Additional Costs . If
any Regulatory Change or any other change in the interpretation or
application of any requirement of law, or compliance by Lender with
any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law)
hereafter issued from any central bank or other Governmental
Authority shall hereafter:

(a) impose, modify or hold
applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar
requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other
liabilities in or for the account of, advances or loans by, or
other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any
office of Lender which is not otherwise included in the
determination of LIBOR hereunder;
 
25



(b) have the effect of reducing the
rate of return on Lender’s capital as a consequence of its
obligations hereunder to a level below that which Lender could have
achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into
consideration Lender’s policies with respect to capital
adequacy) by any amount deemed by Lender to be material;
or

(c) impose on Lender any other
condition and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the
cost to Lender of making, renewing or maintaining loans or
extensions of credit or to reduce any amount receivable
hereunder;

then, in any such case, Borrower
shall promptly pay Lender, upon demand, any additional amounts
necessary to compensate Lender for such additional cost or reduced
amount receivable which Lender deems to be material as reasonably
determined by Lender, provided that such demand by Lender shall
apply to all loans similarly affected by such change. Payments
pursuant to this Section 2.2.5 shall be made within ten
(10) days after the date Lender makes written demand therefor.
Borrower’s obligations under this Section 2.2.5
shall survive the payment of the Debt for a period of three
(3) months.

2.2.6 Breakage
Indemnity . Borrower
shall indemnify Lender against any loss or expense which Lender may
actually sustain or incur in liquidating or redeploying deposits
from third parties acquired to effect or maintain the Loan or any
part thereof as a consequence of (i) any payment or prepayment
of the Loan or any portion thereof made on a date other than a
Payment Date, (ii) any payment or prepayment of the Loan or
any portion thereof made on a date that is a Payment Date if
Borrower did not give the prior written notice of such prepayment
required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, (iii) any
default in payment or prepayment of the Principal or any part
thereof or interest accrued thereon, as and when due and payable
(at the date thereof or otherwise, and whether by acceleration or
otherwise) and/or (iv) the occurrence of a Prime Rate Period.
Lender shall deliver to Borrower a statement for any such sums
which it is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Section 2.2.6 , which statement shall be binding and
conclusive absent manifest error. Borrower’s obligations
under this Section 2.2.6 are in addition to
Borrower’s obligations to pay any Exit Fee and Spread
Maintenance Premium applicable to a payment or prepayment of
Principal and shall survive the payment of the Debt.

2.2.7 New Payment Date
. Lender shall have the
right, to be exercised not more than once during the term of the
Loan, to change the Payment Date to a date other than the ninth
(9 th
) day of each month, but such
date shall not be earlier than the seventh (7
th ) day of each month (a “ New
Payment Date ”), on thirty (30) days’
written notice to Borrower; provided ,
however , that any such change in the Payment Date:
(a) shall not modify the amount of regularly scheduled monthly
principal and interest payments, except that the first payment of
principal and interest payable on the New Payment Date shall be
accompanied by interest at the interest rate herein provided for
the period from the Payment Date in the month in which the New
Payment Date first occurs to the New Payment Date, and
(b) shall change the Stated Maturity Date to the New Payment
Date occurring in the month set forth in the definition of Stated
Maturity Date.

2.3 Loan Repayment
.

2.3.1 Repayment
. Borrower shall pay to Lender on
the Maturity Date the entire outstanding principal balance of the
Loan, all accrued and unpaid interest and all other
 
26


amounts due and owing under the Loan Documents,
including all interest that would accrue on the outstanding
principal balance of the Loan through and including the end of the
Interest Period in which the Maturity Date occurs (even if such
Interest Period extends beyond the Maturity Date). Borrower shall
have no right to prepay all or any portion of the Principal except
in accordance with Sections 2.3.2 and 2.3.3
hereof. Except during the continuance of an Event of Default, all
proceeds of any repayment, including any prepayments of the Loan,
shall be applied by Lender as follows in the following order of
priority: First , accrued and unpaid interest at the
Interest Rate; Second , to Principal; and Third, to
the Exit Fee and any other amounts then due and owing under the
Loan Documents, including the Spread Maintenance Premium (if such
repayment or prepayment occurs prior to the Spread Maintenance
Date). If prior to the Stated Maturity Date the Debt is accelerated
by reason of an Event of Default, then Lender shall be entitled to
receive, in addition to the unpaid Principal and accrued interest
and other sums due under the Loan Documents, an amount equal to the
Spread Maintenance Premium and Exit Fee applicable to such
Principal so accelerated. During the continuance of an Event of
Default, all proceeds of repayment, including any payment or
recovery on the Property (whether through foreclosure, deed-in-lieu
of foreclosure, or otherwise) shall, unless otherwise provided in
the Loan Documents, be applied in such order and in such manner as
Lender shall elect.

2.3.2 Mandatory
Prepayments . The
Loan is subject to mandatory prepayment in certain instances of
Insured Casualty or Condemnation (each a “
Casualty/Condemnation Prepayment ”), in the
manner and to the extent set forth in Section 7.4.2
hereof. Each Casualty/Condemnation Prepayment, after deducting
Lender’s out-of-pocket unaffiliated third party costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses)
in connection with the settlement or collection of the Proceeds or
Award, shall be applied in the same manner as repayments under
Section 2.3.1 hereof, and if such Casualty/Condemnation
Prepayment is made on any date other than a Payment Date, then such
Casualty/Condemnation Prepayment shall include interest that would
have accrued on the Principal prepaid through and including the
last day of the Interest Period in which such payment is made.
Provided that no Event of Default is continuing, any such mandatory
prepayment under this Section 2.3.2 shall be without
the payment of the Spread Maintenance Premium, but subject to the
payment of the Exit Fee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, each Casualty/Condemnation Prepayment shall be
applied in inverse order of maturity and shall not extend or
postpone the due dates of the monthly installments due under the
Note or this Agreement, or change the amounts of such
installments.

2.3.3 Optional
Prepayments .
Provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
Borrower shall have the right to prepay the Loan in whole (but not
in part) on any Payment Date provided that Borrower gives Lender at
least thirty (30) days prior written notice thereof and such
prepayment is accompanied by (a) the Spread Maintenance
Premium applicable thereto (if such prepayment occurs prior to the
Spread Maintenance Date) and (b) the Exit Fee applicable
thereto. If any such prepayment is not made on a Payment Date,
Borrower shall also pay interest that would have accrued on such
prepaid Principal through and including the last day of the
Interest Period in which such payment is made.

2.3.4 Prepayments;
Generally .
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document (a) no prepayment shall
be permitted
 
27


on any date during the period commencing on the
first calendar day immediately following a Payment Date to, but not
including, the LIBOR Determination Date in such calendar month,
unless consented to by Lender, (b) regardless of whether any
prepayment is made on a Payment Date or a date that is not a
Payment Date (but subject to the restrictions set forth in
foregoing clause (a)  and any other prepayment
restrictions and conditions set forth in the Loan Documents), in
connection with such prepayment Borrower shall pay to Lender,
simultaneously with such prepayment, all interest on the principal
balance of the Loan then being prepaid which would have accrued
through and including the last day of such Interest Period then in
effect notwithstanding that such Interest Period extends beyond the
prepayment date and (c) if any prepayment is made on or after
the LIBOR Determination Date in any calendar month and prior to the
first day of the Interest Period that commences in such calendar
month, Borrower shall also pay to Lender in connection with such
prepayment all interest on the Principal then being prepaid which
would have accrued through the end of the next succeeding Interest
Period. Any prepayment received by Lender on a date other than a
Payment Date shall be held by Lender as collateral security for the
Loan and shall be applied to the Debt on the next Payment
Date.

2.4 Release of
Property .

2.4.1 Release Upon Payment in
Full . Lender shall,
upon the written request and at the expense of Borrower, upon
payment in full of the Debt in accordance herewith, release or, if
requested by Borrower, assign to Borrower’s designee (without
any representation or warranty by and without any recourse against
Lender whatsoever) the Lien of the Loan Documents if not
theretofore released. In connection with the release or assignment
of the Lien, Borrower shall submit to Lender, not less than thirty
(30) days prior to the date of repayment (or such shorter time
as is acceptable to Lender), a release or assignment of Lien (and
related Loan Documents) for execution by Lender. Such release or
assignment shall be in a form appropriate in the jurisdiction in
which the Property is located and contain standard provisions
protecting the rights of the releasing lender. In addition,
Borrower shall provide all other documentation Lender reasonably
requires to be delivered by Borrower in connection with such
release, together with an Officer’s Certificate certifying
that such documentation (a) is in compliance with all Legal
Requirements, and (b) will effect such release in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. Borrower shall pay all costs,
taxes and expenses associated with the release or assignment of the
Lien of the Mortgage, including Lender’s reasonable
attorneys’ fees.

2.4.2 Release of Release
Parcel On any Payment
Date, Borrower may obtain the release of the Release Parcel from
the Lien of the Mortgage (and related Loan Documents) solely in
connection with the exercise of the purchase option by Release
Parcel Purchaser pursuant to and in accordance with the Option
Agreement, provided each of the following conditions are
satisfied:

release, Borrower shall continue to be a Special Purpose bankruptcy
Remote Entity;

(b) The Release Parcel is a legally
subdivided parcel from the Property and is on a separate tax lot

28



(c) The conveyance of the Release
Parcel does not (1) violate the Option Agreement,

continuing to be subject to the Lien of the Loan Documents after
such release (the “ Remaining Property ”)
to be in violation of any Legal Requirements, (3) create any
Liens on the Remaining Property, except for utility access, parking
and other easements necessary for infrastructure that benefit or
are necessary for the Release Parcel or (4) violate the terms

any Lease or any Permitted Encumbrance;

(d) The Purchase Price delivered to

event such funds shall be applied in accordance with
Section 3.12(a) hereof;

(e) Borrower shall submit to Lender,
not less than ten (10) days prior to the date of such
release:

release of Lien documentation for the Release Parcel (for execution
by Lender) in a form appropriate in the State and satisfactory to
Lender in its reasonable discretion;

(ii) unless such an easement already
exists of record, and provided that there are shared facilities,
access or parking, a proposed form of easement agreement(s) or
similar agreement(s) between Borrower and the transferee of the
Release Parcel, in form and substance satisfactory to Lender in its
reasonable discretion, pursuant to which Borrower shall receive and
grant such easements, and the right to enforce such restrictive
covenants, over the Release Parcel and the Remaining Property that
are reasonably required for the continued use and operation of the
Remaining Property and Release Parcel;

(iii) an updated zoning report or
other evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender that (1) the
Release Parcel and the Remaining Property constitute separate and
distinct tax lots, (2) the Remaining Property complies with
all zoning laws and all other Legal Requirements (including parking
requirements), (3) all of the Licenses, including all of the
then existing certificates of occupancy, with respect to the
Remaining Property shall remain in full force and effect after the
conveyance of the Release Parcel and (4) from and after the
date of the release, no portion of the Remaining Property shall
with respect to any contractual requirement or Legal Requirement
(including zoning approvals, building code violations and parking
requirements) be materially adversely affected in any manner by any
contractual requirement or Legal Requirement affecting the Release
Parcel to be released or, unless covered by the easement or similar
agreement(s) referred to in subclause (g)(ii) above
(including, the CCE&R Agreement referenced in Section 2.10

2.5 Payments and
Computations .

2.5.1 Making of
Payments . Each
payment by Borrower shall be made in funds settled through the New
York Clearing House Interbank Payments System or other funds
immediately available to Lender by 11:00 a.m., New York City time,
on the date such payment is due, to Lender by deposit to such
account as Lender may designate by written notice to Borrower.
Whenever any such payment shall be stated to be due on a day that
is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the
immediately preceding Business Day (notwithstanding such adjustment
of due dates, Borrower shall not be entitled to any deduction of
interest due under this Agreement, the Note or any of the other

Charge . If any
Principal, interest or other sum due under any Loan Document is not

an amount equal to the lesser of five percent (5%) of such

notice to Borrower with respect to the first such failure and the
Late Payment Charge shall not apply until five (5) days after

Protection Agreement as so required. Lender is hereby irrevocably
appointed the true and lawful attorney of Borrower (coupled with an

statement or estimate procured from the appropriate public office,
without inquiry into the accuracy of such bill, statement or
estimate or into the validity of any tax, assessment, sale,
forfeiture, tax lien or title or claim thereof. If Lender
determines in its reasonable judgment that the funds in the Tax

monthly contribution required to be made by Borrower to the Tax
Subaccount.

presentation of evidence of payment. In making any payment relating
to Insurance Premiums, Lender may do so according to any bill,
statement or estimate procured from the insurer or agent, without
inquiry into the accuracy of such bill, statement or estimate. If
Lender determines in its reasonable judgment that the funds in the

Lender’s request, if permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, turn over to Lender the security deposits (and any
interest theretofore earned thereon) under Leases, to be held by
Lender in a Subaccount (the “ Security Deposit
Subaccount ”) subject to the terms of the Leases.
Security deposits held in the
 
38


Security Deposit Subaccount will be released by
Lender upon notice from Borrower together with such evidence as
Lender may reasonably request that such security deposit is
required to be returned to a tenant pursuant to the terms of a
Lease or may be applied as Rent pursuant to the rights of Borrower
under the applicable Lease. Any letter of credit or other
instrument that Borrower receives in lieu of a cash security
deposit under any Lease entered into after the date hereof shall
(a) be maintained in full force and effect in the full amount
unless replaced by a cash deposit as hereinabove described and
(b) if permitted pursuant to any Legal Requirements, name
Lender as payee or mortgagee thereunder (or at Lender’s
option, be fully assignable to Lender).

3.10 Cash Collateral
Subaccount . If a
Cash Management Period shall have commenced (other than a Cash
Management Period continuing solely because of the continuance of a
PIP Sweep Period), then on the immediately succeeding Payment Date
and on each Payment Date thereafter during the continuance of such
Cash Management Period, all Available Cash shall be paid to Lender,
which amounts shall be transferred by Lender into a Subaccount (the
“ Cash Collateral Subaccount ”) as cash
collateral for the Debt. Any funds in the Cash Collateral
Subaccount and not previously disbursed or applied shall, upon the
termination of such Cash Management Period, be disbursed to
Borrower. Lender shall have the right, but not the obligation, at
any time (a) during the continuance of an Event of Default or
(b) subsequent to the second Calculation Date following the
commencement of a Cash Management Period (whether or not an Event
of Default is then continuing), to apply all sums then on deposit
in the Cash Collateral Subaccount to the Debt, in such order and in
such manner as Lender shall elect, including to make a prepayment
of Principal (together with the applicable Exit Fee and Spread
Maintenance Premium applicable thereto).

3.11 Grant of Security
Interest; Application of Funds . As security for payment of the Debt and the
performance by Borrower of all other terms, conditions and
provisions of the Loan Documents, Borrower hereby pledges and
assigns to Lender, and grants to Lender a security interest in, all
of Borrower’s right, title and interest in and to all Rents
and in and to all payments to or monies held in the Clearing
Account, the Cash Management Account, and all Subaccounts created
pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, the “ Cash
Management System Accounts ”). Borrower hereby grants
to Lender a continuing security interest in, and agrees to hold in
trust for the benefit of Lender, all Rents in its possession prior
to the (a) payment of such Rents to Lender or (b) deposit
of such Rents into the Cash Management System Account. Borrower
shall not, without obtaining the prior written consent of Lender,
further pledge, assign or grant any security interest in any Cash
Management System Account, or permit any Lien to attach thereto, or
any levy to be made thereon, or any UCC Financing Statements,
except those naming Lender as the secured party, to be filed with
respect thereto. This Agreement is, among other things, intended by
the parties to be a security agreement for purposes of the UCC.
Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, Lender may apply any sums in any Cash Management System
Account in any order and in any manner as Lender shall elect
without seeking the appointment of a receiver and without adversely
affecting the rights of Lender to foreclose the Lien of the
Mortgage or exercise its other rights under the Loan Documents.
Cash Management System Accounts shall not constitute trust funds
and may be commingled with other monies held by Lender. All
interest which accrues on the funds in any Cash Management System
Account (other than the Tax Subaccount and the Insurance
Subaccount) shall accrue for the benefit of Borrower and shall be
taxable to Borrower and shall be added to and disbursed in the same
manner and under the same conditions as the principal sum on which
said interest accrued. Upon repayment in full of the Debt, all
remaining funds in the Subaccounts, if any, shall be promptly
disbursed to Borrower.

Section 3.6 ;

(2) if a Cash Management Period is
continuing (other than due to a PIP Sweep Period), into the Cash
Collateral Subaccount in accordance with Section 3.11
hereof.

(b) The failure of Borrower to make
all of the payments required under clauses (i)  through
(vi)  of Section 3.12(a) hereof in full on
each Payment Date shall constitute an Event of Default under this
Agreement; provided , however , if
adequate funds are available in the Cash Management Account for
such payments, the failure by the Cash Management Bank to allocate
such funds into the appropriate Subaccounts shall not constitute an
Event of Default.
 
40



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 3.12 or elsewhere in
the Loan Documents, after the occurrence of an Event of Default,
Lender may apply all Rents deposited into the Cash Management
Account and other proceeds of repayment in such order and in such
manner as Lender shall elect. Lender’s right to withdraw and
apply any of the foregoing funds shall be in addition to all other
rights and remedies provided to Lender under the Loan
Documents.

jurisdiction where it is required to be so qualified in connection
with its properties, business and operations.

authority to execute, deliver and perform under the Loan Documents
and all the transactions contemplated thereby. The Loan Documents
to which Borrower is a party have been duly authorized, executed
and delivered by Borrower and constitute legal, valid and binding
obligations of Borrower, enforceable against Borrower in accordance
with their respective terms, except as such enforcement may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’
rights generally, and by general principles of equity (regardless
of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law). The Loan Documents are not subject to any right
of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense by Borrower or
Guarantor, including the defense of usury, nor would the operation
of any of the terms of the Loan Documents, or the exercise of any
right thereunder, render the Loan Documents unenforceable, and none
of Borrower or Guarantor have asserted any right of rescission,
set-off, counterclaim or defense with respect thereto.

. The execution, delivery
and performance of the Loan Documents by Borrower and the
transactions contemplated hereby will not conflict with any
provision of any law or regulation to which Borrower is subject, or

provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the
creation or imposition of any Lien (other than pursuant to the Loan
Documents) upon any of the property of Borrower
 
41


pursuant to the terms of, any agreement or
instrument to which Borrower is a party or by which
Borrower’s property is subject, nor will such action result
in any violation of the provisions of any statute or any order,
rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority having
jurisdiction over Borrower or any of Borrower’s property.
Borrower’s rights under the Licenses, the Franchise Agreement
and the Management Agreement will not be adversely affected by the
execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, Borrower’s
performance thereunder, the recordation of the Mortgage, or the
exercise of any remedies by Lender. Any consent, approval,
authorization, order, registration or qualification of or with any
Governmental Authority required for the execution, delivery and
performance by Borrower of, or compliance by Borrower with, the

regulation or demand of any Governmental Authority, which default
might have a Material Adverse Effect. Borrower is not in default,
and has not received notice of any event or condition that with the
giving of notice or the passage of time would constitute a default,
in any material respect in the performance, observance or
fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or conditions
contained in any Permitted Encumbrance or any other agreement or
instrument to which it is a party or by which it or the Property is
bound, and to Borrower’s knowledge, there are no defaults
under any such agreement by any other party thereto.

payments has been established hereunder or are
insured against by the Title Insurance Policy. To Borrower’s
knowledge, the Permitted Encumbrances, individually or in the
aggregate, do not (i) materially interfere with the benefits
of the security intended to be provided by the Mortgage and this
Agreement, (ii) materially and adversely affect the value,
operation or use of the Property, or (iii) impair
Borrower’s ability to repay the Loan. To Borrower’s

options to purchase or rights of first refusal affecting all or any
portion of the Property. To Borrower’s knowledge, the Survey
does not fail to reflect any material matter affecting the Property
or the title thereto. All of the Improvements which were included
in determining the appraised value of the Property lie wholly
within the boundaries and building restriction lines of the
Property, and no improvements on adjoining properties encroach upon
the Property, and no easements or other encumbrances affecting the
Property encroach upon any of the Improvements, so as to affect the
value or marketability of the Property, except those which are set

Policy. Each parcel comprising the Property is a separate tax lot
and is not a portion of any other tax lot that is not a part of the
Property. To Borrower’s knowledge, there are no pending or
proposed special or other assessments for public improvements or
otherwise affecting the Property, nor are there any contemplated
improvements to the Property that may result in such special or
other assessments. With respect to the Title Insurance Policy, to
Borrower’s knowledge, the Title Insurance Policy is in full
force and effect.

. Neither Borrower nor
any of its constituent Persons are contemplating either the filing
of a petition by it under any state or federal bankruptcy or
insolvency law or the liquidation of all or a major portion of
Borrower’s assets or properties (a “ Bankruptcy
Proceeding ”), and Borrower has no knowledge of any
Person contemplating the filing of any such petition against it or
such constituent Persons. In addition, neither Borrower nor Sole
Member, Guarantor, Key Principal, nor any principal nor Affiliate
of Borrower, Sole Member, Kanders, Dave or Key Principal, has been
a party to, or the subject of a Bankruptcy Proceeding for the past
ten (10) years. For purposes of this Section 4.7 ,

indirect equity owners of Condor Guarantor or the limited partners
of Supertel or the direct or indirect owners of Supertel’s
limited partners.

4.11 Compliance
. Borrower and to
Borrower’s knowledge, the Property (including the
Improvements) and the use thereof comply in all material respects
with all applicable Legal Requirements (including with respect to
parking, building and applicable zoning and land use laws, codes,
regulations and ordinances). To Borrower’s knowledge,
Borrower is not in default or violation of any order, writ,
injunction, decree or demand of any Governmental Authority, the
violation of which might have a Material Adverse Effect. Borrower
has not committed any act which may give any Governmental Authority
the right to cause Borrower to forfeit the Property or any part
thereof or any monies paid in performance of Borrower’s
obligations under any of the

as a hotel and other appurtenant and related uses. To
Borrower’s knowledge, in the event that all or any part of
the Improvements are destroyed or damaged, said Improvements can be
legally reconstructed to their condition prior to such damage or
destruction, and thereafter exist for the same use without
violating any zoning or other ordinances applicable thereto and
without the necessity of obtaining any variances or special
permits. No legal proceedings are pending or, to the knowledge of
Borrower, threatened with respect to the zoning of the Property.
Neither the zoning nor any other right to construct, use or operate
the Property is in any way dependent upon or related to any
property other than the Property. To Borrower’s knowledge,
all certifications, permits, licenses and approvals, including
certificates of completion and occupancy permits required of
Borrower for the legal use, occupancy and operation of the Property
for its current use (collectively, the “
Licenses ”), have been obtained and are in full
force and effect (or Borrower is legally entitled to operate the
Property in accordance with existing Licenses and promptly
following the date hereof, will obtain such Licenses in accordance
with Legal Requirements and local practice). The use being made of
the Property is in conformity with the certificate of occupancy
issued for the Property and all other restrictions, covenants and
conditions affecting the Property.

Agreement, no Major Contract has as a party an Affiliate of
Borrower.

4.13 Federal Reserve
Regulations; Investment Company Act; Bank Holding Company
. No part of the proceeds
of the Loan will be used for the purpose of purchasing or acquiring
any “margin stock” within the meaning of Regulation U
of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or for any
other purpose that would be inconsistent with such Regulation U or
any other regulation of such Board of Governors, or for any purpose
prohibited by Legal Requirements or any Loan Document. Borrower is
not (a) an “investment company” or a company
“controlled” by an “investment company,”
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended or (b) subject to any other federal or state law or
regulation which purports to restrict or regulate its ability to
borrow money. Borrower is not a “bank holding company”
or a direct or indirect subsidiary of a “bank holding
company” as defined in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956,
as amended, and Regulation Y thereunder of the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System.

4.14 Easements; Utilities and
Public Access . To
Borrower’s knowledge, all easements, cross easements,
licenses, air rights and rights-of-way or other similar property
interests (collectively, “ Easements ”),
if any, necessary for the full utilization of the Improvements for
their intended purposes have been obtained, are described in the
Title Insurance Policy and are in full force and effect without
default thereunder. The Property has rights of access to public
ways and is served by water, sewer, sanitary sewer and storm
drain
 
45


facilities adequate to service the Property for
its intended uses. All public utilities necessary or convenient to
the full use and enjoyment of the Property are located in the
public right-of-way abutting the Property, and all such utilities
are connected so as to serve the Property without passing over
other property absent a valid irrevocable easement. All roads
necessary for the use of the Property for its current purpose have
been completed and dedicated to public use and accepted by all
Governmental Authorities.

4.15 Physical Condition
. Except as may be
expressly set forth in the Physical Conditions Report, to
Borrower’s knowledge, the Property, including all buildings,
improvements, parking facilities, sidewalks, storm drainage
systems, roofs, plumbing systems, HVAC systems, fire protection
systems, electrical systems, equipment, elevators, exterior sidings
and doors, landscaping, irrigation systems and all structural
components, are in good condition, order and repair in all material
respects; there exists no structural or other material defects or
damages to the Property, whether latent or otherwise. Borrower has
not received notice from any insurance company or bonding company
of any defects or inadequacies in the Property, or any part
thereof, which would adversely affect the insurability of the same
or cause the imposition of extraordinary premiums or charges
thereon or any termination or threatened termination of any policy
of insurance or bond. No portion of the Property is located in an
area as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as an
area having special flood hazards, or, if so located the flood
insurance required pursuant to Section 7.1.1 hereof is
in full force and effect with respect to the Property. The
Improvements have suffered no material casualty or damage which has
not been fully repaired and the cost thereof fully paid.

4.16 Leases .
The Property is not subject to any
Leases other than the Operating Lease.

4.17 Fraudulent Transfer
. Borrower has not
entered into the Loan or any Loan Document with the actual intent
to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor, and Borrower has
received reasonably equivalent value in exchange for its
obligations under the Loan Documents. Giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents, the fair saleable
value of Borrower’s assets exceeds and will, immediately
following the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, exceed
Borrower’s total probable liabilities, including
subordinated, unliquidated, disputed or contingent liabilities. The
fair saleable value of Borrower’s assets is, and immediately
following the making of the Loan, will be, greater than
Borrower’s probable liabilities, including the maximum amount
of its contingent liabilities on its debts as such debts become
absolute and matured. Borrower’s assets do not and,
immediately following the execution and delivery of the Loan
Documents will not, constitute unreasonably small capital to carry
out its business as conducted or as proposed to be conducted.
Borrower does not intend to, and does not believe that it will,
incur debts and liabilities (including contingent liabilities and
other commitments) beyond its ability to pay such debts as they
mature (taking into account the timing and amounts to be payable on
or in respect of the obligations of Borrower).

pursuant to the Option Agreement and the JV Agreement), rights of
first refusal, rights of first offer or other similar rights in
favor of third parties.

We expect to receive net proceeds from this offering of approximately $279.5
million (or approximately $322.3 million if the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option in full), assuming an initial public offering price of
$20.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

Concurrently with the completion of this offering, (1) certain members of our
Manager’s senior management team and an affiliate of LoanCore Capital, LLC will
purchase an aggregate of $15 million of shares of our common stock, (2) GICRE
will purchase the lesser of (a) $150 million of shares of our common stock and
(b) a number of shares equal to 30% of the outstanding shares of our common
stock immediately following the completion of this offering and our concurrent
private offerings (excluding any shares that may be issued upon exercise of the
underwriters’ over-allotment option), and (3) Jefferies Group will purchase $40
million of shares of our common stock, in each case in separate private
placements at the initial public offering price per share of our common stock in
this offering and without the payment of any underwriting discount. Jefferies
Group is an affiliate of Jefferies LLC, one of the underwriters in this
offering.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with the $205
million in proceeds we expect to receive from our concurrent private offerings
(assuming an initial public offering price of $20.00 per share), to:

• pay approximately $161.5 million to repurchase all of our outstanding     
  subordinate debt and shares of our common stock held by the DivCore Fund; 
  and                                                                       

• pay approximately $302.2 million to fund a portion of the purchase price to
  acquire the JLC portfolio from JLC.                                    

We intend to finance the balance of the purchase price for the JLC portfolio
with a draw of approximately $258.7 million under our master repurchase
facilities.

The consideration we are required to pay for our outstanding subordinate debt
and shares of our common stock held by the DivCore Fund or the JLC portfolio,
as the case may be, may change prior to the completion of this offering and, in
the case of an increase, we intend to finance such increase from any remaining
net proceeds from this offering or additional borrowings under our master
repurchase facilities.

As of June 19, 2015, $106.7 million aggregate principal amount of our
subordinate debt is outstanding. The subordinate debt bears interest at a rate
of 12% per annum and is scheduled to mature in November 2032. As described
above, the subordinate debt will be repurchased with a portion of the net
proceeds from this offering.

Each $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of
$20.00 per share would (1) increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this
offering by approximately $14.3 million, assuming the number of shares of our
common stock offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus,
remains the same and after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated
offering expenses payable by us and (2) decrease (increase) our common stock
sold in our concurrent private offerings, as well as our common stock issued and
outstanding upon the completion of this offering, our concurrent private
offerings and our formation transactions, by approximately 488,570 (540,000)
shares. In the event of such a decrease in the initial public offering price, we
intend to increase borrowings under our master repurchase facilities in order to
finance the balance of the purchase price for the JLC portfolio. The information
discussed in this paragraph is illustrative only.


We operate in a competitive market for the origination and acquisition of
attractive investment opportunities. We compete with a variety of institutional
investors, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan
associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds,
institutional investors, investment banking firms, financial institutions,
governmental bodies and other entities and may compete with Other LoanCore
Vehicles. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably
greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Several of our
competitors have recently raised, or are expected to raise, significant amounts
of capital, and may have investment objectives that overlap with our investment
objectives, which may create additional competition for our target assets. Some
of our competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources
that may not be available to us or are only available to us on substantially
less attractive terms. Many of our competitors are not subject to the operating
constraints associated with REIT tax compliance or maintenance of an exclusion
or exemption from the Investment Company Act. In addition, some of our
competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which
could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more
lending relationships than we do. Competition may result in fewer investments,
higher prices, acceptance of greater risk, lower yields and a narrower spread of
yields over our borrowing costs. In addition, competition for attractive
investments could delay the investment of our capital.

In the face of this competition, we have access to our Manager’s professionals
through LoanCore and their industry expertise, which may provide us with a
competitive advantage in competing effectively for attractive investment
opportunities and help us assess risks and determine appropriate pricing for
certain potential investments. However, we may not be able to achieve our
business goals or expectations due to the competitive risks that we face.


Company Description
We are a commercial real estate finance company that originates, invests in and
manages commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate-related
assets. Our objective is to provide attractive long-term returns to our
investors through distributions and capital appreciation. To meet our


 objective,
we focus primarily on originating and selectively acquiring commercial mortgage
loans that are secured by institutional quality commercial real estate located
in in-fill locations that we generally intend to hold for long-term investment.

Since our predecessor’s inception, we have been managed by an affiliate of
LoanCore Capital, LLC (which we refer to, together with its affiliates, as
LoanCore), a leading originator of commercial mortgage loans founded by Mark
Finerman, our chairman, chief executive officer and president. We believe that
we will benefit significantly from our relationship with LoanCore, whose
long-standing strategic relationships, combined with its network of seasoned
loan originators, are expected to continue to generate an attractive pipeline of
investment opportunities for us in our target markets. We also expect to
capitalize on attractive opportunities arising from favorable market conditions
for non-bank financial institutions, fueled by the reduced participation of
traditional financial institutions in the supply of commercial real estate debt
capital structured to meet the needs of particular borrowers and the expected
increase in demand from borrowers for such financings. In particular, we believe
there is a significant current opportunity to finance commercial real estate
assets exhibiting strong fundamentals but requiring more customized loan
products than traditional lenders are pursuing in today’s market.

Effective upon the completion of this offering, we will be externally managed
and advised by LoanCore Advisors, LLC, or our Manager, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of LoanCore Capital, LLC. LoanCore was established in 2008 as an asset manager
focused exclusively on commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real
estate-related assets. Since its establishment in 2008 through March 31, 2015,
LoanCore originated or acquired 421 commercial mortgage loans and other
commercial real estate-related assets on behalf of its managed vehicles
(including acquisitions by the LoanCore CLO (as defined below) from Jefferies
LoanCore LLC, or JLC, as described below), representing approximately $9.9
billion in principal balance and, as of March 31, 2015, LoanCore had total
assets under management of approximately $3.3 billion.

LoanCore is led by Mark Finerman, our chairman, chief executive officer and
president, who has 28 years of experience in commercial real estate finance and
has overseen or been directly responsible for over $70 billion of commercial
real estate loan originations and acquisitions. Today, LoanCore’s team is
comprised of over 50 professionals dedicated to originating, acquiring,
evaluating and managing commercial real estate investments. The team has a
multi-disciplinary skill set with expertise in debt origination, principal
credit, private equity and capital markets. LoanCore’s origination network is
comprised of over 35 experienced professionals strategically located in major
markets across the United States and in the United Kingdom, including Greenwich,
Los Angeles, San Francisco, Orange County, Chicago, Atlanta, London and
Edinburgh.

Through LoanCore’s large and experienced team, our Manager has long-standing
strategic relationships with property owners, developers, mortgage brokers and
investors. We believe that these strategic relationships with participants in
the commercial real estate equity and debt markets provide us with unique
insight into the commercial real estate market and give us a competitive
advantage in terms of our pipeline of attractive investment opportunities. In
addition, members of our Manager’s senior management team also manage JLC, whose
strategy of originating and then securitizing commercial real estate loans
allows our Manager to provide borrowers with a full-service product offering and
broad exposure to transactions in the market, providing us with a further
competitive advantage. As of the date of this prospectus, JLC is the only other
vehicle managed by LoanCore that is actively seeking new loan investments.

Our predecessor was established in 2013 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of DivCore
Subordinate Debt Club I, LP, or the DivCore Fund, a private investment fund with
equity commitments of $331.6 million. Since our predecessor’s inception, we have
invested approximately $649.5 million in commercial mortgage loans and senior
participation interests in commercial mortgage loans and, as of March 31, 2015,
our portfolio was comprised of $459.7 million outstanding principal balance of
such loans and senior participation interests. We refer to the commercial
mortgage loans and the senior participation interests in commercial mortgage
loans that we own through our predecessor as of the date of this prospectus as
our existing portfolio. As part of our formation transactions, we will use
$161.5 million of the net proceeds from this offering (subject to adjustment as
discussed below) to repurchase all of our outstanding subordinate debt and
shares of our common stock held by the DivCore Fund. We will also use $302.2
million of the net proceeds from this offering and our concurrent private
offerings and $258.7 million in borrowings under our master repurchase
facilities to acquire from JLC a portfolio of $556.7 million outstanding
principal balance of 12 commercial mortgage loans and one B Note, which we refer
to as the JLC portfolio, for a purchase price of $560.9 million (including
accrued interest of $4.2 million) (subject to adjustment as discussed below).

As of March 31, 2015, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the completion
of this offering, our concurrent private offerings and our formation
transactions, and as adjusted to reflect any prepayments, payoffs, additional
loans and other investments and transactions made or expected to be made as of
June 19, 2015, which we refer to as a pro forma, as adjusted basis, we owned a
portfolio of 19 commercial mortgage loans and four senior participation
interests in commercial mortgage loans, all of which were floating rate, with an
outstanding principal balance of $956.5 million, and one B Note, with an
outstanding principal balance of $29.7 million. Approximately 43.5% of the
outstanding principal balance of these loans, senior participation interests and
other assets were secured or, in the case of the senior participation interests,
otherwise supported by real estate located in California and New York. Moreover,
as of March 31, 2015, on a pro forma, as adjusted basis, our portfolio had a
weighted average yield to fully extended maturity (as further described herein)
of one-month LIBOR (or three-month GBP LIBOR, in the case of two assets
denominated in GBP) plus 6.47% and a weighted average loan-to-value (as further
described herein), or LTV, of 64.1%.
