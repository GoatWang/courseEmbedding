Our entire family loved Dr. Tryon.  He will be missed. Jo Long




			
				
				Posted by: Jo Long - Cave Creek,  AZ - friend   May 27, 2017
			










I just learned of Dr. Tryon's  death today and it broke my heart. He's been my horse vet for 9 or 10 years, and was always so smart, so caring, and so capable at fixing everything up. I trusted him entirely and I feel lost on behalf of my horses with his absence. May he now be surrounded by his animal and human friends in Heaven.

My family's most sincere condolences to your family at this loss.  Dr. Tryon was not only the vet for my horse, but a nearby neighbor and such a wonderful man.  We always appreciated his straightforward approach and kindness.  He will truly be missed. ~The Wimmer Family




			
				
				Posted by: Julie Wimmer - Desert Hills,  AZ   Sep 13, 2016
			










I'm still in shock! We saw him just a few days prior to his passing for one of our horses.. You will be so missed Doc. My prayers and heartfelt condolences to the Tryon family! The Lord called home a wonderful man whose love for horses, family and friends will be long remembered!




			
				
				Posted by: Madeleine Brewer - GLENDALE,  AZ - Friend   Aug 17, 2016
			










My grandson Mark Bradley wrote often how much he cared for Tyron and what a good man he was.  He was very sad to hear of his passing.

Mrs Tryon and family, I feel blessed that our family knew Dr. Tryon. He was an amazing Vet and person. His honesty and kindness were always appreciated. The Equine world will greatly miss him. God be with you and your family in this very difficult time. Your in our thoughts and Prayers.

Dear Mrs. Tryon and family,
Although I have been away for five years, I will always treasure the special joy of knowing Doc and all of you.  Doc saved so many of us, not just our horses, but our spirit!  My love and prayers to you all.

Mrs Tryon and Family, so very saddened to hear of Dr Bill's passing. He was my vet for a long time when I was a resident of Scottsdale and Cave Creek. I knew him as an honest, decent, professional vet with a gentle way about him. May God keep all of you in his hands. He will be missed.

I knew Dr. Tryon as our Veterinarian, but over the years came to know him as a man of great faith, compassion, and kindness. I will always remember his words of comfort when my aged mare passed. He will be sorely missed. My prayers and deepest sympathy go out to his family. May they find comfort in their faith and in shared memories.Rest in Peace, Dr. Tryon, and thank you for all the care you gave our horses, and that we were blessed to have known you.

WILLIAM AUGUSTUS TRYON, II After following a resolute path through life, Bill climbed his final mountain on Earth on March 4, 2016 and then died on March 12. Born January 24, 1931 to Marion Row and Howard Albert Tryon in Elmira, NY, Bill graduated from EFA and was a member of the Princeton University Class of 1953. He played baseball, football and golf while at Princeton, was president of Tiger Inn and participated in the ROTC program there. Upon graduation, he entered the US Marine Corps as an officer and married his best friend and the love of his life, Mary Lou Hamm. She predeceased him on March 4, 2016. Bill spent over sixty years serving his clients and their families in the life insurance business, most notably as a Northwestern Mutual Life agent. In addition, he was active in numerous professional and community endeavors, including service as current chairman of the board and former president of Trayer Products, Inc., former chairman of the board of Perry and Carroll, Inc., and as a director of the Arnot Ogden Memorial Hospital, the Chemung Canal Trust Company, the NYSGA, the Elmira Rotary Club and the Community Foundation. As a result of Bill's steadfast commitment to education and area youth, he was particularly dedicated to the establishment of the Ernie Davis Scholarship. He was an integral member of the Elmira All-Sports Committee and a volunteer coach of Small-Fry basketball and Notre Dame High School golf. In December of 2013, Bill was inducted as an inaugural member to the New York State Golf Association Hall of Fame at Oak Hill in Rochester, having won the NYSGA Men's State Amateur championship three times. He was a long-time member of the Elmira City Club, the Elmira Country Club and Pine Valley Golf Club in New Jersey, where he won the Senior Club Championship in 1988. Bill leaves a loving family who is grateful to Pops for his profound love, support and example: daughter - Susan Tryon (James) Rogers of Elmira; sons - William Augustus Tryon, III of Los Angeles, CA, and Ronald James (Sally) Tryon of Columbia, SC; grandchildren - Gretchen Aynsley Rogers, Meredith Tryon (Alex Jenney) Rogers, William Augustus "Ty" (Hanna) Tryon, IV, John Theys "JT" Tryon, Trayer "Tray" Clancy Tryon, Georgia Lee Tryon, Sarah Catherine "Kitty" Tryon and James Hudson Tryon; great-grandchildren - William Augustus "Tyson" Tryon,V, James Alexander Jenney, and Augusta Baptiste Jenney; siblings - Pamela Tryon Mitchell,  Howard Tryon, Cynthia Tryon Leedham, and John Tryon; brother-in-law - Brooks Braender; nieces - Julie Bennett and Holly Hellewell; family in his heart - John Zwick. Heartfelt thanks from the family go to Ms. Jessica Balmer for the exceptional and loving care she provided to both Bill and Mary Lou. Her keen attention to details and organizational skills gave Bill continuous comfort. The epitome of "Semper Fi," Bill was an honorable man who lived his life with purpose and conviction to his family, the community and his business relationships. It is Bill's request that a private family memorial service take place at a later date. Memorial contributions may be made to the Ernie Davis Scholarship Fund c/o the Community Foundation of Elmira-Corning and the Finger Lakes, Inc. at 301 South Main Street, Horseheads, NY 14845 (www.communityfund.org); or to the Arnot Ogden Medical Center Foundation at 600 Roe Avenue, Elmira, NY 14905. Arrangements entrusted to the LYNCH FUNERAL HOME 318 WEST BROAD STREET HORSEHEADS, NY.

Myra M Williams's Experience
Title: 
               Company: DAW Books
Job Details
               Founded in 1971 by veteran paperback editor Donald A. Wollheim, along with his wife, Elsie B. Wollheim, DAW Books was the first publishing company ever devoted exclusively to science fiction and fantasy.  Now more than 30 years and more than a thousand titles later, DAW has a well-deserved reputation for discovering and publishing the hottest talents in the industry. Many stars of the science fiction and fantasy field made their debuts in the pages of a DAW book, including Tad Williams, C. J. Cherryh, Mercedes Lackey, Melanie Rawn, C.S. Friedman, Jennifer Roberson, and Tanith Lee.  Despite its high profile, DAW is still a small private company, owned exclusively by its publishers, Elizabeth R. Wollheim and Sheila E. Gilbert. Betsy and Sheila are strongly committed to discovering and nurturing new talent, and to keeping a personal "family" spirit at DAW,something they feel is all too rare in today's world of international conglomerate publishing.

Published 10:00 pm Friday, February 3, 2017




Karen Blackburn has been promoted to senior purchasing officer at Kangaroo Golf and Condar Company, manufacturing enterprises co-managed in the same Columbus factory on Hwy. 108 East. 
Blackburn joined Kangaroo in 1990 where she has held positions in production, repairs of the motorcaddies, shipping, and later in sales and supply-chain management. She is a native of Columbus and a graduate of Tryon High School. 
Blackburn was most recently the purchasing manager for Condar’s line of equipment and accessories for the woodstove and fireplace industry. 
Timothy Williams has been promoted to product development manager at Kangaroo and Condar.  He is a member of  Tryon Country Club and has long experience in the woodstove industry as well, coming to Tryon a year ago from New Hampshire where he was with a distributor, and earlier in retail at a woodstove shop. Williams is a native of Dover, N.H. and now resides in Tryon.
Karen Blackburn

Timothy Williams
In his new role he replaces Timothy R. Pope, long-time senior vice president at Kangaroo and Condar, who retired from the firm in 2016. Besides his new responsibilities for managing engineering and product-improvement projects,  Williams continues to have charge of warehousing and shipping functions and is involved in sales and marketing for both Condar and Kangaroo product lines.
Kangaroo was founded in Polk County in 1972, and is the only American manufacturer of motorcaddies, electric self-propelled golf bag carriers for walking golfers. Condar Company was founded in the 1970s in Ohio. After its acquisition by Kangaroo’s owners in 1996 it was moved to North Carolina, into Kangaroo’s plant to add a counter-seasonal business.
