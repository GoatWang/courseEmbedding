Ghee On The Go

 
We all love healthy on the go! Ghee on the go is a portable ghee option to take with you while traveling, camping, hiking, picnicking, or headed to the office. Blend in your coffee as an alternative creamer, bring with you for your toast, sandwiches or morning bagel. Because of its shelf stability, it’s also an easy and light way to pack your cooking oil for your outdoor cooking! Great for high temperatures, and for cooking over an open flame.
Also available in California Garlic and Madagascar Vanilla Bean!

Benefits of Ghee Butter






Increases Metabolism

Ghee is commonly known as a medium chain fatty acid (MCT). MCTs decrease hunger and increase metabolism. Studies show that when replacing butter with ghee, metabolism increases, and cholesterol remains unaffected. Another benefit of MCTs are improved cognitive function.


Aids in Digestion

Ghee is also rich in in butyric acid, a short chain fatty acid. Beneficial intestinal bacteria convert fiber into butyric acid and then use that for energy and intestinal wall support.Therefore, this aids in your bodies natural digestive function.


Natural Source of CLA

Ghee from grass-fed cows contains the fatty acid conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) which aids in weight loss and promotes a healthy circulatory system.


Rich in Vitamins

Ghee is rich in the healthy fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K, which are critical to bone, brain, heart, and immune system function.


100% Lactose-Free

Since all the milk solids are removed through reducing the butter and then filtering the solids out through a sieve ghee becomes a lactose-free product. Therefore people who are lactose intolerant can replace butter or margarine with 4th and Heart ghee.


Purity

Ghee is pure and does not contain any hydrogenated oils that can damage your health.

George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.
