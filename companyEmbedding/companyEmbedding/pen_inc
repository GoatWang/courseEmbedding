Any savvy marketer knows that it is crucial to put their brand in front of clients and prospects as often as possible. While this can be accomplished in an expensive and elaborate fashion - like television spots, radio and print ads, and online marketing through social media or fixed advertisements, there is a less expensive way.

Promotional marketing using free giveaway items is a sound method and has been proven to increase customer loyalty, foster better retention figures, and increase sales and profitability for companies of all sizes. The deciding factor for any marketing manager is striking the balance between cost and benefit. Sure, you can flood the market with hundreds of thousands of dollars of promotional items, but you'll end up running out of working capital quickly. Approach marketing with too stingy an approach and you'll find that no one knows about your business. You'll need to do the math and determine what your marketing budget can handle, but while you're doing that, we'll offer you a "buy one, get some free" promotion that will help you reach more customers - for less money.

This means more marketing ability, more customers reached, better pricing per unit, and more clients and prospects looking at your logo the next time they reach for their pen, desk calendar, or other promotional piece.

Much of our promotional marketing materials are proudly made here in the USA. This means consistent quality, factory direct pricing, quick delivery from state of the art warehouses, and most importantly - job growth across the nation. Our buy one, get some free promotion is exactly what your business needs to ensure consistent, sustained growth. The cost of acquiring new customers is usually estimated to be between $250 and $1000.

Starting as low as 49-cents per pen - including up to five lines of customized printing, thirty characters per line, a four color imprinting process, and twelve options for the barrel color, you'll find that the Contour pen delivers tremendous value. When compared to the BIC Widebody, the Contour offers similar features for nearly half the price.


Stationery - including notepads, memo centers, sticky note dispensers, journals, notepads, and more, are available today at National Pen! You'll find that these promotional giveaway items deliver incredible marketing leverage for your company or organization and are both affordable and high customizable. Our spiral bound notepads are available with one of several solid color or multiple color covers, and can be customized with up to 150 characters of text. You'll enjoy being able to imprint your company name, address, logo - whatever you want! 


If you're looking to deliver real utility and amazing value, consider one of our National Pen-branded sticky note notebooks. You'll show your clients that you care about them and that you're clued into the type of promotional items they'd actually want to use.

A visit to any of our plants is truly a fascinating                experience. The vast array of machines used to manufacture your order                is amazing. Machine set-up is one of the costs associated with                producing your order. Every time an order or batch of orders is                produced, we need to stop the machine and get it ready (set-up) to                produce the specific orders. What's interesting is that the cost to                set-up the machine is the basically the same for any sized order from 1                to 1,000,000. Since this fee covers the cost of stopping the machine                and setting it up for the next set of orders, that's why it is the same                for any sized order.  Top

Develops Graphene-Based Product for Use in Medical ImagingMarketwiredOctober 28, 2015ReblogShareTweetShareDEERFIELD BEACH, FL--(Marketwired - October 28, 2015) - PEN Inc. (PENC) ("PEN" or "the Company"), a global leader in enhanced performance products enabled by nanotechnology to solve everyday problems, today announced the launch of a new graphene-based product for use in the production of nuclear pharmaceuticals used as diagnostic imaging biomarkers. Patients are given these pharmaceuticals when undergoing Positron Emission Tomography (PET) which is a molecular imaging system that provides clinicians detailed information about diseases such as cancer, neurological disorders and cardiovascular disease.The new product is a thin carbon foil made of layers of graphene for use in cyclotron accelerators that produce nuclear pharmaceuticals. Developed at the Company's Applied Nanotech Inc. subsidiary in Austin, Texas, the new graphene foils were part of a DOE Phase II SBIR effort to develop carbon foils for next generation ion beam accelerators. The graphene foils can serve as either stripper foils or extraction foils, both of which are integral to the operation of ion beam accelerators."Our new graphene foils are a perfect example of how Applied Nanotech is leveraging research supporting U.S. government priorities into new business opportunities," said Dr. Scott Rickert, CEO of PEN Inc. Dr. Richard Fink, President of Applied Nanotech noted: "Our team has over 15 years of experience and know-how in the field, including our US Patent No. 6,819,034 that describes the application of graphene in the form of carbon flakes."The Company's graphene stripper foils can overcome critical limitations of alternative materials due to their exceptional physical properties such as mechanical strength, uniformity and high thermal conductivity. Tests performed on an accelerator at Michigan State University show that the lifetime of these foils are two to four times longer than those of currently available amorphous carbon foils. The graphene foils can be made as large as 13 cm (about 5 inches) in diameter and can be easily cut into smaller sections to meet the requirements of various types of equipment used to manufacture imaging biomarkers."After using Applied Nanotech's foils in our cyclotron for the last several months, we are impressed with their reliability. The material is easy to handle, cut and has no defects," said Dr. Henry Clark, Texas A&M University Cyclotron Institute.About Applied Nanotech, Inc.Applied Nanotech, Inc., a PEN Inc. company, is the PEN Design Center focused on developing new products for the PEN family of companies using nanotechnology approaches.

(PENC), was recently asked to share his experience in nanotechnology commercialization in a webinar entitled "Roadblocks to Success in Nanotechnology Commercialization -- What Keeps the Small and Medium Enterprise Community Up at Night?" The online event was sponsored by The National Nanotechnology Coordination Office (NNCO), on behalf of the Nanoscale Science, Engineering, and Technology (NSET) Subcommittee of the Committee on Technology, National Science and Technology Council (NTSC), under the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. In addition to Dr. Rickert, the webinar panel included Craig Bandes from Pixelligent Technologies, LLC, and James Lamb of Brewer Science, and it was moderated by Dr. Michael Meador, Director of the NNCO. The hour-long event touched on a number of questions from 200 nanotechnology businesspeople, academics, and others.New product development was addressed in Dr. Rickert's comments. He used a current PEN new product effort as an example of the company's approach. "Well, we're working on a product right now... that basically addresses the issue of people's health, personal health... It's a common problem, and it's getting worse. We didn't want to use traditional chemicals... It turns out there isn't a single nano company we know that knows how do to it." Rickert then explained how the synergy of PEN's two subsidiaries working together fuels the development process. "You put enough together, you brainstorm, innovate enough, you come up with something... It's not just chemistry, it's physics, biology, the combination of all those things, all the disciplines of science and engineering."The protection of intellectual property was another topic of interest, and Dr. Rickert shared PEN's IP porfolio philosophy: "It includes trademarks, service marks, as well as patents. I look at the whole portfolio, and we use all of them. Patents oftentimes are overemphasized." Dr. Rickert also offered advice for students pursuing a career in nanotechnology. "Find a good company and apprentice. Don't think you know much coming in, but listen a lot, you'll learn a lot, then you can start contributing," he said.An archived version of the webinar is expected to be posted on the NNCO website: https://www.nano.gov/SMEwebinars2015.About PEN Inc. (PENC)PEN Inc.

I ordered it in royal blue, and the barrel color and matte finish are really beautiful.

Cartridge Comparison Guide 



Cartridge Types
Ink & Toner Basics
Number of Pages & Shelf Life



Cartridge Type



Genuine or OEM (Original) Cartridges
Remanufactured Cartridges
Compatible Cartridges


Description

OEM stands for original equipment manufacturer, meaning the cartridge was made by the same company that made your printer. Original brand cartridges are very reliable and sometimes the only option if your printer is new to market or uncommon.


Remanufactured ink is a genuine brand cartridge that has gone through one cycle of use. After use, the cartridge is recycled, acquired by a remanufacturing facility and put through a rigorous professional refurbishing process. During the refurbishing process the cartridge is disassembled, thoroughly cleaned and tested for quality. It's then carefully refilled, tested again and brought back to life. Buying remanufactured prevents one less cartridge from ending up in a landfill.


A compatible cartridge is a brand new ink cartridge built by a manufacturer other than your printer. It's like buying the generic version of the genuine brand. Most are uniquely designed to differentiate from genuine cartridges. Despite any structural difference you may notice, the cartridge will still fit in your machine and print a full yield, just like the original brand.



Price Factors

Many printer manufacturers follow the razor-and-blades business model which may result in higher priced genuine cartridges.


Remanufactured ink is much cheaper than the original brand ink. It's far more cost effective to refurbish a previously used cartridge than create a new OEM from scratch.


Compatible ink is much cheaper than the original brand. Compatible suppliers don't have to worry about the additional costs that hinder OEMs like new printers or firmware, which lets them keep prices low.



Quality

Original cartridges work extremely well and are covered under a warranty by the printer manufacturer


High quality remanufactured ink will match the quality of the original, but not all remanufactured ink is created equal. Make sure you buy from a reputable supplier in order to get the absolute best results.


High quality compatible ink will match the quality of the original, but not all compatible ink is created equal. Make sure you buy from a reputable supplier in order to get the absolute best results.





What's the difference between ink and toner cartridges?



Ink Cartridges
Toner Cartridges


Printer Type
Work with inkjet printers
Work with laser printers


Material
Liquid ink
Dry powder


How it works
Inkjet printers use a series of nozzles that spray tiny drops of ink directly on the print suface
Laser toner printers use static electricity and heat to bond dry toner powder to a page


Commonly used by
Casual home users, small business and photographers
Large businesses and schools






Number of Pages You Can Print

A cartridge's page yield is the estimated number of pages you can print. Page yield is based on 5% page coverage. This means that the quoted page yield is based upon printed pages where only 5% of the page has been imprinted with ink. For example, a short memo has approximately 5% coverage. If you have a cartridge that has a yield of 500 pages, it can print 500 pages of that short memo. If you are printing letters, photos or graphics, your coverage will vary greatly and your page yield will drop significantly.



Cartridge Warranty and Shelf Life

Most ink and toner cartridges include a warranty or "best by" date on their box. Remanufactured and compatible ink cartridges can last 12-18 months unopened, and toner cartridges can last up to 3 years.



Cartridge Care and Storage

Only open a cartridge when you need it. Opened cartridges will eventually dry out, especially if the protective tape or clip has been removed. If you have an open ink cartridge around and would like to try and prevent it from drying out, place it nozzle side up in a plastic airtight tub. If your cartridge came with protective tape or a clip reapply both before storing. Place a damp cloth or paper towel in the tub, next to the cartridge and keep it stored in a cool, dark place.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
