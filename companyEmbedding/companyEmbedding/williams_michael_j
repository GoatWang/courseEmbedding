I observed Michael build a top-notch Marketing & Communications department that contributed to the organization's professional image.

Michael took ownership of several key initiatives and delivered each with significant success.  He reorganized and brought financial discipline to our Annual Membership Meeting and turned the event from a financial loss into one that generated revenue.  He also led our corporate website project and managed the delivery of a powerful e-commerce and online marketing tool.

Michael for any senior marketing role.See moreSee lessAs COO of SOLINET (now re-named to Lyrasis) I recruited Michael to create a new marketing strategy and direction for the organization.  Michael excelled at not only creating a best-in-class marketing department, but also helped transform the organization’s culture to a more business-savvy and results-focused environment.  
Additionally, I put Michael in charge of a complex e-commerce project because I knew he would deliver an excellent website and manage the project in a very pragmatic and strategic way.  Michael did not disappoint and the team delivered a robust corporate website on-time and on-budget.
