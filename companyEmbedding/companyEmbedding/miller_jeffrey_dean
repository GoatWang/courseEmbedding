              I joined Google in mid-1999, and I'm currently a Google Senior Fellow in the Research
              Group, where I lead the Google Brain project. My areas of interest include
              large-scale distributed systems, performance monitoring, compression techniques,
              information retrieval, application of machine learning to search and other related
              problems, microprocessor architecture, compiler optimizations, and development of new
              products that organize existing information in new and interesting ways. While at
              Google, I've worked on the following projects:
              
The design and implementation of the initial version of Google's advertising
                serving system.
                
The design and implementation of five generations of our crawling, indexing,
                and query serving systems, covering two and three orders of magnitude growth in
                number of documents searched, number of queries handled per second, and frequency
                of updates to the system. I recently gave a talk at WSDM'09 about some of the issues involved in
                building large-scale retrieval systems (slides).
                
The initial development of Google's 
                  AdSense for Content product (involving both the production serving system
                  design and implementation as well as work on developing and improving the quality
                  of ad selection based on the contents of pages).
                
The development of Protocol Buffers, a way of encoding structured data in an
                efficient yet extensible format, and a compiler that generates convenient wrappers
                for manipulating the objects in a variety of languages. Protocol Buffers are used
                extensively at Google for almost all RPC protocols, and for storing structured
                information in a variety of persistent storage systems. A version of the protocol
                buffer implementation has been open-sourced and is available at http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/.
                
Some of the initial production serving system work for the Google News product, working with Krishna Bharat to
                move the prototype system he put together into a deployed system. Some aspects of
                our search ranking algorithms, notably improved handling for dealing with off-page
                signals such as anchortext.
                
The design and implementation of the first generation of our automated job
                scheduling system for managing a cluster of machines.
                
The design and implementation of prototyping infrastructure for rapid
                development and experimentation with new ranking algorithms.
                
The design and implementation of MapReduce, a system for simplifying the
                development of large-scale data processing applications. A paper about MapReduce appeared in OSDI'04.
                
The design and implementation of BigTable, a large-scale semi-structured
                storage system used underneath a number of Google products. A paper about BigTable appeared in OSDI'06.
                
Some of the production system design for Google Translate, our statistical machine
                translation system. In particular, I designed and implemented a system for
                distributed high-speed access to very large language models (too large to fit in
                memory on a single machine).
                
Some internal tools to make it easy to rapidly search our internal source code
                repository. Many of the ideas from this internal tool were incorporated into our
                Google Code Search product,
                including the ability to use regular expressions for searching large corpora of
                source code.
                
The design and implementation of two generations of systems for large-scale
                training and deployment of deep learning models: DistBelief, and TensorFlow. TensorFlow is now an open source project,
                hosted on GitHub.
                
I enjoy developing software with great colleagues, and I've been fortunate to
              have worked with many wonderful and talented people on all of my work here at Google.
              To help ensure that Google continues to hire people with excellent technical skills,
              I've also been fairly involved in our engineering hiring process.
              
                I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Washington, working
                with Craig Chambers on whole-program optimization techniques for object-oriented
                languages in 1996. I received a B.S., summa cum laude from the University of
                Minnesota in Computer Science & Economics in 1990. From 1996 to 1999, I worked for
                Digital Equipment Corporation's Western Research Lab in Palo Alto, where I worked
                on low-overhead profiling tools, design of profiling hardware for out-of-order
                microprocessors, and web-based information retrieval. From 1990 to 1991, I worked
                for the World Health Organization's Global Programme on AIDS, developing software
                to do statistical modelling, forecasting, and analysis of the HIV pandemic.
              

                In 2009, I was elected to the National Academy of
                Engineering, and I was also named a Fellow of the Association
                for Computing Machinery (ACM) and a Fellow of the American Association for the
                Advancement of Sciences (AAAS).

Personal:
I've lived in lots of places in my life: Honolulu, HI; Manila, The Phillipines;
              Boston, MA; West Nile District, Uganda; Boston (again); Little Rock, AR; Hawaii
              (again); Minneapolis, MN; Mogadishu, Somalia; Atlanta, GA; Minneapolis (again);
              Geneva, Switzerland; Seattle, WA; and (currently) Palo Alto, CA. I'm hard-pressed to
              pick a favorite, though: each place has its plusses and minuses.
              
                One of my life goals is to play soccer and basketball on every continent. So far,
                I've done so in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. I'm worried
                that Antarctica might be tough, though.

Zack Snyder Once Wanted Jeffrey Dean Morgan As Batman, Which Could Still Happen
      Zack Snyder Once Wanted Jeffrey Dean Morgan As Batman, Which Could Still Happen      /FilmBlogging the Reel World News Featured Reviews Trailers Cool Stuff /Filmcast NewsReviewsTrailersCalendar/FilmcastCool StuffCastingComic BookRemakesSci-FiSequelsEarly BuzzTVStar WarsSuperhero BitsArtBooksGadgetsGearToysOtherThe ShowAfter DarkThe Tobolowsky FilesBonus EpisodesInterviewsAudio CommentariesLive Broadcasts     Zack Snyder Once Wanted Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Batman, and It Could Still HappenPosted on Friday, October 14th, 2016 by Ethan AndertonRight now Zack Snyder is hard at work on Justice League over in Iceland, where we just got our first look at Amber Heard as Mera, the Queen of Atlantis. The film marks the continuation of the DC Extended Universe that began with Man of Steel and grew with Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. The latter film allowed Zack Snyder to realize his dream of bringing his take on Frank Miller’s more grizzled version of The Dark Knight to the big screen. The Caped Crusader ended up being played by Ben Affleck, but at one point Snyder had someone else in mind, and it’s actually still possible for him to follow through on that.While promoting his new film Desierto, actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan revealed to Cinema Blend that while he was on the Watchmen press tour, Zack Snyder told him, “My dream is to do the Frank Miller Batman,” and “You would be an awesome Batman.” While it would appear that his moment has passed, Zack Snyder has actually left the door open for Morgan to still become Batman.You might think that having the actor cast as Thomas Wayne, who is now dead, would not allow for us to see Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Batman. But a well-known comic book storyline involving another member of Justice League could still allow for him to become another version of The Dark Knight.In the DC Comics universe, there’s a major story arc called Flashpoint involving The Flash going back in time to stop his mother from being killed. His actions set off a chain of events that have a huge impact on the rest of the DC Comics universe, one of which being that young Bruce Wayne has died instead of his parents, inspiring Thomas Wayne to take up the mantle of Batman instead.And thus we have the Flashpoint Batman who could be played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan. And he’s absolutely ready to suit up: “Maybe when he cast me that was kind of the goal. Hopefully DC can figure this all out, and in a few years I can come back and do a Flashpoint Batman! I would love it. That would be great.” However, don’t get your hopes up yet, because he also notes, “I have not had any big discussions with him about [Flashpoint].”The possibility of seeing a Flashpoint Batman is extremely far down the road. Right now DC Entertainment needs to focus on keeping the DC Extended Universe on track and making up for some of the mistakes they made in Man of Steel, Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad. It looks like there’s some solid course correction in the works with Justice League and Wonder Woman, but we’ll see how things continue from there.The good news is we’ve already seen The Flash (Ezra Miller) time travel in Batman v Superman, so it’s not out of the realm of possibility for Flashpoint to happen. The CW series version of The Flash is currently dealing with that storyline, but it would play out in a much different way with all of the other members of Justice League involved this time. But let’s get through the rest of the Justice League standalone franchise starters first before we start thinking about that.Would you like to see Flashpoint happen on the big screen at some point?
