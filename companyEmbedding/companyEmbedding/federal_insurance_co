Hi, my name is Brent Fulk. I have been an insurance agent with GEICO since 2003 and your local San Jose insurance agent since 2007. My office serves the Silicon Valley Area, from Fremont to San Mateo, and Monterey through the South Bay. We can help insure your home and auto as well as your motorcycle, boat, and RV.

We understand the great diversity of the San Francisco Bay Area and the South Bay. At the San Jose local GEICO office, we have agents who speak Spanish, Vietnamese, Tagalog, and Hindi. When you get a quote through our office, we'll make sure all your eligible discounts are applied. We make doing business with GEICO easy for you.

About FEDERAL INSURANCE COMPANY

   Through subsidiaries, Chubb Limited (formerly ACE Limited) sells property/casualty insurance, life insurance, and reinsurance through subsidiaries around the globe. It primarily provides property/casualty insurance to commercial and personal customers. Policies offered include general liability, homeowners, auto, accident, workers' compensation, and specialty crop and marine coverage. The company's ACE Tempest Re businesses provide reinsurance to property/casualty insurers in North America and Europe. In early 2016 the former ACE Limited acquired the US's Chubb Corporation for $28 billion and took the Chubb name.
   Geographic Reach

   The North American insurance segment, which includes property/casualty subsidiaries ACE USA, ACE Bermuda, and ACE Canada, is Chubb's largest business segment accounting for about 40% of revenue. The company's ACE International and ACE Global Markets property/casualty insurance units reach into the rest of the world, while its smaller ACE Life insurance division primarily operates in emerging markets in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. ACE Private Risk Services is a property/casualty division catering to high-net-worth individuals
  

   With its operating subsidiaries located in more than 50 countries, Chubb serves customers in more than 170 nations.
  

   ACE moved its place of incorporation home from the Caymans to Switzerland in 2008. It kept executive offices in Bermuda and New York.
  
Strategy

   Chubb regularly looks to expand its product offerings and geographical presence through acquisitions and organic measures.
  

   To expand in high-growth geographic markets, it established new offices in Turkey and Panama in 2009 and 2008. Then, in early 2012 the company opened a representative office in Kiev that will allow it to directly engage in the Ukrainian insurance market.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions

   In recent years Chubb has focused its geographic expansion on smaller acquisitions in emerging global marketplaces. In 2011 it entered two new markets for life insurance in North Asia after acquiring New York Life's life insurance operations in Hong Kong and South Korea for about $425 million.
  

   In 2012 Chubb acquired Indonesian general insurance firm Asuransi Jaya Proteksi for some $130 million. It closed its purchase of Mexican surety insurer Fianzas Monterrey from New York Life for $285 million in 2013, as well as its purchase of another Mexican insurance firm, ABA Seguros, from Ally Financial for $865 million.
  

   In 2015 the company acquired the Fireman's Fund US personal lines business catering to high-net-worth customers. The deal, valued at $365 million and providing access to more than 120,000 premier personal lines customers, expanded Chubb's position as one of the largest personal lines insurers catering to wealthy individuals.
  

   Later that year the company announced a much larger deal with plans to acquire insurer Chubb, which specialized in serving wealthy clients, for $28.3 billion. The combined company, which operates under the Chubb name, became one of the world's largest property/casualty firms. ACE shareholders own 70% of the new company.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
