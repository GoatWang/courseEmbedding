About ProcessUnity




























































About UsAbout ProcessUnity





About ProcessUnity Next-Generation Governance, Risk and
Compliance Solutions…For All Organizations
Good governance, risk and compliance (GRC) management practices are good for business. Unfortunately, most organizations today continue to struggle to implement effective and efficient programs. Why? Small- to mid-size organizations can’t justify the big-ticket costs for software and services, so they stick with the spreadsheets they’ve been using for years. Larger organizations aspire to create that “single system of record” for their GRC programs, which usually results in long implementation times, never-ending professional services engagements and applications that just never seem to have all of the features and functions they should.
ProcessUnity is changing GRC – making good governance, risk and compliance practices and tools available to organizations of all sizes…at a reasonable price. Our team grew up in GRC: some of us ran risk and compliance programs, some of us developed and implemented GRC software. Throughout our careers, we have all seen what works and what doesn’t. We put our collective experience together and built next-generation technology that is changing the market.
It all starts with our platform…our cloud-based platform. It’s a powerful collection of capabilities – document management, workflow, interactive reporting, and more – combined with the availability, scalability and security that software-as-a-service applications can provide. In a nutshell, our platform is an enabling toolkit that can be used to build almost anything related to GRC automation. But, the truth is most organizations don’t want a toolkit. They don’t have the time or the expertise to build their own apps. They want results…now.
So our experts built the apps based on industry best practices. Leveraging the power of our platform, our product team developed a suite of results-ready solutions designed to tackle a number of GRC challenges, including Third-Party Risk Management, Policy & Procedure Management, Compliance Management and even newer paradigms such as Product & Service Offer Management. While each solution is different in terms of what it does, they all share similar characteristics: they are extremely easy to use; they are configurable by business users; and they deploy very quickly.
Our intuitive user interface reduces the amount of training users need to get up to speed. Total configurability means that day-to-day risk and compliance professionals can fine-tune the application to fit their particular needs – without having to call someone in IT (or ProcessUnity). Ease-of-use plus configurability give us a tremendous advantage over other systems: We can deploy faster than anyone else. Even our most complex implementations are completed in weeks, not months or even years.
We also price differently. We offer multiple pricing tiers, allowing customers to purchase only the features, functions and user licenses they need. Getting started with GRC automation? Choose our Silver or Gold edition packages and get your program running quickly. Have a robust program with thousands of stakeholders and complex requirements? Our advanced Platinum and Enterprise packages have you covered.
Our approach and hard work is paying off. Our clients are getting real results and our customer list is growing at a tremendous rate. As one would expect, the majority of our customers are companies in financial services, healthcare, pharmaceuticals and other highly regulated industries. We work with organizations as small as community banks and as large as Fortune 50 organizations. Customer success is our ultimate goal, so we’re proud of our high customer satisfaction scores and retention rates.
Is your organization ready for next-generation governance, risk and compliance? Contact us today to get started.

ProcessUnity Recognized by Gartner as a Challenger  in 2017 IT Vendor Risk Management Magic Quadrant
ProcessUnity’s evaluation was based on Completeness of Vision and Ability to Execute



















July 20, 2017 10:01 ET

 | Source: ProcessUnity, Inc.






CONCORD, Mass., July  20, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ProcessUnity, a leading provider of cloud-based solutions for risk management, today announced that it has been positioned by Gartner, Inc. as a Challenger in the June 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for IT Vendor Risk Management. ProcessUnity Vendor Cloud is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application that identifies and remediates risks posed by third-party service providers. The cloud-based solution automates key phases of the vendor risk management lifecycle from initial onboarding and due diligence, through ongoing assessments, service-level agreements (SLAs) and contract management. (Click here to view a five-minute video demonstration.) “We believe being named a Challenger in ProcessUnity’s first-ever Magic Quadrant appearance is tremendous validation for our approach to Third-Party Risk Management,” said Ed Thomas, Vice President of Marketing at ProcessUnity. “Our easy-to-use, quick-to-deploy and reasonably priced tools are helping companies as small as community banks and as large as Fortune 500 corporations assess more vendors, more thoroughly in less time.” Gartner writes, “High-profile failures of IT service providers, increasing rollouts of enterprise risk management programs, and third-party access to sensitive and regulated information continue to fuel demands in the IT VRM market. While the predominant market driver remains regulatory requirements, lesser regulated or nonregulated entities are increasingly concerned with the operational and reputational risks to which their vendors expose them.” Additionally, Gartner believes, “By 2020, 75% of Fortune Global 500 companies will treat vendor risk management as a board-level initiative to mitigate brand and reputation risk.” For more information on ProcessUnity Vendor Cloud and third-party risk management visit www.processunity.com. About the Magic Quadrant Gartner does not endorse any vendor, product or service depicted in its research publications, and does not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the highest ratings or other designation. Gartner research publications consist of the opinions of Gartner’s research organization and should not be construed as statements of fact. Gartner disclaims all warranties, expressed or implied, with respect to this research, including any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
