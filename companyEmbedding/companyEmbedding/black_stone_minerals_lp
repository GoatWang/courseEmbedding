Style Scores:



B Value | A Growth | A Momentum | A VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

BusinessBSM is one of the largest owners of oil and natural gas mineral interests in the United States.
BSM's principal business is maximizing the value of its existing portfolio of mineral and royalty assets through active management and expanding its asset base through acquisitions of additional mineral and royalty interests.

BSM maximizes value through the marketing of its mineral assets for lease, creative structuring of those leases to encourage and accelerate drilling activity, and selectively participating alongside its lessees on a working-interest basis.
BSM's primary business objective is to grow its reserves, production, and cash generated from operations over the long term, while paying, to the extent practicable, a growing quarterly distribution to its unitholders.
Mineral & royalty interestsBSM's mineral and royalty interests consist of mineral interests in approximately 14.5 million acres, with an average 48.1% ownership interest in that acreage, NPRIs in 1.2 million acres, and ORRIs in 1.4 million acres.
These non-cost-bearing interests include ownership in approximately 40,000 producing wells.
BSM also own non-operated working interests.
BSM recognizes oil and natural gas revenue from its mineral and royalty and non-operated working interests in producing wells when the oil and natural gas production from the associated acreage is sold.
BSM's other sources of revenue include mineral lease bonus and delay rentals, which are recognized as revenue according to the terms of the lease agreements.
Commodity pricesOil and natural gas prices have been historically volatile based upon the dynamics of supply and demand. In the second half of 2014, oil prices began a rapid decline as global supply outpaced demand.
In addition, in late November 2014, OPEC announced that it would not adjust its production targets.
The oil price decline continued into 2015, but WTI benchmark prices appear to have stabilized in the range of $45-$50 per Bbl during the period of January 2015 through March 2015.
If WTI remained at the midpoint of this range throughout 2015, our realized oil price, excluding the effects of hedges, would decrease approximately 50% compared to 2014. Although natural gas prices improved in 2014 compared to 2013, natural gas continues to also be impacted by an imbalance between supply and demand across North America.

During the three months ended March 31, 2015, Henry Hub spot natural gas prices ranged from $2.62 per MMBtu to $3.32 per MMBtu.
However, more recently, Henry Hub spot prices have settled on the lower end of that range. If natural gas prices remained depressed, at around $2.60 per MMBtu, our realized natural gas price, excluding the effect of hedges, would decrease by approximately 40% compared to 2014.
Intellectual propertyNone
CompetitionThe oil and natural gas business is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisition of reserves, the acquisition of minerals and oil and natural gas leases and personnel required to find and produce reserves.
Many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national, or worldwide basis.
Certain of BSM's competitors may possess financial or other resources substantially larger than BSM possesses.
BSM's ability to acquire additional minerals and properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon its ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment.
Oil and natural gas products compete with other forms of energy available to customers, primarily based on price.
These alternate forms of energy include electricity, coal, and fuel oils.
Changes in the availability or price of oil and natural gas or other forms of energy, as well as business conditions, conservation, legislation, regulations, and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas.
5% shareholders pre-IPOCamden Energy Limited Partnership 8.1%
Thomas L. Carter, Jr. 8.6%
DividendsCash Distribution Policy
The partnership agreement generally provides that BSM will pay any distributions each quarter during the subordination period in the following manner:
• first, to the holders of preferred units in an amount of approximately $25.00 per preferred unit;

• second, to the holders of common units, until each common unit has received the applicable minimum quarterly distribution in the amounts specified below plus any arrearages from prior quarters; and
• third, to the holders of subordinated units, until each subordinated unit has received the applicable minimum quarterly distribution.
Use of proceedsBSM expects to receive $422 million from its IPO and use it for the following:
to repay all of the indebtedness outstanding under its credit facility, which was $389.0 million as of March 31, 2015. BSM expects that at the time of completion of the offering, the outstanding balance on its credit facility will approximately equal the net proceeds of this offering. If the net proceeds should exceed the outstanding balance, this excess will be used to fund future capital expenditures.
