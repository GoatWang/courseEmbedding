The DragonFly 2020 3D Printer







Professional PCB and Electronics Prototyping, Redefined


















Truly Bringing "Print" to Printed Circuit Boards












undefined

 
Nano Dimension has developed a PCB 3D printer and a suite of nanotechnology conductive and dielectric inks specifically for PCB professionals, enabling the ability to take full control of PCB development and shortening time to market. 
 
Nano Dimension's DragonFly 2020 3D printer is a highly accurate and versatile inkjet deposition and curing system for printing professional multilayer circuit boards. The DragonFly 2020 3D Printer represents an evolution unlike anything the industry has seen before. The innovative hardware, dedicated nano-inks and novel software offers virtually limitless design flexibility to a wide range of research and development, prototyping and custom manufacturing projects. Our highly conductive silver nano inks for electronics printing are also available separately.

The rapid prototyping capabilities of the DragonFly 2020 3D Printer for professional 3D printed electronics completely transforms the ways product development teams work. No more waiting days or weeks for a custom PCB prototype that has to be fabricated offsite. The DragonFly 2020 3D Printer offers the flexibility to print an entire board or just part of a circuit. You can develop the RF and digital sections of the board in parallel, test and iterate on the fly. The DragonFly 2020 3D Printer empowers progress and encourages innovation, lessening development risks and enabling faster times-to-market - and ultimately, better products.

Circuit Board Prototyping, Simplified















We understand the challenges of creating a professional multilayer PCB. You risk exposing your intellectual property to outsiders and have to negotiate high, upfront set-up prices. It's a frustrating balance of speed, complexity, creativity, efficiency and cost. Until now.
 
That's why we developed the DragonFly 2020 3D Printer.
Our latest white paper PCB Prototyping: In-house or Outsource? takes an even more in-depth look at the benefits that the different levels of an organisation, from management to design, can maximise from in-house rapid PCB prototyping.

FAQ











#1: Does Nano Dimension also print using dielectric inks? 
Yes.  
 
#2: Are there any limitations for the PCB because of the silver-based nano inks, for example a maximum current or specific temperatures ranges? Or can the printed PCB used like regular copper based PCBs?
The ink will be engineered to behave as similarly to copper as chemistry allows. 
 
#3: Can the printed PCBs be soldered like any other PCB today?  
Yes.  
 
#4: Are there any min/max numbers about the number of layers and the thickness?  
There is no limit to the number of layers beyond the mechanical height of the z axis.
 
#5: How green is the process? How do I deal with remains of the inks and out-of-use printed PCBs? Do I have to dispose the inks or the printed PCBs as hazardous waste?  
We're keeping the process as green as possible. The additive approach of 3D printing avoids the production chemicals and waste associated with standard PCB production.
 
#6: Can you provide figures about the printing speed?   
This is dependent on the number of layers, the complexity of the circuits and the board size. A large, complex, 10-layer board can take several hours to print.
 
#7: Is there a special process to for curing the inks or is it just some kind of dry out?  
An integrated sintering process cures the inks to attain the right conductivity and adhesion.
 
#8: Will the final software be able to import Gerber files and able to print them directly?   
Yes it works with Gerber files and all that is needed is to set up the print job.  
 
#9: When will the first printers be available for preorder?  
Nano Dimension began delivering the DragonFly 2020 3D Printer to beta customers in Q2, 2017. 
The company is currently receiving pre-orders. 
 
#10: Do you plan to sell different-sized machines with different sized printing areas?  
Eventually yes, but for now the standard measurements are ca. 20cm x 20cm
 
#11: Do you have a pricing scheme or range for the printer and the inks?  
Please contact us for further details and discussion. 
 
#12: What are the printing specifications?  
The printer prints ca. 80-100 µm traces, ca. 150 µm interconnections, and a minimum layer thickness of 3 µms.

Advanced Materials 







 Dielectric Inks & Nano Particle Conductive Inks Engineered for Printed Electronics

























Highly Conductive Silver Inks for Inkjet Printers







We are proud to present our state-of-the-art AgCite™ family of nanoparticle silver inks with unparalleled conductivity for inkjet deposition.
 
Nano Dimension’s ink scientists can reliably extract 10-100+ nanometer-sized particles of pure silver. Our ability to control the size, shape and dispersion of the silver nanoparticles in accordance with the printing requirements of our customers is critical in formulating the best conductive inks available. This allows us to achieve the highest ink performance optimization in properties such as conductivity, adhesion and flexibility, in a wide range of applications including RFID and OLED, from the particle level all the way through formulation to the printing process itself. 
 
The AgCite™ family of inks sinters at low temperatures and is suited to a broad range of substrates including paper, polymers, glass and ITO. With unparalleled conductivity, less ink is needed for the same application requirement, bringing about major cost-savings.
 
 Download AgCite Ink Brochure








































Dielectric Inks for Inkjet Printers










Nano Dimension has also developed a suite of dielectric inks to meet the advanced needs of the electronics community. The insulating properties of these materials is just as important and advanced as the conductive properties of the conductive inks.
 
For electronic circuits to function properly, properties relating to interference, adhesion, thermal dissipation and flammability have to be engineered into the ink. Our one-part insulating dielectric material provides solutions suited for both rigid and flexible circuits. For more detailed information, download our Dielectric Ink Brochure.
 
 Download Dielectric Ink Brochure


























Why Nano Inks?


















Conductivity
Highest conductivity in the market - 35,700,000 S/m


















Controllable
Nano Dimension can control the shape, size, and distribution of particles


















Customization
Custom-formulated inks will work with your specific printer and substrate


















Complex
We make our own inks, which is critical to understanding their complexity 




































Electronic Materials for Antennas & RFID Applications







Achieve New Levels of Efficiency and Flexibility










 
Nano Dimension provides conductive inks specifically tailored for use in antennas, including radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology for a variety of devices including smart cards, various ID products, arrays and more.
 
The AgCite™ family of nanoparticle silver inks, deposited by contactless, digital, inkjet printing, deliver outstanding results. Third party tests demonstrate the inks matching industry efficiency benchmarks with 89% antenna efficiency at 2 GHz.   
 
As well as delivering unparalleled conductivity, this process replaces the etching process used for making most copper antennas, which is expensive, inflexible and creates toxic waste. Additional benefits include digital manufacturing flexibility as well as excellent printed line and space resolution. This allows antenna designers more flexibility when addressing the demanding requirements of today’s antenna applications.
 










































Chemistry 101















Nano Dimension boasts two fully-equipped ink laboratories. One focuses on the research and production of conductive inks, while the other focuses on dielectric inks. The labs primarily generate silver nanoparticle inks and nanopolymers for use with the DragonFly 2020 PCB 3D Printer, and also work with a variety of customers on their advanced and customized ink requirements.  
 
Our silver nanoparticle inkjet inks are based on a breakthrough wet-chemistry process licensed exclusively from Yissum of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. This clean and efficient process begins with a silver precursor raw material, and provides Nano Dimension with exceptional control over the types, shapes and sizes of the silver nanoparticles.
