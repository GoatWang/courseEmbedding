Product Management Assessments 

Our Product Management Assessments can help take your company or team to the next level!
Get A Free Estimate
Product Management is one of the most important strategic functions in a company. Great Product Management leads to more successful and more profitable products, happier customers and long-term winning strategies to conquer markets. It also ensures that your company doesn’t waste money developing, marketing and selling products that don’t meet customer needs and should not have been built in the first place.
Optimal Product Process Assessment
Our Product Management Assessments ensure that you have the following elements in place:

An effective product process (as lightweight as possible for your culture)
A great team who understands their role and is trained to perform at a high level of competence
Excellent standardized tools and templates to ensure that deliverables can be created quickly
Systems in place for ongoing company improvements/learning and leveraged collaboration

The 280 Group Product Management Assessments are a service where we do an in-depth analysis of the Product Management function at your company (process, people and tools), provide concrete recommendations for dramatically improving its effectiveness, and assist you with implementing key changes. By working with the 280 Group, you can ensure that you are implementing best practices and that product management will help drive your company’s overall success.
To perform the Product Management Assessments, the 280 Group assigns a team of senior consultants to work with your company. Our rapid and thorough assessment will provide you with a plan to dramatically improve Product Management at your company in a short period of time.
Let the 280 Group help you build a plan to optimize your company’s Product Management function
The deliverable for the assessment is:

Presentation to stakeholders and/or executive staff
Summary of findings
Recommendations
In-depth plans for additional work to execute the recommendations.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

One Team. A World of Opportunity.

As one of the world’s largest and most active venture capital firms, NEA has developed deep domain expertise and insight into our industries of focus.  We channel that knowledge into every technology and healthcare investment we make -- at any stage, in any location, around the globe. 













In Key Industries

Across our portfolio, visionary entrepreneurs are at the helm of current and future industry leaders, fueling the development of technologies that will keep the U.S. at the forefront of innovation. Some of the most successful business leaders in each of these industries have joined forces with NEA as Venture Partners, bringing tremendous sector insight and deep networks.





Technology




We’ve built a premier IT franchise by fueling the growth of disruptive technologies and market leaders across several key sectors, including electronics, consumer technology, enterprise mobility, virtualization, tech-enabled services, SaaS and cloud computing.


View Technology




Healthcare




With a focus on biopharmaceuticals, healthcare services/IT and medical devices, we have long track record of partnering with companies that have pioneered transformative innovations in healthcare, such as balloon angioplasty and laparoscopic surgery.


View Healthcare








Across All Stages










NEA’s proven investment strategy spans all stages of a company's growth, from seeding innovations in emerging markets to funding early-stage companies in high-growth markets to fueling the growth of market leaders. Any stage of growth is the right stage to partner with NEA. We can add value and offer expert guidance throughout your company’s lifecycle—whether your big idea is at its inception or has already progressed to be a viable reality.






At A Global Scale

The last two decades have marked the largest expansion of the global economy the world has ever seen, with more than half of the expansion attributable to emerging economies. With bi-coastal U.S. operations and a growing international presence, NEA stays on the cutting edge of new technologies as we expand our global network.

Growing up on Both Coasts

More than 35 years ago, our founders formed the industry’s first truly bi-coastal firm. Our US presence has grown to include offices in Menlo Park, Washington, DC, New York and Chicago. This enables NEA to find the best opportunities at the source of innovation, and to build a vast network of resources and expertise from coast to coast.





Thinking Globally

NEA actively invests in emerging markets, particularly in India and China, and is continuously expanding our global network to benefit companies in our portfolio--many of which are operating internationally from the earliest stages. Today our investing activities span six continents, and we think the world seems a little flatter every day.








Key Benefits




Network
People are the driving force behind every successful business--including ours. This is what 'value add' means.



Deep roots and strong ties matter, and partnering with NEA means joining a thriving network of business leaders, successful entrepreneurs, technologists, vendors and potential customers. Entrepreneurs often tell us that our network is even more valuable than the capital we invest. We're committed to making sure that's the case.





Scale
Over 35 years, $17 Billion and more than 500 liquidity events, we've learned that size does have its advantages. 



We use ours to create a global platform that gives us the insight, the flexibility and the efficiency to invest in big ideas--no matter where they are, or how far along they might be. Our scale enables us to seed innovations in emerging markets, fund early-stage companies in high-growth sectors, and fuel the growth of market leaders.





Depth
We are investors... and operators, technologists and entrepreneurs. We really do know it when we see it.   



Nobody ever said sourcing innovation, spotting big market opportunities and building great businesses was easy--it's not! And doing it well for nearly four decades is no fluke. By combining deep sector knowledge, a collaborative team structure, and the broad perspective scale brings, we show up early, dive deep and make things happen.

United States

Geographic diversity has long been a hallmark of NEA, founded on both U.S. coasts in 1977 and still deeply rooted in Silicon Valley and the Mid-Atlantic. Ask someone where NEA is headquartered, and you'll see how ingrained that dual citizenship is--they'll think about it for a minute, and then either admit they don't know or err on the side of their home office. It makes for some fierce sports rivalries, but it also makes us better investors. We have cross-functional, cross-country collaboration down to such a science it's bordering on art. We want to find and fund innovation at its source, and innovation is everywhere. That pursuit of innovation and great partnerships has led us to spend a lot more time in certain hubs, and over the last few years NEA has established small offices in New York and Chicago.




Menlo Park

Innovation is everywhere, but Silicon Valley is still the undisputed hub of the venture capital and startup ecosystems--and few would dispute that Sand Hill Road is to venture capital what Wall Street is to the stock markets. NEA's founding West Coast office was in San Francisco, and while we're active up and down the west coast, Sand Hill Road has been home since the mid-80s.




Washington, DC

NEA's East Coast roots are spread across the metropolitan DC region, with a founding office in Baltimore and a second location in Virginia. Our dual residency came to an end in 2007, when our East Coast investing staff moved into our current Friendship Heights location. Our operations team has stayed close to the firm's Baltimore roots with an office in nearby Timonium.






San Francisco

In 2016 we harkened back to our city roots and opened an office in San Francisco. The office is located in the South Park neighborhood—a  recognized startup and VC mecca in the area. The space is designed as collaborative and approachable work environment that serves as a landing place for NEA team members, and also provides us with an awesome spot to host meetings and events.




New York

In recent years, we've been spending more and more time in New York. The region's vibrant startup ecosystem, coupled with top tech and design talent, has made it a hub for digital media and consumer internet companies. We occupied office space in 2011, and earlier this year we launched NEA Studio to support entrepreneurial designers as they make the leap to company formation and funding.






Boston

Boston has undoubtably established itself as a force within the innovation ecosystem. We have a history of partnering with New England-based startups, and currently have over two dozen active portfolio companies in Boston and surrounding areas. In 2013, we decided to formalize our relationship with the city by opening an office in the Cambridge biopharma hub, Kendall Square.




Chicago

Our portfolio spans six continents, but we have invested more capital in Chicago than in any other municipality outside of Silicon Valley. We like Chicago's unique entrepreneurial spirit--the blend of midwest sensibilities and leading edge tech that has transformed legacy industries like printing and logistics. To better serve our local portfolio, we opened a small office here in 2012.

Product Management Assessments 

Our Product Management Assessments can help take your company or team to the next level!
Get A Free Estimate
Product Management is one of the most important strategic functions in a company. Great Product Management leads to more successful and more profitable products, happier customers and long-term winning strategies to conquer markets. It also ensures that your company doesn’t waste money developing, marketing and selling products that don’t meet customer needs and should not have been built in the first place.
Optimal Product Process Assessment
Our Product Management Assessments ensure that you have the following elements in place:

An effective product process (as lightweight as possible for your culture)
A great team who understands their role and is trained to perform at a high level of competence
Excellent standardized tools and templates to ensure that deliverables can be created quickly
Systems in place for ongoing company improvements/learning and leveraged collaboration

The 280 Group Product Management Assessments are a service where we do an in-depth analysis of the Product Management function at your company (process, people and tools), provide concrete recommendations for dramatically improving its effectiveness, and assist you with implementing key changes. By working with the 280 Group, you can ensure that you are implementing best practices and that product management will help drive your company’s overall success.
To perform the Product Management Assessments, the 280 Group assigns a team of senior consultants to work with your company. Our rapid and thorough assessment will provide you with a plan to dramatically improve Product Management at your company in a short period of time.
Let the 280 Group help you build a plan to optimize your company’s Product Management function
The deliverable for the assessment is:

Presentation to stakeholders and/or executive staff
Summary of findings
Recommendations
In-depth plans for additional work to execute the recommendations.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business

3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.
