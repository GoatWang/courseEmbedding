Why oil prices scored their biggest one-day rally of 2017

Jul. 25, 2017 at 3:05 p.m. ET
by Myra P. Saefong









Oil prices notch biggest one-day gain of the year
Oil prices rallied Tuesday to notch their largest one-day dollar and percentage gain since December, according to FactSet data. Prices found support on the back of news Monday that Saudi Arabia plans to cut its crude exports and Nigeria agreed to limit its production. Expectations for a slowdown in U.S. production, after Anadarko Petroleum Corp.  cut its full-year spending budget, also contributed to price gains. September WTI crude  rose $1.55, or 3.3%, to settle $47.89 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Anadarko shares down 3% after company posts wider-than-expected loss
Shares of Anadarko Petroleum Corp.  fell more than 3% late Monday after the oil and gas exploration and production company reported a larger-than-expected second-quarter loss. Anadarko said it lost $415 million, or 76 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with a loss of $1.36 a share in the second quarter of 2016. Adjusted for certain items, the company lost $423 million, or 77 cents a share, in the quarter. Revenue reached $2.7 billion in the quarter, compared with $1.92 billion a year ago. Sales Analysts polled by FactSet had expected the company to report an adjusted loss of 36 cents a share on sales of $2.2 billion. Anadarko also cut its investments by $300 million for the full year and adjusted full-year sales-volume guidance to reflect recent asset sales and deferred production connected with the company's response earlier this year to a fatal home explosion in Colorado linked to one of the company's wells. "We feel this is a prudent move," the company said in a statement. Shares ended the regular trading session up 0.3%.

Anadarko's stock tumbles as explosion prompts closure of over 3,000 wells for weeks
Shares of Anadarko Petroleum Corp.  tumbled 6.3% in active midday trade Thursday to a nine-month low, after the oil and gas exploration company said it would close more than 3,000 wells in response to the last week's fatal home explosion in Firestone, Colo. The stock changed hands recently at $56.13, the lowest level seen since Sept. 16, while volume spiked to 7.9 million shares, or more than double the full-day average. The company said late Wednesday that the wells, which account for total production of about 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, could remain shut for two to four weeks while inspections and testing of equipment can be conducted. Analyst Paul Grigel at Macquarie Research reiterated his overweight rating on the stock, saying he believed any impact from the shut in production will be limited. "We believe the ultimate impact on financials and the company is likely to be de minimis but do recognize this will likely be a near-term focus until the investigation by local fire officials is complete," Grigel wrote in a note to clients. The stock has plunged 19% year to date, while the SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF  has shed 11% and the S&P 500  has gained 6.5%.

Why oil prices scored their biggest one-day rally of 2017

Jul. 25, 2017 at 3:05 p.m. ET
by Myra P. Saefong









Oil prices notch biggest one-day gain of the year
Oil prices rallied Tuesday to notch their largest one-day dollar and percentage gain since December, according to FactSet data. Prices found support on the back of news Monday that Saudi Arabia plans to cut its crude exports and Nigeria agreed to limit its production. Expectations for a slowdown in U.S. production, after Anadarko Petroleum Corp.  cut its full-year spending budget, also contributed to price gains. September WTI crude  rose $1.55, or 3.3%, to settle $47.89 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Anadarko shares down 3% after company posts wider-than-expected loss
Shares of Anadarko Petroleum Corp.  fell more than 3% late Monday after the oil and gas exploration and production company reported a larger-than-expected second-quarter loss. Anadarko said it lost $415 million, or 76 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with a loss of $1.36 a share in the second quarter of 2016. Adjusted for certain items, the company lost $423 million, or 77 cents a share, in the quarter. Revenue reached $2.7 billion in the quarter, compared with $1.92 billion a year ago. Sales Analysts polled by FactSet had expected the company to report an adjusted loss of 36 cents a share on sales of $2.2 billion. Anadarko also cut its investments by $300 million for the full year and adjusted full-year sales-volume guidance to reflect recent asset sales and deferred production connected with the company's response earlier this year to a fatal home explosion in Colorado linked to one of the company's wells. "We feel this is a prudent move," the company said in a statement. Shares ended the regular trading session up 0.3%.

Anadarko's stock tumbles as explosion prompts closure of over 3,000 wells for weeks
Shares of Anadarko Petroleum Corp.  tumbled 6.3% in active midday trade Thursday to a nine-month low, after the oil and gas exploration company said it would close more than 3,000 wells in response to the last week's fatal home explosion in Firestone, Colo. The stock changed hands recently at $56.13, the lowest level seen since Sept. 16, while volume spiked to 7.9 million shares, or more than double the full-day average. The company said late Wednesday that the wells, which account for total production of about 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, could remain shut for two to four weeks while inspections and testing of equipment can be conducted. Analyst Paul Grigel at Macquarie Research reiterated his overweight rating on the stock, saying he believed any impact from the shut in production will be limited. "We believe the ultimate impact on financials and the company is likely to be de minimis but do recognize this will likely be a near-term focus until the investigation by local fire officials is complete," Grigel wrote in a note to clients. The stock has plunged 19% year to date, while the SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF  has shed 11% and the S&P 500  has gained 6.5%.

Important Performance Information





Performance results reflect any applicable expense subsidies and waivers in effect during the periods shown. Without such subsidies and waivers the fund's performance results would be less favorable. All results are historical and assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.
		





Sales Charges
		





Class A shares ("A") results include the maximum sales charge.
		





Important Risk Considerations




The fund may not achieve its objective and/or you could lose money on your investment in the fund.
		





Stock markets and investments in individual stocks  are volatile and can decline significantly in response to issuer, market, economic, industry, political, regulatory, geopolitical, and other conditions.
		





Investments in foreign markets can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, currency, economic, industry, political, regulatory, geopolitical, or other conditions.
		





Emerging markets can have less market structure, depth, and regulatory, custodial or operational oversight and greater political, social, and economic instability than developed markets.
		





Please see the prospectus for further information on these and other risk considerations.

Morningstar Disclosure



The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
		



Morningstar rankings may vary among share classes and are based on historical total returns, which are not indicative of future results.




Class A share star ratings do not include any front-end sales load and are intended for those investors who have access to such purchase terms (e.g., plan participants of a defined contribution plan.) Therefore, Morningstar strongly encourages investors to contact their investment professional to determine whether they are eligible to purchase the A share without paying the front load.

The principles of indirect influence in order to guide even the most difficult conversations.

Morning Concurrent Sessions (Note: Some sessions end at 12:00 pm)
M1 - Coping with Change at Work: Embrace Positive & Productive TransformationChrissy Scivicque, PCM, ATD, Founder & CEO, CCS Ventures LLC
Navigating the evolving landscape of work productively is an essential skill for all administrative professionals. Whether changes taking place are within your control or not, you can control your response to them. This Session shows you how to turn any change into an opportunity, why we’re hardwired to resist change (and how to manage that effectively), which of the four stages of transition you’re in, and how to see beyond uncertainty. Learn strategies for managing stress, overcoming a “change adverse” mindset and how to thrive on change by developing the crucial skill of resiliency.

M2 - @ Thinking Like a Project ManagerMelissa Esquibel, MCT, President, MPELLC
Like many admins, you’re known for answering “yes” to any request, but that can leave you juggling dozens of projects ineffectively. Borrowing from a project manager’s book of tricks can help you stay on track, prioritize your work, and communicate progress effectively. Learn project manager vocabulary and terms to help frame your  work, how tools you’re already using can track and communicate progress, ways to handle push back from team members and superiors about priorities and deadlines, the critical math of project management, and much more.

M3 - Connective Across DifferencesTrudy Bourgeois, Founder, The Center for Workforce Excellence
Overcoming and flexing our biases are vital to thriving in today’s workplace.  If you’re ready to work better with your peers, build authentic relationships with your boss and others, experience higher levels of career satisfaction, and set yourself up for success…this Session is for you! You’ll gain an understanding and appreciation for becoming more collaborative and how to enhance results and drive innovation.

M4 - *Communicate and Collaborate with Emotional IntelligenceSusan Schoenfeld, President, Sue Schoenfeld and Associates and Consultant, Loeb Consulting Group LLC
Emotional Intelligence (EI) is defined by the ability to understand and manage our emotions and to better understand the behavior of others.  It’s an important factor that influences productivity, efficiency, advancement, and collaboration.  Learn how to use EI for self-development, analyze others to establish better relationships, and how it can improve communication. Explore self-awareness, managing your emotions by learning your triggers, how to improve your listening skills and engage in fewer evaluative types of responses, and behavioral styles of yourself and others.

M5 - Manage Difficult Conversations with Credibility and DiscretionSandy Geroux, CEO, WOWplace International, LLC
Some conversations have the potential to become confrontational, explosive and even harmful. With proper positioning, preparation, flexibility, compassion, and good judgment, difficult conversations can result in healthy dialogues. Discover techniques for timing, holding, and following-up on difficult conversations. Walk away with the ability to identify and analyze the risks and desired outcomes for any conversation, use a powerful step-by-step process for deciding when, where, why, and how to hold a difficult conversation, while sidestepping five common mistakes, and managing your emotions!

M6 - *Grammar and Usage Update for Super-Busy AdminsMandi Stanley, CSP, Author and Trainer, Mandi Stanley Seminars, LLC
Admins are expected to have grammatically correct, error-free documents and email communications. There must be an easy way to find and correct mistakes—and to stay current with modern usage. Mandi pinpoints the most common issues and shows you techniques to quickly clean-up and complete your communication. You’ll explore run-on sentences and fragments in professional correspondence and email, comma traumas, confusing word combinations (example affect/effect), commonly misused words, correct use of quotation marks, grammar group settings, and more!

M7 - Modern Minute-Taking for Admins and AssistantsChristy Crump, Director of Operations, Regulatory Compliance Services
Minute-taking is much different today than even 10 years ago. Now, minutes are typically taken on a laptop, for informal type meetings, and for people who attended the meeting. Much of the work is done preparing ahead of the meeting which saves time during and after the meeting. This back-to-basics Session will cover essentials like drafting an agenda and using it as a template for your notes, tips on note-taking during a meeting, recapping and summarizing discussions (including when to be specific and what to leave out), and handling cleanup and distribution. 

M8 - @ 4 Habits of Empowered Women LeadersLisa Olsen, Co-Owner and Presenter, Admin to Admin
Female leaders bring natural strengths to the table in terms of management and communication styles, but there are four areas that can be uncomfortable for them: negotiation, risk, conflict, and competition. Learn how to develop greater comfort in these four areas by evaluating the habits of others, discovering motivations, strategies, and tools that will lead to better self-awareness and advocacy, and successfully applying them with confidence. We’ll help you to reduce your discomfort, discover your natural negotiation style, understand the myth behind women and risk, and become proactive in dealing with conflict, elements of healthy competition, and more!

M9 - @ E-File Triage: Leveling Up Your Office Skills - Back by Popular DemandNeil Malek, Founder and Lead Instructor, Knack Training, LLC

This course is designed to solve as many of the day-to-day headaches you have.

Automating aspects of your computer programs are traditionally areas where your company’s IT staff needs to be brought in. No more! Many software companies are providing simple ways to connect important tools and services that you use daily! Using actions like incoming email, workplace chat, and even social media traffic, you can trigger responses like automated replies, saved and catalogued information, and collaboration. In this Workshop, we’ll explore automation in Microsoft Outlook and OneNote, Evernote, Slack, and other common workplace tools. Topics include:

Creating and using template emails that are available in one click.
Connecting OneNote with Outlook to automatically save and file information.
Automating information-gathering and research with Evernote.
Connect your workplace chat in Slack with outside sources.

*Laptops are REQUIRED for this workshop. Please have the Microsoft Office Suite installed on your laptop prior to coming onsite.
**This workshop, due to its hands-on nature, has very limited seating.

W7 - On the Hunt on the Las Vegas Strip: Lessons in Team Development and Leadership (Offsite)Conducted by Strayboots
An award-winning competitive scavenger hunt, this Workshop showcases points of interest on the southern side of the Vegas Strip while providing lessons in how teamwork and leadership develop.  Attendees will be grouped into teams, and a team leader will be assigned ahead of time. The Hunt is organized on your mobile device as your team collects points and photos along the way. Your team will be solving riddles, answering questions, and capturing the fun in photos. As you explore the neighborhood, you’ll discover how teams are formed and conflicts are resolved, what roles team members take and the forms leadership takes. 
IMPORTANT NOTE: This workshop covers a lot of territory (and a few miles) over several hours. Attendees should wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to be on their feet and moving during the three hours.  Participants will meet in the designated meeting room at the Venetian and then walk to Caesar’s Palace to begin the Hunt.


The Executive Assistants’ Summit schedule differs slightly from the APC schedule. Please visit the EA Summit Schedule for full details.
