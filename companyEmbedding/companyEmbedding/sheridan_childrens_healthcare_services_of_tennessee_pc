About Us








About HealthCare.com
January 2017 – HealthCare.com Helps Over 2 Million Americans Find Health Insurance Options in 2016 – Read More

HealthCare.com is operated by HealthCare, Inc., and is a leading search, comparison and recommendation tool for healthcare consumers and performance advertising platform for healthcare marketers.
The HealthCare.com of today was launched in 2014. We started with the belief that we can apply our technology, data and health insurance expertise to build easy-to-use tools to help consumers make better purchase decisions about their health plan. Our goal is to deliver tools and related content in a way that engages everyday users, and demystifies the healthcare buying experience. And we help consumers find the coverage best suited to their health needs while improving their healthcare literacy.
 

 
Watch the HealthCare.com Explainer Video



Our StoryHealthCare.com is a healthcare startup changing the way consumers shop for health insurance.
We were inspired by the desire to not only improve the healthcare shopping experience, but the final outcome. Based on this mission, our team of technology, Internet and health insurance entrepreneurs combined their passion and expertise to deliver the leading search engine and recommendation tool that helps individuals shop for health insurance, compare plans, and buy coverage that best fits their needs – anytime – anywhere. We thought about what would make the most impact in the healthcare space, and developed a product-specific search and comparison engine that displays both marketplace health plans that are eligible for a subsidy, and many plans that are not available on the exchange, side-by-side in an easy-to-compare layout. With proprietary search innovation and an intuitive recommendation tool, we have built a data-driven engine to provide consumers the best plan results that match both their health insurance and their healthcare lifestyle.

We started this company because we know how important purchasing health insurance coverage is. Yet the confusion that surrounds the shopping process can lead to wasted time or worse, ill-fitted plans that don’t provide needed medical coverage. We assembled a great entrepreneurial team of Internet, technology, data and health insurance experts with the know-how and drive to serve this mission.
To support our mission to consumers, we work with the largest health insurance companies in the U.S. to make their health plan offerings more accessible, and easier to understand. HealthCare.com also gives consumers the opportunity to compare both on-exchange, marketplace plans and off-exchange plans side by side, so consumers can see nearly every choice available to them before they buy.
Who We AreHealthCare.com is founded and lead by a diverse, passionate and entrepreneurial management team:

Health insurance veterans who have spent decades in the health insurance business
Start-up entrepreneurs who have built and sold successful Internet-driven businesses
Technologists who have built enterprise-scale online software applications
Data and analytics experts who have applied Big Data to improve health outcomes


Why NowThe Affordable Care Act offered standardization and a new online shopping experience for health insurance, providing consumers data that previously was not directly accessible. While there are public health insurance exchanges, there’s still a ton of consumer confusion. We believe there will still be substantive changes in how U.S. consumers approach the purchase of healthcare. Companies like ours can usher in an eventual path to the consumerization of healthcare.
We’re supported by a group of investors who have built some of the most valuable Internet companies in the world, including the Priceline Group and Booking.com. The strength of our financial backing allows us to build great proprietary technology for today’s marketplace, and keep building value-added online healthcare tools that our consumers love to use.
Based in Miami, HealthCare.com also has offices in New York City and Guatemala City.

Who Are We:
 We’re an independent, privately-operated provider of consumer healthcare information, operating since 2006. We’re different than HealthCare.gov, which is a government website launched in 2013 as part of the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), and have been in business far longer as a website and company. From HealthCare.com, you can shop around for healthcare marketplace plans (i.e., the same plans available on HealthCare.gov),  and other state-based exchanges. In addition, we may display plans that are sold by insurance carriers that meet federal standards to be a qualified health plan ( as defined by the ACA), but are not sold at HealthCare.gov or your state exchange. We do not actually sell health plans ourselves, but work with licensed entities.
                
 What if I Need a Subsidy?
Our website helps you calculate if you are eligible for a subsidy. We provide only an estimate. You can apply for and buy a plan online at HealthCare.gov (or a state exchange website), through a web-based entity as defined by the ACA, or from licensed insurance agents. We partner with both web-based entities and licensed insurance agents to enroll consumers. You officially calculate and apply for a subsidy at the time of purchase. If you are eligible for a subsidy, you can apply for qualified health plan (as defined by the ACA) through insurance carriers and certified, licensed insurance agents that partner with us.
Here are important facts straight from HealthCare.gov confirming that health insurance can  be (and most-often is) purchased outside of the federal exchange website:

“Many insurance agents and brokers can also help you apply for and enroll in Marketplace health coverage. Contact an agent or broker to learn more.” 



“You can also get insurance outside the Marketplace--through a private insurance company, an online insurance seller, or an agent or broker.”  


 Our Business Model:
Our business model is to: 1) aggregate a comprehensive set of plan options – including both on-exchange and off-exchange plans – from public and private sources, 2) develop industry-leading tools, data and technology to help consumers select a plan, and 3) match consumers with multiple purchase options – online, over the phone or directly with a certified, licensed insurance agent. We generate revenue from agencies and carriers by facilitating plan purchases. We also generate some targeted advertising revenue from the website.  Our services are free to consumers.
