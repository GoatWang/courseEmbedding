CUSTOMER COMMENTS

"A sales person at O'Riley’s Auto Parts recommended your product after I asked what was the best product for scratch removal for my 2008 Jeep Liberty. I was amazed at how simple and effective the NuFinish Scratch Doctor worked. Finally a product that did what it said it would. It removed scratches and left a beautiful finish all over the vehicle. I will not use anything else on my car. Thank you for a wonderful product. I will also now use other products from NuFinish." Michael O., Lubbock, TX
"I had scratches on my truck from a car wash that scratched the whole left side. Though I was going to have to go to a body shop to repair it, but after using Scratch Doctor they were all gone!  Will definitely be buying more Nu Finish products in the future." -Alex Glessing, Fort Collins, CO
"I saw your television commercial for Nu Finish Scratch Doctor a couple of weeks ago. I couldn't possibly believe that the product could work that well....until I tried it for myself! I don't know what you put in that bottle, but that stuff is amazing! It removed the key marks near my door handle and the nicks on my trunk in no time. Nice to see that there's a product out there that can do exactly what you claim it can do. Thank you!"-Jonathan Sullivan, Santa Rosa, CA
"I live in the city and my car gets abused going in and out of small parking spaces all day long. It was so easy to get the paint off of my doors left behind by the other cars with Scratch Doctor. Just wish you could have come out with this product years ago...it would have saved me a ton of money touching up my other cars. Keep up the great work!"-Becky Rodgers, Seattle, WA
"My wife came home with scratches down the side of her car, which she had no idea how they got there. I went to an automotive store and they recommended I try Nu Finish Scratch Doctor before going to the expense of getting a paint job at a body shop. Low and behold, they were right. Scratch Doctor made the scratches on the side of her car virtually disappear. Thanks!"-Al Beaufort, Corpus Christi, TX
"Wow! Not much else to say but that Nu Finish Scratch Doctor is just what the doctor ordered. Thank you for creating this amazing product!"-Terry Mendelsohn, Lawrence, KS

                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.
                            



                                Entity Type

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Sole Proprietor
                            

                                N
                            

                                Indicate whether provider is a sole proprietor.

A sole proprietor is the sole (the only) owner of a business that is not incorporated; that unincorporated business is a sole proprietorship.
In a sole proprietorship, the sole proprietor owns all of the assets of the business and is solely liable for all of the debts of the business.
There is no difference between a sole proprietorship and a sole proprietor; they are legally a single entity: an individual.
In terms of NPI assignment, a sole proprietor is an Entity type 1 (Individual) and is eligible for only one NPI (the sole proprietorship business is not eligible for its own NPI).
As an individual, a sole proprietorship cannot be a subpart and cannot have subparts. (See NPI Final Rule for information about subparts.)
A sole proprietorship may or may not have employees.
Often, the IRS assigns an EIN to a sole proprietorship in order to protect the sole proprietor's SSN from disclosure in claims or on W-2s. NPPES does not capture a sole proprietorship's EIN.
Many types of health care providers could be sole proprietorships (for example, group practices, pharmacies, home health agencies).





                                Provider Last Name (Legal Name)

                                The last name of the provider (if an individual). If the provider is an individual, this is the legal name. This name must match the name on file with the Social Security Administration (SSA). In addition, the date of birth must match that on file with SSA. (First and last names are required for initial applications.) The First, Middle, Last and Credential(s) fields allow the following special characters: ampersand, apostrophe, colon, comma, forward slash, hyphen, left and right parentheses, period, pound sign, quotation mark, and semi-colon. A field cannot contain all special characters.
