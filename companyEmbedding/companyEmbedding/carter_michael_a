4.0 out of 5 starsA Giacchino Wonderland Of Amazing Themes & Lush SoundsByKaya Savason March 14, 2012Michael Giacchino has become the go-to guy for Pixar, and while John Carter is not made by Pixar it certainly is directed by one of their elite. Be it style or schedule, Stanton parts ways with Thomas Newman and teams up with Giacchino for this flourishing sci-fi epic. There's no doubt that the Oscar winner's music was going to be spectacular, but exactly how spectacular? John Carter's score is as musically sound as Giacchino could make it. It has a wonderful theme and lots of little motifs along the way. The sound is big, but in a sweeping romantic way. The score has some old fashioned sensibilities but packs the energy of modern music.For Giacchino fans this score will be a real treat because he really draws from his own style a lot. More so than he's done recently. While every score has his style and signature sound I found John Carter to be a wonderful reminder of everything I love about his music. Moments reminded me of LOST, Super 8 and even Medal Of Honor. Giacchino's stamp as a person is all over this score and for that reason makes it feel like a really personal effort. The story being told is a wonderful adventure and the music really captures the listener. The emotions play very well even if they aren't deeply profound. You won't shed any tears from this score like you did with Super 8 (well, at least like I did). This is also a meaty score with lots of substance.For a springtime blockbuster this is as good as it gets. While Silvestri's Avengers and Hans Zimmer's Dark Knight Rises will undoubtedly rule summer, this score is a great fresh experience.  Also, Giacchino fans better enjoy this one because we won't hear him again till Star Trek 2 next year.

Top critical reviewSee all 2 critical reviews› 3.0 out of 5 starsNot as great without the visualsBySisterInArmson November 6, 2012As an avid soundtrack/score collector and having seen the film, I rushed to add this one to my collection.  The first time I popped it into the player I was a little disappointed once it was over.  Thinking that perhaps I was distracted and missed part of it as I painted, I hit replay.  It wasn't any different the second time.  It's one of the rares scores in my collection that really works better with the film than by itself.  There are some really sweeping moments and beautiful songs, but it just didn't do what it did for me as I watched the film.  There's not that one repeating theme that really ties the whole thing together either.  Overall, I'm glad I have it, but it gets moved down to the bottom part of the collection.

And like many others, I grew to love the character of John Carter through the books, comics, paintings, and imaginations of the many artisans through the years so, to finally see it on film was filling some very large expectations.This movie did just that and did so handsomely.Unlike so many other book adaptations of late, this one worked hard to keep from going over the top and focused on the story and the relationships within. Admittedly, there were a few times where certain story components were simply assumed to be understood and I had to explain them to my kids, but for the most part, this adaptation did a brilliant job of explaining itself whenever it could. And unlike so many other movies where someone's agenda is blazed across the scenes, this movie brings the joy of a story just for the sake of having a good story to share, without any excess baggage.This is the kind of movie to keep close at hand so you can pull it out and watch whenever you can. Like a good book on a rainy afternoon, the acting, animation, and music combine to weave a wonderful story about greed, loss, hope, and love, as well as how one individual can make the difference no matter who they are or where they're from. And when you're ready to go there, remember these words: Ak Ohum Oktay Weez Barsoom!0Comment|

The main character's theme plays in a couple of ways--during the beginning of the first track, you'll hear it evoke a sense of wonder, and at the beginning of the last track, you'll here it play sweetly, almost with melancholy.That's not where it shines though.  The theme comes most strongly, and best represents the album and film, at the fifth track, "Sab Than Pursues the Princess."  The brass falls in and pounds out powerful notes that make you want a hero to cheer for.  That's the essence of the music right there--each piece of the score has a clear identity of that nature.  In this CD are the makings of a classic score, one that should be recognized for so clearly sweeping the listener into the emotions of the film.  After a while, the movie is unnecessary.  Instead, you have a blast of solid emotion striking you with every track.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsEpic soundtrackByK. Michael Carlockon April 18, 2012Format: Audio CD|Verified PurchaseThe score for the movie John Carter is wonderfully epic, with a range that sweeps from robust bravado to quiet intimacy. One of the most interesting moments in the movie - the brutal battle against the Warhoon - is visually violent and chaotic but the score is sad and tender.  This seems like an unusual choice for combat music, but it totally works inside the movie because of the counterpoint scenes that are cut into the fighting. This soundtrack was inspired but it could have added standalone musical themes and it might have helped if the end credits music would have started off rousingly rather than serenely. Also, one wonders if the punny names for the various pieces undermines the value of the genuinely fine music.The soundtrack is in the John Williams-style of film scores, which is almost always a good thing. Four out of 5 stars (4 and a half if the stars worked that way).0Comment|

Mr. Giacchino has an uncanny ability, like other great film composers, to make films grander, more humane, more emotionally involving.  I also love the film which seems to be gathering a cult following that it so richly deserves.  Mr. Giacchino has done a superb job -- and this makes for a great listening experience.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

With some parts quiet and evocative interwoven with other parts that follow the intense struggle, triumph and discovery of life on Barsoom, I know that others enjoy this different world as much as I do.  And for those of you who have yet to kiss a princess, ERB was right....it can happen!0Comment|

His soundtrack stands on its own, but is particularly enjoyable when listened to as part of the actual film.  Soundtracks that are too obtrusive can ruin a film.  Others that are too stark can also hamper it.  This score strikes that most delicate of balances between auditory feast and film resource.  A must for any fan of film scores!0Comment|

Gephardton March 9, 2013Format: Audio CD|Verified PurchaseThis soundtrack has quickly become one of my top favorites (I like it better than I liked the movie, and I'm "into" science fiction).  I like to work with soundtrack instrumentals in the background, and this is one of my most-played selections.  Michael Giacchino is a talented composer, whose soundtracks I generally tend to love. Favorite cut? Probably "The Prize is Barsoom," but really I like them all.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

But after listening to the soundtrack independent of the film itself, I found myself enjoying the music on a second level. I believe this is one of those soundtracks that deserve to be heard in a live orchestra performance.  I highly recommend this soundtrack by Mr. Giacchino.0Comment|

Product Description▼▲
Experiencing the Truth communicates the need of a vibrant, experiential, Reformed Christianity among African-Americans and all believers.How does a believer choose a church to attend? Sadly too many Christians search for churches that serve them and meet their perceived needs. Instead they should prefer places where God is exalted and biblical truth and Christian doctrine are proclaimed. Such churches are essential if Christians are to understand what God is doing and what he calls His people to be.Experiencing the Truth presents these truths not simply to African-American churches, but also to the whole church today. Anthony Carter, Michael Leach, and Ken Jones clearly present the need for a vibrant, experiential, Reformed Christianity among African-Americans. These authors lay out the biblical basis for choosing and attending a church, and they demonstrate how the historic Reformed expression has been the most biblically accurate and experientially consistent expression of Christianity.

Publisher's Description▼▲
Experiencing the Truth communicates the need of a vibrant, experiential, Reformed Christianity among African-Americans and all believers. How does a believer choose a church to attend? Sadly too many Christians search for churches that serve them and meet their perceived needs. Instead they should prefer places where God is exalted and biblical truth and Christian doctrine are proclaimed. Such churches are essential if Christians are to understand what God is doing and what he calls His people to be. Experiencing the Truth presents these truths not simply to African-American churches, but also to the whole church today. Anthony Carter, Michael Leach, and Ken Jones clearly present the need for a vibrant, experiential, Reformed Christianity among African-Americans. These authors lay out the biblical basis for choosing and attending a church, and they demonstrate how the historic Reformed expression has been the most biblically accurate and experientially consistent expression of Christianity.


Author Bio▼▲
Anthony Carter (MA, Biblical Studies, Reformed Theological Seminary) serves as the assistant pastor of Southwest Christian Fellowship in Atlanta. The author of two books, the Non Nobis Domine blog, and numerous magazine and journal articles, Carter frequently travels as a conference speaker and guest lecturer. He is also an organizing member of the Council of Reforming Churches.

Endorsements▼▲
"I hope Experiencing the Truth will be an impetus to move the African-American church from the selfdeprecating darkness of theological liberalism into the divinely nourishing light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ." Rev. Eric C. Redmond, author, Where Are All the Brothers?

"Provides a biblical diagnosis and prescription for what ails the African-American church and much of the larger church world as well. From theology to preaching to worship and Christian spirituality, these veterans of the church and pulpit apply the scalpel of truth to every major area of church life." Thabiti Anyabwile, Senior Pastor, First Baptist Church of Grand Cayman

Publisher Description▼▲
Why do you attend the church you attend? In Experiencing the Truth, Anthony Carter uses this simple question to diagnose core problems facing the black church. If you picked your church simply because its convenient or because its where you grew up, you may not be experiencing the truth every Sunday. Carter points to the need for a vibrant, experiential, Reformed Christianity among African-Americans and all believers.

Experiencing the Truth calls believers to preach, promote, and practice a historic, biblical, and experiential Christianity in their churches  African-American or otherwise. Anthony Carter, Michael Leach, and Ken Jones lay out the biblical basis for choosing and attending a church, and they demonstrate how the historic Reformed expression has been the most biblically accurate and experientially consistent expression of Christianity. Experiencing the Truth will serve as a valuable resource for all believers seeking to bridge the cultural gap among Christians and to bring about a more unified Christianity through understanding and submission.
