Julie “Squeeze” Ginther – Lingerie Fighting Championships














































 


























 

 

















































Julie “Squeeze” Ginther




















Julie “Squeeze” Ginther 

BIOGRAPHY:
Julie is a fitness model from California who has been a very popular wrestler for a number of years.  Julie also plays Lingerie Football and Lingerie Basketball. This makes her the world’s first three sport lingerie athlete! She describes herself as a “scissors specialist” and credits this skill with allowing her to transition seamlessly between wrestling and MMA. She has developed many other holds to force submissions including strangles and her feared triangle choke. The common theme; this is a fighter who wins by squeezing the air out of her opponent (thus the nickname).  Julie is ferociously competitive, hates to lose and doesn’t plan to let any little girl in lingerie beat her!


Record: 4-2
Nickname: Squeeze
Height: 5’7″
Weight: 143lbs
Fighting Style: Wrestler
Hometown: Sacramento, CA

Lingerie Fighting Championships Inc. Report To Shareholders






GlobeNewswire



Nov 30, 2016 3:30 PM EST













 




























































 LAS VEGAS, Nov. 30, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lingerie Fighting Championships, Inc. ("LFC") (OTC Pink:BOTY) today issued the following announcement to its Shareholders. To Our Shareholders, This year has been a transformative year for Lingerie Fighting Championships, Inc. (the "Company"). Several managing partners were removed from decision-making roles in the first quarter due to their inability to provide promised funding. We secured funding to provide for the Company's short term financial requirements by issuing convertible promissory notes to a limited number of investors. Recently, these investors initiated conversion of these convertible promissory notes into shares of the Company's common stock, placing significant downward pressure on our share price. At the same time, the conversion of these convertible promissory notes has reduced our debt and resulted in a substantial increase in our stock's liquidity. Previously, there was virtually no volume in the market for our shares. Last Friday, November 25, 2016, nearly 2.5 million shares exchanged hands. On the operations side, the year has been very positive. Our television coverage has grown to more than 2,000 cable & satellite systems, we licensed to networks in Japan and France, held our first live event in Europe and launched a reality series on Tuff TV. We have also achieved several new milestones. Previous to this year, the Company had never held more than one live event in a single calendar year. This year we held three; June 18 in Nice, California, October 29 in New Town, North Dakota and November 10 in Bratislava, Slovakia. In 2014, we often were required to pay upwards of $3,000 to rent venues to hold live events.  In 2016, a venue paid LFC $35,000. Also this year, we added two new key additions to our organization. Charles Connaughton was appointed as the Company's Chief Financial Officer and Brad Kelly was appointed Sponsorship Director.  Both bring a wealth of experience to their respective positions.

Whether you're a movie buff or prefer to binge-watch TV shows, Walmart has you covered with a wide selection of entertainment options. Browse for your favorite movies and TV shows and discover new titles you'll love. Which format is best? you'll find DVD and Blu-ray movies while browsing through the selection offered by Walmart. DVDs can be played on DVD players, gaming systems and on laptops. Blu-rays can be played on Blu-ray players and on gaming systems. The main difference between the DVD and Blu-ray formats is the amount of storage space on the discs. A DVD can store 4.6GB of data while Blu-ray discs can store 25GB of data and 50GB of data for the dual layer discs. Blu-rays typically have a better audio and video quality and come with more extras compared to DVDs. If you have a TV with 4K, HD or 3D features, Blu-rays will be the best way to enjoy your TV. You can also find many movies that include a DVD and a Blu-ray disc. How can I browse for movies? Browsing for movies is very easy, whether you're looking for your all-time favorite classics or for new releases. Blockbusters and franchises such as Star Wars, Power Rangers or the Fast and the Furious should be prominently featured, but you can also browse by genre if you're looking to expand your movie and TV collection. Check out the selection of Disney movies if you have young children, and take a look at the Harry Potter and Star Wars sections if you're a fan of sci-fi and fantasy. Movies are organized by genres such as animated movies, action, crime, drama, horror or romance among many others so you can easily find what you're looking for. How can I find my favorite TV shows? Owning your favorite TV shows on DVD or Blu-ray is ideal if you like to rewatch episodes. You can actually buy the latest season of your favorite show as soon as it comes out instead of catching the episodes as they air on TV. Check out the TV section to find the latest TV shows or browse by network. If you have a favorite TV show, use the search bar to find seasons available on DVD and Blu-ray or to find a boxset of the entire show. How can I discover new movies and shows I will like? There are different ways to discover new entertainment options. If you're shopping with a budget in mind, take a look at the $5 DVDs section or shop Blu-ray by price. This is a great way to find classics you have always wanted to own and to give new movies a chance. you'll find some fun double features, some recent releases and some timeless classics at Everyday Low Prices. You can also browse for movies and shows by genre, look up actors, actresses and directors or take a look at the customers favorite section if you want to find out which movies and shows are popular. How can I find the latest movies and TV shows? The best sellers section is a great place to find popular movies and TV shows. Recent releases usually end up in this section but so do classics when they're first released on Blu-ray or DVD. Walmart has a new releases section so you can easily see the latest movies that were released. You can even preorder Blu-ray and DVDs before their initial release if you want to add a movie to your collection as soon as it becomes available. If you recently purchased a 4K TV, check out the 4K resolution section to see the latest movies available in this format. what's InstaWatch and VUDU? Many DVDs and Blu-ray offered by Walmart come with a digital version of the movie. These digital movies are available by a VUDU service called InstaWatch. You can then stream your movies on a laptop, on a gaming system, on a Blu-ray player or via a VUDU Spark stick. You can also use your VUDU account to buy digital versions of movies and shows or to simply rent content. This feature allows you to watch your movies on more devices and to watch your movies and shows right away if you decide to order online.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147366597, DC-prod-dfw1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

Stock up to keep your entertainment arrangement flexible and fun.TV show genresWatching your old favorite shows can be fun, but it's always nice to try something new. Zeroing in on the right shows to watch can be a challenge when there's so much great TV on offer. While shopping for new TV shows you've never seen before, it can be helpful to shop by genre. Genres will give you a general overview of the mood and tone of the show and can help you determine whether the show is appropriate for young children or not.Drama: Drama TV shows focus on a high level of emotion and excitement, which can come in the form of suspense, mystery, action or social tension between characters. Some dramatic TV shows focus on historical time periods, while others focus on a sensational version of life in the present day. Mad Men and Downton Abbey are examples of historical dramas, while shows like CSI and Law & Order focus on drama in the present day. Dramatic TV series usually run about an hour per episode and are often either inappropriate or not fast-paced enough for children.Comedy: When you're in the mood for something lighthearted and funny, comedy TV is the way to go. Comedy shows include some family-friendly classics like I Love Lucy and some edgier, adults-only modern shows like Silicon Valley. Most comedy TV shows are a half-hour long, but some comedy TV, like stand-up comedy specials, can run longer.Animation: Also known as cartoons, many animated TV shows are aimed at children, but there's also plenty of animation, like South Park or Family Guy, that's aimed at adults. This TV show category can also include animated TV shows from Japan known as anime, which are usually most appropriate for older children and adults. Most of the TV shows available for very young children and toddlers are found in this category, which usually includes episodes that run for a half hour or less but can include some longer made-for-TV movies or specials.Sci-Fi and fantasy: Science fiction, aka sci-fi, and fantasy are two of the most imaginative TV genres. They look into fictional futures and imaginary pasts to tell stories that usually have a dramatic focus but can be funny. Star Trek is perhaps the most iconic sci-fi TV show, while shows like Game of Thrones and The Twilight Zone represent the fantasy genre. Some fantasy shows, like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, take place in the present day. The shows in this genre focus on magical or alien elements and usually run for at least an hour.TV show formatsStreaming through Walmart is an option for TV viewers focused on new media, but if you still prefer to have a physical copy of the shows you love, DVDs and Blu-rays are the best option. These disc media formats offer high picture quality, reliable playback and easy functionality that even kids can operate on their own. TV show DVDs and Blu-rays come in a variety of different formats.Multi-disc season sets: TV shows run in groups known as seasons. Shows that run for just a short period of time may get only one season, but those that run for many years can have multiple seasons. Some shows have different themes in different seasons, and fans may find themselves gravitating to one particular season to watch more than any of the others. If you're just starting to watch a show or there's one season you like better than any others, a TV show season set may be the right choice for you. Because seasons usually include more than five episodes, season sets usually have multiple discs and come in a package that holds them all together for easy storage.Complete series box sets: Complete series box sets are the perfect way to keep every single episode of your favorite show on hand for viewing whenever you feel like binge-watching through the entire show. This category of TV show DVD and Blu-ray may include special-edition box sets that have behind-the-scenes-footage and other special features you won't get through streaming in addition to each episode of the show.Single discs: Single-disc TV show DVDs and Blu-rays usually include special episodes that are longer than an hour or collections of episodes around a specific theme. For example, you may be able to buy one disc with all the Christmas episodes of your favorite show.Show moreElectrode, Comp-167925796, DC-prod-dfw2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

5.0 out of 5 starsExactly what you'd expectByRyan C.on July 22, 2016Is Lingerie Fighting Championships for everyone?  No.Is it extremely entertaining and does it feature beautiful women... to the point that all anyone can hope for is the proverbial wardrobe malfunction?  ... In a nutshell, YES!Anyone who bought this with the hopes and expectations to see the BEST that MMA has to offer and then, in turn, gave this a 1-Star Rating...  that's like buying an old Hyundai with a Corvette sticker on the bumper and getting mad that it doesn't drive fast.LFC is what it is -- can't hate on them for that.
