            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

      Customers Are Saying!








★★★★★"Great 
            customer service, quick response and turn around. Thanks Jennifer!!"Cathy Washington - Dallas, TX




★★★★★...Your 
            patience and understandin...
            "Thank you so much for all your help in obtaining the flood insurance 
            I needed so that I could purchase my first home. It is really too 
            bad other insurance agents aren't like you, in your patience and understanding 
            in helping me obtain all my insurance with one agent. I could not 
            have completed the purchase of my home without your help! I may have 
            located you by searching online and I did not expect much when I sent 
            the first email. But, I was extremely surprised to be in contact with 
            an agent that really cared and went the extra mile to help me. Again, 
            thank you so much for all your help."
Pamela Tanner - Unadilla, NY




★★★★★I 
            was a little scared to switch...
            I recently changed all of my insurance due to the horrid flood insurance 
            policies, Jennifer was so helpful in finding me flood insurance at 
            a reasonable rate and included my home insurance also. Since she did 
            so well with that we changed our car insurance also. When she found 
            me a company I had never heard of, I was a little scared to switch. 
            But did anyways and then 3 weeks later my son totaled his car. But 
            with working with this new company and Jennifer everything worked 
            out well. I am so thankful for all her help with my insurance needs. 
            Plus I have never had insurance people call to see how things are 
            going which I think is great customer service on her part. I thank 
            her for all her help and hard work."
Vicki Sanchez - Huntington Beach, CA




★★★★★...Affordable 
            Flood Insurance policy... 
            "I just wanted to say that you did a great job in setting me up with 
            an affordable flood insurance policy for my home. Your honesty, expertise 
            and professionalism was very refreshing after weeks of being put through 
            the ringer by other insurance providers. You saved me close to $2000.00 
            per year for twice the coverage offered by others and if I would have 
            found you sooner I would have saved another $750.00 dollars on a flood 
            elevation survey that I did not need! I will definitely recommend 
            your firm to friends and family that find themselves in the same predicament 
            as I. Thank you so much for a pleasant experience and your superior 
            performance."
Robert Gallagher - Rochester, NY




★★★★★"...Beginning 
            of a long relationship between us...My wife June and I would like 
            to express our sincere appreciation to Jennifer for an excellent job 
            that she did for us. She found solutions to our needs, not only saving 
            us money but also found us better policies. Jennifer is very courteous, 
            knowledgeable, professional and reliable. Her customer service is 
            second to none. She is always calm under pressure. We tried to do 
            eight policies all at once with one fairly complex policy. She tried 
            many options to come up with the best solution for each property. 
            We believe she got us a very good package. We trust that this is just 
            the beginning of a long relationship between us and your company."
Glang Dao - Milpitas, CA




★★★★★I 
            also like the extra features..."Orlando's entire staff went above 
            what I expected, not only did they give me great rates but as a consumer 
            I feel better educated about my insurance. I know what the coverage's 
            mean because they took the time to explain it to me. I also like the 
            extra features of being with RIS, like the newsletter and Referral 
            Program. This year I am going to win the GRAND PRIZE!"
Kim & Dave Evange - West Palm Beach, FL




★★★★★...I 
            highly recommend them"What a great experience! It was easy to 
            reach them on the phone and everyone was very polite and my calls 
            were returned in a timely manner. I appreciate them going over the 
            information and making it easy to understand. Rogers Insurance has 
            great service and I highly recommend them!"
Corinne Caen - San Rafael, CA




★★★★★Money...service...protection...this 
            Newport Beach Woman says Rogers has it all! "I have always appreciated 
            the timely service we get from Veronica and all the staff at Rogers 
            Insurance. And the fact we're able to save money and get better protection 
            is the icing on the cake!"
Patty Carter - Newport Beach, CA




★★★★★One 
            word describes it: "amazing!" 
            Our family has been given excellent service by Rogers Insurance. Through 
            Gary of Rogers Insurance's office, we were able to obtain the coverage 
            we needed at reasonable rates with professional, organized and prompt 
            service. When we had a claim, Lori was available when we needed her 
            and our claim was resolved amazingly easily. We highly recommend Rogers 
            Insurance.
Thomas and Ann Broderson - El Cerrito, CA




★★★★★
Loyal for years! Recommends to "everyone!" 
            "We have done business with Rogers Insurance for many years and have 
            always been more than happy with the way we're treated by all of their 
            people. Veronica is great to work with and I recommend them to everyone."
Gary and Linda Owens - Hillsborough, CA 




★★★★★...knowing 
            we are in good hands "We are so happy with the service provided 
            by Rogers Insurance. We have ALWAYS received prompt and courteous 
            service from the entire staff. They have been dedicated to finding 
            the lowest cost insurance for us AND ensuring we continue to hold 
            the most suitable coverages for our protection. Veronica has been 
            a wonderful person to work with and, best of all, she has made us

Tips for Picking the Proper Flood Insurance

          Two inches of water can cause nearly $8,000 damage to the average home, 
          according to research conducted by the Federal Emergency Management 
          Agency (FEMA).
          Not only is water-related damage one of the most common causes of an 
          insurance claim, thanks to recent flood-zone revisions by FEMA, millions 
          of homeowners are racing to find affordable flood insurance for the 
          first time. 
          Unfortunately, selecting the best flood insurance isn't always the easiest 
          of tasks.
          Following is a checklist to use when speaking with an agent about purchasing 
          the right flood insurance protection for your property. 
        
Many underwriters are restricted from writing a new flood policy once 
          a major event is announced, so shop for flood insurance ahead of time. 
          
          Find out when the flood policy is scheduled to go into effect, and ask 
          about purchasing a temporary policy during the interim. 
          Remember, flood insurance doesn't always cost a lot. 
          Homes in low to moderate risk areas may qualify for preferred risk policies.
Policy Specifics 
          Understand what type of flooding is included and what is excluded, as 
          well as which portion of the policy will cover the damage.
          For example, high winds from a hurricane may result in water damage 
          to exposed areas of the home, earthquakes can cause pipes to burst and 
          even putting out a fire may result in extensive water damage. 
          Ask your agent what portions of the policy provide needed protection 
          in different scenarios, and evaluate the deductibles, limitations and 
          restrictions for each.
 Review Your Risk
          Updated flood maps have resulted in big changes. 
Visit www.floodsmart.gov 
          and enter your zip code to get an up-to-date listing of flood risks 
          for your area
 Flooding is the United States' #1 natural hazard. 
          We want consumers to know that while homeowner's insurance won't cover 
          them against flooding, they can protect their home and property by purchasing 
          a flood insurance policy separately through us--the flood insurance 
          specialists.
          Many people are under the misconception that they are ineligible for 
          flood insurance because of where they live, or their mortgage status. 
          But the truth is, as long as your hometown is an NFIP community, most 
          homeowners, business owners and renters can get flood insurance. We 
          urge consumers to remember the flood insurance basics:

          You CAN get flood insurance nationwide.

You CAN get flood insurance nationwide.
You CAN get flood insurance if you live in a floodplain or high-flood-risk 
            area.
You CAN get flood insurance if you live outside a floodplain, or 
            a low-to-moderate flood-risk area - and at lower cost.
You CAN get flood insurance if your property has been flooded before.
You CAN get flood insurance from insurance agents in your area.
You CAN get flood insurance even if your mortgage broker doesn't 
            require it.

 NFIP- National Flood Insurance Program aka FEMA flood insurance 
          Program Changes as of January 1, 2013

          NFIP previously announced average premium increases of 5% overall and 
          3% for Preferred Risk Policies as their annual premium change to the 
          flood program. Those premium changes were covered in FEMA 
          W-12027, summarized in Summer 
          FloodLines and will be implemented as of October 1, 2012. Therefore, 
          the premium increases below represent successive increases due to the 
          passage of the Biggert Waters Flood Reform Act. 
 NFIP Extends PRP Extension Eligibility Beyond the Initial 
          2 Year Period

          While FEMA completes a study and analysis to develop an implementation 
          strategy for the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012, 
          policies written as Preferred Risk Policies under the 2 Year PRP Eligibility 
          Extension may continue to be renewed as PRPs beyond the previously designated 
          2-year period. 
 Under the initial 2-Year PRP Eligibility Extension, buildings newly 
          mapped into a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) on or after October 1, 
          2008, became eligible for the PRP for 2 years beginning on January 1, 
          2011. Buildings newly mapped into an SFHA on or after January 1, 2011, 
          were also eligible for the PRP during the 2-year period following the 
          map revision date. At the end of the 2-year period, the policies were 
          required to be rewritten as standard-rated policies. For more information 
          please review FEMA 
          Bulletin W-10085 Aug. 23, 2010. 
Beginning with the first renewal effective on or after January 1, 2013, 
          policies issued under the PRP Eligibility Extension that meet the PRP 
          loss history requirements will not be transitioned into standard X-zone 
          rating, but will continue to be issued as PRPs at each renewal until 
          further notice. Under the extension, new business PRPs may also continue 
          to be issued for properties newly mapped into the SFHA as a result of 
          a map revision that became effective on or after October 1, 2008.
 NFIP Announces Jan. 1, 2013 Premium Increases for Preferred Risk Policies 
          (PRP) 

          Premiums will increase an average of 13% for PRPs written or renewed 
          on or after January 1, 2013. (The 3% increase as of October 1, 2012 
          and the average 10% increase as of Jan. 1, 2013 combined.) The combined 
          premium for a particular policy may change more or less than the average 
          13% total PRP premium change. The PRP premium tables that become effective 
          January 1, 2013, are included in the full FEMA bulletin linked below. 
          

          For more information and to view Jan. 1, 2013 PRP rate tables, please 
          refer to the entire FEMA 
          Bulletin W-12054 related to the January 1, 2013 changes. 
NFIP Provides Premium Increase Rates for Non-Primary Residence Properties

          Through the passage of HR 5740 authorizing the NFIP through July 31, 
          2012, the NFIP was directed for properties not the primary residence 
          of an individual to discontinue premium subsidies and to increase the 
          premium rates by 25% each year until the average risk premium rate equals 
          the average risk premium rates for actuarially-based properties beginning 
          on July 1, 2012.br> 

          The FEMA 
          Bulletin 12043 includes the premium rate tables to accomplish this 
          25% increase as of Jan. 1, 2013 and further information for your use. 
          

          Fidelity renewal billings for policies renewing Jan. 1, 2013 or later, 
          not indicated in our files as primary residence, and rated with subsidies 
          will contain the required 25% increase as well as a statement to inform 
          policyholders of the premium increase effective on that renewal billing. 
          The statement will read similar to the following: 

          On May 31, 2012, HR 5740 was signed into law amending the National Flood 
          Insurance Program. One provision of the new law states that residential 
          properties that are not the policy holder's primary residence are no 
          longer eligible to receive subsidized rates. Furthermore, the law requires 
          that rates for these risks must increase by 25% each year until it reaches 
          the appropriate actuarial rate level as determined by FEMA. 

          Flood insurance covers direct physical loss caused by "flood." In simple 
          terms, a flood is an excess of water on land that is normally dry. Here's 
          the official definition used by the National Flood Insurance Program. 
          

          A flood is (1) "A general and temporary condition of partial or complete 
          inundation of two or more acres of normally dry land area or of two 
          or more properties (at least one of which is your property) from a. 
          overflow of inland or tidal waters; b. unusual and rapid accumulation 
          or runoff of surface waters from any source; or c. mudflow*. (2) Collapse 
          or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or similar body of water 
          as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of 
          water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels that result in a flood as 
          defined in A.1.a. Above." 

          * Mudflow is defined (in part) as "A river of liquid and flowing mud 
          on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried 
          by a current of water."

★★★★★"Great 
            customer service, quick response and turn around. Thanks Jennifer!!"Cathy Washington - Dallas, TX




★★★★★...Your 
            patience and understandin...
            "Thank you so much for all your help in obtaining the flood insurance 
            I needed so that I could purchase my first home. It is really too 
            bad other insurance agents aren't like you, in your patience and understanding 
            in helping me obtain all my insurance with one agent. I could not 
            have completed the purchase of my home without your help! I may have 
            located you by searching online and I did not expect much when I sent 
            the first email. But, I was extremely surprised to be in contact with 
            an agent that really cared and went the extra mile to help me. Again, 
            thank you so much for all your help."
Pamela Tanner - Unadilla, NY




★★★★★I 
            was a little scared to switch...
            I recently changed all of my insurance due to the horrid flood insurance 
            policies, Jennifer was so helpful in finding me flood insurance at 
            a reasonable rate and included my home insurance also. Since she did 
            so well with that we changed our car insurance also. When she found 
            me a company I had never heard of, I was a little scared to switch. 
            But did anyways and then 3 weeks later my son totaled his car. But 
            with working with this new company and Jennifer everything worked 
            out well. I am so thankful for all her help with my insurance needs. 
            Plus I have never had insurance people call to see how things are 
            going which I think is great customer service on her part. I thank 
            her for all her help and hard work."
Vicki Sanchez - Huntington Beach, CA




★★★★★...Affordable 
            Flood Insurance policy... 
            "I just wanted to say that you did a great job in setting me up with 
            an affordable flood insurance policy for my home. Your honesty, expertise 
            and professionalism was very refreshing after weeks of being put through 
            the ringer by other insurance providers. You saved me close to $2000.00 
            per year for twice the coverage offered by others and if I would have 
            found you sooner I would have saved another $750.00 dollars on a flood 
            elevation survey that I did not need! I will definitely recommend 
            your firm to friends and family that find themselves in the same predicament 
            as I. Thank you so much for a pleasant experience and your superior 
            performance."
Robert Gallagher - Rochester, NY




★★★★★"...Beginning 
            of a long relationship between us...My wife June and I would like 
            to express our sincere appreciation to Jennifer for an excellent job 
            that she did for us. She found solutions to our needs, not only saving 
            us money but also found us better policies. Jennifer is very courteous, 
            knowledgeable, professional and reliable. Her customer service is 
            second to none. She is always calm under pressure. We tried to do 
            eight policies all at once with one fairly complex policy. She tried 
            many options to come up with the best solution for each property. 
            We believe she got us a very good package. We trust that this is just 
            the beginning of a long relationship between us and your company."
Glang Dao - Milpitas, CA

            what I expected, not only did they give me great rates but as a consumer 
            I feel better educated about my insurance. I know what the coverage's

Tips for Picking the Proper Flood Insurance

          Two inches of water can cause nearly $8,000 damage to the average home, 
          according to research conducted by the Federal Emergency Management 
          Agency (FEMA).
          Not only is water-related damage one of the most common causes of an 
          insurance claim, thanks to recent flood-zone revisions by FEMA, millions 
          of homeowners are racing to find affordable flood insurance for the 
          first time. 
          Unfortunately, selecting the best flood insurance isn't always the easiest 
          of tasks.
          Following is a checklist to use when speaking with an agent about purchasing 
          the right flood insurance protection for your property. 
        
Many underwriters are restricted from writing a new flood policy once 
          a major event is announced, so shop for flood insurance ahead of time. 
          
          Find out when the flood policy is scheduled to go into effect, and ask 
          about purchasing a temporary policy during the interim. 
          Remember, flood insurance doesn't always cost a lot. 
          Homes in low to moderate risk areas may qualify for preferred risk policies.
Policy Specifics 
          Understand what type of flooding is included and what is excluded, as 
          well as which portion of the policy will cover the damage.
          For example, high winds from a hurricane may result in water damage 
          to exposed areas of the home, earthquakes can cause pipes to burst and 
          even putting out a fire may result in extensive water damage. 
          Ask your agent what portions of the policy provide needed protection 
          in different scenarios, and evaluate the deductibles, limitations and 
          restrictions for each.
 Review Your Risk
          Updated flood maps have resulted in big changes. 
Visit www.floodsmart.gov 
          and enter your zip code to get an up-to-date listing of flood risks 
          for your area
 Flooding is the United States' #1 natural hazard. 
          We want consumers to know that while homeowner's insurance won't cover 
          them against flooding, they can protect their home and property by purchasing 
          a flood insurance policy separately through us--the flood insurance 
          specialists.
          Many people are under the misconception that they are ineligible for 
          flood insurance because of where they live, or their mortgage status. 
          But the truth is, as long as your hometown is an NFIP community, most 
          homeowners, business owners and renters can get flood insurance. We 
          urge consumers to remember the flood insurance basics:

          You CAN get flood insurance nationwide.

You CAN get flood insurance nationwide.
You CAN get flood insurance if you live in a floodplain or high-flood-risk 
            area.
You CAN get flood insurance if you live outside a floodplain, or 
            a low-to-moderate flood-risk area - and at lower cost.
You CAN get flood insurance if your property has been flooded before.
You CAN get flood insurance from insurance agents in your area.
You CAN get flood insurance even if your mortgage broker doesn't 
            require it.

---------------------------------
 NFIP- National Flood Insurance Program aka FEMA flood insurance 
          Program Changes as of January 1, 2013

          NFIP previously announced average premium increases of 5% overall and 
          3% for Preferred Risk Policies as their annual premium change to the 
          flood program. Those premium changes were covered in FEMA 
          W-12027, summarized in Summer 
          FloodLines and will be implemented as of October 1, 2012. Therefore, 
          the premium increases below represent successive increases due to the 
          passage of the Biggert Waters Flood Reform Act. 
 NFIP Extends PRP Extension Eligibility Beyond the Initial 
          2 Year Period

          While FEMA completes a study and analysis to develop an implementation 
          strategy for the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012, 
          policies written as Preferred Risk Policies under the 2 Year PRP Eligibility 
          Extension may continue to be renewed as PRPs beyond the previously designated 
          2-year period. 
 Under the initial 2-Year PRP Eligibility Extension, buildings newly 
          mapped into a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) on or after October 1, 
          2008, became eligible for the PRP for 2 years beginning on January 1, 
          2011. Buildings newly mapped into an SFHA on or after January 1, 2011, 
          were also eligible for the PRP during the 2-year period following the 
          map revision date. At the end of the 2-year period, the policies were 
          required to be rewritten as standard-rated policies. For more information 
          please review FEMA 
          Bulletin W-10085 Aug. 23, 2010. 
Beginning with the first renewal effective on or after January 1, 2013, 
          policies issued under the PRP Eligibility Extension that meet the PRP 
          loss history requirements will not be transitioned into standard X-zone 
          rating, but will continue to be issued as PRPs at each renewal until 
          further notice. Under the extension, new business PRPs may also continue 
          to be issued for properties newly mapped into the SFHA as a result of 
          a map revision that became effective on or after October 1, 2008.
 NFIP Announces Jan. 1, 2013 Premium Increases for Preferred Risk Policies 
          (PRP) 

          Premiums will increase an average of 13% for PRPs written or renewed 
          on or after January 1, 2013. (The 3% increase as of October 1, 2012 
          and the average 10% increase as of Jan. 1, 2013 combined.) The combined 
          premium for a particular policy may change more or less than the average 
          13% total PRP premium change. The PRP premium tables that become effective 
          January 1, 2013, are included in the full FEMA bulletin linked below. 
          

          For more information and to view Jan. 1, 2013 PRP rate tables, please 
          refer to the entire FEMA 
          Bulletin W-12054 related to the January 1, 2013 changes. 
NFIP Provides Premium Increase Rates for Non-Primary Residence Properties

          Through the passage of HR 5740 authorizing the NFIP through July 31, 
          2012, the NFIP was directed for properties not the primary residence 
          of an individual to discontinue premium subsidies and to increase the 
          premium rates by 25% each year until the average risk premium rate equals 
          the average risk premium rates for actuarially-based properties beginning 
          on July 1, 2012.br> 

          The FEMA 
          Bulletin 12043 includes the premium rate tables to accomplish this 
          25% increase as of Jan. 1, 2013 and further information for your use. 
          

          Fidelity renewal billings for policies renewing Jan. 1, 2013 or later, 
          not indicated in our files as primary residence, and rated with subsidies 
          will contain the required 25% increase as well as a statement to inform 
          policyholders of the premium increase effective on that renewal billing. 
          The statement will read similar to the following: 

          On May 31, 2012, HR 5740 was signed into law amending the National Flood 
          Insurance Program. One provision of the new law states that residential 
          properties that are not the policy holder's primary residence are no 
          longer eligible to receive subsidized rates. Furthermore, the law requires 
          that rates for these risks must increase by 25% each year until it reaches 
          the appropriate actuarial rate level as determined by FEMA. 

          Flood insurance covers direct physical loss caused by "flood." In simple 
          terms, a flood is an excess of water on land that is normally dry. Here's 
          the official definition used by the National Flood Insurance Program. 
          

          A flood is (1) "A general and temporary condition of partial or complete 
          inundation of two or more acres of normally dry land area or of two 
          or more properties (at least one of which is your property) from a. 
          overflow of inland or tidal waters; b. unusual and rapid accumulation 
          or runoff of surface waters from any source; or c. mudflow*. (2) Collapse 
          or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or similar body of water 
          as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of 
          water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels that result in a flood as 
          defined in A.1.a. Above." 

          * Mudflow is defined (in part) as "A river of liquid and flowing mud 
          on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried 
          by a current of water."

Shelter Insurance Company is a mutual insurance company which focuses on Auto, Property, Business, and Life Insurance. It operates in fourteen U.S. states and the headquarters is in Columbia, Missouri.
Shelter was founded in 1946 as the insurance subsidiary of the Missouri Farmers Association (the same company as MFA Incorporated), and was called MFA Mutual Insurance Company.[1] The Shelter name came from the company's most famous slogan, "M.F.A is your Shield of Shelter". In 1981, the name was changed to Shelter Insurance Companies.[2] The company's headquarters remained in Columbia. The Shelter Insurance Gardens are located at the company headquarters in Columbia.[3]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
