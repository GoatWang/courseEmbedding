Joel Grade Named Sysco Chief Financial Officer, Effective Sept. 1, 2015
Chris Kreidler Elects to Step Down After Six Years in CFO Role



















April 01, 2015 08:00 ET

 | Source: Sysco Corporation





HOUSTON, April 1, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) announced today that Joel T. Grade has been named executive vice president and chief financial officer, effective Sept. 1, 2015, following Chris Kreidler's decision to leave the company in order to relocate to the northeast and spend more time with his family. Kreidler will remain CFO through Aug. 31, 2015, and work closely with Grade and Sysco's senior executive team to ensure an orderly transition of his responsibilities. Kreidler has also agreed to stay on through the end of December as an advisor to the company.

	"Chris was the first senior executive I hired upon becoming CEO in 2009, and we are indebted to him for his many contributions and tireless efforts on behalf of Sysco," said Bill DeLaney, Sysco's president and chief executive officer. "His strong leadership in capital markets, long-term planning, mergers and acquisitions, and integration planning for the US Foods merger are areas where Chris has made a significant and long-term impact on our company. We respect Chris' thoughtful and personal decision to step down, and wish Chris and his family all the best for their future."

	Grade has served as Sysco's senior vice president of finance and chief accounting officer since early 2014 with responsibility for field finance, commercial finance, financial planning and analysis, financial reporting, and shared services accounting. He began his career at Sysco as a staff auditor in 1996 and has since held a variety of senior finance and commercial roles, including chief financial officer of Sysco Chicago in 2002 followed by chief financial officer of Sysco Canada in 2007. He was later promoted to president of Sysco Canada in 2010 and then became senior vice president of foodservice operations, north region and Canada in 2012. Grade earned an undergraduate degree in Accounting and Finance with a specialization in International Business from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1993 and an MBA in Finance, Strategy and Marketing from Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management in 2007.

	"As a veteran Sysco leader with nearly 20 years of experience in key finance and commercial roles, Joel is uniquely suited to step into the CFO position," DeLaney said. "His deep knowledge of our local operations and people, combined with his more recent service at the corporate level, give him a well-rounded view of how to better serve our customers. We are fortunate to have a leader like Joel ready to take on this key position and I look forward to working closely with him in his new role as we move forward."

About Sysco

505 KB|5 pagesProduct DescriptionStudents learn about a variety of Cold War events and people through the song We Didn't Start the Fire by Billy Joel.  This poster project on over 30 Cold War topics includes but is not limited to: JFK, Marilyn Monroe, Space Race, AIDS, Atomic Bomb, Eisenhower, Berlin Wall, Red China, Joe McCarthy, Stalin, Einstein, Disney, Sputnik, Castro, Cuba, Ho Chi Minh, Korean War, Palestine, Israel, Environmentalism, and Sally Ride.  

Students listen to the song We Didn't Start the Fire and watch the music video if possible.  After discussing it, the students pick a person/event from the song to be the topic of their poster project (I typically have them pick out of a hat).

The requirements for the poster are outlined very clearly on the handout, including written research, maps, images, cited sources, a quote, a timeline, and more.  This absolutely requires library research days.  This is a great opportunity for the students to teach each other about some of the things from 1950-1989 that as a class you might not have time to get to.  

The file includes a brief explanation of the topics mentioned in the song.  I cut those items into strips for the students to pick out of a hat.

Sysco CFO Joel Grade: Connecting Finance to Customers and the Business







 







Joel Grade






 
Since joining Houston-based Sysco Corp. as a staff auditor in 1996, Joel Grade has not only held a variety of finance positions but has also worked as president of Sysco Canada and as a regional senior vice president of foodservice operations. Those experiences, he says, have shaped his roll-up-your-sleeves view of finance, and informed him on how finance can help drive the company’s growth.
In this conversation with Tom Bendert, principal with Deloitte Consulting LLP, Mr. Grade discusses why he thinks Sysco is well-positioned to build on its 48-year legacy as it continues to work toward improving the customer experience, enhancing associate engagement and achieving financial objectives.
Tom Bendert: Joel, what are the top priorities for Sysco?
Joel Grade: At Sysco’s Investor Day in September 2015, we laid out a three-year strategic plan intended to achieve a gain in operating income of at least $400 million. Halfway through, we are actually outperforming our goals so the new target is $600 million to $650 million. Our strategy is based on several pillars that we refer to as the “5 P’s”— partnership, productivity, products, people and portfolio. Within each of these, we have specific objectives to drive the customer experience and be more productive in everything we do. For example, we have invested in a shared services center that, while still in its early stages, is allowing us to provide more consistent service to our customers while taking transactional work out of the field. Similarly, we are finding ways to better utilize technology to make our sales force more productive, such as eliminating manual order taking and other administrative tasks, so that salespeople can spend more time selling.
Improving productivity across the organization is something we approach very holistically because it is so closely tied to growth. By understanding what we do, where we do it and how we do it, we can gain leverage out of our cost structure and reinvest the savings we achieve into the business to drive growth. Our ultimate aim is to invest in people, technology and process to enhance our customer experience and make our business more competitive and differentiated.
Tom Bendert: What support do you as CFO and your finance team provide in these efforts?
Joel Grade: Part of my responsibility, in conjunction with other team members, is to help increase productivity by determining where we can invest, to both grow our business and drive costs out of our system. One way we do that is by having finance very much integrated into the business. We have people who support the sales function, merchandising, marketing, business technology, supply chain and other areas in order to achieve that. In addition, we have our locations in the field in which there is a regional structure with a finance leader to support the teams in those local markets.
I find people—whether in the supply chain, marketing, sales or some other function—have many great ideas, but to effectively monetize them, finance needs to be closely involved, in order to say, “That makes sense, but have you considered X?” or “What can we also do here?” That’s the expectation I have for my people, to work as part of the solution and to help make sure that we get the most out of the investments we make, whether it’s a marketing campaign, a new customer contract or venturing into a new market segment.
Our finance team is also focused on capital allocation issues—how we might reinvest in the business, return value to shareholders in the form of dividends, pursue M&A, pay down debt and so on.
Tom Bendert: How does M&A fit into Sysco’s growth strategy, and what role does finance play?
Joel Grade: M&A is a key capital allocation priority, and we think of it in three buckets. One is around our core North American business, which has been our primary market; our approach to M&A here is mostly for smaller fold-in-and-tuck-in deals, either to broaden our geographies or to broaden our capabilities and product lines. Our product line is diverse, from mop handles to lobster tails, so we look for companies that have products—and, importantly, expertise—in, say, produce or meat or seafood. I’d call those core-business acquisitions.
The second bucket is around adjacencies; products or services that complement our business, such as hotel amenities. And the third bucket is around international, as geographic expansion is an important part of our overall strategy. Historically, our approach has been to do a couple of larger, transformative deals and then build around them. Last year we acquired the Brakes Group in Europe, and we continue to expand in Latin America and in the Caribbean. Finance is closely involved across the entire M&A process, from analyzing prospective deals to financing the transaction to supporting the integration work, including integrating the acquired company’s finance processes. We also work closely with our investor relations team to represent the transaction to the marketplace and put it in the context of our overall growth story.
Tom Bendert: Given the expanding scope of what Sysco sells and to whom, how do you keep pace with customers’ expectations?
Joel Grade: Sysco has always been a customer-centric organization—­it’s ingrained in our DNA, and we are always evolving our capabilities. We realize that every market we operate in has unique needs, whether it’s Miami, Florida or Lyon, France. We’ve made technology investments that enable us to serve our customers much more consistently and efficiently.
We also have a team of finance people who support our merchandising organization, specifically around category management. For example, they provide analytics and related support to help determine the opportunities and pitfalls in different product categories. Although the finance team doesn’t make decisions on specific products, they partner with merchandising colleagues to identify opportunities and risks. They also assess opportunities and trends where finance can provide insight.
Tom Bendert: How does your international expansion impact the composition of your investor base?
Joel Grade: Sysco has always had a very international shareholder base­—it’s about 16% now, which is well above average for what we regard as our peer group. Our key shareholder base is long-term strategic investors. There are some U.S. shareholders who fit that description, and that profile is also represented strongly in the European investor base, and also in Asia, which is relatively small for us now. During and after our acquisition of Brakes, we spent time in Europe developing our story and getting our name out in places that have long-term, high-quality investors. So as Sysco’s world has expanded, we have changed and evolved our investor outreach to include relatively frequent interaction with international investors.
When I think about communicating with investors, regardless of market, I think it’s all about being clear and consistent, transparent and balanced, and giving people the color behind the business so that they understand the full context. I believe in talking about the “good, the bad and the ugly,” focusing on the “why” of what you’re doing, and holding yourselves accountable.
Tom Bendert: How does your goal to embed finance into the business influence your talent development strategy?
Joel Grade: We don’t have an ivory-tower culture in finance; rather, we have people who combine financial skills with a desire to really participate in the business. And so we need sharp, innovative analytical people who aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty.
For people who want to move around and gain diverse experiences, we provide opportunities to do that, and providing opportunities is at the core of how I think about talent development. For example, somebody can come here and get experience working hand-in-hand with sales, with merchandising, with supply chain and also gain experience in our field organization, among other areas. We don’t have a formal rotation program, but we do create detailed individual development plans. We also emphasize coaching and try to help people to maximize their performance and meet their career goals.
Tom Bendert: You have a strong operations background and a long tenure at Sysco. How has that shaped your approach to the CFO role?
Joel Grade: Both of those factors are fundamental to how I operate. A number of the people who serve as “market presidents” have worked for me at some point. That has helped me build up credibility, which can be helpful when reaching out into the field organization and influencing a decision. They know that I understand our markets and how our customers think. When you’ve been out in the warehouses talking to night and day staff, when you’ve spent time with the drivers and local suppliers and customers, you gain a broader perspective. It’s part of what helps finance be an active participant in helping drive our business. My philosophy is, we are all in sales, we are all in operations, and we all ultimately own this organization, so don’t be a bystander.

Execution Risk: Stepping Over 12 Common Hurdles

                          Whether an incoming CFO is charged with improving performance or a sitting finance chief is trying to transform the organization, execution risk looms large. Consider, for example, the risks involved in changing an organization’s business model, expanding globally or even in getting projects that are off the rails back on track. There are three primary drivers of execution risk—availability of critical resources, stakeholder commitment and alignment, and emotional/social resistance—and solving for them begins by understanding their root causes. Learn 12 issues leaders should consider addressing to help deliver successful change initiatives.
                        



Building Strong Relationships with Segment CEOs: Charles Holley, CFO-in-Residence

                          Having a strong relationship with business segment leaders is an important element to being the kind of CFO that CEOs look for to help them drive their vision and execute the organization’s strategy, according to Charles Holley, retired CFO of Walmart. Mr. Holley discusses how finance chiefs can establish that strong relationship by becoming a trusted business partner to segment CEOs, developing an ability to be an adept influencer to guide decisions for both their segments and the enterprise and by serving as the CEO’s enforcer when necessary.
                        



Analytics: Five Skills to Help Finance Soar

                          Making analytics a core competency for finance depends on people, as well as strategy, process, data and technology. However, to move beyond descriptive analytics and into the realm of predictive and prescriptive analytics, CFOs need to understand the skillsets that are required to make the leap. Learn why CFOs are ideally positioned to address this talent challenge, which can help move the needle on analytics accomplishments even if readiness in other areas is lagging.

Four Ways CFOs Can Avoid a Digital Talent Crunch

                          Technology is redefining how work gets done, both in the back office and in frontline operations. While the rapid growth of digital technologies creates new opportunities for finance, it also creates the potential for a digital divide: If members of the finance team lack the necessary skillsets and business acumen, they may not be able to make the most of these new digital capabilities.  Learn how CFOs can help their organization advance its digital efforts by focusing on leadership, culture, skills development and engagement.
                        



Keeping Finance Talent Relevant to Changing Needs: Charles Holley, CFO-in-Residence

                          It’s no secret that talent is key to a CFO’s success, yet talent is a perennial top challenge for CFOs. That’s partly due to the continually changing definition of what it means to have a talented finance team, says Charles Holley, an independent senior advisor to Deloitte. Drawing on his extensive leadership experiences, he explains how to identify, recruit and develop the people best suited for the fast-changing demands of finance. The key, he says, is finding the best athletes and keeping their capabilities relevant and aligned to the needs of the business.

                          To elevate the strategic contribution that a finance organization’s FP&A team can make, CFOs should focus on developing the team’s technical, professional and leadership competencies. Specifically, they can use a four-part model that provides opportunities to gain education and experience with exposure to key decision-makers and the expectation that FP&A will function more strategically. Rotating talent from FP&A into the business and back again can also help team members acquire both a broader understanding of the organization and the specialized knowledge that can make this function integral to the organization’s success.

Company Press Release
HOUSTON, April 1, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) announced today that Joel T. Grade has been named executive vice president and chief financial officer, effective Sept. 1, 2015, following Chris Kreidler’s decision to leave the company in order to relocate to the northeast and spend more time with his family. Kreidler will remain CFO through Aug. 31, 2015, and work closely with Grade and Sysco’s senior executive team to ensure an orderly transition of his responsibilities. Kreidler has also agreed to stay on through the end of December as an advisor to the company.
“Chris was the first senior executive I hired upon becoming CEO in 2009, and we are indebted to him for his many contributions and tireless efforts on behalf of Sysco,” said Bill DeLaney, Sysco’s president and chief executive officer. “His strong leadership in capital markets, long-term planning, mergers and acquisitions, and integration planning for the US Foods merger are areas where Chris has made a significant and long-term impact on our company. We respect Chris’ thoughtful and personal decision to step down, and wish Chris and his family all the best for their future.”
Grade has served as Sysco’s senior vice president of finance and chief accounting officer since early 2014 with responsibility for field finance, commercial finance, financial planning and analysis, financial reporting, and shared services accounting. He began his career at Sysco as a staff auditor in 1996 and has since held a variety of senior finance and commercial roles, including chief financial officer of Sysco Chicago in 2002 followed by chief financial officer of Sysco Canada in 2007. He was later promoted to president of Sysco Canada in 2010 and then became senior vice president of foodservice operations, north region and Canada in 2012. Grade earned an undergraduate degree in Accounting and Finance with a specialization in International Business from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1993 and an MBA in Finance, Strategy and Marketing from Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management in 2007.
“As a veteran Sysco leader with nearly 20 years of experience in key finance and commercial roles, Joel is uniquely suited to step into the CFO position,” DeLaney said. “His deep knowledge of our local operations and people, combined with his more recent service at the corporate level, give him a well-rounded view of how to better serve our customers. We are fortunate to have a leader like Joel ready to take on this key position and I look forward to working closely with him in his new role as we move forward.”
