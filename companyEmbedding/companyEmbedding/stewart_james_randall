Stuart Randall (July 24, 1909 – June 22, 1988)[1] was an American actor of film and television who appeared on screen between 1950 and 1971.
He is best known for his recurring role as Sheriff Mort Corey in thirty-four episodes which aired between April 4, 1961, and April 20, 1963, of the western television series, Laramie. He appeared in three earlier Laramie episodes under different character names.[1]
Randall's first role was also as a sheriff in the 1950 Roy Rogers film, Bells of Coronado. He appeared in Pickup on South Street as a police commissioner. In 1954, he played a sheriff in the episode "Belle Starr" of the syndicated television series Stories of the Century, starring and narrated by Jim Davis.[1]
In 1955, he portrayed Tom Garvey in "Cattle Drive to Casper" on the NBC anthology series, Frontier, narrated by Walter Coy. His co-stars in the episode included Jack Elam, Beverly Garland, and Ray Teal.[2] He appeared in 1958–59 as Sheriff Art Sampson (billed in the last appearance as Art Simpson) on an earlier NBC series, Cimarron City, set in an Oklahoma boomtown. John Smith was a co-star in that series too.[3]
Other roles[edit]
Randall guest starred on at least nine other NBC westerns, seven times on The Virginian and in six episodes of Bonanza and John Payne's The Restless Gun, three times on Riverboat (once as General Winfield Scott in the 1960 episode "The Quota"), twice on Wagon Train, and once each on Overland Trail, Daniel Boone and The High Chaparral, all in assorted roles of mostly law enforcement officers, other authority figures, or ranchers. He appeared seven times on ABC's The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, three times on the Will Hutchins ABC/Warner Brothers western Sugarfoot, twice each on ABC's Colt .45, Cheyenne, Lawman, and The Rifleman, and once each on the network's Maverick, Destry (as Sheriff Denton in "Big Deal at Little River"), and The Big Valley.[1]
From 1959 to 1967, Randall appeared eleven times on CBS's Lassie, three in the 1967 role of Len Briggs. His other CBS appearances were on Schlitz Playhouse, Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater, The Texan, Yancy Derringer, Wanted: Dead or Alive, Dundee and the Culhane, Lancer (as Sheriff Dundee in "The Measure of a Man"), Tightrope, Checkmate, and Perry Mason, as he played Sheriff Max Taylor in the 1964 episode "The Case of the Fifty Millionth Frenchman."[1] He appeared in the 1962 episode entitled "Jeopardy" of the NBC family drama series, National Velvet.
His later roles were as Captain O'Loughlin in the 1969 episode "Let Ernest Come Over" of the ABC medical drama Marcus Welby, M.D., starring Robert Young, and as Jack Campbell in the 1971 episode "In the Line of Duty" of NBC's Ironside, starring Raymond Burr. His final television appearance was on November 1, 1971, as Deputy Attorney General Hawkins in the episode "Dreadful Sorry Clementine" of the ABC western Alias Smith and Jones.[1]
In June 1969, Randall was grand marshal of the Hesperia Days Parade in Hesperia, California. He died in 1988, aged 78, in San Bernardino, California from undisclosed causes.

                                1174515597
                            

                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.
                            



                                Entity Type
                            

                                Individual
                            

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Sole Proprietor
                            

                                N
                            

                                Indicate whether provider is a sole proprietor.

A sole proprietor is the sole (the only) owner of a business that is not incorporated; that unincorporated business is a sole proprietorship.
In a sole proprietorship, the sole proprietor owns all of the assets of the business and is solely liable for all of the debts of the business.
There is no difference between a sole proprietorship and a sole proprietor; they are legally a single entity: an individual.
In terms of NPI assignment, a sole proprietor is an Entity type 1 (Individual) and is eligible for only one NPI (the sole proprietorship business is not eligible for its own NPI).
As an individual, a sole proprietorship cannot be a subpart and cannot have subparts. (See NPI Final Rule for information about subparts.)
A sole proprietorship may or may not have employees.
Often, the IRS assigns an EIN to a sole proprietorship in order to protect the sole proprietor's SSN from disclosure in claims or on W-2s. NPPES does not capture a sole proprietorship's EIN.
Many types of health care providers could be sole proprietorships (for example, group practices, pharmacies, home health agencies).





                                Provider Last Name (Legal Name)
                            

                                STEWART
                            

                                The last name of the provider (if an individual). If the provider is an individual, this is the legal name. This name must match the name on file with the Social Security Administration (SSA). In addition, the date of birth must match that on file with SSA. (First and last names are required for initial applications.) The First, Middle, Last and Credential(s) fields allow the following special characters: ampersand, apostrophe, colon, comma, forward slash, hyphen, left and right parentheses, period, pound sign, quotation mark, and semi-colon. A field cannot contain all special characters.

How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Georgia, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner. Choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
