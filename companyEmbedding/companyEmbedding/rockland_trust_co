History[edit]
Rockland Trust's 1927 petition to open a branch in Hull, Massachusetts sparked a state-level debate on whether to allow "kangaroo banking" (banks opening branches in non-adjacent towns). The proposal was opposed by Alvan T. Fuller, then Governor of Massachusetts, and Hingham Trust, a bank based closer to Hull. The petition was finally granted by the Massachusetts legislature.[3]
In 1910, Rockland Trust began offering "Automobile Banking" — an innovative program that offered banking services to nearby towns (including Hull, Massachusetts) from the window of a special adapted car. The program was so well received that it continued through 1955.
In 2008, Rockland Trust acquired Slades Ferry Bank.
In 2009, Rockland Trust acquired Benjamin Franklin Bank, adding 11 new branches and expanding into Boston's MetroWest area.
