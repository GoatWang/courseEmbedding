The information inside was identical and I was able to complete the assignments and follow along in class.  I find paperback books easier to carry to and from class, so this was a great option for me.  The pictures are in color, and the print is more than large enough to read.  The paper quality is nice, and it is not too thin or brittle.  I used this book for approximately 12 weeks during the summer semester of 2016 and it did not wear and tear.  It was also easy to put post-its with notes inside and highlighter did not smear across the page.  This is a very well written book and contains a great deal of relevant information about marketing.  It is a good high level view for someone who has not been exposed to the field before.  The index is separated into different sections including name, company, brand and organization.  I found this especially helpful when I was writing essays assigned by my professor.  There is also a very comprehensive glossary and easily searchable Table of Contents and includes a "Brief Contents" and "Contents" section that provided either a quick view of the pages or something more in depth depending on what you needed.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in the marketing field.Read more0Comment|

Philip Kotler







Philip Kotler and Kevin Lane Keller distinguish the following five product levels:

Pure material goods - offer is made only by tangible goods (product) that isn’t accompanied by any service - e.g. soap, toothpaste, salt
Predominant material goods with accompanying services - offer consists primarily of a product that is accompanied by a minor service (or retail services) - e.g. car accompanies services
Hybrid - offer is made equally by products and services - e.g. high-end restaurant offers not only excellent food but also perfect service, music, bar and other facilities
Predominant service with accompanying goods - the essence of offer is a service, accompanied by minor goods - e.g. basis of air transport is a service (transportation) accompanied by food, beverage, newspaper and magazines, film screenings, etc.
Pure service - offer is made only by services - e.g. psychotherapy, massages, babysitting

"Did you know that Philip Kotler was recently ranked as the fourth "Most Influential Business Writer/Management Guru" of the 21st century?"
 
The recently published article conducted by The Financial Times polled over 1,000 chief executives in 25 countries around the world and ranked people who had the most influence in business theory and practice in the past year (2005). To view the complete ranking as a .pdf document, please visit: http://news.ft.com/cms/88762712-576c-11da-b7ea-00000e25118c.pdf

5 Most Influential Business Writers or Management Gurus of the 21st century:
  Peter Drucker Bill Gates Jack Welch Philip Kotler  Michael Porter 
" What are some current trends in marketing management? How do you bring the latest concepts into your classroom?"
  NEW — “Holistic marketing” coverage — Explores the emerging concept that everything matters in marketing: internal marketing, integrated marketing, relationship marketing, and socially responsible marketing.
"Do you like to have to have flexibility in chapter topics?"
 NEW — Modular Organization - Kotler and Keller focused on preserving the strengths and core topics, while carefully tightening coverage in every chapter for greater clarity.  By organizing the text into seven parts of related material, a more modular approach, instructors have greater flexibility.  For example: see Table of Contents.

  NEW - Casebook solutions! Instructors: Visit www.prenhall.com/custombusiness to see how easy it is to create a casebook or coursepack that includes cases and readings from leading providers, like Harvard Business School Publishing.  An exam copy takes just 2 weeks.   When students purchase a casebook bundled with this text, they save 10%

  NEW - Simulations from Interpretive Simulations! Instructors, please visit: www.prenhall.com/interpretive for additional information. Students get a top textbook from PH, a premium simulation from Interpretive, and a discount on both!
 
 
Other Points of Differentiation
 
 "Many say Kotler defined this course and the third edition of Framework for Marketing Management is noteworthy because it's the first time Kotler is joined by a co-author.  Are you familiar with Kevin Lane Keller?"
 NEW - Philip Kotler invites Kevin Lane Keller to be co-author -  Acknowledged as one of the international leaders in the study of strategic brand management and integrated marketing communications, Kevin is presently E.B.Osborn Professor of Marketing at the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration at Dartmouth College.  His research has been widely cited and has received numerous awards, and he’s served as brand confident to marketers at the world’s top companies, including Disney, Ford, Intel, Levi Strauss, Nike, Procter & Gamble and Starbucks.   Kevin also writes Strategic Brand Management (Prentice Hall).
