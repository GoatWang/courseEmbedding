Risk Considerations
Investments in mutual funds involve risk. Stocks may decline in value. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate, credit, liquidity and market risks to varying degrees. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. Investing in foreign securities, particularly those of emerging markets, presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, and market risks. There are additional risks associated with investing in commodities, high-yield bonds, aggressive growth stocks, non-diversified/concentrated funds and small- and mid-cap stocks which are more fully explained in the prospectuses. Please read the prospectus for more information.

*Fund risk: Deutsche Limited Maturity Quality Income Fund and Deutsche Ultra-Short Investment Grade FundBond investments are subject to interest-rate, credit, liquidity and market risks to varying degrees. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. In certain situations, it may be difficult or impossible to sell an investment at an acceptable price. Investing in foreign securities presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, and market risks. These funds may lend securities to approved institutions. These funds are not "money market funds" and do not attempt to maintain a stable net asset value. See the prospectus for details. 




Although tax-free funds seek income that is exempt from federal income taxes, a portion of the funds' returns may be subject to federal, state, local and alternative minimum tax. Please read the prospectus for more information. You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. The Fund may impose a fee upon sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor had no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time. The credit quality of the fund's holdings can change rapidly in certain markets, and the default of a single holding could have an adverse impact on the fund's share price. The fund's share price can also be negatively affected during periods of high redemption pressures and/or illiquid markets. The actions of a few large investors in one class of shares of the fund may have a significant adverse effect on the share prices of all classes of shares of the fund. Money Market investments are subject to interest-rate and credit risks. When interest rates rise, prices generally fall. In addition, any unexpected behavior in interest rates could increase the volatility of the fund's yield and could hurt fund performance. Prepayments could also create capital gains tax liability in some instances. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Although individual securities may outperform the market, the entire market may decline as a result of rising interest rates, regulatory developments or deteriorating economic conditions. Any investments in money market instruments of foreign issuers are subject to some of the risks of foreign investing, such as unfavorable political and legal developments, limited financial information, and regulatory risk and, economic and financial instability. Portfolio management could be wrong in its analysis of industries, companies, economic trends and favor a security that underperforms the market. See the prospectus for specific details regarding each fund's risk profile.To obtain a summary prospectus, if available, or prospectus, for Institutional money market funds distributed by Deutsche AM Distributors, Inc., download one now or call Institutional Investor Services at (800) 730-1313 Monday through Friday, 8:30 am to 6:00 pm ET.
