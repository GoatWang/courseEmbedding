P/CF Ratio
The price to cash flow ratio (P/CF) is a fundamental measure used to determine if an investment is valued appropriately. Each holding&#39;s P/CF is the latest closing price divided by the latest fiscal year&#39;s cash flow per share. Negative P/CF ratios are excluded from this calculation.

P/B Ratio
The price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is a fundamental measure used to determine if an investment is valued appropriately. The book value of a company is a measure of how much a company&#39;s assets are worth assuming the company&#39;s debts are paid off. Each holding&#39;s P/B is the latest closing price divided by the latest fiscal year&#39;s book value per share. Negative book values are excluded from this calculation.

12m Trailing Yield
The yield an investor would have received if they had held the fund over the last twelve months assuming the most recent NAV.

Funds that concentrate investments in specific industries, sectors, markets or asset classes may underperform or be more volatile than other industries, sectors, markets or asset classes and than the general securities market.


Real estate investment trusts ("REITs") are subject to changes in economic conditions, credit risk and interest rate fluctuations.


Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.


Index returns are for illustrative purposes only. Index performance returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance does not guarantee future results.


After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.


Certain sectors and markets perform exceptionally well based on current market conditions and iShares Funds can benefit from that performance. Achieving such exceptional returns involves the risk of volatility and investors should not expect that such results will be repeated.


Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, a person must receive a copy of "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options."

Structuring Private Real Estate Funds
Forming a private real estate fund provides a means for the successful real estate developer to access a dedicated pool of capital to fund new investment deals without having to raise capital on a deal-by-deal basis. This article provides an overview of some of the key structural considerations related to the formation, launch, and operation of a private real estate fund.
 
Private real estate funds enable managers to pool capital without having to navigate the cumbersome securities registration process involved in launching an REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) or other publicly-offered investment fund. Despite the relative ease of implementation, private real estate funds are structurally complex and sophisticated investors will expect to participate on terms that not only align interests between the investor and general partner/ sponsor, but that also reflect current market trends.
If you have questions about the process or costs to launch a private real estate fund, or are ready to start a fund, we invite you to contact us to schedule a complimentary consultation.
 
Entity Types
Private real estate funds are typically formed using an entity that is either a limited partnership or a limited liability company. Both of these entity types are known as pass-through entities so that they are essentially disregarded for tax purposes and all gains and losses are directly attributed to the limited partners or members of the entity. There has been a long standing tradition among private investment funds of using Delaware limited partnerships or limited liability companies as the entity of choice. However, principals should be aware that the laws of many states may deem holding real estate for income producing purposes to be an activity that requires an entity to be qualified to do business in the state where the real estate is located. In some states, qualifying an out-of-state entity, or a particular type of entity, to do business can be expensive in certain jurisdictions and might not be necessary if some advance planning is utilized. More particularly, principals should carefully discuss their investment strategy and implementation plans with experienced counsel and consider the benefits and drawbacks of using a particular entity type or jurisdiction for its formation.
 
Admission and Withdrawal of Investors
Since investments in real estate are illiquid, private real estate funds have many unique structural issues that must be addressed. An initial consideration is whether to use an open-end or closed-end fund structure. Many investors favor the open-end structure, which, in the simplest form, allows investors to enter and exit the fund at regular intervals determined by the fund’s sponsor. However, the illiquid nature of a private real estate fund’s investment assets often makes the open-end structure unworkable since it presents the fund with the dual problems of establishing a fair value for each contributing and withdrawing investor. Closed-end funds, on the other hand, cause all investors to join the private real estate fund at the same time, removing the issues concerning the initial value of their investments, and restrictions can be crafted to match investor withdrawal rights with the fund’s liquidity profile.
If managed properly, a private real estate fund’s investment assets should appreciate over time and, therefore, many early investors would consider the participation of subsequent investors inequitable without some sort of compensation for that appreciation. The difficulty comes in trying to determine the appropriate valuation for subsequent investors since formal real property appraisals may be the only way to properly assess the value of the fund’s investment assets. The appraisal process is expensive, can be time consuming, and, in some circumstances, may not be available at all. One potential solution is for a fund to utilize what are called “side pockets.” A side pocket refers to an internal accounting system where investors essentially participate in a private real estate fund’s investment assets on an investment-by-investment basis. Therefore, the valuation of the private real estate fund’s earlier investment assets is not at issue for subsequent investors because they will not be permitted to participate in the profits and losses resulting from the earlier investment assets.
Meanwhile, giving investors flexible withdrawal rights can cause significant problems for a private real estate fund. It is very difficult to provide timely liquidity from investments in real estate assets because there are really only two ways to accomplish this objective. One option is to arrange for the sale of the real property investment. However, several problems arise with this option, including:



forced sales generally result in substantially reduced sale proceeds
sales transaction can take a considerable amount of time to consummate
there may not be a ready buyer for the asset or the asset may not even be in salable condition (e.g., if the asset is a partially completed development project)



The second option is for a private real estate fund to leverage its real estate investments. This option may not be particularly attractive or even available based upon the fund’s existing indebtedness and creditworthiness and whether the fund’s real estate investments are already encumbered. Current market conditions have also made the availability of debt financing rather scarce in comparison to pre-financial crisis market conditions. Additionally, each of the two options mentioned previously can adversely impact the performance and risk profile of the fund for each investor that does not withdraw. Real estate fund sponsors should carefully match the liquidity of a private real estate fund’s investment assets with the withdrawal rights offered to the fund’s investors.

Initial Capital Contributions and Capital Calls
Private real estate funds possess certain unique capital needs based on the nature of the fund’s investment assets. Most funds utilize a “capital call” structure where investors are required to make an initial capital contribution at the time the fund accepts investment subscriptions. The remaining amount of each investor’s capital commitment is periodically “called down” by the fund. The capital call structure recognizes that most private real estate funds will be unable to precisely time the closing of the fund and the full deployment of all of the fund’s capital. The fund may also be making real estate investments where:

a substantial amount of time is required between the fund’s commitment to purchase the investment and the consummation of the underlying transaction, or
development activities are being undertaken and the fund is only required to make periodic progress payments on its investment asset

Not only is the timing of investor’s capital contributions critical to a private real estate fund’s ability to fund its investments, the contribution of capital also generally starts the clock running on the “preferred return” that the fund will pay to the investors.
 
Allocation of Profits and Losses; Clawbacks; Return of Capital
Most private real estate funds offer their investors a preferred return, together with a split of the fund’s overall net profits. The structure that specifies the order in which a fund’s profits and losses are allocated among investors and the fund’s manager/ sponsor is often referred to as the “waterfall.” Waterfalls vary widely in their structure and operation, depending upon a private real estate fund’s investment assets and overall investor profile.
Generally, profits are allocated in the following order:

investors will receive a return of their capital contributions
investors will receive a preferred return, calculated on the total amount of their capital contributions while such sums are held by the private real estate fund
the fund’s manager/ sponsor will receive an allocation equal to a portion of the total preferred return allocated to the investors (usually in the same percentage as the profit split and referred to as the preferred return “catch-up” or sponsor/ GP “catch-up”)
finally, the remaining profits are split between the investors and the fund’s sponsor

While no fund can ever guarantee the payment of a preferred return, investors are assured that they will receive the initial profits from the fund’s investment activities before the fund’s manager/ sponsor is entitled to any allocation of profits. However, there are a variety of ways to specify the calculation of a preferred return based on the timing of capital contributions or fund investments. The purpose of including a preferred return “catch-up” in a waterfall is to allow a private real estate fund’s general partner/ sponsor to have some participation in the fund’s profits, so long as the preferred return has been allocated to the investors. The catch-up feature ensures that the profits resulting from a successful private real estate fund are allocated exactly in accordance with the agreed upon profit split and, conversely, the profits from a marginally successful fund will be primarily allocated to investors rather than the fund’s manager/ sponsor.
Some funds will employ a “clawback” mechanism as a check against any over-allocation to a private real estate fund’s sponsor group. Clawback provisions take many different forms, but they generally serve as a contractual obligation of the fund’s manager/ sponsor to return any and all profit allocations it receives, in the event that:

any investor does not receive both (A) a return of the investor’s entire capital contribution, and (B) the entire preferred return on invested capital; or
the total amount allocated to the general partner/ sponsor over the life of the fund is greater than the agreed upon profit split

Private real estate funds can also differ from other types of funds in how and when capital contributions are returned to investors. A private real estate fund sponsor must closely consider the fund’s investment strategy when structuring for the return of capital. For example, a fund that is focused on fixing and “flipping” real estate would likely prefer to retain the proceeds resulting from sale of early investment assets for future investment activity. On the other hand, there would be no reason for a private real estate fund focused on the development of a single project to retain investor capital. Some funds also choose to treat current income generated from the fund’s investment assets differently than the proceeds from the sale of the fund’s investment assets, such that the waterfall for current income does not include a return of capital. However, it is important to keep in mind that the preferred return generally continues to accrue on all unreturned capital contributions and it may make more sense for the private real estate fund to return capital to investors at its earliest opportunity.

Fees and Expenses and Related Conflicts of Interest
As an investment type, real estate is often susceptible to the imposition of many fees and costs, some of which can appear to be duplicative or improperly allocated to investors in a private real estate fund. Real estate funds generally charge investors a fixed management fee, based on a percentage of the fund’s assets under management, to cover the manager’s costs of operating the fund. General fund expenses are also typically factored into the overall net profit or net loss available to investors. For example, if a private real estate fund contracts with a third-party to serve as a property developer, general contractor, or property manager for the fund’s investment assets, rather than utilizing the fund’s general partner/ sponsor in such roles, investors may question the purpose or amount of the management fee.
Certainly, conflicts of interest may arise when a fund’s manager/ sponsor does provide development or property management services to the fund and care should be exercised to fully disclose any and all amounts that the fund may pay to the fund manager and its affiliates. It is often helpful for a private real estate fund to consider a more customized compensation system for its general partner or manager in order to better align the interests of all parties. More complex compensation structures include fully-disclosed acquisition, development, and disposition fees, fixed limitations on total fees and expenses payable to the manager, and limitations that provide that ancillary fees will only be paid from the fund’s cash flow when it is ultimately distributed to the investors. In any case, investors must be given detailed disclosure regarding any compensation to a private real estate fund’s manager/ sponsor or the sponsor group risks significant potential liability as a result of non-disclosure.
 
Operational Considerations
By their nature, private real estate funds often reflect many of the characteristics of traditional operating businesses. The sponsor’s principal managers and employees must consider numerous operational issues that generally don’t arise in the course of operating other, open-end private investment funds. For example, a private real estate fund must be able to provide for the development, improvement, property management, and/or maintenance of its investment assets. Real estate investments also encounter unique requirements for insurance, compliance with state and local codes and ordinances, and will usually be subject to property taxes and other ongoing taxes and assessments. Successful real estate fund sponsor groups plan for operational challenges in advance to allow the fund to achieve its objectives and return capital to investors.
 
Conclusion
The process to launch a private real estate fund involves navigating a variety of structural complexities and business challenges. Presenting investors with an offering that is not consistent with current market imperatives will make the process to raise investor capital substantially more difficult. In what has become an increasingly competitive environment for investor funds, only those sponsors that take a thoughtful approach and present a coherent value proposition will succeed to build long-term value in a private real estate fund complex.

			Investment Approach

Focus on high quality underlying assets
			The quality and location of our assets, particularly the strength of our super regional malls and large office assets in primary markets, continues to differentiate the strategy.

Stronger growth demographics
			The strategy seeks to invest in attractive stabilized assets in markets with strong growth demographics.

Solid current income yield
			The strategy’s portfolio of quality assets attracts desirable tenants. The demand for high quality assets and strong leasing velocity across the portfolio provide for a solid, consistent current income yield. Our real estate asset managers constantly monitor the existing tenant base and execute leasing strategies for future growth at the asset level.

Broad portfolio diversification

The strategy’s size allows for broad portfolio diversification. No single asset, tenant or industry has undue influence on the value or performances of the portfolio. Additionally, our size and nimbleness allows us access to all major transactions offered through intermediaries and also to transactions not generally available on a competitive basis.

Minimal new development (pure core)
			Focus is on attractive stabilized investments with high quality physical improvements.

Portfolio Characteristics 



P/CF Ratio
The price to cash flow ratio (P/CF) is a fundamental measure used to determine if an investment is valued appropriately. Each holding&#39;s P/CF is the latest closing price divided by the latest fiscal year&#39;s cash flow per share. Negative P/CF ratios are excluded from this calculation.

as of 27-Jul-2017



15.78




P/B Ratio
The price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is a fundamental measure used to determine if an investment is valued appropriately. The book value of a company is a measure of how much a company&#39;s assets are worth assuming the company&#39;s debts are paid off. Each holding&#39;s P/B is the latest closing price divided by the latest fiscal year&#39;s book value per share. Negative book values are excluded from this calculation.

as of 27-Jul-2017



2.38




Equity Beta
Beta is a measure of the tendency of securities to move with the market as a whole. A beta of 1 indicates that the security&#39;s price will move with the market. A beta less than 1 indicates the security tends to be less volatile than the market, while a beta greater than 1 indicates the security is more volatile than the market.<br/><br/>Calculated vs. S&amp;P 500

as of 30-Jun-2017



1.18




Standard Deviation (3y)
Standard deviation measures how dispersed returns are around the average. A higher standard deviation indicates that returns are spread out over a larger range of values and thus, more volatile.

as of 30-Jun-2017



14.00%




Distribution Yield
The annual yield an investor would receive if the most recent fund distribution and current fund price stayed the same going forward. It’s calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution and dividing by the fund’s net asset value (NAV) from the as-of date.

as of 30-Jun-2017



3.74%




12m Trailing Yield
The yield an investor would have received if they had held the fund over the last twelve months assuming the most recent NAV. The 12-Month yield is calculated by assuming any income distributions over the past twelve months and dividing by the sum of the most recent NAV and any capital gain distributions made over the past twelve months.

as of 30-Jun-2017



3.94%




30 Day SEC Yield
A standard calculation of yield introduced by the SEC in order to provide fairer comparison among funds. This yield reflects the interest earned after deducting the fund&#39;s expenses during the most recent 30-day period by the average investor in the fund. Negative 30-Day SEC Yield results when accrued expenses of the past 30 days exceed the income collected during the past 30 days.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.


Funds that concentrate investments in specific industries, sectors, markets or asset classes may underperform or be more volatile than other industries, sectors, markets or asset classes and than the general securities market.


Real estate investment trusts ("REITs") are subject to changes in economic conditions, credit risk and interest rate fluctuations.


Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.


Index returns are for illustrative purposes only. Index performance returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance does not guarantee future results.


After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.


Certain sectors and markets perform exceptionally well based on current market conditions and iShares Funds can benefit from that performance. Achieving such exceptional returns involves the risk of volatility and investors should not expect that such results will be repeated.


The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).


Although BlackRock shall obtain data from sources that BlackRock considers reliable, all data contained herein is provided “as is” and BlackRock makes no representation or warranty of any kind, either express or implied, with respect to such data, the timeliness thereof, the results to be obtained by the use thereof or any other matter. BlackRock expressly disclaims any and all implied warranties, including without limitation, warranties of originality, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, non-infringement, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.

			Objective & Strategy
		

			
				The fund seeks total return through growth of capital and current income by investing primarily in domestic real estate securities.

			
			
				
			
		


Building Diversification
An active, total return strategy focused on US real estate investment trusts (REITs)
whose values are driven by real commercial property assets.



Management expertise
 
Competitive returns
 
Diversification potential


Established in 1983, Invesco Real
Estate manages $61.8 billion in direct
and publicly traded real estate
securities.
The Securities Investment team, a
subset of Invesco Real Estate, manages
$26.9 billion with six portfolio
managers and 16 analysts, averaging
21 years and 12 years experience,
respectively.
 
US REITs have historically provided
strong long-term total returns when
compared with the broad stock market.1
REITs have also been a source of
income because they are legally

Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers. It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

		Performance quoted is past performance and cannot guarantee comparable future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Investment return and principal value will vary so that you may have a gain or a loss when you sell shares. 


Performance shown at NAV does not include applicable front-end or CDSC sales charges, which would have reduced the performance.


		
		Performance figures reflect reinvested distributions and changes in net asset value (NAV) and the effect of the maximum sales charge unless otherwise stated.


Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, returns would have been lower.

 About risk
			 


Convertible Securities Risk. The Fund may own convertible securities, the value of which may be affected by market interest rates, the risk that the issuer will default, the value of the underlying stock or the right of the issuer to buy back the convertible securities.
Credit Risk. The issuer of instruments in which the Fund invests may be unable to meet interest and/or principal payments, thereby causing its instruments to decrease in value and lowering the issuer's credit rating.
Derivatives Risk. The value of a derivative instrument depends largely on (and is derived from) the value of an underlying security, currency, commodity, interest rate, index or other asset (each referred to as an underlying asset). In addition to risks relating to the underlying assets, the use of derivatives may include other, possibly greater, risks, including counterparty, leverage and liquidity risks. Counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the Fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract. Derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative. As a result, an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the Fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative, which may make the Fund's returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss. Derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the Fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price. This risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions, during which the Fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions. Derivatives may also be harder to value, less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the Fund's ability to use certain derivatives or their cost. Also, derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits, particularly during adverse market conditions.
Developing/Emerging Markets Securities Risk. The prices of securities issued by foreign companies and governments located in developing/emerging markets countries may be affected more negatively by inflation, devaluation of their currencies, higher transaction costs, delays in settlement, adverse political developments, the introduction of capital controls, withholding taxes, nationalization of private assets, expropriation, social unrest, war or lack of timely information than those in developed countries.
Foreign Securities Risk. The Fund's foreign investments may be affected by changes in a foreign country's exchange rates, political and social instability, changes in economic or taxation policies, difficulties when enforcing obligations, decreased liquidity, and increased volatility. Foreign companies may be subject to less regulation resulting in less publicly available information about the companies.
High Yield Bond (Junk Bond) Risk. Junk bonds involve a greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the credit quality of the issuer. The values of junk bonds fluctuate more than those of high-quality bonds in response to company, political, regulatory or economic developments. Values of junk bonds can decline significantly over short periods of time.
Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk refers to the risk that bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise; conversely, bond prices generally rise as interest rates fall. Specific bonds differ in their sensitivity to changes in interest rates depending on their individual characteristics, including duration.
Management Risk. The investment techniques and risk analysis used by the Fund's portfolio managers may not produce the desired results.
Market Risk. The prices of and the income generated by the Fund's securities may decline in response to, among other things, investor sentiment, general economic and market conditions, regional or global instability, and currency and interest rate fluctuations.
Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Risk. The Fund may invest in mortgage- and asset-backed securities that are subject to prepayment or call risk, which is the risk that the borrower's payments may be received earlier or later than expected due to changes in prepayment rates on underlying loans. Faster prepayments often happen when interest rates are falling. As a result, the Fund may reinvest these early payments at lower interest rates, thereby reducing the Fund's income. Conversely, when interest rates rise, prepayments may happen more slowly, causing the security to lengthen in duration. Longer duration securities tend to be more volatile. Securities may be prepaid at a price less than the original purchase value. An unexpectedly high rate of defaults on the mortgages held by a mortgage pool may adversely affect the value of mortgage-backed securities and could result in losses to the Fund. The risk of such defaults is generally higher in the case of mortgage pools that include subprime mortgages. Subprime mortgages refer to loans made to borrowers with weakened credit histories or with lower capacity to make timely payments on their mortgages.
Preferred Securities Risk. Preferred securities may include provisions that permit the issuer, in its discretion, to defer or omit distributions for a certain period of time. If the Fund owns a security that is deferring or omitting its distributions, the Fund may be required to report the distribution on its tax returns, even though it may not have received this income. Further, preferred securities may lose substantial value due to the omission or deferment of dividend payments.
REIT Risk/Real Estate Risk. The Fund concentrates its investments in the securities of real estate and real estate related companies. Investments in real estate related instruments may be affected by economic, legal, cultural, environmental or technological factors that affect property values, rents or occupancies of real estate related to the Fund's holdings. Real estate companies, including REITs or similar structures, tend to be small and mid cap companies, and their shares may be more volatile and less liquid. The value of investments in real estate related companies may be affected by the quality of management, the ability to repay loans, the utilization of leverage and financial covenants related thereto, whether the company carries adequate insurance and environmental factors. If a real estate related company defaults, the Fund may own real estate directly, which involves the following additional risks: environmental liabilities, difficulty in valuing and selling the real estate, and economic or regulatory changes.
Short Sales Risk. Short sales may cause the Fund to repurchase a security at a higher price, thereby causing the Fund to incur a loss. A short position in a security poses more risk than holding the same security long. As there is no limit on how much the price of the security can increase, the Fund's exposure is unlimited. In order to establish a short position in a security, the Fund must borrow the security from a broker. The Fund may not always be able to borrow a security the Fund seeks to sell short at a particular time or at an acceptable price. The Fund also may not always be able to close out the short position by replacing the borrowed securities at a particular time or at an acceptable price. The Fund will incur increased transaction costs associated with selling securities short. In addition, taking short positions in securities results in a form of leverage which may cause the Fund to be volatile.
Small- and Mid-Capitalization Risks. Stocks of small- and mid-sized companies tend to be more vulnerable to adverse developments and may have little or no operating history or track record of success, and limited product lines, markets, management and financial resources. The securities of small- and mid-sized companies may be more volatile due to less market interest and less publicly available information about the issuer. They also may be illiquid or restricted as to resale, or may trade less frequently and in smaller volumes, all of which may cause difficulty when establishing or closing a position at a desirable price.

Open-end core real estate funds are hot again
 

Pensions & Investments · May 27, 2013









Joseph Azelby says J. P. Morgan Asset Management now has queues of up to a year for its open-end core funds




They're back.Lines of investors waiting to get in are starting to form at open-end core real estate funds for the first time since the financial crisis.“There's a lot of interest in core, even though everyone thinks it's very, very fairly priced,” said Brad Morrow, senior private markets consultant in the New York office of Towers Watson & Co. “It's a continued flight to quality.”

If there is another economic downturn, investors believe that lower-quality properties in less desirable areas would drop in value further and stay down longer than stabilized, higher quality real estate, he said.While not all core open-end fund managers on Pensions & Investments' list of the top 10 real estate equity managers report investor queues, they all say there have been strong flows into their core funds. J. P. Morgan Asset Management now has queues of up to a year for its open-end core funds, said Joseph Azelby, managing director at J.P. Morgan Asset Management (JPM) in the New York office, where he is head of the firm's global real assets group. “People are still somewhat risk averse,” Mr. Azelby said. “The (real estate) market is still very good and continues to perform well. “J.P. Morgan has regained half of what it lost in the downturn, he added.Investors and J.P. Morgan executives believe the real estate market, including core, still has room to grow. “There's demand today for core and demand for at least a year,” Mr. Azelby said.Prudential Real Estate Investors also has queues for its open-end core funds. “There are definitely queues, but they are reasonable queues,” said Eric Adler, London-based global chief investment officer for Prudential's real estate business. Investors can see that they will get their money invested within a reasonable amount of time, he explained.At Prudential, the lines began forming in earnest in 2012, he said.“We're in a good spot right now,” Mr. Adler said. “Really, 2012 saw the turnaround for us in a meaningful way.”TIAA-CREF also has a “slight” queue for its two core open-end funds, said Tom Garbutt, senior managing director and head of global real estate in the New York office. “So far, we're clearly seeing an increase in the amount of capital to our open-end funds and … we have been quite successful placing the capital,” Mr. Garbutt said.David Gilbert, chief investment officer of Clarion Partners, New York, said his firm had increased capital flows from existing and new clients, predominantly in core investment strategies. “Roughly two thirds of the year-to-year increase (in 2012) was due to new capital inflows with the remainder attributable to capital appreciation,” he wrote in an e-mailed response to questions.Mr. Gilbert declined to discuss whether Clarion Partners' open-end funds have queues. Sources said that Clarion Partners does not yet have queues, but the flows into its open-end funds are strong but manageable.

         Union Square Registers USQ Core Real Estate Fund      


Posted By: trackeradmin


TweetUnion Square Capital Partners Registered USQ Core Real Estate Fund, a new interval fund.
According to the  Prospectus:
The Fund seeks to provide investors with returns equal to or greater than the NCREIF Fund Index – Open End Diversified Core Equity over an entire market cycle; however, it cannot guarantee that any targeted returns will be met and actual returns may vary materially.  It is intended that the majority of the Fund’s total return will be derived from portfolio income with the balance derived from appreciation. The Fund pursues its investment objective by strategically investing across private institutional real estate investment funds (“Private Investment Funds”) as well as a broad set of public real estate securities, including exchange traded funds (“ETFs”), index mutual funds (“Index Funds”) and closed-end funds and mutual funds (collectively with ETFs and Index Funds, “Public Investment Funds”), that invest principally, directly or indirectly, in real estate. Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the Fund’s net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes will be invested in real estate securities.  The Fund defines “real estate securities” to include common stock, preferred equity, partnership or similar interests, convertible or non-convertible preferred stock, and convertible or non-convertible secured or unsecured debt issued by: Private Investment Funds and Public Investment Funds that invest principally, directly or indirectly, in real estate; publicly traded real estate investment trusts; non-traded unregistered real estate investment trusts; and real estate operating companies.  For purposes of its 80% investment policy, the Fund may also invest in real estate-linked derivative instruments, including swap agreements, options, futures, options on futures and structured notes. Investments in derivatives may involve risks different from, and possibly greater than, those of investments directly in the underlying securities or assets.  The value of real estate-linked derivative instruments may be affected by risks similar to those associated with direct ownership of real estate. “
