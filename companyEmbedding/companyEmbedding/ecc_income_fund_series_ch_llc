Why Energy Infrastructure MLPs?
Thematically, MLPs represent an investment in the build-out of US energy infrastructure
                        over the next few decades. MLPs own, operate, and build energy infrastructure assets
                        such as pipelines, storage facilities, and processing plants.

Insurance Products Shares of the Portfolios are offered only to participating insurance companies and their separate accounts to fund the benefits of Variable Contracts, and to qualified pension and retirement plans and registered and unregistered separate accounts.
Closed-End Funds do not continuously issue shares for sale as open-end mutual funds do. Since the initial public offering, the Funds now trade in the secondary market.

Investors may purchase or sell ETF shares throughout the day through any brokerage account, which will result in typical brokerage commissions.

Please note: Closed end funds are subject to the risk of their underlying assets and investment strategy. Unlike open end funds, closed end funds trade on an exchange at a price which is often a discount to their net asset value (NAV). The market price may experience periods of increased volatility due to the use of leverage as well as market and fund illiquidity. Important information you should know about investing in closed-end funds.

More about Portfolio Composition








*The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a funds monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees, if applicable), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)The performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Distributions are not guaranteed and the amount of distributions will vary depending on a number of factors. Market prices and investment return will vary, therefore you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Click on the "Performance & Risk" link to view quarter-end performance. All performance data is for the common shares of the fund. Total distribution rate (at market or NAV) may include unknown combinations of income, capital gains and return of capital.Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated. Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated. ^Premium/Discount to NAV represents the percentage by which the funds market price exceeds or is less than net asset value (NAV). Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is a discount to their NAV.Top holdings are as of the date indicated and may not be representative of the funds current or future investments.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Objective

            The Fund’s primary investment objective is to maximize current income.  Long-term capital appreciation is a secondary objective.

            Global opportunity set of fixed income securities (duration varies from 0 to 3 years)
        



























Overview


Prior to 23 January 2017, the Low Duration Income Fund was named the Floating Income Fund.




Fund Overview
Generating income while minimizing interest rate exposure
Designed for investors who need steady income with low interest rate exposure, the fund takes a broad-based approach to investing in income-generating bonds. It employs PIMCO’s vast analytical capabilities and sector expertise to help temper the risks of income investing. 
Why Invest In This Fund
Pursues income across global fixed income sectors  
The global economic landscape is constantly changing, causing different bond sectors to go in and out of favor. The fund’s multi-sector approach allows it to seek out the best income-generating ideas in any market climate, targeting multiple sources of income and low interest rate exposure from a global opportunity set.
Total return approach to generating income 
While generating attractive current income is a primary goal, the fund also seeks long-term capital appreciation and compelling risk-adjusted returns with a low duration level. The fund also aims to preserve capital, maintain quality and lower interest rate risk.
Ability to be opportunistic 
The fund can tactically shift portfolio weights, moving to wherever attractive yields can be generated with low interest rate sensitivity in an increasingly complex and volatile investment environment. This flexibility helps the fund to nimbly capture opportunities as economic and market conditions change.
Our Expertise 
The fund is managed by an expert team of veteran global income investors: Dan Ivascyn and Alfred Murata were named Morningstar’s 2013 U.S. Fixed Income Fund Managers of the Year for PIMCO Income Fund; Eve Tournier, Head of Pan-European Credit Portfolio Management, is the lead portfolio manager for the firm’s dedicated European income-oriented strategies and global multi-sector credit strategies. The team draws on PIMCO’s time-tested investment process: our rigorously developed global macro outlook, bottom-up credit analysis and research teams’ deep reservoir of specialized investment expertise.

A word about risk: Investing in the bond market is subject to certain risks including market, interest-rate, issuer, credit, and inflation risk; investments may be worth more or less than the original cost when redeemed. The value of most bond funds and fixed income securities are impacted by changes in interest rates.Bonds and bond funds with longer durations tend to be more sensitive and more volatile than securities with shorter durations;bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise. Investing in foreign denominated and/or domiciled securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations,and economic and political risks, which may be enhanced in emerging markets. High-yield,lower-rated, securities involve greater risk than higher-rated securities; portfolios that invest in them may be subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk than portfolios that do not. Equities may decline in value due to both real and perceived general market, economic and industry conditions. Investments in value securities involve the risk the market's value assessment may differ from the manager and the performance of the securities may decline. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous.

Performance quoted represents past performance and is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results. Investment return and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate. Shares may be worth more or less than original cost when redeemed. Current performance may be lower or higher than average annual returns shown. Performance quoted does not reflect any sales charges, if applicable, and performance would be lower if it did.


Differences in the Fund’s performance versus the index and related attribution information with respect to particular categories of securities or individual positions may be attributable, in part, to differences in the pricing methodologies used by the Fund and the index.
        


No assurance is being made that any fund that may have experienced high or unusual performance for one or more periods will continue to experience such performance. High performance is defined as an unusual growth in alpha between reporting periods or total return when measured to historical returns. Unusual performance is defined as an unusual change in performance (+/-) between reporting periods and the portfolio experienced unusual performance for one or more periods.

Market-Based NAV (Per Share): The Market-Based NAV is the net asset value per share, calculated using available market quotations (or an appropriate substitute that reflects current market conditions) rounded to the fourth decimal place.  The Market-Based NAV is not indicative of future Market-Based NAVs or the future performance of any of the Funds and classes set forth above. The Market-Based NAV may change daily and may deviate from $1.0000 even when financial markets are stable. Although the Market-Based NAV is intended to reflect the price at which a Fund's securities could be sold, the actual sales price could be more or less.

             Performance figures presented reflect the total return performance after fees and reflect changes in share price and reinvestment of dividend and capital gain distributions on the payable date. All periods longer than one year are annualized.
        

             The inception date provided is for the Fund’s oldest share class, the Institutional Class. The returns presented are for Class P shares, which were first offered in 4/08. Returns measure performance from the inception of the oldest share class to the present, so some returns predate the inception of Class P. Those returns are calculated by adjusting the Institutional returns to reflect the P shares' different charges and expenses. Total return performance does not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares.
        

             Daily YTD return is from the most recent calendar year end.
        

             Growth of $10,000 is calculated at NAV and assumes that all dividend and capital gain distributions were reinvested. It does not take into account sales charges or the effect of taxes. Results are not indicative of future performance.
        

Past performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results. For funds with at least a 3-yr history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees) with an emphasis on downward variations and consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating is a weighted average of the performance figures for its 3-, 5- and 10-yr (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Morningstar, Inc.® 2017. All rights reserved. The information contained herein; (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its affiliates; (2) may not be copied or distributed; (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Hollow stars represent a class of shares with inception dates that is different than the inception date of the fund. For the period prior to the inception date of these shares, performance information is based on the performance of the fund’s Institutional Class shares, adjusted to reflect the actual distribution and/or service (12b-1) fees and other expenses paid by the newer share class.
        

             The Lipper Category returns and rankings are calculated by Lipper Inc., a Reuters Company, which is a nationally recognized organization that compares the performance of mutual funds with similar investment objectives. The Category returns represent the average performance of included funds, while rankings compare an individual fund's returns to those of the other funds in its category. Both are based on total return performance, with capital gains and dividends reinvested, with annual operating expenses deducted, but without including front- or back-end sales charges. Rankings begin with the actual share class inception. Rankings are relative to a peer group and do not necessarily mean that the fund had high total returns.

Portfolio Composition Footnotes & Disclosures


disclosures
5The Sharpe Ratio measures the risk-adjusted performance. The risk-free rate is subtracted from the rate of return for a portfolio and the result is divided by the standard deviation of the portfolio returns.
6The information ratio is defined as the portfolio's excess return per unit of risk, or tracking error. For example, an information ratio of 1 means that a portfolio manager generates 100 basis points, or one percent of excess return for every 100 basis points of risk taken.
7Tracking error, a measure of risk, is defined as the standard deviation of the portfolio's excess return vs. the benchmark expressed in percent.
8May include nominal and inflation-protected Treasuries, Treasury futures and options, agencies, FDIC-guaranteed and government-guaranteed corporate securities, and interest rate swaps.
9Short duration emerging markets instruments includes an emerging market security or other instrument economically tied to an emerging market country by country of risk with an effective duration less than one year and rated investment grade or higher or if unrated, determined to be similar quality by PIMCO. Emerging Markets includes the value of short duration emerging markets instruments previously reported in another category.
10May include municipals, convertibles, preferreds, and yankee bonds.
11Net Other Short Duration Instruments includes securities and other instruments (except instruments tied to emerging markets by country of risk) with an effective duration less than one year and rated investment grade or higher or, if unrated, determined by PIMCO to be of comparable quality, commingled liquidity funds, uninvested cash, interest receivables, net unsettled trades, broker money, short duration derivatives (for example Eurodollar futures) and derivatives offsets. With respect to certain categories of short duration securities, the Adviser reserves the discretion to require a minimum credit rating higher than investment grade for inclusion in this category. Derivatives Offsets includes offsets associated with investments in futures, swaps and other derivatives. Such offsets may be taken at the notional value of the derivative position which in certain instances may exceed the actual amount owed on such positions.

             Portfolio information in the charts is based on the fund's net assets. These percentages may differ from those used for the fund's compliance calculations, including the fund's prospectus, regulatory, and other investment limitations and policies, which may be based on total assets of the fund or other measurements, may include or exclude various categories of investments from those covered in the portfolio allocation categories shown in this report, and may be based on different classifications and measurements of the fund’s investments and other criteria.
        

             References to specific sectors, securities or issuers are for illustrative purposes only. All holdings are subject to change daily. All share classes have the same portfolio but different expenses.
        

             Duration is a measure of a portfolio’s price sensitivity expressed in years. Effective duration is the duration for a bond with an embedded option when the value is calculated to include the expected change in cash flow caused by the option as interest rates change.

Disclosures 




Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the funds carefully before investing. This and other information are contained in the fund’s prospectus and summary prospectus, if available, which may be obtained by contacting your investment professional or PIMCO representative.   Please read them carefully before you invest or send money.


A word about risk:

 
Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bonds and bond strategies with longer durations tend to be more sensitive and volatile than those with shorter durations; bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise, and the current low interest rate environment increases this risk. Current reductions in bond counterparty capacity may contribute to decreased market liquidity and increased price volatility. Bond investments may be worth more or less than the original cost when redeemed. Investing in foreign denominated and/or domiciled securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations, and economic and political risks, which may be enhanced in emerging markets. Mortgage and asset-backed securities may be sensitive to changes in interest rates, subject to early repayment risk, and their value may fluctuate in response to the market’s perception of issuer creditworthiness; while generally supported by some form of government or private guarantee there is no assurance that private guarantors will meet their obligations. High-yield, lower-rated, securities involve greater risk than higher-rated securities; portfolios that invest in them may be subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk than portfolios that do not. Equities may decline in value due to both real and perceived general market, economic, and industry conditions. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous. Investing in derivatives could lose more than the amount invested.  Diversification does not ensure against loss.

        

             Investments made by a Fund and the results achieved by a Fund are not expected to be the same as those made by any other PIMCO-advised Fund, including those with a similar name, investment objective or policies.  A new or smaller Fund’s performance may not represent how the Fund is expected to or may perform in the long-term.  New Funds have limited operating histories for investors to evaluate and new and smaller Funds may not attract sufficient assets to achieve investment and trading efficiencies.  A Fund may be forced to sell a comparatively large portion of its portfolio to meet significant shareholder redemptions for cash, or hold a comparatively large portion of its portfolio in cash due to significant share purchases for cash, in each case when the Fund otherwise would not seek to do so, which may adversely affect performance.

Overview






 Fund Overview
A balanced approach to income investing
PIMCO Balanced Income Fund (Canada) aims to provide attractive current income as well as capital appreciation over the long term by combining the higher capital appreciation and dividend-paying potential of equities with the lower volatility and attractive income potential of fixed income.
Why Invest in This Fund?
Benefits of a balanced approach
PIMCO’s balanced equity and fixed income strategy strives to provide the attractive return potential of equities with the income and capital preservation potential of fixed income, making it beneficial for investors as a part of a diversified portfolio.
Global and flexible
In an effort to capitalize on changing market conditions, the fund’s investment strategy is global which provides the portfolio management team with considerable flexibility to invest in the best income-generating opportunities across the capital structure, diversified by geography and sector.
Driven by research
For fixed income, PIMCO portfolio managers take a broad-based approach, targeting multiple sources of potential income from an expansive opportunity set across both higher yielding and higher quality bonds. For equities, portfolio managers from Research Affiliates employ a fundamentally-weighted, active global developed equity strategy built on smart beta that seeks higher-yielding companies generating sustainable dividends at attractive valuation.
Industry-leading portfolio management
The fixed income component is managed by PIMCO's Alfred Murata and Dan Ivascyn, both current managers of the Monthly Income Fund (Canada). The equity component is managed by Research Affiliates' Rob Arnott and Chris Brightman, experienced equity investors of the Research Affiliates Equity (“RAE”) strategies.

             A sales communication that includes a rate of return or a mathematical table illustrating the potential effect of a compound rate of return must contain a statement in substantially the following words:
“[The rate of return or mathematical table shown] is used only to illustrate the effects of the compound growth rate and is not intended to reflect future values of [the investment fund or asset allocation service] or returns on investment [in the investment fund or from the use of the asset allocation service].”
        

Investments made by a Fund and the results achieved by a Fund are not expected to be the same as those made by any other PIMCO-advised Fund, including those with a similar name, investment objective or policies. 
A Fund may be forced to sell a comparatively large portion of its portfolio to meet significant shareholder redemptions for cash, or hold a comparatively large portion of its portfolio in cash due to significant share purchases for cash, in each case when the Fund otherwise would not seek to do so, which may adversely affect performance.​

Portfolio Composition Footnotes & Disclosures


disclosures
5Net Other Short Duration Instruments includes securities and other instruments (except instruments tied to emerging markets by country of risk) with an effective duration less than one year and rated investment grade or higher or, if unrated, determined by PIMCO to be of comparable quality, commingled liquidity funds, uninvested cash, interest receivables, net unsettled trades, broker money, short duration derivatives (for example Eurodollar futures) and derivatives offsets. With respect to certain categories of short duration securities, the Adviser reserves the discretion to require a minimum credit rating higher than investment grade for inclusion in this category. Derivatives Offsets includes offsets associated with investments in futures, swaps and other derivatives. Such offsets may be taken at the notional value of the derivative position which in certain instances may exceed the actual amount owed on such positions.

             Duration is a measure of the fund's price sensitivity to changes in interest rates expressed in years.
        

Portfolio structure is subject to change without notice and may not be representative of current or future allocations.
Effective duration is the duration for a bond with an embedded option when the value is calculated to include the expected change in cash flow caused by the option as interest rates change.

Disclosures 




All investments contain risk and may lose value. Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bonds and bond strategies with longer durations tend to be more sensitive and volatile than those with shorter durations; bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise, and the current low interest rate environment increases this risk. Current reductions in bond counterparty capacity may contribute to decreased market liquidity and increased price volatility. Bond investments may be worth more or less than the original cost when redeemed. Equities may decline in value due to both real and perceived general market, economic and industry conditions. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks, such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous. Investing in derivatives could lose more than the amount invested. For a complete description of the risks associated with a particular Fund, please refer to the Fund’s prospectus. Sovereign securities are generally backed by the issuing government, obligations of U.S. Government agencies and authorities are supported by varying degrees but are generally not backed by the full faith of the U.S. Government; portfolios that invest in such securities are not guaranteed and will fluctuate in value. Investing in foreign denominated and/or domiciled securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations, and economic and political risks which may be enhanced in emerging markets.  Sovereign securities are generally backed by the issuing government, obligations of the U.S. Government agencies and authorities are supported by varying degrees but are generally not backed by the full faith of the U.S. Government; portfolios that invest in such securities are not guaranteed and will fluctuate in value.  Investing in foreign denominated and/or domiciled securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations, and economic and political risks, which may be enhanced in emerging markets.
