WALLA WALLA, Wash., July  27, 2017  ( ) -- Banner Bank, a subsidiary of Banner Corporation (NASDAQ:BANR), today announced that it has entered into a purchase and assumption agreement to sell its Utah branches and related assets and liabilities to People’s Intermountain Bank, a banking subsidiary of People’s Utah Bancorp (NASDAQ:PUB). 
The purchase and assumption agreement includes approximately $260 million in loans, $180 million in deposits and all of Banner Bank’s seven Utah branches which are located in Provo, Orem, Salem, Springville, South Jordan, Salt Lake City and Woods Cross. The deposit premium is estimated to be approximately $15.3 million based on average deposits at closing. The purchase of the branches is subject to regulatory approval and satisfaction of customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2017.  The Utah branches will continue operating as Banner Bank until the transaction is completed.  At that time, the branches will operate under the name of Bank of American Fork, a division of People’s Intermountain Bank.  About Banner CorporationBanner Corporation is a $10.2 billion bank holding company operating two commercial banks in five Western states through a network of branches offering a full range of deposit services and business, commercial real estate, construction, residential, agricultural and consumer loans.

You should not place undue reliance on these statements, as they are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results and performance in future periods may be materially different from any future results or performance suggested by the forward-looking statements in this release.  Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified in our risk factors contained in Banner Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.  In addition, the requisite regulatory approvals for the sale of the branches might not be obtained.  Such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this release. Banner Corporation expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements found here in to reflect any changes in Banner Corporation’s expectations of results or any change in events.

                    Thursday, July 27, 2017 1:01 PM  UTC

AMERICAN FORK, Utah, July  27, 2017   -- People’s Utah Bancorp (“PUB”) (Nasdaq:PUB) today announced that its banking subsidiary, People’s Intermountain Bank (“PIB”), has signed a purchase and assumption agreement to acquire approximately $260 million in loans and seven Utah branch locations with approximately $180 million in low-cost deposits from Banner Corporation’s (Nasdaq:BANR) banking subsidiary Banner Bank (“Banner”).  PIB will operate the branches under the name of Bank of American Fork, a division of PIB.
“We are thrilled to be expanding our footprint with these additional branch locations. This transaction will provide our existing customers with added convenience and service and our new customers with the opportunity to enjoy the outstanding personalized service and commitment of a Utah-based community bank,” said Richard Beard, President and CEO of PUB.  “This transaction, coupled with the Town & Country Bank acquisition we announced two months ago, allows us to further deploy our solid capital base and to strategically grow our company along the I-15 corridor of the Intermountain Region.  The purchase of these assets and assumption of liabilities will further extend our position as the largest community bank in Utah.  We expect the transaction will be immediately accretive to earnings once completed.” PIB will acquire seven branches located in Salt Lake City, Provo, South Jordan, Woods Cross, Orem, Salem and Springville.  Subject to regulatory approval, the Woods Cross and Orem branches are planned to be consolidated into the existing Bank of American Fork Bountiful and Orem branches, respectively.  The deposit premium is estimated to be $15.3 million based on average deposits at closing. The purchase of the branches is expected to close in early fourth quarter of 2017 and is subject to certain closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approval. D.A. Davidson & Co. acted as financial advisor to PUB and Dorsey & Whitney LLP acted as legal counsel.  Davis Wright Tremaine LLP acted as Banner’s legal counsel.   Conference Call  PUB will hold a conference call at 12:00 p.m. Mountain Time (2:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on Thursday, July 27, 2017 to review the transaction, and to discuss second quarter financial results.  The conference call will be accessible by telephone and through the Internet.  Interested individuals are invited to listen to the call by telephone at 888-317-6003 (international calls 412-317-6061) and the participant entry number is 3290312.   To participate in the webcast, log on to: http://services.choruscall.com/links/pub170728.html If you are unable to participate during the live webcast, the call will be archived on our website, www.peoplesutah.com, or at the same URL above until August 28, 2017. An investor presentation related to the transaction will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and will be available on PUB’s website at www.peoplesutah.com. Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PSLRA”). Such forward-looking statements include but are not limited to statements about the benefits of the asset acquisition by PUB, including PUB’s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, the effect of the transaction on PUB’s earnings, the timing of the closing of the transaction, and other statements that are not historical facts.  These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those projected, including but not limited to the risks that the asset acquisition does not close when expected or at all because required regulatory or other approvals and other conditions to closing are not received or satisfied on a timely basis or at all; the risk that the benefits from the transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected, including as a result of changes in general economic and market conditions, interest and exchange rates, monetary policy, laws and regulations and their enforcement, and the degree of competition in the geographic and business areas in which PUB operates; the reaction to the transaction of the companies’ customers, employees, and counterparties; and the diversion of management time on transaction-related issues.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made and reflect management’s current estimates, projections, expectations and beliefs.  PUB undertakes no obligation to publicly revise or update the forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date of this report.  About People’s Utah Bancorp People’s Utah Bancorp is the holding company for People’s Intermountain Bank, which has 20 locations in two banking divisions, Bank of American Fork and Lewiston State Bank, a leasing division, GrowthFunding Equipment Finance, and a mortgage division, People’s Intermountain Bank Mortgage.

People’s Utah Bancorp is the holding company for People’s Intermountain Bank with 20 locations in two banking divisions, Bank of American Fork and Lewiston State Bank, and one leasing division, GrowthFunding Equipment Finance. We are the largest community-bank holding company in the state of Utah based on asset size, deposits, loans and shareholders’ equity. The Company is headquartered in American Fork, Utah, which is located on the I-15 corridor between the cities of Salt Lake City and Provo. Our banking brands reflect a long history of serving our communities – in the case of Bank of American Fork since 1913, and in the case of Lewiston State Bank since 1905. PUB is committed to preserving the community-bank model with a full range of bank products and technologies.
Utah is one of the fastest growing states in the United States in terms of population, ranking 7th in 2015 percentage growth according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Over 75% of Utah’s population is concentrated along Interstate 15 or the I-15 Corridor, specifically within Davis, Weber, Salt Lake and Utah Counties. The next largest population centers in the state are in Washington and Cache Counties. Together with the I-15 Corridor, these counties make up approximately 84.7% of Utah’s population. Most of the major business and economic activity in Utah is located in the counties where we currently have branches.

People’s Utah Bancorp is the holding company for People’s Intermountain Bank with 20 locations in two banking divisions, Bank of American Fork and Lewiston State Bank, and one leasing division, GrowthFunding Equipment Finance. We are the largest community-bank holding company in the state of Utah based on asset size, deposits, loans and shareholders’ equity. The Company is headquartered in American Fork, Utah, which is located on the I-15 corridor between the cities of Salt Lake City and Provo. Our banking brands reflect a long history of serving our communities – in the case of Bank of American Fork since 1913, and in the case of Lewiston State Bank since 1905. PUB is committed to preserving the community-bank model with a full range of bank products and technologies.
Utah is one of the fastest growing states in the United States in terms of population, ranking 7th in 2015 percentage growth according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Over 75% of Utah’s population is concentrated along Interstate 15 or the I-15 Corridor, specifically within Davis, Weber, Salt Lake and Utah Counties. The next largest population centers in the state are in Washington and Cache Counties. Together with the I-15 Corridor, these counties make up approximately 84.7% of Utah’s population. Most of the major business and economic activity in Utah is located in the counties where we currently have branches.

  detail or More About Us for additional information.

People’s Utah Bancorp and Town & Country Bank, Inc. of St. George, Utah Announce Merger




















May 31, 2017 17:22 ET

 | Source: People's Utah Bancorp






AMERICAN FORK, Utah, May  31, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- People’s Utah Bancorp (the “Company” or “PUB”) (Nasdaq:PUB) and Town & Country Bank, Inc. (“Town & Country Bank”) today jointly announced the signing of a definitive agreement to merge Town & Country Bank, a community bank based in St. George Utah, into People’s Intermountain Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of PUB. Town & Country Bank was established in 2008 with one branch in St. George, Utah and one loan production office in Sandy, Utah and has a strong focus on serving business customers. As of March 31, 2017, Town & Country Bank had total assets of $135.1 million, gross loans of $97.3 million and total deposits of $119.7 million. The boards of PUB and Town & Country Bank unanimously approved the transaction, which is subject to required regulatory approvals, customary closing conditions, and shareholder approval. The transaction provides for the payment to Town & Country Bank shareholders of $4.28 per share in cash and 0.2978 shares of PUB common stock. Based on the closing price of $25.55 for PUB shares on May 30, 2017, the transaction would result in an aggregate value of $20.9 million or $11.89 per fully diluted Town & Country Bank common share. Town & Country Bank shareholders may also receive additional cash consideration at closing subject to certain closing conditions. As of March 31, 2017, Town & Country Bank had tangible equity of $14.7 million. The Town & Country Bank office and PUB’s Bank of American Fork branch in St. George are expected to be consolidated in January 2018. Upon consolidation, the combined division will operate under the name “People’s Town & Country Bank”. Bank of American Fork branches in other areas will not be affected by this St. George-area name change. The Town & Country Bank’s Sandy loan production office is expected to be consolidated with the current Bank of American Fork Sandy branch and will operate under the name Bank of American Fork. This is part of a larger bank-wide strategy to establish a community-banking network with local names throughout Utah and potentially in adjoining states. “We appreciate the unique style of customer service that Town & Country Bank has created. We look forward to working with customers and our associates to preserve some of the most important aspects of that style. The merger will add substantial capital, new technologies and products to Town & Country Bank customers that have not been available before. It will also allow Town & Country Bank to increase lending limits that will allow customers to do larger projects. The new combined People’s Town & Country Bank division in St. George is expected to have loans of approximately $133 million and deposits of $128 million. The People’s Town & Country Bank division will allow us to continue the community-banking tradition so important to American small business while spreading the high regulatory and operating costs of banking over a broader base,” said Richard T. Beard, President and CEO of People’s Utah Bancorp. Kurt Johnson, Chairman of the Board of Town & Country Bank stated, “We believe this combination will be highly beneficial to our customers. They will have access to the additional resources that will come from joining the People’s Utah Bancorp family including mortgage services offered by People’s Intermountain Bank Mortgage. The standards for customer service at both banks is very high. Our customers should expect the personal service we have been known for with additional options and resources to choose from.” According to MetroStudy, housing dynamics in the St. George, Utah and Mesquite, Nevada market area are very strong. As of March 2017, job growth showed a year-over-year net increase of 3,100, unemployment was 3.7% compared to the national rate of 4.5%, and there were 1,716 new home starts, among the highest months since 2008. A conference call for investors, analysts and the public is scheduled for 11:00 a.m. Eastern time on Thursday, June 1, 2017. The conference call will be accessible by telephone and through the Internet. Interested individuals are invited to listen to the call by telephone at 888-317-6003 (international calls 412-317-6061) and the participant entry number is 0699936. To participate in the webcast, log on to:  http://services.choruscall.com/links/pub170601html If you are unable to participate during the live webcast, the call will be archived on our website, www.peoplesutah.com, or at the same URL above until July 1, 2017. Forward looking and other material information may be discussed on this conference call. PUB was advised in the transaction by D.A. Davidson & Co. as financial advisor and Dorsey & Whitney LLP as legal counsel. Town & Country Bank was advised by Sheshunoff & Co., as financial advisor, and Jones Waldo Holbrook & McDonough, PC as legal counsel.

We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of 2,282,000 common shares in
this offering will be approximately $29.7 million, or approximately $34.8
million if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full, based on
the initial public offering price of $14.50 per share and after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

We expect to use the net proceeds we will receive from this offering to expand
our operations through the opening of new branches, acquisitions and for general
corporate purposes. Additionally, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to
finance mergers or acquisitions of non-bank financial services companies,
although we have no present agreements or commitments to make any acquisition.
While our growth strategy includes opening new branches and completing strategic
mergers or acquisitions and we regularly identify and explore specific
acquisition opportunities as part of our ongoing business practices, we have no
present agreements or commitments to use any of the net proceeds from this
offering for these purposes over the next twelve months. However, if
opportunities to open new branches or complete acquisitions present themselves,
then we may choose to use some or all of the net proceeds to take advantage of
such opportunities. We currently do not intend to use any of the net proceeds we
will receive from this offering to add capital to BAF or LSB.

The amounts and timing of these expenditures will depend on numerous factors,
including the amount of our future revenues and net income, our ability to
identify attractive expansion and acquisition opportunities and the success of
our marketing efforts. Accordingly, our management will retain broad discretion
in deploying the net proceeds from this offering. Pending the uses described
above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in investment-grade,
available-for-sale interest-bearing investments.


The banking and financial services business in our market areas is highly
competitive. This increasingly competitive environment is a result primarily of
growth by the large national banks and credit unions, changes in regulation,
changes in technology and product delivery systems, and the accelerating pace of
consolidation among financial services providers. We compete for loans, deposits
and customers with other commercial banks, local community banks, savings and
loan associations, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies,
insurance companies, finance companies, money market funds, credit unions and
other non-bank financial services providers. Many of these competitors are much
larger in total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital
markets and offer a broader range of financial services than we can offer.

Competition for deposit and loan products remains strong from both banking and
non-banking firms, and this competition directly affects the rates of those
products and the terms on which they are offered to customers. Price competition
for deposits may adversely affect our ability to generate low cost core deposits
in our primary market areas sufficient to fund our asset growth. As a result we
may seek alternative funding through borrowings and may need to price our 
deposit products more aggressively, resulting in an increase in our costs of 
funding and a reduction in our net interest margin. While our deposit base has
increased, several larger banks have grown their deposit market share in our 
markets faster than we have resulting in a declining relative deposit market 
share for us in our existing markets. We believe our declining relative market
share in deposits has resulted primarily from aggressive marketing and 
advertising, branch expansion, expanded delivery channels and more attractive 
rates offered by larger bank competitors. Technological innovation continues to
contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial 
services markets. Many customers now expect a choice of several delivery systems
and channels, including telephone, mail, internet banking, mobile banking and 
ATMs.

According to SNL: Briefing Book: 2014 Deposit Market Share — Banks, excluding
non-retail branches (SNL Report), BAF is the twelfth largest bank among all
banks operating in Salt Lake County with a deposit market share of 0.4% and is
the third largest bank in Utah County with a deposit market share of 13.3%. BAF
is the eleventh largest bank in Davis County with a deposit market share of
0.8%. Our St. George branch was opened in August of 2014 and has no reported
market share in Washington County. LSB is the third largest bank in Cache County
with a deposit market share of 16.9%. LSB is the largest bank in Franklin
County, ID where we have our Preston branch, with a 33.0% deposit market share.

Industrial loan companies, or industrial banks, are financial institutions that
loan money and may be owned by non-financial institutions. For historical
reasons, most industrial banks are headquartered in a small number of states,
including Utah, California, Nevada and Colorado. Many of the largest industrial
banks are headquartered in Utah. However, most of the Utah industrial banks are
owned or controlled by major industrial corporations or financial services firms
based outside of Utah, and their deposits are primarily from customers residing
outside of Utah. As a result, we do not consider most Utah industrial banks to
be our competitors for deposits.

According to the SNL Report, our largest competitors by county are as follows:

                                                          Competitor’s  
                                                             Market     
            County                 Largest Competitor         Share       
            Davis County          Wells Fargo & Co.               31.34 % 
            Salt Lake County      JP Morgan Chase & Co.           35.12 % 
            Utah County           Wells Fargo & Co.               25.42 % 
            Cache County          Zions Bancorp                   29.82 % 
            Washington County     Zions Bancorp                   31.45 % 
            Franklin County, ID   Wells Fargo & Co.               29.58 % 
            State of Utah         Wells Fargo & Co.               39.19 % 

Credit union organizations are also competitors for customer deposits in Utah
and have added pressure to our ability to retain and attract deposits. According
to the SNL Report, total 2014 deposits for the state of Utah were approximately
$78.6 billion, of which credit unions held approximately $15.4 billion or 19.6%
of total deposits in Utah. This is an increase in total credit union deposits
from approximately $13.4 billion in 2010, but a decrease in market share from
20.7% of total Utah deposits in 2010 of approximately $65.0 billion.

Increased regulation and mergers between financial institutions have placed
additional pressure on banks to consolidate their operations, reduce expenses
and increase revenues to remain competitive. In addition, competition has
intensified due to federal and state interstate banking laws, which permit
banking organizations to expand geographically with fewer restrictions than in
the past.

We have been able to develop a loyal borrower and depositor base by providing
personalized service, offering competitive products and employing state-of-the
art technology to customers as evidenced by mobile banking and remote deposit
capture services.


Company Description
We are a bank holding company, formed in 1998 and headquartered in American
Fork, Utah, which is located on the I-15 corridor between the cities of Salt
Lake City and Provo. We have 18 banking branches operated through our two
wholly-owned banking subsidiaries, BAF and LSB, which began offering


 banking
services in 1913 and 1905, respectively. We provide full-service retail banking
in many of the leading population centers in the state of Utah, including a wide
range of banking and related services to locally-owned businesses, professional
firms, real estate developers, residential home builders, high net-worth
individuals, investors and other customers. Our primary customers are small- and
medium-sized businesses that require highly personalized commercial banking
products and services. We believe we have a strong reputation in our markets. As
of September 30, 2014, the BauerFinancial rating for BAF was 5-Star Superior and
for LSB was 4-Star Excellent. A substantial portion of our business is with
customers who have long-standing relationships with us or who have been referred
to us by existing customers. BAF has been recognized through numerous awards and
recognitions including the 2014 Community Commitment Award by the American
Bankers Association, the 2014 National Community Bank Service Award by the
Independent Community Bankers of America and recognition in 2014 as the best
community bank by Best of State Magazine.

We are the largest community bank holding company headquartered in the state of
Utah based on asset size, deposits, loans and shareholders’ equity. Upon
completion of the offering, we will be the only exchange listed, publicly traded
community bank holding company in the five state area comprised of Utah, Idaho,
Wyoming, Nevada and New Mexico.

We believe we serve highly attractive markets in terms of economic strength,
population demographics, competitive dynamics and long-term opportunities for
growth. We believe we have a history of building long-term customer
relationships and attracting new customers through our service-oriented
corporate culture. We focus on educating our customers regarding banking
products and services and then work to target products and services to specific
customer needs. In addition, we believe that our strong capital position and
experienced management team provide the strength and foundation we need to
continue to grow our business.
