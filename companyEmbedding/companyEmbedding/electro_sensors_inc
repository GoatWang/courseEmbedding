Supplier: Electro-Sensors, Inc.



About




       
Electro-Sensors, Inc. began operations in 1968 in St. Louis Park, Minnesota. It was founded by James P. Slattery to serve material handling and process control applications in industrial plants. The original products included the Bin-Levetrol level sensor which sensed presence or absence of material and functioned as a high or low level control for bins or hoppers used in dry bulk material handling systems. Another core product was a speed monitor for monitoring critical shaft speeds and was used on conveyor belts, screw conveyors, bucket elevators, and similar process equipment. This speed monitor would shut off the driven equipment if proper speed was not maintained. As the company grew, other sensing technologies and products were added to monitor temperature, vibration, or position in industrial applications. These products include shaft speed sensors, shaft speed switches, bearing temperature sensors, belt misalignment devices, vibration switches, position monitors for slide gates and valves, tilt switches, motor speed controllers, and complete hazard monitoring systems for processing plants.
Electro-Sensors, Inc. consistently produces the most reliable machine monitoring sensors and hazard monitoring systems, utilizing leading-edge technology to continuously improve our products and make them easier to use. Our goal is to manufacture the industry-preferred product for every market we serve. We do this through total quality commitment, by completely fulfilling our customers' expectations.
Electro-Sensors, Inc. contributes real value to the marketplace by providing complete, ready-to-install systems. These systems are delivered promptly and are supported by knowledgeable technical support, providing total customer service. We appreciate our many loyal customers who depend upon our products every day to help run their plants with greater efficiency, productivity, and control.
No matter how unique or complex your manufacturing environment, chances are that Electro-Sensors has encountered a similar challenge. A dedicated staff of applications engineers and years of experience combine with the industry's most advanced technology to deliver reliable solutions that can perform at or above industry standards.

	                Electro-Sensors, Inc. began operations in 1968 in St. Louis Park, Minnesota. It was founded by James P. Slattery to serve material handling and process control applications in industrial plants. The original products included the Bin-Levetrol level sensor which sensed presence or absence of material and functioned as a high or low level control for bins or hoppers used in dry bulk material handling systems. Another core product was a speed monitor for monitoring critical shaft speeds and was used on conveyor belts, screw conveyors, bucket elevators, and similar process equipment. This speed monitor would shut off the driven equipment if proper speed was not maintained. As the company grew, other sensing technologies and products were added to monitor temperature, vibration, or position in industrial applications. These products include shaft speed sensors, shaft speed switches, bearing temperature sensors, belt misalignment devices, vibration switches, position monitors for slide gates and valves, tilt switches, motor speed controllers, and complete hazard monitoring systems for processing plants. Electro-Sensors, Inc. consistently produces the most reliable machine monitoring sensors and hazard monitoring systems, utilizing leading-edge technology to continuously improve our products and make them easier to use. Our goal is to manufacture the industry-preferred product for every market we serve. We do this through total quality commitment, by completely fulfilling our customers' expectations. Electro-Sensors, Inc. contributes real value to the marketplace by providing complete, ready-to-install systems. These systems are delivered promptly and are supported by knowledgeable technical support, providing total customer service. We appreciate our many loyal customers who depend upon our products every day to help run their plants with greater efficiency, productivity, and control. No matter how unique or complex your manufacturing environment, chances are that Electro-Sensors has encountered a similar challenge. A dedicated staff of applications engineers and years of experience combine with the industry's most advanced technology to deliver reliable solutions that can perform at or above industry standards.

What type of Output does my sensor give?Electro-Sensors standard Hall-Effect Sensors give a NPN Open Collector, current sinking output. The output is a digital square wave alternating from zero to supply voltage. We also have optional PNP Open Collector, current sourcing sensors.
What value pull-up resistor should I use with an Electro-Sensors sensor?All Electro-Sensors' products have an internal pull-up resistor. However, if you are sending the pulses to a device without one, you will need to supply one. A suitable pull-up resistor can be anywhere from a 1 K-ohm - 3.3 K-ohms, however, be sure not to exceed 25mA on the sensor. Additionally, ensure the resistor is rated for 200% of the expected maximum wattage it will dissipate at 25°C. If using ¼ watt resistors good values are:



DC Supply
Resistor in Ohms
 Current
Watts Dissipated


5-10 volts
1K
 5-10 mA
.100  (100 mill watt)


12-15 volts
2.2-3.3K
6.8 – 5.45 mA
.082   (82 mill watt)


24 volts
4.7K
5 mA
.123   (123 mill watt)




What is the maximum working voltage and current my sensor can handle?Electro-Sensors' Hall Effect sensors can work up to 24 Vdc at 25 mA maximum. However, we strongly recommend an operating current of less than 20 mA.
Do I need a separate DC power supply to power the Hall Effect Sensor?When using the sensor with an Electro-Sensors product (Speed Switch, Tachometer, etc.) no separate power supply is needed. Those products have a built in supply to power the sensor. If not using with an Electro-Sensors product, check the specifications of that product.
Can my sensor be used with an Intrinsically Safe Barrier?Yes, Electro-Sensors' Hall Effect, Magnetoresistive, and Digital Ring Kit Sensors meet the requirements of intrinsically safe apparatus and associated apparatus for use in Class I, II, and III; Division I hazardous (classified) locations. ANSI/UL 913-1988 - Category 16
 How do I test my sensor to make sure it is working properly?

Electro-Sensors' analog sensors (Models 916, 917) can be tested by disconnecting the sensor from the electronics, and connecting an ohmmeter to the black and clear wires. A properly working sensor would have an ohm reading of approximately 10,000 ohms. Otherwise, contact the factory for details.
Electro-Sensors' standard Hall Effect Sensors (Models 906, 907, 931, 932, 933, 1101, 1102, 1201, and 1202) require an electrical test. Please contact the factory for details.

Do I need a two or three piece shaft monitoring system? Many applications are more suited to having the switch electronics and sensor right at the monitoring point (a two piece system) that way everything is calibrated right there. Other applications require the switch to be remotely mounted from the sensor and disc (a three piece system). Space limitations, environmental considerations, and personal preference all play a part in determining the speed switch system required figure out what you need before installation begins it will save you time and money in the long term.
What type of sensor do I need for my application?Electro-Sensors offers several different types of sensor housings to meet even the most demanding and diverse of application needs. Our standard aluminum body sensors will work in most applications, but we also have explosion proof sensors and the choice of either stainless steel or PVC sensors for corrosive environments. Our explosion proof sensors are also a great choice for harsh environments such as rock quarries or mining applications where a rugged housing is required to protect the sensing head. All of our sensors can be supplied with high-temp Teflon cable if required for higher temperature applications.
What are my pulse generating options?Electro-Sensors offers a wide range of shaft end mount pulser discs and over shaft mount pulser wraps. If the end of the shaft to be monitored is readily available, then in many cases, it makes sense to choose a pulser disc to generate pulses. If the shaft end is not available, then you can use a pulser wrap this is a custom made pulse generator that is a split collar that clamps around the shaft and installs in seconds. Over the years we have manufactured thousands of custom pulser discs and wraps, and either way we've got you covered.
What is the difference between RPM range and relay set point range?Most of Electro-Sensors speed switches can be used to monitor shafts that operate at speeds of up to 10,000 RPM. The relay set point range, however, varies from switch to switch; this range is where the relay will trip when a fault condition occurs. The M100T switch for example has an operating RPM range up to 10,000 RPM, but a set point range of between 5 and 100 RPM. When calibrated the relay will trip somewhere between these 5 and 100 RPM. Knowing the difference between operating RPM range and relay set point range will assist you and save time when specifying a switch for any speed.

The end of the shaft I want to monitor is not available to get at. What other options do I have for mounting a magnetic target?A custom manufactured Pulser wrap that clamps around the shaft that you want to monitor.
What materials can I have my pulser wrap manufactured out of?PVC, Aluminum, and Stainless Steel.
What information do I need to specify a pulser wrap?

Exact shaft diameter
Maximum RPM of the shaft
Maximum temperature the wrap will encounter
Any corrosive chemicals or solvents present
Any space restrictions.

What is the maximum number of magnets I can fit on a pulser wrap?The standard number of magnets on all Electro-Sensors' pulser wraps is 16. However, depending on the outside diameter of a pulser wrap, more magnets may be able to be added. See the following equations or consult the factory for more details.

For 1/2" magnets: Max # of magnets = (Wrap OD - .5)*3.14/.65
For 1/4" magnets: Max # of magnets = (Wrap OD - .5)*3.14/.35
Where OD = Outside Diameter
Please Note: an even # of magnets is always needed

How many pulses per revolution does my sensor/disc give?With a standard Electro-Sensors Hall Effect Sensor, you will get 1 pulse for every 2 magnets (made with magnets alternating in polarity). With an Electro-Sensors Magnetoresistive Sensor, you will get 1 pulse for every 1 magnet. Our standard 255 pulser disc has 16 magnets alternating in polarity.What type of EZ100 should I be using for a high speed shaft moving in a counter clockwise direction?The aluminum 255-EZ disc (part#: 700-001502) is the best option for this situation. With the aluminum option, as opposed to the nylon, you can tighten the disc up to 50 pounds or more with a lock washer and Loc-Tite. This will greatly help to secure the disc to the shaft.


 
FAQs: Other

What types of sensor outputs can be interfaced with my Electro-Sensors equipment?
How do I calculate frequency or Hertz (Hz)?
What is the maximum operating temperature for Electro-Sensors products?
Is my 4-20 mA or 0-10V output isolated?
What if I need to return my product for credit/repair?

What types of sensor outputs can be interfaced with my Electro-Sensors equipment?The standard output being used with Electro-Sensors equipment is NPN Open Collector type. However, much of our equipment can be interfaced with other sensors that are not manufactured by Electro-Sensors. Consult Factory on specific equipment and sensor details, or refer to product data sheets on this web-site.
How do I calculate frequency or Hertz (Hz)?Frequency is measured in Hertz. Hertz is the measure of pulses per second. Hertz is calculated using the following equation:

Hertz = (PPR)(RPM)/60
Where PPR = Pulses Per Revolution
RPM = Revolutions Per Minute

What is the maximum operating temperature for Electro-Sensors products?When specified, our sensors, discs, and wraps can be used in areas up to a maximum of 302° F. Our Electronics are rated to 122° F. Consult Factory with exact application concerns.
Is my 4-20 mA or 0-10V output isolated?Most of our current products have an isolated output. Isolator cards (CVI-50 for example) may be purchased for other equipment.
What if I need to return my product for credit/repair?Contact Electro-Sensors, Inc. for details and Return Policy at 1-800-328-6170. All products being returned must have a Return Authorization Number (RA#).
What is meant by a Normally Closed or Normally Open contact? The way to think of a “Normally” closed or open condition is:  The state of the contacts when the relay is sitting on the shelf in the warehouse.   That is their “normal” condition.  When the system is operating correctly they “switch” and are kept that way by an electrical force, current moving through a coil.

Company Description by Electro-Sensors, Inc.
Electro-Sensors, Inc. began operations in 1968 in St. Louis Park, Minnesota. It was founded by James P. Slattery to serve material handling and process control applications in industrial plants. The original products included the Bin-Levetrol level sensor which sensed presence or absence of material and functioned as a high or low level control for bins or hoppers used in dry bulk material handling systems. Another core product was a speed monitor for monitoring critical shaft speeds and was used on conveyor belts, screw conveyors, bucket elevators, and similar process equipment. This speed monitor would shut off the driven equipment if proper speed was not maintained. 

As the company grew, other sensing technologies and products were added to monitor temperature, vibration, or position in industrial applications. These products include shaft speed sensors, shaft speed switches, bearing temperature sensors, belt misalignment devices, vibration switches, position monitors for slide gates More... and valves, tilt switches, motor speed controllers, and complete hazard monitoring systems for processing plants.

					Liquid Level				















	Liquid Level Sensors and Control Switches	

					Types of Fluid / Liquid Level Sensor & Float Switch Materials, Sizes and Applications					


For manufacturers incorporating fluids as part of their equipment functionality, level sensing of those fluids can be particularly challenging. In applications such as mobile fuel delivery or fuel storage, liquid level sensors must be impervious to solvents and oils and meet any hazardous environment/explosion-proof component requirements.
Liquid level sensors utilized in food processing, food service equipment and brewing must be made of food-grade materials. In applications that include level sensing of hot oils, chemicals and even water, durability is key, as the composition of these fluids can dramatically shorten sensor life.
An improperly specified liquid level sensor can quickly cause equipment malfunction and possible damage, resulting in increased warranty claims and dissatisfied customers.
Madison Company manufactures a broad range of liquid level sensors including float switches, continuous level sensors and non-contact ultrasonic sensors to meet customer needs in a wide variety of fluid sensing applications. Madison partners with every customer to provide either a stock or custom-engineered product for even the most demanding applications. Since 1959, Madison Company has been providing fluid sensing solutions manufactured in the U.S.A.

					Liquid Level				















	Liquid Level Sensors and Control Switches	

					Types of Fluid / Liquid Level Sensor & Float Switch Materials, Sizes and Applications					


For manufacturers incorporating fluids as part of their equipment functionality, level sensing of those fluids can be particularly challenging. In applications such as mobile fuel delivery or fuel storage, liquid level sensors must be impervious to solvents and oils and meet any hazardous environment/explosion-proof component requirements.
Liquid level sensors utilized in food processing, food service equipment and brewing must be made of food-grade materials. In applications that include level sensing of hot oils, chemicals and even water, durability is key, as the composition of these fluids can dramatically shorten sensor life.
An improperly specified liquid level sensor can quickly cause equipment malfunction and possible damage, resulting in increased warranty claims and dissatisfied customers.
Madison Company manufactures a broad range of liquid level sensors including float switches, continuous level sensors and non-contact ultrasonic sensors to meet customer needs in a wide variety of fluid sensing applications. Madison partners with every customer to provide either a stock or custom-engineered product for even the most demanding applications. Since 1959, Madison Company has been providing fluid sensing solutions manufactured in the U.S.A.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
