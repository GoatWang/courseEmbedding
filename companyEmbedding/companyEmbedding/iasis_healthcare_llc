Physicians 







Overview 



 


ICARE 



 


Practice Opportunities 



 


Societies 



 


 




Physicians
Physicians are the foundation of IASIS Healthcare and the critical link connecting our unique brand of healthcare to our hospitals, employees, patients and the communities we call home.
When genuine, mutually respectful relationships are built and sustained, the results are:

The highest standards of patient care
Unparalleled services, equipment and facilities
Employees who believe their jobs really do make a difference
An environment where the growth and development of your practice is assured
Strong, financially sound hospitals to ensure that the healthcare needs of the community are met


We have embraced numerous types of partnerships with our physicians. While the majority of IASIS physicians have a traditional relationship with our hospitals, we also affiliate with physicians and physician extenders through employment arrangements. IASIS works with its employed physicians and extenders to identify ways to improve their overall practice operations and support them with financing and human capital. For all of its affiliated physicians, IASIS works to link them to independent practice associations, physician hospital organizations, provider service organizations and other provider sponsored healthcare delivery networks. IASIS also has established several joint ventures that include hundreds of physician owners.
MD Portal
We strive to give physicians the tolls and information they need to provide excellent care to their patients. Through MD Portal, physicians can gain secure access to the most up-to-date information about their own patients, including radiology and lab results, 24 hours a day 7 days a week.
Visit the MD Portal
I-CARE
I-CARE is a centralized support system for clinical research and continuing education activities within the IASIS Healthcare system. We provide all the tools investigators, coordinators, and sponsors need for their clinical trials in one easy-to-use location. We provide CMEs for live events and enduring material.
Visit I-CARE
Marketing
At IASIS Healthcare, we realize that one of the keys to building a successful practice is effective, strategic marketing to the consumer. Physicians who join IASIS will have the benefit of a full complement of best practices in marketing, communications and community outreach to get their practice off to a great start.
Leadership Opportunities
To ensure that physicians across the country are actively heard and represented in our organization, IASIS offers many leadership opportunities for physicians:

At the community level as members of the local hospital boards of trustees and medical executive committees
At the national level as members of IASIS’ Physician Advisory Council, which includes physicians from every hospital

Resident Web Access
Resident Web Access offers tenants of IASIS healthcare’s medical office buildings the convenience of being able to view open charges, to see transaction history, and to make lease payments online

Steward Health Care and IASIS Healthcare Announce Definitive Agreement to Merge



on May 19, 2017



Steward to Become Largest Privately-Owned For-Profit Hospital Operator in the U.S.

BOSTON, MA – Steward Health Care LLC (“Steward”) and IASIS Healthcare LLC (“IASIS”) today announced they have entered into a definitive agreement to merge their operations. The transaction will make Steward the largest private for-profit hospital operator in the United States with 36 hospitals across ten states, managed care operations in Arizona, Utah and Massachusetts, and projected revenues of almost $8 billion in 2018, the first year of consolidated operations. The merger is expected to close in the third calendar quarter of 2017, subject to customary regulatory approvals, terms and conditions. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
Steward currently operates 18 hospitals and directly employs more than 1,300 multi-specialty physicians in locations across Massachusetts, Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania. IASIS operates 17 hospitals and one behavioral health hospital in locations across Utah, Arizona, Colorado, Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana. Through this transaction, Steward will operate nearly 7,500 patient beds across ten states with approximately 38,000 employees including more than 1,800 directly employed multi-specialty physicians and several thousand aligned physicians.
The merger with IASIS positions Steward to leverage IASIS’s multi-state operating experience to bring Steward’s new model of health care and its award-winning health care services to patients across the nation. As part of the merger with IASIS, Steward will also begin managing the Health Choice managed care operations, which covers more than 680,000 lives. This will bring the total number of covered lives within Steward’s managed care and health insurance products to more than 1.1 million.
“Our physician-driven accountable care model focused on keeping patients healthy is transforming the health care industry as this transaction demonstrates,” said Dr. Ralph de la Torre, Chairman and CEO of Steward Health Care. “Our model shows how the industry can successfully shift toward a more cost-effective local, coordinated approach that puts patients first.”
The new model of health care practiced by Steward emphasizes quality care and wellness. Steward pioneered its health care model in Massachusetts, where it turned around some of the state’s most struggling hospitals into a thriving health system that improved outcomes, lowered costs, and decreased overall health care spending.
W. Carl Whitmer, President and Chief Executive of IASIS, said, “Since its formation nearly 20 years ago, IASIS’s mission has been to deliver high-quality, cost-effective healthcare to our patients and the communities we serve. We have accomplished this goal by investing in our growing hospitals and talented employees and by providing a broad and differentiated set of capabilities and assets to our high-growth, community-focused urban and suburban hospital markets. Steward’s innovative approach to reducing health care cost and improving quality of service will further this mission. It will be business as usual while all of us work toward a seamless merger of our operations.”
IASIS Healthcare’s 18 hospitals will all be merging under Steward Health Care, including:
Arizona

Mountain Vista Medical Center (Mesa, AZ)
St. Luke’s Behavioral Health Center (Phoenix, AZ)
St. Luke’s Medical Center (Phoenix, AZ)
Tempe St. Luke’s Hospital (Tempe, AZ)

Medical Properties Trust, Inc. (“MPT”) has agreed to acquire the interests of substantially all of IASIS’s hospital real estate subject to long term leases and loans with Steward. Under terms of the merger agreement, cash proceeds paid by MPT and other financing sources will be used to retire IASIS’s senior secured term loans and unsecured notes. Remaining cash proceeds will be paid to IASIS equity holders, including its majority stockholder, TPG Capital.
Cerberus Capital Management, LP, one of the world’s leading private investment firms, is the majority shareholder in Steward Health Care LLC. Citi is acting as the sole financial advisor to Steward and is providing committed financing in connection with the transaction. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is acting as sole financial advisor to IASIS.

Healthcare Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis


These reports detail the ever-changing world of healthcare and all of its nuances and sub-categories. Healthcare cannot be narrowly defined nor can one report detail what is happening around the globe. MarketResearch.com provides detailed reports for various countries around the world and the healthcare needs and offerings in those countries. These reports also profile the types of administrations and regulations and policies that are in place in various regions and segments in each country.

Reports are available in industry sub-categories such as: wellness and preventative programming, sports medicine, insurance and managed care, and clinical guidelines and best practices. Readers may also find data regarding alternative and complementary medicine, nursing, public health and information technology. Though not always considered when first thinking of healthcare, information may also be found on veterinary health. 

Reviews of various equipment and pharmaceuticals in specific regions are made available regarding multiple countries. Herbal and traditional products are contrasted and compared, and global access to sufficient ambulance services is discussed.
