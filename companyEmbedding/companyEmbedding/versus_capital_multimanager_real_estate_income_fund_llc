Versus Capital Multi-Manager Real Estate Income Fund Surpasses $1 Billion in Assets | Business Wire
























































Versus Capital Multi-Manager Real Estate Income Fund Surpasses $1 
      Billion in Assets






October 03, 2016 10:23 AM Eastern Daylight Time



GREENWOOD VILLAGE, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Versus Capital Advisors LLC, an asset management firm that specializes 
      in distinctive real asset investment strategies, announced today that 
      their flagship fund, the Versus Capital Multi-Manager Real Estate Income 
      Fund (Tickers: VCMIX/VCMRX; “the Fund”), exceeded $1 billion in assets 
      under management.
    


      The Fund is a continuously offered closed-end interval fund, registered 
      under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Fund serves as a core real 
      estate holding, providing access to institutional real estate managers.
    

      “We believe, now more than ever, it is critical for all investors to 
      diversify beyond traditional 60/40 portfolios with investments that 
      provide attractive risk adjusted returns and low correlations to the 
      public equity and fixed income markets,” said Casey Frazier, Chief 
      Investment Officer of Versus Capital Advisors LLC. “We are proud that 
      our Fund has demonstrated strong performance, low volatility and stable 
      income since its inception over four years ago.”
    

      Mark Quam, CEO of Versus Capital Advisors added, “We believe that 
      investors in our Fund, or any investment strategy for that matter, are 
      best served by financial advisors that adhere to a fiduciary standard. 
      Therefore, we only actively market to Registered Investment Advisors 
      (“RIAs”), private banks & institutional investment consultants. We are 
      happy to have reached the $1 billion milestone and are grateful to have 
      done so with the support and confidence of the fiduciary community.”
    

Performance data current to the most recent month-end may be obtained 
      by calling 303-221-0606 or by visiting www.versuscapital.com.


Risks


      CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FUND'S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, RISKS, CHARGES, AND 
      EXPENSES BEFORE INVESTING. YOU CAN OBTAIN THE PROSPECTUS AND SUMMARY 
      PROSPECTUS WITH THIS AND OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE FUND FROM THE 
      VERSUS CAPITAL WEB SITE (versuscapital.com). READ THEM CAREFULLY BEFORE 
      INVESTING. AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND IS SUBJECT TO A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK.
    

      The Fund does not intend to list its Shares on any securities exchange 
      during the offering period, and a secondary market in the Shares is not 
      expected to develop. There is no guarantee that shareholders will be 
      able to sell all of their tendered shares during a quarterly repurchase 
      offer. An investment is not suitable for investors that require 
      liquidity, other through the Fund’s repurchase policy. You should not 
      expect to be able to sell your Shares other than through the Fund’s 
      repurchase policy, regardless of how the Fund performs.
    

      Real estate is subject to special risks, among which are tenant default, 
      environmental problems, and adverse changes in local economic 
      conditions. The yield from an underlying investment fund could be 
      significantly reduced if it fails to qualify as a REIT (real estate 
      investment trust) for tax purposes. The Fund's investments also may be 
      negatively affected by the broad investment environment. Although the 
      Fund is intended to provide a means by which investors can diversify 
      their portfolios into real estate, the Fund itself is "non-diversified" 
      under the Investment Company Act of 1940 since changes in the market 
      value of a single holding may cause a greater fluctuation in the Fund's 
      net asset value than in a "diversified" fund. The Fund is not intended 
      to be a complete investment program. Investors are reminded that 
      portfolio diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against 
      a loss
    

      A multi-manager strategy involves certain risks. For example, the 
      success of the Fund depends in large part upon the ability of the 
      Adviser to choose successful Investment Managers. It is possible that 
      some Investment Managers may take similar market positions, thereby 
      interfering with the Fund's investment goal. The Fund and underlying 
      Investment Managers may borrow as an investment strategy. The Fund 
      intends to limit borrowing to one third of its gross asset value. While 
      borrowing presents opportunities to increase the Fund's total return, it 
      potentially increases the losses as well. Under certain circumstances, 
      the Fund's distribution policy could result in a return of capital, 
      potentially causing the Fund's expense ratio to increase. The Adviser, 
      Sub-Adviser, and Investment Mangers manage portfolios for themselves and 
      for clients other than the Fund. A conflict between the interests of the 
      Fund and the interests of these other parties may arise in certain 
      situations which potentially could disadvantage the Fund. For example, a 
      suitable but limited investment opportunity might be allocated to 
      another client rather than to the Fund.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices

Beyond Tesla: 7 stocks driving the autonomous car revolution

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Versus Capital Multi-Manager Real Estate Income Fund Surpasses $500 Million In Assets






Business Wire




Feb 11, 2016 4:49 PM EST













 




























































  Versus Capital Advisors LLC (ticker: VCMIX), an asset management firm that specializes in distinctive real estate investment funds, announced today that the Versus Capital Multi-Manager Real Estate Income Fund ("the Fund"), having recently reached $500 million in assets, registered an additional $1.25 billion in shares as of February 2, 2016.  The Fund is a continuously offered closed-end interval fund, registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Fund serves as a core real estate holding, providing access to institutional real estate managers. "In a highly volatile investment environment, we feel that the registered investment advisor community continues to validate our core real estate strategy with additional investment dollars," said Casey Frazier, Chief Investment Officer of Versus Capital Advisors LLC.  Mark Quam, CEO of Versus Capital Advisors, added, "Attractive distributions, low volatility, and the potential for long-term capital appreciation, are the investment attributes we are working to provide advisors and their clients. We are continuing to see interest in the product grow and as such, we needed to assure we had sufficient shares registered to accommodate the investment demand."  Performance data current to the most recent month-end may be obtained by calling 877-343-7916.  Risks  CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FUND'S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, RISKS, CHARGES, AND EXPENSES BEFORE INVESTING. YOU CAN OBTAIN THE PROSPECTUS AND SUMMARY PROSPECTUS WITH THIS AND OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE FUND FROM THE VERSUS CAPITAL WEB SITE (versuscapital.com). READ THEM CAREFULLY BEFORE INVESTING. AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND IS SUBJECT TO A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK.  The Fund does not intend to list its Shares on any securities exchange during the offering period, and a secondary market in the Shares is not expected to develop. There is no guarantee that shareholders will be able to sell all of their tendered shares during a quarterly repurchase offer. An investment is not suitable for investors that require liquidity, other through the Fund's repurchase policy. You should not expect to be able to sell your Shares other than through the Fund's repurchase policy, regardless of how the Fund performs.
