TEXAS-NEW MEXICO POWER COMPANY Company Profile

   The name is a bit misleading. While Texas-New Mexico Power (TNMP) has a heritage of providing energy services in the Lone Star State as well as its neighbor to the West, the Land of Enchantment, it is currently a provider to Texas residents only. The utility, a subsidiary of PNM Resources, an energy company based Albuquerque, New Mexico, provides regulated electric transmission and distribution services to more than 231,000 customers in 76 cities in Texas. The company serves small-to-medium sized communities in Texas on behalf of 65 retail electric providers. (In 2007 PNM Resources assigned the New Mexico regulated electric distribution operations to another business unit.)
  
† Some telephone numbers on the Hoover’s site may be on a country’s do not call or do not contact list including, but not limited to, the United Kingdom’s CTPS or TPS registers. It is a legal requirement that companies do not make sales or marketing calls to registered numbers. These are central opt out registers whereby corporate subscribers and individuals can register their preference not to receive unsolicited sales and marketing telephone calls. By using the information provided on the Hoover’s sites, as the direct marketer you represent and warrant that you will use such information in compliance with all applicable local, state, national or international laws and regulations, including any local do not call registers or marketing regulations, and agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Dun & Bradstreet and each of its affiliates in the event your use violates such laws and regulations.

TEXAS-NEW MEXICO POWER COMPANY Revenue and Financial Data

   The name is a bit misleading. While Texas-New Mexico Power (TNMP) has a heritage of providing energy services in the Lone Star State as well as its neighbor to the West, the Land of Enchantment, it is currently a provider to Texas residents only. The utility, a subsidiary of PNM Resources, an energy company based Albuquerque, New Mexico, provides regulated electric transmission and distribution services to more than 231,000 customers in 76 cities in Texas. The company serves small-to-medium sized communities in Texas on behalf of 65 retail electric providers. (In 2007 PNM Resources assigned the New Mexico regulated electric distribution operations to another business unit.)
