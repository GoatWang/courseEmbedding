DALLAS, July 28, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. (NYSE:    SC) ("SC") today announced net income for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017 ("Q2 2017") of $265 million, or $0.74 per diluted common share. During Q2 2017, SC's effective tax rate was 24.0 percent, down from 35.2 percent in the second quarter ended June 30, 2016 ("Q2 2016"). The decreased tax rate for Q2 2017 is associated with Santander Consumer International Puerto Rico, LLC results, leading to a $41 million impact, or $0.11 per diluted common share, of which $14 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share is attributable to Q2 2017.








Q2 2017 Highlights (variances compared to Q2 2016):

Announced proposed dividends of $0.03 per share in Q4 2017 and $0.05 per share in Q1 and Q2 of 2018, following the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ("CCAR") results of Santander Holdings USA, Inc. ("SHUSA") 
Total auto originations of $5.5 billion, up 1% 

Core retail auto loan originations of $2.3 billion, up 36% 
Chrysler Capital nonprime loan originations of $948 million, up 11% 
Chrysler Capital prime loan originations of $854 million, down 30% 

Net finance and other interest income of $1.1 billion, down 6% 
Net leased vehicle income of $131 million, up 5%     
Return on average assets of 2.7%, down from 3.0% 
Common equity tier 1 ("CET1") ratio of 14.3%, up 170 bps 
Executed asset sales of $536 million through Banco Santander flow agreement 
Completed national roll out of Chrysler Capital VIP program with more than 2,500 dealers enrolled 
Chrysler penetration rate of 20%, up from 19% at the end of the first quarter of 2017 
Issued $2.3 billion in securitizations, including the first public DRIVE securitization 

"We are pleased that following SHUSA's 2017 CCAR results, SC announced proposed dividends to our shareholders of $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $0.05 per share in the first and second quarters of 2018, as SC and SHUSA continue to make significant improvements to the organization's capital planning processes. While there is still work to be done, I am proud of our diligent and hard work over the last several years as we endeavor to maintain the highest standards of governance, compliance and risk management," said Jason Kulas, President and Chief Executive Officer.
Mr. Kulas continued, "We are also pleased with the progress we have made to further strengthen our relationship with Chrysler. During the quarter, we completed the national roll out of our VIP program with more than 2,500 Chrysler dealers enrolled, executed a second asset sale through the Banco Santander flow agreement, and remain committed to growing our dealer floorplan strategy with Santander Bank NA, all of which support improved penetration rates with Chrysler."
Izzy Dawood, Chief Financial Officer, added, "During the quarter, we continued to demonstrate robust access to the capital markets by executing two securitizations totaling $2.3 billion from our SDART and DRIVE platforms, including our inaugural public DRIVE securitization."
Finance receivables, loans and leases, net1 of $35 billion as of Q2 2017 increased 3 percent versus December 31, 2016. Net finance and other interest income decreased 6 percent to $1.1 billion in Q2 2017 from $1.2 billion in Q2 2016, driven by a combination of lower retail installment contract ("RIC") balances and higher cost of funds, which was driven primarily by an increase in benchmark rates.
SC's average annual percentage rate ("APR") at the end of Q2 2017 for RICs held for investment was 16.6 percent, down from 16.7 percent at the end of Q2 2016. These APRs are consistent with credit trends in our held for investment portfolio. As of the end of Q2 2017, RICs with FICO® scores at origination of less than 540 decreased to 22.4 percent, from 22.9 percent as of the end of Q2 2016, and RICs with FICO® scores at origination greater than 640 increased to 14 percent, from 13.3 as of the end of Q2 2016.
Net leased vehicle income increased 5 percent to $131 million in Q2 2017, from $125 million in Q2 2016, as a result of the continued growth of our leasing portfolio.
SC's allowance ratio2 decreased 10 basis points, to 12.6 percent at the end of Q2 2017, from 12.7 percent at the end of Q1 2017.
SC's RIC net charge-off ratio3 and delinquency ratio4 increased to 7.5 percent and 4.7 percent, respectively, in Q2 2017, from 6.0 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively, in Q2 2016. The increase in SC's net charge-off ratio is attributable to a combination of a lower recovery rate, slower portfolio growth since Q2 2016 and the acceleration of bankruptcy related charge-offs. These bankruptcy related charge-offs are primarily timing related and would have likely otherwise occurred in future quarters, as such not changing SC's overall view of vintage losses. The increase in delinquency ratio in Q2 2017 was also impacted by the slower portfolio growth since Q2 2016.
Provision for credit losses increased to $521 million in Q2 2017, from $512 million in Q2 2016. 
SC recorded net investment losses of $100 million in Q2 2017, compared to net investment losses of $101 million in Q2 2016. The current period losses were primarily driven by $90 million of lower of cost or market adjustments related to the held for sale personal lending portfolio, comprised of $104 million in customer default activity and a $14 million decrease in market discount, consistent with typical seasonal patterns. Excluding the impact of personal lending, net investment losses totaled $2 million.
During Q2 2017 SC incurred $282 million of operating expenses, up 4 percent from $272 million in Q2 2016, primarily driven by continued investment in compliance and control functions. SC's expense ratio for the quarter increased to 2.2 percent, up from 2.0 percent during the same period last year. 
SC executed asset sales of $566 million during Q2 2017, with $536 million in sales generated through the flow agreement with Banco Santander, under which it retains servicing. The serviced for others portfolio of $9.9 billion as of Q2 2017, is down 24 percent from $13 billion in Q2 2016. Servicing fee income decreased 26 percent to $32 million in Q2 2017, from $43 million in Q2 2016. The decline in SC's serviced for others portfolio and servicing fee income are a result of lower prime originations and lower prime asset sales in Q2 2017, compared to the same quarter the prior year, as the prime environment remains highly competitive.
1 Includes Finance receivables held for investment, Finance receivables held for sale and Leased vehicles.
2 Ratio for allowance for credit losses excludes end of period balances on purchased receivables portfolio of $194 million and finance receivables held for sale of $2.1 billion. 
3 Net charge-off ratio stated on a recorded investment basis, which is unpaid principal balance adjusted for unaccreted net discounts, subvention and origination costs.
4 Delinquency ratio is defined as the ratio of end of period delinquent principal over 60 days to end of period gross balance of the respective portfolio, excludes capital leases.

 Under the banking agencies' risk-based capital guidelines, assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet exposures are assigned to broad risk categories. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is multiplied by the associated risk weight of the category. The resulting weighted values are added together with the measure for market risk, resulting in the Company's total Risk weighted assets. 






 (b)  
 CET1 is calculated under Basel III regulations required as of January 1, 2015. The fully phased-in capital ratios are non-GAAP financial measures.

Banco Santander Reportedly Plans To Raise Stake In Santander Consumer
Jul 10 17
Banco Santander, S.A. (BME:SAN) is planning to raise stake in Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. (NYSE:SC). Banco Santander plans to go ahead with a proposal to increase control of Santander Consumer USA, after the business passed the Federal Reserve's stress test last month, according to people familiar with the matter. Banco Santander is still waiting for regulators to sign off on the transaction, first proposed in 2015. Banco Santander, which already owns 59% of Santander Consumer USA, has been trying for two years to purchase a 9.7% stake from co-founder Thomas G Dundon. It's not clear what Banco Santander would pay if the transaction goes ahead now. A Madrid-based press officer for Banco Santander declined to comment.

Overview

						About Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc.
					

						Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. (NYSE: SC) is a full-service, technology-driven consumer finance company focused on vehicle finance and unsecured consumer lending products. The company, which began originating retail installment contracts in 1997, has a serviced portfolio of more than $40 billion (as of September 30, 2014), has more than two million customers across all credit grades, and is headquartered in Dallas. Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. is the parent company of Santander Consumer USA Inc. ("SC").
					
 History 

						The company was founded by a group of entrepreneurs within the auto industry. The group gained experience working in finance in auto dealerships, and in 1995 left the dealership environment to start a new company focused on the finance side of the industry. As a non-originator, the new company marketed the auto finance programs of various banks, gaining valuable perspective on the auto originations process.
					

						The success of the group caught the attention of FirstCity Financial and in 1998 our entrepreneurial partnership joined with FirstCity Financial to form FirstCity Funding, a nonprime auto finance company with a unique business model serving a niche market. We grew quickly and in 2000 our ownership group expanded to include HBOS plc., and FirstCity Funding officially became Drive Financial Services LP.
					

						In 2004, FirstCity Financial sold its interest in Drive, shifting ownership to HBOS plc and Drive Management LP. The stability and strength of HBOS plc allowed Drive to surpass expectations and continue to grow at a rapid pace. In 2006, HBOS plc and certain members of Drive Management LP sold their interest to Banco Santander S.A.
					

						In 2009, Santander contributed its interest in the company to Santander Holdings USA Inc. (SHUSA), a wholly owned subsidiary of Banco Santander S.A. and until December 31, 2011, the company was owned by SHUSA and our CEO.
					

						In late 2011, three leading private investment equity firms, Centerbridge Partners LP, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. LP and Warburg Pincus LLC, through Sponsor Auto Finance Holding Series LP, purchased an ownership interest in the company.
					

						In 2013, Santander Consumer USA launched Chrysler Capital auto purchase and lease financing program with the Chrysler Group LLC and integrated its subprime Drive brand into the main Santander platform. In 2014, SC became a public company with a listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: SC).
					
Financial Overview

						To make a financial inquiry regarding securitizations or other matters pertaining to Santander Consumer USA Holdings, Inc., please send your request via e-mail or visit the investor section of our Web site.

					Full Description



Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc., incorporated on July 1, 2013, is the holding company for Santander Consumer USA Inc., and subsidiaries, a consumer finance company focused on vehicle finance and third party servicing. The Company operates through Consumer Finance segment. Its Consumer Finance business is focused on vehicle financial products and services, including retail installment contracts, vehicle leases, and dealer loans, as well as financial products and services related to motorcycles, recreational vehicles (RVs), and marine vehicles. It also includes its personal loan and point-of-sale financing operations. The Company's primary business is the indirect origination and securitization of retail installment contracts, principally through manufacturer-franchised dealers in connection with their sale of new and used vehicles to retail consumers. The Company offers auto financing products and services to Fiat Chrysler Automobiles US LLC (FCA) customers and dealers under the Chrysler Capital brand. These products and services include consumer retail installment contracts and leases, as well as dealer loans for inventory, construction, real estate, working capital and revolving lines of credit.The Company offers vehicle-related financing products, primarily consisting of consumer loans and leases, and servicing of such assets. Its origination platform delivers automated around the clock underwriting decision-making through a credit-scoring system. Every loan application it receives is processed by its risk scoring and pricing models. Its credit scorecard development process is supported by a market database that includes 20 years of historical data on the loans that it has acquired, as well as consumer finance third-party data. It continuously evaluates loan performance and consumer behavior to improve its underwriting decisions. The Company's scorecard methodology supports underwriting decisions for consumers across the full credit spectrum and is designed to allow it to manage modeled risk-adjusted yield for a given consumer's credit profile. Its servicing activities consist of processing customer payments, responding to customer inquiries (such as requests for payoff quotes), processing customer requests for account revisions (such as payment deferrals), maintaining a perfected security interest in the financed vehicle, monitoring vehicle insurance coverage, pursuing collection of delinquent accounts, and remarketing repossessed or off-lease vehicles.Consumer Vehicle LoansThe Company's primary business is to indirectly originate vehicle loans through automotive dealerships throughout the United States. It has a dealer network, which includes manufacturer-affiliated or independent dealers. It uses a risk-adjusted methodology to determine the price to pay the automotive dealer for the loan, which may be above or below the principal amount of the loan depending on characteristics, such as the contractual annual percentage rate (APR) and the borrower's credit profile. The consumer is obligated to make payments in an amount equal to the principal amount of the loan plus interest at the APR negotiated with the dealer. The consumer is also responsible for charges related to past-due payments. Dealers may retain some portion of the finance charge as compensation. Its agreements with dealers place a limit on the amount of the finance charges they are entitled to retain. Loans with below-market APRs are offered through manufacturer incentive programs. The manufacturer will compensate the originator of these loans for the amount of the financing rate that is below market. These payments are called rate subvention. It is entitled to receive rate subvention payments from FCA. It also directly originates loans through its branded online RoadLoans.com platform. The loans acquired in bulk acquisitions have primarily been collateralized by automobiles. However, a small amount of such loans have been collateralized by marine and recreational vehicles. It generates revenue on these loans through finance charges.Vehicle LeasesThe Company acquires leases primarily from FCA-affiliated automotive dealers and, as a result, become titleholder for leased vehicles. The acquisition cost for these leases is based on the underlying value of the vehicle, the contractual lease payments and the residual value, which is the expected value of the vehicle at the time of the lease termination. It uses projected residual values that are estimated by third parties, such as Automotive Lease Guide (ALG). The residual value it uses to determine lease payments, or the contractual residual value, may be adjusted upward as part of marketing incentives provided by the manufacturer of the vehicle. The marketing incentive payment that manufacturers pay the Company is equal to the expected difference between the projected ALG residual value and the contractual residual value. This residual support payment is a form of subvention. It is a preferred provider of subvented leases through Chrysler Capital. All of these leases are to prime consumers. The consumer, or lessee, is responsible for the contractual lease payments and any excessive mileage or wear and tear on the vehicle that results in a lower residual value of the vehicle at the time of the lease's termination. The consumer is also generally responsible for charges related to past due payments. Its leases are primarily closed-ended, meaning the consumer does not bear the residual risk. It generates revenue on leases through monthly lease payments and fees and, depending on the market value of the off-lease vehicle, it may recognize a gain or loss upon remarketing. Its agreement with FCA permits it to share any residual losses over a threshold, determined on an individual lease basis, with FCA.Servicing for OthersThe Company services a portfolio of vehicle loans originated or otherwise independently acquired by Santander Bank, N.A. (SBNA), as well as vehicle leases originated by SBNA under terms of a flow agreement with it. It also services loans sold through its flow agreements, and through its Chrysler Capital off-balance sheet securitizations, as well as several smaller loan portfolios for various third-party institutions. It generates revenue on these assets through servicing and other fees collected from the institutional owners and the borrowers, and may also generate a gain or loss on the sale of assets.
