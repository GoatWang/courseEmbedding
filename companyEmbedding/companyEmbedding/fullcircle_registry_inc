(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  General:  Where this Form 10-Q includes "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of  �  Attracting immediate financing;  �  Merging with or acquiring profitable private businesses.  �  Delivering a quality product that meets customer expectations;  �  Obtaining and expanding market acceptance of the products we offer; and  �  Competition in our market.  History:  Our initial business began in 2000 with the formation of FullCircle Registry, Inc ("FullCircle" or the "Company"). We were a technology-based business that provided emergency document and information retrieval services. The system was designed to allow medical personnel to quickly obtain critical information. We provided these services directly to subscribers and through strategic alliances with health care providers.  Our Current Business:  Our current business plan targets the acquisition of small profitable businesses with the following mission statement:  FullCircle Registry, Inc.'s, mission is to provide exit capabilities for small to medium sized private profitable, companies through acquisition, to improve our stockholder value while leaving those companies autonomous where possible to continue to be managed by the team that founded them, and subsequently providing liquidity and increased returns for the founder(s).  We have entered the "analysis" and "selection" phase of our M&A activities and will be announcing any progress through PR newswire releases.  New Business plan and new direction  In recent years we have established four operating subsidiaries. In addition to the parent company, FullCircle Registry, Inc., we have established companies to operate in the following business sectors: distribution of medical supplies, entertainment, insurance agency and prescription assistance services. In 2010 we purchased our first property, in Indianapolis, Indiana, that contains the Georgetown 14 Digital Cinemas. Revenues for 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 were predominantly from the movie theater operations. Our medical supplies distribution company, FullCircle Medical Supplies, Inc., plans to commence operations in 2016 when funding is available. FullCircle Insurance Agency, Inc. and FullCircle Prescriptions, Inc. are currently inactive, pending national economic improvements and changes in the healthcare sector.  Funding for acquisitions, theater improvements and operating capital  In July 2015 we entered into discussions with Local Initiatives Support Corporation ("LISC") for the purpose of receiving funding assistance for the business model change of our theater in Indianapolis. Additional information regarding those activities is reported under "New direction business model for Georgetown 14 Cinemas," below.  We continue to receive additional requirements to qualify for consideration of funding from LISC. We have accomplished all of those demands and are in the final stages of revising the application and pro formas to include those revisions. We have been informed that our application should proceed to the LISC committee in June for its recommendation to LISC corporate offices. This has been a very difficult process as there has been no assistance on how to proceed with the application process. There are specialists that perform these functions for companies; however, FullCircle does not have sufficient capital to hire these services so our CEO has had to perform these application revisions himself along with the tax appeal process, SEC filings and the general management of the Company.  Our CEO met with our property mortgage holder and was able to obtain a mortgage payment moratorium until July 31, 2016 when it is expected that our LISC funding application will be resolved.  It is our intent to lease the theater once the funding and theater conversion is completed.  FullCircle Entertainment, Inc.  In 2010 we established FullCircle Entertainment, Inc. ("FullCircle Entertainment") for the purpose of acquiring movie theaters and other entertainment venues.  On December 31, 2010, FullCircle Entertainment purchased Georgetown 14 Cinemas, a movie theater complex property at 3898 Lafayette Road, Indianapolis, Indiana 46224.  A summary of the Georgetown 14 acquisition follows:  �  The 8-acre property purchase price was $5.5 million.  �  The appraised value was $7.85 million.  �  Assumed mortgage was $5,047,841 with issuance of Company stock valued at $452,159.  �  20 employees.  In January 2012 we converted all of our screens to a digital format and installed 3D capability at a cost of $790,000, which we financed with a secured loan. The digital format offers a crisper view and allows the exhibition of 3D movies on three of our screens. Two of our theaters had been previously converted to digital prior to 2012.  In 2012 we renegotiated the mortgage on the property, resulting in a reduction of 3/4 percentage point in the interest rate. In March 2013 we again renegotiated the mortgage, resulting in a further reduction of 1/4 percentage point.  Our mortgage currently is currently at a 4 3/4 % interest rate. Due to the decline in movie revenues and related decline in operating cash flows, in 2015 it was difficult for us to maintain the current level of principal and interest payments. On July 31, 2015, we entered into a change in terms agreement with our lender whereby our lender agreed to modify our payment schedule from a monthly fixed principal and interest payment in the amount of $34,435 to interest only payments beginning with payment due date of June 15, 2015 thru November 15, 2015. The normal payment of principal and interest of $34,435 was to resume on December 15, 2015.  In late 2015, the mortgage on our property was transferred to another lender, and recently we have negotiated a mortgage payment moratorium until July 31, 2016 expecting that our funding application with LISC will be resolved by then.  During 2013 we increased pricing of our tickets and concessions to be in line with other competing full service digital theaters in our area.  We also developed a new web page for the Georgetown 14 Digital Cinemas allowing for a more complete patron information center. The new site is:  In 2013, we began an upgrade to the Georgetown 14 Digital Cinemas; with more signage and a complete remodel of our concession and lobby areas, as well as new employee uniforms. Funding for these improvements has been difficult, but we have managed to begin the process with the assistance from major stockholders.  We launched a gift card program as well as a Customer Rewards program. Since its inception in January 2014 more than 500 patrons have enrolled in the Customer Rewards program. This will allow us to identify the zip codes of our patrons, so that we can target specialized marketing materials and monitor our growth outside our immediate area.  We also added uniformed security from dusk to close, and increased our management compensation to be more commensurate with other local theaters. We also improved our maintenance operations to improve the patron experience.  During 2016, contingent on our funding application, we plan to improve our theater operations to allow us to offer:  �  Free viewing of U.S. popular sporting events, such as the Major League Baseball World Series, NFL playoffs, NCAA Basketball and Football playoffs and NBA playoffs. These would be primarily marketing events to increase concession revenue.  �  Viewing of popular international sporting events, to serve our local international community.  �  Business meetings requiring high-speed internet upload and download capabilities  �  Private party functions  �  Adult beverages and in-theater dining  �  New recliner seating  During 2015, nationwide theater revenues were down compared to the preceding year, due principally to a series of poorly reviewed and disappointing movies that were released. Because of the first run movies that are predominately class B movies, we experienced a further decline in attendance. Our first quarter ticket sales and concession revenues dropped by 26.5% compared to the first quarter 2015.  The quality of the movies during the quarter has been disappointing; however the industry as a whole is expecting some improved releases in June and July.  In early 2014 we received a letter of intent for the purpose of leasing our Georgetown 14 Theater. We negotiated and accepted reasonable terms of a lease and after six months the company vacated the LOI. Their broker informed us that they were unable to obtain the funds necessary for their planned $2.5 million conversion of the theater.  In October 2014 we once again returned to seeking a theater company to lease or purchase our property. Those conversations continued throughout 2015 and remain active at the time of this filing. We continue to discuss leasing opportunities with major theater companies. Several have visited but have declined due to the high crime image in our area next to the Lafayette Square Mall, which is predominately vacant and in disrepair.  Provided that we are successful in acquiring funding and completing the conversion into a dine-in theater we believe that we will become attractive to a major movie theater company for the purpose of leasing our remodeled facility.  No assurances can be made as to the success of our plan to lease or sell the property; however we have paid down our mortgage by approximately $800,000 since the acquisition of the property in 2010, so should this occur we would be in a better financial position to be able to refinance our mortgage and be able to use some of our equity for working capital.  At this time, we have no contracts, agreements, or understandings for additional funding, nor can any assurance be given that we will be able to obtain this capital on acceptable terms. In such an event, this may have a materially adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. No assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the total capital necessary to fund our new business plans. In such an event, this may have a materially adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  A portion of the building housing the Georgetown Digital Cinemas also includes a grocery store space, which we lease to an independent operator. In 2014 we renewed our lease to Save-A-Lot Stores, a grocery store operator, for another seven years with three five year options.  Our theater General Manager elected to retire and relocate to Idaho during the March Quarter. Currently the theater and property is being managed by the FullCircle CEO and we are reviewing candidates to hire a new general manager.  Recently we received notification that our appeal for the property tax assessment was approved. This appeal reduced our annual property tax payments by $46,087 to $38,000 for the 2015 assessment year.  We received a new assessment for 2016 that did not take into consideration our 2015 assessment adjustment so we have started the appeal process again. Working on these appeals for each year since 2011 is extremely time consuming and frustrating. Due to the degree of difficulty working with a bureaucracy requires engaging an experienced tax attorney. Given that there is insufficient funding to hire those services the CEO has been required to perform all of those appeals since 2011. The savings has been substantial with approximately $240,000 in tax savings with the 2016 appeal remaining.  New direction business model for Georgetown 14 Cinemas  The cost of renting movies from studios and filmmakers continues to increase. In addition, the quantity of major new releases each week has declined. In general, we do not receive the best first run movies anymore.  On the other hand, the casual restaurant business has been on the upswing in recent years, and consumer demand for restaurant meals has increased.  Because of these trends, we have been attempting to refinance the theater or acquire other funding to finance the conversion of the theater into an "In-Theater Dining" experience and replace the stadium seating with recliner lounge seating. As a result of changes in Hollywood's direction and the popularity of Netflix and other movie aftermarket activity, the theater business model is changing, and many theater companies are starting to convert to enhanced food and beverage services. In addition, many theaters are transforming their auditoriums to luxury reclining seating. Fortunately, as of this date only two theaters in our marketplace have converted. Studio Movie Grill converted a facility 10 miles from us to full in-dining services and Circle Center has converted to just luxury recliners. We believe that we need to move quickly to protect our investment.  We believe we have an ideal theater footprint for us to do a complete conversion, including a nice area for a lounge and a lobby large enough to install a food or beverage destination area as well. The plan would be to convert the smallest auditorium into a kitchen. In our phase one plans we would convert four auditoriums into luxury recliner seating and begin serving an expanded menu and beverages. In phase two more theaters would be converted as well.  Because of the improved performance in the casual restaurant sector in past years, we believe that this trend will continue. Economically, if a person and their spouse want to do a dinner and a movie it takes about four hours to do and if they have children the babysitting cost is very high. Combining the theater and the restaurant reduces the time to about two hours and becomes more economically attractive.  Since October 2014 we have been working with agencies that are involved in economic development in the depressed areas of Indianapolis. We have had two meetings with representatives of the Mayor of Indianapolis, and a meeting with former Mayor Ballard on July 28th 2015. The Mayor's office introduced us to Local Initiatives Support Corporation ("LISC"), which provides grants and financing for redevelopment of urban commercial properties and we are requesting a grant to provide the funding to convert the theater. Indianapolis has expressed interest in improving the Georgetown 14 area, and members of the city's economic development staff are assisting us in our campaign. Our applications for the conversion grant and the refinancing of the property have been submitted.  The area has been economically damaged by the problems with the Lafayette Square Mall, adjacent to us, along with the recession. Currently, Lafayette Square Mall is less than 50% occupied. LISC is interested in helping the area to improve the business climate and begin a recovery. Another mall area, Lafayette Shoppes, which is adjacent to our property, has also experienced a decline in tenants. Currently that center's shops are only 50% occupied.  Among other activities, we have been engaged in a property tax appeal since May 2012 to correct our valuations, back to 2011. In late August we made a presentation to the Tax Review Board of Marion County for the purpose of evaluation of our historical assessments and taxes on the theater property. We won this appeal and we have received credits of $190,000 dating back to the assessments in 2011. We have engaged in a payment plan to clear the remaining property tax balance in monthly payments of $4,010 per month through June of 2016. We are still in the process of appealing the 2014 and 2015 assessments.  Since we have resolved the valuation and tax issues, we became cleared to submit our LISC application. All of the required information, financial history and pro formas, along with details of the five phases of our plan, have been submitted to LISC.  If we receive a favorable response from LISC, it is our goal that LISC would provide the funding for the theater conversion and upgrade. We are requesting funds sufficient to complete the conversion of half the theater. Our pro forma with the conversion is estimated to take our FullCircle Entertainment revenues to the $2.7 to $3.0 million level in the first year after conversion, which would be more than double our current revenue. Performances of other existing theaters that have made this conversion have had even greater percentages increases. Of course, these pro forma estimates depend on a number of assumptions.  No assurances can be made at this time as to the success of our plan to acquire the funding and lease or sell the property.  Subsequent to December 31, 2015 on February 20, 2016 we received a Letter of Intent (LOI) for the purpose of purchasing a portion of our parking lot. The LOI purpose is to use the south end of the parking lot for a mixed-use building housing retail shops and millennium apartments. At this time the developer is engaged in a feasibility study. If this purchase for the development moves forward it will provide some working capital as well as improve the value of our remaining property. The area being discussed is about one acre in size.  Recently, on May 2nd we received a support letter from the Director of the International Marketplace Coalition, which was one of the requirements from LISC for us to complete our application requirements. This allows us to now proceed to committee action for our funding application.  FullCircle Medical Supplies, Inc.  In 2013 we established a new company, FullCircle Medical Supplies, Inc. ("FullCircle Medical"), for the purpose of entering into the durable medical equipment ("DME") supply business sector, for the purpose of acquiring medical supply businesses and other related medical supply services in the Sun Belt states.  At the time we started to move into the DME acquisition direction we believed that the theater would be leased out which would free up our time and financial resources to begin that project. Unfortunately this company development had to be placed on hold until we can get out from under the financial burden of the theater.  Our current plan is to acquire or establish DME businesses throughout the state of Louisiana with up to twelve DME locations, utilizing centralized warehousing, billing, and purchasing, and to provide all related DME services in each location.  Acquiring these businesses and covering the whole state should provide:  �  Economies of scale, reducing costs of inventory and operational expenses  �  Central warehousing, providing prompt supply to all stores and internet sales, and reducing obsolete inventory write-downs  �  Smaller vehicle fleets  �  Improved buying power by purchasing in volume  �  Reduced insurance expense  �  Improved individual store web sites  �  Internet marketing allowing the stores to reach out to the entire country with product catalogues and shopping carts  �  Social media marketing  �  Centralized billing and insurance claim processing  �  Improved receivables controls  �  Increased selection of products  �  Operational synergies between all stores  �  Improved margins and profitability  Once we can begin we are considering several existing DME businesses, with an average of approximately $1.1 million in revenues. At such time as we complete some acquisitions, we plan to employ a state manager with experience in the medical supply industry to supervise the managers of the purchased stores and to manage the operations in the state.  We have signed consulting agreements with two Acquisition Managers for the purpose of assisting in our acquisition process in Louisiana and South Carolina and to assist the CEO in the due diligence requirements necessary to determine each DME's suitability to become part of our mission.  Many of these businesses are still owned by their founders, who are looking for an exit strategy to realize a gain for their life's work. Most have employees with ten to fifteen years' experience, who are solid contributors to these businesses. Most are contributors to civic activities in their communities, which provides them a business connection within their marketing area. Our intent is to allow them to continue to operate autonomously, to continue to be profitable, and to improve net income with increased product selection, improved synergies, and Internet and social media exposure. We have entered the "analysis" and "selection" phase of our acquisition activities, and our executives have made multiple trips to Louisiana for the purpose of collecting and analyzing information, reviewing each business, observing employees, and understanding the focus and strengths of each business. In some cases we are negotiating letters of intent for these proposed acquisitions, and in the process of financial evaluations of those businesses.  Typically, most DME businesses do not market on the Internet and many do not have websites. Once we complete the first acquisition, we plan to create a web site introducing a products catalogue and shopping cart. As acquisitions continue, we plan to "clone" the website for each location, connecting to our products catalogue and shopping carts. This would allow each DME to market nationally as well as internationally and ship out of a central warehouse. We believe that revenues from these businesses can be expanded by approximately 50% over the first two-year period through Internet and social media marketing.  In general, applicable SEC rules require that the financial statements of these businesses be audited by an independent certified public accountant, so the purchase of these businesses cannot be completed until the auditors complete the audit and provide their opinion.  Candidates to operate the proposed Louisiana company have been interviewed and, following acquisition of DME companies in the state, will be phased in with consulting arrangements and eventually assume management positions in the company. We believe our consultants will assist in providing a full range of products and services for each market.  Once we establish consolidated operations in Louisiana, and the infrastructure and operations are tested and functioning, we plan to utilize this same rollup approach in additional southern states.  FullCircle Insurance Agency, Inc.  The FullCircle Insurance Agency, Inc. was founded in August 2008, but is currently inactive. In the past few years the insurance industry has experienced difficulties flowing from the financial problems of AIG and other major industry players, and the enactment of the Affordable Care Act has produced significant uncertainty in the healthcare insurance field. Until these matters are stabilized, we have placed operations of this company on hold. We believe that this industry will thrive once the Affordable Care Act is fully implemented, improved, and finalized. Increased agency knowledge and professionalism will be necessary to help businesses and individuals understand the new laws. We believe there are opportunities to "roll up" several local agencies into regional agencies, for economies of scale in providing these professional services.  FullCircle Prescription Services, Inc.  FullCircle Prescription Services, Inc. was established for the purpose of handling our prescription assistance services program. Its mission is to assist consumers in finding medications at discounted rates worldwide in our "Shop the World" program. When it becomes operational, FullCircle Prescription Services, Inc. will not dispense any medications nor handle any prescriptions, but will function only as a customer assistance program.  Until a more favorable political climate exists we have placed the marketing efforts for the advancement of FullCircle Prescription Services, Inc. on hold.  Our Corporate Information:  Our principal executive offices are located at 161 Alpine Drive, Shelbyville, Kentucky, 40065, and our telephone number is (502) 410-4500. Our current website address is www.fullcircleregistry.com. Our website and the information contained therein or connected thereto shall not be deemed to be incorporated into this report.  SEC Compliance and Regulations:  The requirements for regulatory compliance continue to be difficult. The HTML and the XBRL filing format are now both required by the SEC, which is expensive.  Competition:  Movie Theater Entertainment:  The motion picture exhibition industry is fragmented and highly competitive. Our theaters compete against regional and independent operators as well as the larger theatre circuit operators.  Our operations are subject to varying degrees of competition with respect to film licensing, attracting customers, and obtaining new theater sites. In those areas where real estate is readily available, there are few barriers preventing competing companies from opening theaters near our existing theater, which may have a material adverse effect on our revenues.
