Persons who respond to the collection of information contained in this form are not required to respond unless the form displays a currently valid OMB number.
* This undertaking does not affect any limits Section 102(a) of the National Securities Markets
        Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to
        require information. As a result, if the securities that are the subject of this Form D are "covered securities" for purposes 
        of NSMIA, whether in all instances or due to the nature of the offering that is the subject of this Form D, States cannot
        routinely require offering materials under this undertaking or otherwise and can require offering materials only to the
        extent NSMIA permits them to do so under NSMIA's preservation of their anti-fraud authority.

China Film Co. and China’s Pegasus Media Group have struck a deal to collaborate on a wide range of film and TV projects, including U.S.-Chinese co-productions. Part of their agreement entails the establishment of a $100 million U.S. China production fund.
The deal was inked by CFC general manager Jiang Ping and Pegasus’ Sun Jianjun (aka Jay Sun) at a signing ceremony in Los Angeles today (Nov. 1.) Hollywood executives in attendance included representatives from CAA and Netflix, and officials from the Chinese Consulate General.
The two companies describe the agreement as “strategic.” It spans development, investment, production, promotion and marketing of film and TV projects. Additionally, the two aim to establish a multimedia video production base, an online platform for Chinese films to be seen abroad, and the creation of a joint-venture company CFC Pegasus Film Integrated Marketing.







The fund will involve the two companies and Hong Kong-based private fund company Co-High Investment Management. The fund’s objective is to invest in the development of China-U.S. film projects, through purchase of IP and script rights, screenplay development and down payments for major cast members.
“The investment evaluation criteria of the China-US Film Co-production Project Development Fund are that the film co-production projects must first conform to China’s relevant national policies, the co-produced films can be released in cinemas in the US and worldwide and can also be distributed digitally,” Sun said. “The projects should, to the maximum extent, give considerations to cinema distribution, digital distribution and integrated operations in the Chinese market, ensuring their artistic quality, market value and ROI.”
Film projects expected to receive finance from the fund include: “Edge of the World,” “Super Nova,” “Super Brain,” “Instructions not Included,” “Butterfly Lovers,” and “Water Margin.”
“Edge of the World,” is written by Jacqueline Feather and David Seidler, and has Hawk Koch and Mark Gordon attached as producers. It tells the story of a foreign woman who travels inland from Shanghai and introduces pandas to the western world.
Other projects under consideration include: “General Stilwell,” “Lady White Snake,” “Forbidden City,” “The Last Empress” and “Angel’s List.”
Private-sector conglomerate, Pegasus claims a 23 year track record in Chinese entertainment. Its recent credits include the Leste Chen-directed Chinese remake of Korean comedy drama “Miss Granny.” State-owned, CFC is the leading distributor in China thanks to its role in releasing films imported under the revenue-sharing quota.

You have to giggle at least a bit:
““The investment evaluation criteria of the China-US Film Co-production Project Development Fund are that the film co-production projects must first conform to China’s relevant national policies […] the projects should, to the maximum extent, give considerations to cinema distribution, digital distribution and integrated operations in the Chinese market, ensuring their artistic quality, market value and ROI.”
Because if there’s one thing mainlanders are good at it’s dictating “artistic quality” and “market value” to Hollywood as if Hollywood wasn’t making movies when China was cooking up new schemes to keep its people miserable for most of the 20th century. 
And how do they expect to have ANY success with an “online platform” for Chinese films to be seen abroad when their own counterfeit culture has led to Chinese films being uploaded to YouTube — not toreents, mind you, but frickin’ YOUTUBE! — within days of theatrical release? Couple that with the rampant piracy of discs since nearly the dawn of that format and I’d be hard pressed to believe ANYBODY that believes Chinese films aren’t being watched abroad already and by larger numbers than any platform will draw this late in the game. At least Hong Kong cinema was able to gain traction in the west before it too became so easily pirated and sold illegally all over China and even the western diasporas. 
Still, I’m sure there are plenty of folks in Hollywood who’ll have no problem adhering to those “relevant national policies” if it means work.
Mind you, based on the titles, it’s obvious most of the films on their slate will be designed for the undemanding domestic theatrical audience while going DTV in the west. They should have Well Go USA on speed dial. :)
