NEW YORK, Oct. 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Avista Healthcare Public Acquisition Corp. (the "Company"), a blank check company formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, today announced the pricing of its initial public offering of 30,000,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit. The units will be listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market and trade under the ticker symbol "AHPAU" beginning October 11, 2016. Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share and one warrant to purchase one-half of one Class A common share.  Two warrants may be exercised for one whole Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share. Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the Class A ordinary shares and warrants are expected to be listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols "AHPA" and "AHPAW," respectively. 








Credit Suisse is serving as the sole book-running manager for the offering.  The Company has granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 4,500,000 units at the initial public offering price to cover over-allotments, if any. 
The offering is being made only by means of a prospectus. When available, copies of the prospectus may be obtained from Credit Suisse, Prospectus Department, One Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10010; Telephone: (800) 221-1037; email: newyork.prospectus@credit-suisse.com.

We are offering 30,000,000 units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit. We
estimate that the net proceeds of this offering together with the funds we will

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of loans 
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. As of 
    June 30, 2016, we had borrowed $175,000 under the promissory note with our 
    sponsor. Subsequent to June 30, 2016, our sponsor loaned us an additional 
    $125,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These 
    loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $2,000,000 
    of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering 
    expenses (other than underwriting commissions) and amounts not to be held
    in the trust account. In the event that offering expenses are less than as 
    set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing 
    working capital expenses. In the event that the offering expenses are more 
    than as set forth in this table, we may fund such excess with funds not held 
    in the trust account.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $10,500,000, which constitutes the underwriters'
    deferred commissions (or up to $12,075,000 if the underwriters'
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the
    underwriters from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining
    funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial
    business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including
    payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection
    with our initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other
    companies or for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to
    any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and
    commissions.

(4) Includes organizational and administrative expenses and may include amounts
    related to above-listed expenses in the event actual amounts exceed
    estimates.

(5) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business
    combination. In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The
    amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from
    the trust account. Based on current interest rates, we would expect
    approximately $60,000 to be available to us from interest earned on the
    funds held in the trust account over 12 months following the investment of
    such funds in specified U.S. Government Treasury bills beginning in January
    2017; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This
    estimate assumes an interest rate of 0.02% per annum based upon current
    yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested. In
    addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
    intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
    sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated
    to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
    combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the
    trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only
    out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial
    business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working
    capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no
    proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts.
    Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price
    of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be
    identical to the private placement warrants issued to our initial
    shareholders. The terms of such loans by our sponsor, affiliate of our
    sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors, if any, have not been
    determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We
    do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an
    affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing
    to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek
    access to funds in our trust account.

(6) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    initial business combination to fund a 'no shop" provision and commitment
    fees for financing.

The rules of the NASDAQ provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from
this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account. Of the
net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants,
$300,000,000 (or $345,000,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised in full), including $10,500,000 (or up to $12,075,000 if the
underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will, upon the consummation of this offering, be
placed in a non-interest bearing U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase
Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee.
Beginning in January 2017, the funds in the trust account will be invested only
in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the
Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. Based on current interest rates, we estimate that the interest
earned on the trust account will be approximately $60,000 per year, assuming an
interest rate of 0.02% per year, following the investment of such funds in
specified U.S. government treasury bills or in specified money market funds
beginning in January 2017. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the
principal or interest held in the trust account except for the withdrawal of
interest to pay taxes, if any, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of
the private placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until
the earliest of (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the
redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a
shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of
association to modify the substance and timing of our obligation to redeem 100%
of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the redemption of
all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject to
applicable law. Based on current interest rates, we do not expect that interest
earned on the trust account will be sufficient to pay taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay 
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial 
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using 
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust 
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs 
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the 
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in 
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due 
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective 
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or 
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will enter into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we 
will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office
space, administrative and support services. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to 
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of June 
30, 2016, we had borrowed $175,000 under the promissory note with our sponsor. 
Subsequent to June 30, 2016, our sponsor loaned us an additional $125,000 to be 
used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans are 
non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31, 2016 
or the closing of this offering. These loans will be repaid upon the closing of 
this offering out of the $2,000,000 of offering proceeds not held in the trust 
account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of $0.50 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants issued to our initial shareholders. The terms of such loans
by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from
parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not
believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver
against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination 
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors
or their affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated
transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion
of our initial business combination. The price per share paid in any such 
transaction may be different than the amount per share a public shareholder 
would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial 
business combination. However, such persons have no current commitments, plans 
or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms 
or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, 
they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any 
material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases 
are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently 
anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject 
to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction 
subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the 
purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are 
subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net 
tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be
less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC's "penny stock"
rules) and the agreement for our initial business combination may require as a
closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.
If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights so that we
cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or 
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business 
combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business 
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in 
connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum 
and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of our obligation 
to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business 
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the 
redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial 
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, 
subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder 
have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial shareholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant 
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our 
initial business combination. In addition, our initial shareholders, officers 
and directors have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions 
from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to 
complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. 
However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires
public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating 
distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we 
fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time
frame.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial
business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities
having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check
companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating
businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well
established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business
combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors
possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our
ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available
financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in
pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to
pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their
redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial
business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they
potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses.
Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in
successfully negotiating an initial business combination.


Company Description
We are a newly organized blank check company incorporated on December 4, 2015 as 
a Cayman Islands exempted company and formed for the purpose of effecting a 
merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or 
similar business combination with one or more businesses,


 which we refer to 
throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination. We have not 
identified any business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on 
our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with 
respect to identifying any business combination target.

Our founders are two of the founders and managing partners of Avista. Avista is 
a middle market private equity firm focused on control buyout and growth 
investments in the healthcare, communications and industrial sectors, with
offices in New York, Houston and London. Thompson Dean, our Executive Chairman,
and David Burgstahler, our President and Chief Executive Officer, were two of
the founders of Avista in 2005. Our founders have worked together for over
20 years. Over the past 10 years, Avista has raised four private equity funds
(Avista Capital Partners I, II, III and IV L.P.) and had approximately
$6 billion in assets under management as of June 30, 2016. We expect that Avista
will raise additional funds and / or successor funds in the future.

Our management team has significant experience sourcing, analyzing, acquiring 
and operating healthcare related businesses. Since inception, Avista funds have 
invested in 15 healthcare portfolio companies.

While we may acquire a target business in any industry or location, our initial 
focus will be to acquire and operate a North American or European 
healthcare-related business. AHPAC will target businesses in the healthcare
industry that it considers to have strong management teams, stable cash flows
and robust growth prospects. We believe that we derive significant benefit from
our management team and board members (the "AHPAC team") as well as our
affiliation with Avista. We believe that the AHPAC team brings a distinctive
blend of private equity investing experience, deal sourcing capabilities and
operating expertise. Our team has extensive experience not only identifying and
executing such acquisitions, but also running and operating the businesses post
transaction. In addition, the AHPAC team has significant experience working with
private companies to reshape their operations and help drive value creation. Not
all of such companies have achieved the same level of value creation.

We believe that the AHPAC team is well positioned to identify attractive 
acquisition candidates because of their extensive contacts and transaction
sources, including a broad list of industry executives, public board members,
private owners, wealthy families, private capital managers, private equity
funds, investment bankers and other transaction intermediaries. A central
component of our acquisition strategy is our management team's ability to
implement value creation initiatives designed to drive shareholder value as they
have done in the past for Avista portfolio companies, not all of which have
achieved the same level of shareholder value. The AHPAC team blends financial
sophistication, operating perspective and business management skills to execute
on these initiatives.

We are a Cayman Islands exempted company formed on December 4, 2015. Our
executive offices are located at 65 East 55th St., 18th Floor, New York,
NY 10022 and our telephone number is 212-593-6900.

Condensed Financial Statements 

 

Note 1—Organization
and Plan of Business Operations

Organization
and General

 

Avista
Healthcare Public Acquisition Corp. (the “ Company
”) is a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a
Cayman Islands exempted company on December 4, 2015. The
Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share
exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or
similar business combination with one or more businesses (a “
Business Combination ”). The Company intends to focus
its search for a target business in the healthcare industry,
although it may seek to complete a Business Combination with an
operating company in any industry or sector. The Company is an
“emerging growth company,” as defined in
Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the “ Securities Act ”), as modified by the
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “ JOBS
Act ”).  The Company’s sponsor is Avista
Acquisition Corp. (the “ Sponsor ”), a Cayman
Islands exempted company, which was incorporated on
December 4, 2015.

 

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had not commenced any
operations.  All activity for the period from December 4,
2015 (inception) through September 30, 2016 relates to the
Company’s formation and its initial public offering of
30,000,000 units (the “ Units”) at $10.00 per
Unit, each consisting of one of the Company’s Class A
ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share (the “
Class A Shares”), and one warrant (the “
Warrants”) to purchase one-half of one Class A
Share (the “ Public Offering ”).  The
Company also granted the Underwriters (as defined below) of the
Public Offering a 45-day option to purchase up to 4,500,000
additional Units to cover over-allotments (the “
Over-allotment Option ”).  The Class A
Shares sold as part of the Units in the Public Offering are
sometimes referred to herein as the “public
shares.”  The Company will not generate any operating
revenues until after completion of a Business Combination, at the
earliest.

 

The
registration statement for the Company’s Public Offering was
declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “ SEC ”) on October 7, 2016.  The
Public Offering closed on October 14, 2016 (the “
Close Date ”).  The Sponsor and certain other
accredited investors (the “ Initial
Shareholders”) purchased an aggregate of 16,000,000
warrants (the “ Private Placement Warrants ”) at
a purchase price of $0.50 per warrant, or $8,000,000 in the
aggregate, in a private placement at the Close Date (the “
Private Placement ”).  The Initial Shareholders
have agreed to purchase up to an additional 1,800,000 Private
Placement Warrants at $0.50 per warrant, or $900,000 in the
aggregate, in the event the Over-allotment Option is exercised in
full.

 

The
Company intends to finance a Business Combination with net proceeds
from its $300,000,000 Public Offering and $8,000,000 Private
Placement (see Note 3).  As of the Close Date, after paying
underwriting discounts of $6,000,000 and funds designated for
operational use of $2,000,000, the remaining net proceeds of
$300,000,000 were deposited in a trust account with Continental
Stock Transfer and Trust Company acting as trustee (the “
Trust Account ”) as described below.  As of
November 17, 2016, the Over-allotment Option had not been
exercised.  An amount equal to the gross proceeds from any
exercise of the Over-allotment Option will be deposited into the
Trust Account.

 

The Trust
Account

 

Prior to
January 2017, funds held in the Trust Account will not be
invested and will be held in a non-interest bearing account. 
Beginning in January 2017, the funds in the Trust Account will
be invested in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of
180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the “ Investment Company Act
”), which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations, until the earlier of (i) the consummation of the
Business Combination, (ii) the Company’s failure to
consummate a Business Combination within the prescribed time or
(iii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in
connection with a shareholder vote to amend the amended and
restated memorandum and articles of association to modify the
substance and timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem
100% of the public shares if the Company does not complete a
Business Combination within the prescribed time. Placing funds in
the Trust Account may not protect those funds from third-party
claims against the Company. Although the Company will seek to have
all vendors, service providers (other than its independent
auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities it
engages execute agreements with the Company waiving any claim of
any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account, there is no
guarantee that such persons will execute such agreements. The
Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company under
certain circumstances if and to the extent any claims by such
persons reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account below a
specified threshold. The Company has not independently verified
whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity
obligations and believes that the Sponsor’s only assets are
securities of the Company. Therefore, the Sponsor may not be able
to satisfy those obligations should they arise. The remaining net
proceeds (not held in the Trust Account) may be used to pay for
business, legal and accounting due diligence on prospective
acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses as
well as any taxes.  The amount in the Trust Account at the
Close Date is $10.00 per public share ($300,000,000 held in the
Trust Account divided by 30,000,000 public shares).

Business
Combination

 

The
Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the
specific application of the net proceeds of the Public Offering and
the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially
all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward
consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the
Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination.
The Company will provide the holders of the public shares (the
“ Public Shareholders ”) with the opportunity to
redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion
of the Business Combination, either (i) in connection with a
shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or
(ii) by means of a tender offer, in either case at a per-share
price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on
deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the
consummation of the Business Combination, including interest (which
interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of
then outstanding public shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the Company seeks shareholder approval of the Business Combination
and the Company does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender
offer rules, a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of
such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is
acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in
Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the “ Exchange Act ”)), will be
restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an
aggregate of 15% of the public shares. In connection with any
shareholder vote required to approve any Business Combination, the
Initial Shareholders have agreed (i) to vote any of their
respective Ordinary Shares (as defined below) in favor of the
initial Business Combination and (ii) not to redeem any of
their Ordinary Shares in connection therewith.

 

The NASDAQ
rules require that the Business Combination must be with one
or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair
market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the Trust
Account (less any Deferred Commissions (as defined below) and taxes
payable on interest earned) at the time of the Company signing a
definitive agreement in connection with the Business
Combination.

 

If the
Company has not completed a Business Combination by
October 14, 2018, the Company will (i) cease all
operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as
promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days
thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable
in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust
Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes
payable, and less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution
expenses) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares,
which redemption will completely extinguish the rights of the
Public Shareholders as Shareholders (including the right to receive
further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable
law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following
such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s
remaining shareholders and its Board of Directors, dissolve and
liquidate, subject in each case to the Company’s obligations
under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the
requirements of other applicable law. In the event of a
liquidation, the Public Shareholders will be entitled to receive a
full pro rata interest in the Trust Account (initially anticipated
to be approximately $10.00 per share, plus any pro rata interest
earned on the Trust Fund not previously released to the Company and
less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses). There
will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with
respect to the Founder Shares (as defined below) or the Private
Placement Warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company
fails to complete a Business Combination within the 24-month time
period.

 

Note 2—Significant
Accounting Policies

 

Basis of
Presentation

 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been
prepared in U.S dollars in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“
US GAAP ”) for interim financial information and
in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and
Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the SEC.  Certain
information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP have been condensed
or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC
for interim financial reporting.  Accordingly, they do not
include all of the information and footnotes necessary for a
comprehensive presentation of the financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.  In the opinion of management, the
accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements include all
adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, which are
necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position,
operating results and cash flows for the periods
presented.

 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the Company’s final prospectus as
filed with the SEC on October 10, 2016 and declared effective
on October 7, 2016, as well as the Company’s form 8-K,
as filed with the SEC on October 20, 2016. Operating results
for the three and  nine months ended September 30, 2016
are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected
for the year ending December 31, 2016 or any other future
period.

 

Loss Per
Share

 

Loss per
share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average
number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the period, excluding
shares subject to forfeiture (Note 5).  The Company had no
dilutive securities outstanding during the period from
December 4, 2015 (inception) through December 31, 2015 or
for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016.

Notes to
Condensed Financial Statements

 

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

 

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair
value.

 

Use of
Estimates

 

The
preparation of the Company’s condensed financial statements
in conformity with US GAAP requires the Company’s
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed
financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during
the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

 

Income
Taxes

 

The
Company accounts for income taxes under FASB ASC 740, 
Income Taxes (“ ASC 740 ”).
ASC 740 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and
liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the
financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for
the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax
credit carry forwards. ASC 740 additionally requires a valuation
allowance to be established when it is more likely than not that
all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be
realized.

 

ASC 740
also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in an enterprise’s condensed financial statements
and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for
financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits
to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be
sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company
recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized
tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax
benefits as of September 30, 2016 or December 31,
2015.  The Company is currently not aware of any issues under
review that could result in significant payments, accruals or
material deviation from its position.

 

There is
currently no taxation imposed on income by the Government of the
Cayman Islands.

 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

 

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective,
accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material
effect on the accompanying financial statements.

 

Emerging
Growth Company

 

Section 102(b)(1) of
the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required
to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until
private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities
Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a
class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required
to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards.
The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the
extended transition period and comply with the requirements that
apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt
out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such
extended transition period which means that when a standard is
issued or revised and it has different application dates for public
or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company,
can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies
adopt the new or revised standard.

 

Concentration
of Credit Risk

 

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist of cash accounts in a financial institution,
which at times, may exceed the Federal depository insurance
coverage of $250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on
these accounts and management believes the Company is not exposed
to significant risks on such accounts.

 

Subsequent
Events

 

Management
of the Company evaluates events that have occurred through the date
the financial statements were issued.  Based upon the review,
management did not identify any recognized or non-recognized
subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure
in the financial statements.

Financial
Instruments

 

The fair
value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify
as financial instruments under FASB ASC 820, Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures , approximates the carrying
amounts represented in the balance sheet.

 

Deferred
Offering Costs

 

The
Company complies with the requirements of ASC 340-10-S99-1 and SEC
Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A; “Expenses of
Offering”.  Deferred offering costs at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 of $650,046 and
$290,209, respectively, primarily consist of accounting and legal
services, securities registration expenses and exchange listing
fees.  These offering costs, along with underwriting
discounts, were charged to shareholders’ equity at the Close
Date.

 

Note 3—Public
Offering

 

In the
Public Offering, consummated on October 14, 2016, the Company
issued and sold 30,000,000 Units at a price of $10.00 per
Unit.  The Company also granted the Underwriters the 45-day
Over-allotment Option to purchase up to 4,500,000 additional
Units.  As of the Close Date, the Over-allotment Option had
not been exercised.  Each Unit consists of one Class A
Share and one Warrant to purchase one-half of one Class A
Share. Two Warrants must be exercised for one whole Class A
Share at a price of $11.50 per share. The Warrants will become
exercisable on the later of 30 days after completion of the
Business Combination or 12 months after the Close Date and
will expire five years from the completion of the Business
Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Company
may redeem the Warrants at a price of $0.01 per Warrant upon
30 days’ notice, only in the event that the last sale
price of the Class A Shares is at least $24.00 per share (as
adjusted for share splits, share dividends, rights issuances,
subdivisions, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for
any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the
third trading day prior to the date on which notice of redemption
is given. The Company will not redeem the Warrants unless a
registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
Class A Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants is
effective and a current prospectus relating to those shares is
available throughout the 30 day redemption period, unless the
Warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis and such cashless
exercise is exempt from registration under the Securities Act. If
the Company redeems the Warrants as described above, management
will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise
their Warrants to do so on a cashless basis, provided an exemption
from registration is available. No Warrants will be exercisable for
cash unless the Company has an effective registration statement
covering the Class A Shares issuable upon exercise of the
Warrants and a current prospectus relating to such shares. If the
shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants are not registered
under the Securities Act, holders will be permitted to exercise
their Warrants on a cashless basis. However, no Warrant will be
exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and the Company will
not be obligated to issue any Class A Shares to holders
seeking to exercise their Warrants, unless the issuance of the
Class A Shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified
under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or
an exemption is available.

 

Note 4—Commitments

 

Underwriting
Agreement

 

The
Company entered into an agreement with the underwriters (the
“ Underwriters ”) of the Public Offering
(“ Underwriting Agreement ”) that required the
Company to pay an underwriting discount of 2.0% of the gross
proceeds of the Public Offering to the Underwriters at the Close
Date of the Public Offering. The Company will pay the Underwriters
a deferred underwriting discount of 3.5% of the gross proceeds of
the Public Offering (“ Deferred Commissions ”)
at the time of the closing of the Business Combination. The
Deferred Commission was placed in the Trust Account at the Close
Date and will only be payable to the Underwriters if the Business
Combination is consummated.

 

Registration
Rights

 

Holders of
the Founder Shares, the Private Placement Warrants, warrants that
may be issued on conversion of working capital loans (and any
Class A Shares issuable upon exercise of such warrants and
upon conversion of the Founder Shares) are entitled to registration
rights with respect to such securities (in the case of the Founder
Shares, only after conversion to Class A Shares) pursuant to
an agreement signed on the effective date of the Public Offering.
The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three
demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register
such securities for resale. In addition, the holders have certain
“piggy-back” registration rights with respect to
registration statements filed subsequent to the Business
Combination. However, the registration rights agreement will
provide that the Company will not permit any registration statement
to become effective until termination of applicable lock-up periods
with respect to such securities.

Note 5—Related
Party Transactions

 

Related
Party Loans

 

The
Company issued to the Sponsor on December 14, 2015, as amended
and restated on September 1, 2016, an unsecured promissory
note pursuant to which the Company was permitted to borrow up to
$300,000 in aggregate principal amount. Between inception and the
Close Date, the Company borrowed $300,000.  This note was
non-interest bearing and was repaid in full to the Sponsor at the
Close Date.

 

The
Sponsor may make a working capital loan to the Company and up to
$1,500,000 of such loan may be converted into warrants, at the
price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the Sponsor. Such
warrants would be identical to the Private Placement
Warrants.

 

Administrative
Services Agreement

 

The
Company presently occupies office space provided by an affiliate of
the Sponsor.  The affiliate has agreed that, until the Company
consummates a Business Combination, it will make such office space,
as well as certain support services, available to the Company, as
may be required by the Company from time to time. The Company will
pay the affiliate an aggregate of $10,000 per month for such office
space and support services.

 

Private
Placement Warrants

 

The
Initial Shareholders purchased 16,000,000 Private Placement
Warrants at $0.50 per warrant (for an aggregate purchase price of
$8.0 million) from the Company in a Private Placement on the
Close Date. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private
Placement Warrants were placed into the Trust Account. The Initial
Shareholders have also agreed that if the Over-allotment Option is
exercised by the Underwriters in full or in part, they will
purchase an additional number of Private Placement Warrants at a
price of $0.50 per warrant (up to a maximum of 1,800,000 Private
Placement Warrants) necessary to maintain in the Trust Account an
amount equal to $10.00 per Unit sold in the Public Offering.
