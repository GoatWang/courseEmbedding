Delta Lloyd To Be Delisted From Euronext Amsterdam and Euronext Brussels Prior To Completion Of Legal Merger With NN Group
Apr 21 17
NN Group and Delta Lloyd jointly announced that during the Post Closing Acceptance Period, which expired today 21 April 2017 at 17:40 hours CET, 61,025,175 Shares were tendered for acceptance at an Offer Price of EUR 5.40 (cum dividend) in cash per Share (the ‘Offer Price’), representing approximately 13.4% of all Shares and an aggregate value of approximately EUR 330 million. Together with the 364,044,985 Shares that were already held by the Offeror following settlement of the Shares tendered during the Offer Period, NN Group will (indirectly) hold 425,070,160 Shares, representing approximately (i) 93.3% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares in the capital of Delta Lloyd, (ii) 91.3% of the aggregate number of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares and preference shares A in the capital of Delta Lloyd, and (iii) 90.2% of the aggregate number of the issued ordinary shares and preference shares A (i.e. including shares held by Delta Lloyd in its own share capital) in the capital of Delta Lloyd. As the Offeror will hold 93.3% of the Shares following settlement of the Shares tendered during the Post Closing Acceptance Period, NN Group is entitled to pursue a triangular legal merger of Delta Lloyd into the Offeror, whereby remaining holders of Shares will receive listed ordinary shares in the capital of NN Group (‘NN Group Shares’) (the ‘Legal Merger’).

History[edit]
The earliest predecessor of Delta Lloyd, the Hollandsche Societeit van Levensverzekeringen, was founded in 1807. In 1967 it merged with the Amsterdamsche Maatschappij van Levensverzekeringen and was renamed Delta. And in 1969 Delta merged with NedLloyd (not to be confused with the shipping company of the same name). In 1973 all shares in Delta were bought by the British firm Commercial Union (now Aviva).
In 1999 Delta Lloyd merged with OHRA. The company was renamed Delta Lloyd Group in 2002.
In 2016 Delta Lloyd was acquired by NN Group.
Initial public offering[edit]
The Delta Lloyd Group officially went public on the NYSE Euronext Amsterdam on 3 November 2009.[4] Delta Lloyd made 38–42% of its shares public, with its major shareholder Aviva reducing its ownership from 92% to 50–54%. Delta Lloyd's other previous shareholder, Nuts OHRA, retained its 8% stake.
In July 2012 and January 2013, Aviva sold its part, making the group 95% publicly traded.
Delta Lloyd Nederland[edit]
Delta Lloyd[edit]
Delta Lloyd forms the core of the Delta Lloyd Group. It offers saving accounts, insurance and financial planning.
OHRA[edit]
OHRA was formed in 1925 and was known as Onderlinge ziektekostenverzekeringsfonds van Hoogere RijksAmbtenaren (Mutual health insurance for senior civil servants).
ABN AMRO Verzekeringen[edit]
ABN AMRO Verzekeringen is a joint venture between ABN AMRO and Delta Lloyd, giving Delta Lloyd the exclusive right to sell insurance through ABN AMRO offices. It had a revenue of €900 million in 2006. For Delta Lloyd this joint venture represents a vital means of selling insurances.
Delta Lloyd Health Insurance[edit]
Delta Lloyd was only a small player in the health insurance market with 700,000 customers. Originally, Delta Lloyd tried to merge its health insurance division with Agis and Menzis, but the deal fell through, thus necessitating Delta Lloyd to sell its health insurance division to CZ groep, effective January 1, 2008.
Delta Lloyd Bank[edit]
Delta Lloyd also offers limited banking products, such as savings accounts and mortgages.
Delta Lloyd Belgium and Germany[edit]

History[edit]
The earliest predecessor of Delta Lloyd, the Hollandsche Societeit van Levensverzekeringen, was founded in 1807. In 1967 it merged with the Amsterdamsche Maatschappij van Levensverzekeringen and was renamed Delta. And in 1969 Delta merged with NedLloyd (not to be confused with the shipping company of the same name). In 1973 all shares in Delta were bought by the British firm Commercial Union (now Aviva).
In 1999 Delta Lloyd merged with OHRA. The company was renamed Delta Lloyd Group in 2002.
In 2016 Delta Lloyd was acquired by NN Group.
Initial public offering[edit]
The Delta Lloyd Group officially went public on the NYSE Euronext Amsterdam on 3 November 2009.[4] Delta Lloyd made 38–42% of its shares public, with its major shareholder Aviva reducing its ownership from 92% to 50–54%. Delta Lloyd's other previous shareholder, Nuts OHRA, retained its 8% stake.
In July 2012 and January 2013, Aviva sold its part, making the group 95% publicly traded.
Delta Lloyd Nederland[edit]
Delta Lloyd[edit]
Delta Lloyd forms the core of the Delta Lloyd Group. It offers saving accounts, insurance and financial planning.
OHRA[edit]
OHRA was formed in 1925 and was known as Onderlinge ziektekostenverzekeringsfonds van Hoogere RijksAmbtenaren (Mutual health insurance for senior civil servants).
ABN AMRO Verzekeringen[edit]
ABN AMRO Verzekeringen is a joint venture between ABN AMRO and Delta Lloyd, giving Delta Lloyd the exclusive right to sell insurance through ABN AMRO offices. It had a revenue of €900 million in 2006. For Delta Lloyd this joint venture represents a vital means of selling insurances.
Delta Lloyd Health Insurance[edit]
Delta Lloyd was only a small player in the health insurance market with 700,000 customers. Originally, Delta Lloyd tried to merge its health insurance division with Agis and Menzis, but the deal fell through, thus necessitating Delta Lloyd to sell its health insurance division to CZ groep, effective January 1, 2008.
Delta Lloyd Bank[edit]
Delta Lloyd also offers limited banking products, such as savings accounts and mortgages.
Delta Lloyd Belgium and Germany[edit]




Office building in Brussels


Delta Lloyd is also active in Belgium and Germany. In Belgium the company offers life insurance and collective insurance. In Germany Delta Lloyd stopped signing new contracts in 2010.

Our  client solutions










Solutions
                        Investment solutions are designed around constraints of institutional clients. The solutions aim to meet risk-adjusted return objectives by using matching and return portfolios with a strong risk-monitoring framework. These include, for example, the capital requirements for insurers under Solvency II or the new Dutch Financial Assessment Framework (nFTK) for pension funds, as well as fiscal restrictions.  Investment solutions aim at decreasing regulatory capital usage.
                    






Mandates
                        DLAM leverages its experience of servicing internal clients (insurance, pension and banking products) by using this expertise in providing tailor-made solutions for external clients.  We provide tailor-made investment solutions for all Delta Lloyd insurance entities in the Netherlands and Belgium. Above all, we are a proactive service provider for risk controlled investment solutions for international institutional investors.
                    






Funds
                        We offer specialised investment funds for fixed income, equities and multi asset. Our first fund was established in 1960. In the years after we have proven to be a mid sized investment fund providor in the Netherlands. We specialize in building pro active expertise for our customers. We provide funds to retail investors through banks and to institutional investors for their specific portfolios. We are well known for our fixed income and small-cap investing.

Corporate Social Responsibility








Excellent solutions that also contribute directly to a sustainable future
This is what Delta Lloyd Asset Management is determined to offer its customers – at no additional cost.Both Delta Lloyd and our customers agree: it’s more important than ever to invest assets in a way that contributes to a sustainable future. Of course our investment funds have always adhered to a 100% responsible investment policy. Delta Lloyd is now seeking to implement even stricter criteria, specifically from a sustainability point of view. While responsible investing is all about exclusion, we are now increasingly focussed on making a positive impact; for example, by contributing to the shift towards renewable energy. Our main focus is on investing in companies who are leading the way towards sustainability. At the same time, we believe that sustainability does not have to come at a higher price or pose greater risks. Sustainability should not be the exception – it should be the standard. That’s exactly what our customers expect too.
