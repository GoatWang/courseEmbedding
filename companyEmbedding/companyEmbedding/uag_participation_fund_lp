  About Forex




WHAT AM I DOING WHEN I TRADE FOREX?



Forex, also known as foreign exchange or FX,
	    is the simultaneous buying of one currency while selling another.
	    The forex market is available 24 hours a day, five days a week and it’s one of the largest,
		most liquid financial markets in the world. Just to compare, the New York Stock Exchange
		makes about $169 billion a day in volume and the Forex Market makes over $5 trillion a day in volume.





How does Forex trading work?



Forex is traded in currency pairs.
							Common currency pairs are the Euro/US Dollar, US Dollar/Japanese Yen,
							Great British Pound/US Dollar, and US Dollar/Canadian Dollar.
							You buy one currency and automatically sell another.





What are the trading hours for the Forex market?



The Forex market is open 24 hours a day. It opens on Sunday at 10:00 pm GMT, and closes on Friday at 10:00 pm
                            GMT:Sydney opensat 10:00 pm to 7:00 am GMTTokyo opens at 12:00 am to 9:00 am GMTLondon opens
                            at 8:00 am to 5:00 pm GMTNew York opens at 1:00 pm to 10:00 pm GMT.





Is Forex trading expensive?



It depends on the leverage and capital invested. You can have a starting
							capital of as low as $50, or as high you want.
							However, it is important to remember that increasing leverage increases risk;
							but ultimately depends on the investor’s appetite for risk.





Where is the central of the Forex market?



Forex trading is not centralized on an exchange, as with the stock and futures markets.
							The Forex market is considered an Over-the-Counter (OTC)or ‘Interbank’ market,
							due to the fact that transactions are conducted between two counterparts over
							the telephone or via an electronic network.





Who are the participant in the Forex market?



The Forex market is called an ‘Interbank’ market due to the fact that
							historically it has been dominated by banks,
							including Central Banks, commercial banks, and investment banks. However,
							the percentage of other market participants is rapidly growing and now the list includes
							large
							multinational corporations, global money managers, registered dealers,
							international money brokers, futures and options traders, and individual investors.





How are currency prices determined?



There are various ways currency prices can change.
							Economic and political conditions usually affect the value of a currency,
							along with interest rates and inflation.





How do I profit from trading Forex?



The sum of your profit depends on the efficiency of your tradingstrategy,
							on how well you will learn to predict the alteration in rates tendency and a little on
							the amount of your deposit which allows you to sustain unfavorable situations during market movements.





What tools do I need to trade Forex?



You only need a computer with internet connection and a free demo
							account or a funded live account with MTrading to start.
							However, you should be equipped with proper Forex education and tools to minimize risks
							in the Forex market.

                Uruguay: UAG waits for valuation rebound before IPO
            

By: 

                    Rob Dwyer
                
Published on: 

                    Wednesday, April 02, 2014
                



                    Suppressed valuations of companies in stock indices across Latin American are keeping IPO candidates at bay and the prospects for fresh issuances are remote, according to equity bankers.

One such candidate, Union Agriculture Group, still hopes to list internationally following its recent acquisition of El Tejar, which made the company the leading agriculture producer and landowner in Uruguay. However, Juan Satori, UAGs executive chairman, says prospective valuations from any IPO at the moment are lower than the multiples on offer to the company through private sources. "We can get higher valuations through alternative sources than we can get through an IPO," says Satori, who had mandated Credit Suisse and JPMorgan to lead an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in 2013. "We are still in touch with [those banks], but we are not sure if we will change the syndicate [when UAG re-mandates the IPO]," he says.UAG bought 100% of El Tejar, which owned about half of the 67,000 hectares of farmland it operated, bringing the total area of farmland operated by UAG to 172,000 hectares. David Creighton, president and CEO at Cordiant Capital, which had previously loaned El Tejar $11.3 million for land acquisitions, says that El Tejar decided to sell to its larger competitor after failing to buy as much farmland as it hoped to, as land valuations soar. The rising value of agricultural land is problematic throughout the region, says Creighton: "Everyone was putting money into agricultural land and then New York hedge funds began to get involved and there was a bit of a bubble going on." He notes, though, that there are different valuation issues at play across Latin America, with Brazil opening new land, but with valuations restricted through high infrastructure costs. UAGs Satori says that half of the companys returns are currently generated through appreciation of land values, although that is expected to lower to one-third in coming years as the rate of appreciation slows in Uruguay and the economies of scale of the enlarged farming operations are monetized. "We now have half a billion dollars deployed in our operations," he says. He adds that the company doesnt expect to buy any more farmland in Uruguay or to expand outside the country. However, he expects the attractiveness of Uruguays agricultural sector to assuage any concentration fears that potential IPO investors might have. "Not many countries with quality agricultural land allow open foreign participation in the sector," he says. "Uruguay also has attractive tax, regulation and, very importantly, political risk  just look at what is going on in Ukraine."Meanwhile, despite Creightons belief that land valuations are in bubble territory, the company is committed to the industry and has diversified investments to include farming of commodities as well as investments in biofuels, phosphates and agricultural infrastructure. The company also part-invested in a $100 million fund for Fiagril Participações, which will finance the purchase of seeds and fertilizers to sell to farmsin the farming heartland state of Mato Grosso. Creighton says that private financiers such as Cordiant have a big opportunity to operate in these types of agricultural sub-sectors, where the traditional banks are currently not able or willing to participate despite attractive potential returns.
