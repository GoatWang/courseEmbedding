STR Holdings, Inc. Reports First Quarter 2015 Results






GlobeNewswire



May 12, 2015 8:30 AM EDT













 


















































  Operations Update   The Company has substantially completed the renovation of its Enfield, Connecticut facility including its research and development laboratory. In addition, the Company's newly opened Suzhou facility has achieved ISO 9001 certification.  The Company continues to retrofit its existing production equipment to produce low-shrink paperless encapsulants and has attained a product mix of approximately 65% paperless in the first quarter of 2015. The Company expects to continue to increase its product mix to the paperless configuration during 2015.  Balance Sheet and Liquidity  The Company finished the quarter with $13.3 million of cash and no debt. As of March 31, 2015, the Company also had $8.3 million of income tax receivables.  The Company generated negative operating cash flow of $1.7 million during the first quarter of 2015. With Zhenfa's assistance, the Company is currently exploring working capital financing to support expected sales volume growth.  "During the first quarter we were able to improve our adjusted EBITDA burn," stated Joseph C. Radziewicz, STR's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. "Ex-restructuring, we were also close to achieving break-even gross profit. We are implementing additional cost-reduction actions in the second quarter that we believe will further improve our financial results going forward."    First Quarter Conference Call and Presentation  The Company will discuss its financial results in a conference call today at 9:00 am ET. A live webcast of the conference call and presentation will be available through the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at www.strsolar.com. Investors in the U.S. interested in participating in the live call should dial (877) 312-8789 and enter passcode: 24375197. Those calling from outside the U.S. should dial (970) 315-0282 and use the same passcode. A telephone replay will be available at 12:00 p.m. ET through Wednesday, May 20, 2015 by dialing (855) 859-2056 from the U.S., or (404) 537-3406 from international locations, and entering passcode: 24375197. The webcast and presentation will be archived on the Company's website for one year.  About STR Holdings, Inc.   STR Holdings, Inc. is a provider of encapsulants to the photovoltaic module industry. Further information about STR Holdings, Inc. can be obtained via the Company's website at www.strsolar.com.    Forward-Looking Statements  This press release contains forward‑looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. These forward‑looking statements present the Company's current expectations and projections relating to its financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business and are based on assumptions that it has made in light of the Company's industry experience and perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors management believes are appropriate under the circumstances. However, these forward‑looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or financial or operating results. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the statements regarding the following: (1) incurring substantial losses for the foreseeable future and the Company's inability to achieve or sustain profitability in the future; (2) the potential impact of pursuing strategic alternatives, including dissolution and liquidation of our Company; (3) our reliance on a single product line; (4) our securing sales to new customers, growing sales to existing key customers and increasing our market share, particularly in China; (5) customer concentration in our business and our relationships with and dependence on key customers; (6) the outsourcing arrangements and reliance on third parties for the manufacture of a portion of our encapsulants; (7) technological changes in the solar energy industry or our failure to develop and introduce or integrate new technologies could render our encapsulants uncompetitive or obsolete; (8) competition; (9) excess capacity in the solar supply chain; (10) demand for solar energy in general and solar modules in particular; (11) our operations and assets in China being subject to significant political and economic uncertainties; (12) limited legal recourse under the laws of China if disputes arise; (13) our ability to adequately protect our intellectual property, particularly during the outsource manufacturing of our products in China; (14) our lack of credit facility and our inability to obtain credit; (15) a significant reduction or elimination of government subsidies and economic incentives or a change in government policies that promote the use of solar energy, particularly in China and the United States; (16) volatility in commodity costs; (17) our customers' financial profile causing additional credit risk on our accounts receivable; (18) our dependence on a limited number of third‑party suppliers for raw materials for our encapsulants and other significant materials used in our process; (19) potential product performance matters and product liability; (20) our substantial international operations and shift of business focus to emerging markets; (21) the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on financial results, and the geographic distribution of revenues; (22) losses of financial incentives from government bodies in certain foreign jurisdictions; (23) compliance with the Continued Listing Criteria of the NYSE; (24) the ability to realize synergies from the transaction with Zhenfa Energy Group Co., Ltd., and (25) the other risks and uncertainties described under "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and in subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. You are urged to carefully review and consider the disclosure found in our filings which are available on http://www.sec.gov or http://www.strsolar.com. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those projected in these forward‑looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward‑looking statement contained in this press release whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.               STR Holdings, Inc.

Company History
 
1944 - DeBell and Richardson, Inc. was founded in 1944 when two of the world's most prominent polymer scientists, John DeBell and Henry Richardson, started the first dedicated plastics research and development firm in the United States. Located in the Hazardville section of Enfield, Connecticut, the company rapidly gained a reputation for innovation of engineered compounds and technical service for the growing plastics industry.  DeBell and Richardson, Inc. created and patented dozens of plastics commonly in use today.
 
1972 - In 1972, then President Robert C. Springborn purchased DeBell & Richardson. Inc. and broadened the scope of the company to include testing, analysis and quality assurance. The areas of expertise for these endeavors were chemicals and plastics, electrical / electronics and consumer merchandise. The new expanded company, Springborn Laboratories, became a leader in the quality assurance and consumer products testing market while continuing to provide expert plastics research and development services to a variety of internationally known clients.
 
1975 - In 1975, Springborn Laboratories' vast knowledge base in polymeric materials was called upon to create the company's most important innovation - the development of encapsulants for terrestrial photovoltaic modules. The original PV encapsulant development program, having a duration of more than a decade, evaluated hundreds of polymeric materials and modifier combinations, and included years of advanced weathering studies.  The outcome of the program was clear: modified ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA), represented the very best combination of performance and cost, easily besting other materials including silicones, urethanes, acrylics, PVB's, ionomers, etc.
 
1979 - In 1979 Springborn Laboratories began marketing EVA for the photovoltaic module industry under the trade name PhotoCap®.
 
1980 - In the early 1980's, the demand for its PhotoCap® EVA became so strong that the company, then known as Springborn Testing and Research (STR), decided to make a significant commitment to the expansion of its pilot manufacturing operation, investing in production-scale equipment and infrastructure.  As a result of the knowledge base acquired through the development of the material in its own laboratories and testing facilities, STR found its ability to provide technical service to solar start-ups as much in demand as its encapsulant products.
 
1990 - In the early 1990's, STR (with an updated name: Specialized Technology Resources, Inc.) increased capacity once again and continued its refinement of EVA-based PV encapsulants, launching products with unsurpassed long term photo-thermal stability, faster curing capability, and dimensional stability.
 
2000 - During the early 2000's, STR polymer scientists were busy developing still more advanced formulations and product configurations, including ultra fast curing encapsulants and multilayer products such as EVA/backsheet and EVA/cover film.
 
2002 - In 2002, STR formed the Spanish company Specialized Technology Resources España, S.A., (STRE) in Asturias, Spain, to better serve its growing customer base in Europe. In June of 2004, STRE officially commenced production, and began planning the addition of its second production line just two months later.
 
2005 - STR acquired Conplex, Inc. in St. Augustine, Florida in January of 2005, subsequently converting the company to a dedicated PV encapsulant manufacturing operation and renaming it Specialized Technology Resources Florida, Inc.
 
2006 - In 2006, STR completed the addition of its second production line at STRE and began preparations for a third line there by purchasing the neighboring property, commencing a building expansion to double the size of the facility, and ordering its largest and most advanced production line to date.
 
2007 - In 2007 STR launched its fourth factory in Somers, Connecticut, USA. This factory is dedicated to the production of multilayer constructions for emerging PV applications.  The Somers facility is the present day location of STR's US based solar division.
 
2009 - In 2009, STR launched its fifth factory, Specialized Technology Resources (Malaysia) SDN. BHD. in Gelang Patah, Johor, Malaysia with the idea of better serving the growing Asian PV market.
 
2010 - November 2010 - STR announced that it closed on its previously announced acquisition of land and a 275,000 square foot building located in East Windsor, Connecticut. STR will relocate the majority of its US manufacturing to the new location. In addition, the facility will house U.S.-based product management and sales teams, as well as a new 20,000 square foot research and development laboratory. The facility acquisition enables STR to complete the planned expansion of its Connecticut manufacturing capacity to approximately 3.0 GW in 2011.
 
2014 - October 2014 - STR launches its newest factory, STR Solar (Suzhou) Company Limited located in Shajiabang, Suzhou, China.
 
2014 - November 2014 - STR relocates its world headquarters and research and development laboratory back to its original facility located at 10 Water Street in Enfield, Connecticut, USA.
 
2014 - December 2014 - STR enters into strategic relationship with Zhenfa Energy Group Co., Ltd., a leading developer of solar PV power stations based in Chongqing, China.
