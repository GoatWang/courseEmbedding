        #4-Fantastic!!
I have been using Hawaiian Tropics for YEARS!! I use the #4 "daily" and the Accelerator Lotion when walking and in the back yard tanning. I have been looking for the #4 this year and have only been able to get 4 bottles. NO ONE seems to have it in stock!! Have you stopped it????

        Worst sunscreen I've ever used
This sunscreen is not good. After I used the SPF 30 I had gotten literally the worst sunburn in my life. I could not believe it my back has been peeling for days. The worst part is the places I applied the most sunscreen are the places that got burned the worst. My entire back peeled. Literally my entire back it looked as if someone poorer acid on my back. It's just crasy because I had a base tan and I'm half Mexican. My girlfriend had terrible burns on the back of her leg. See picture of the peeling. All I have to say is this sunscreen did nothing to help with sun protection.

        All Time Favorite!
I am in love with this tanning lotion! Not only does it have everyone's All Time Favorite beachy coconut smell but it also gives an amazing bronze glowing tan! I like this because it's not sticky, not oily, and helps to moisturize the skin with its Aloe Vera. Other then that it lasts all day on me! I can go in the ocean and receive the same benefit coming out that I did going in! Great smell, gorgeous tan, moisturizing, and an Spf, I love this lotion:-)

        Best one they make
I use this everyday and LOVE the way it smells. For whatever reason, the higher SPFs have a different fragrance. This makes me feel like I'm in Hawaii everyday.. It's moisturizing too.

        Great product!
I love Hawaiian tropics and the fact that it's light nongreasy and gives you a really nice tan while protecting from harmful UV rays.

        Surprisingly good
I bought this stuff a few weeks ago, and I was shocked how well it worked. Got a great tan without having to deal with the greasy/ oily feeling of other products. Definitely recommend using this to anyone.
