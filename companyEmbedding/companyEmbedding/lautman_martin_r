 Advances in Consumer Research Volume 8, 1981       Pages 434-436 LINEAR EFFECTS IN COGNITIVE RESPONSE TO ADVERTISING Larry Percy, Creamer Inc. Martin R. Lautman, Associates for Research in Behavior, Inc.   [The authors would like to thank Ms. Carol Farquhar, Northwestern  University, for her assistance in designing and analyzing this study.] ABSTRACT -  This paper presents the results of an exploration of linear effects in cognitive  response on cognitive structure. Specifically, elicited cognitive response to advertising  stimuli were related to beliefs and purchase intent associated with the advertised  product. A strong linear relationship was found between supportive arguing responses and  related cognitive structure measures. INTRODUCTION Interest in the joint cognitive response-cognitive structure model for studying the  impact of persuasive communication has grown since its early presentation by Lutz and  Swasy (1977). A number of studies have been reported which attempt to link the number of  cognitive responses to a communication stimulus (usually in the form of advertising) with  a corresponding effect upon elements of cognitive structure. Olson, Toy, and Dover (1978),  for example, studying, specifically, five levels of price information, demonstrated a  strong relationship between the number of counterarguments and support arguments as  related to the amount of information contained in several advertisements. Wilson and  Muderrisoglu (1979, 1980) have utilized much the same procedure, applying the model to an  analysis of comparative advertising. In each case, strong support for the notion of the  number of cognitive responses elicited from an advertising communication stimuli mediating  cognitive structure was shown. All of this research, however, has been concerned with the total or average number of  cognitive responses elicited by the communication stimuli. Accepting the basic hypothesis  that there is a relationship on the macro level between the number of cognitive responses  and the effect upon cognitive structure measures, it is the purpose of this paper to  explore beyond the total effect and consider the functional relationship between different  magnitudes of cognitive response upon cognitive structure. More specifically, what will be  explored is whether respondents exhibiting greater cognitive activity, operationally  defined as offering a greater number of cognitive responses, also exhibit a corresponding  change in cognitive structure. METHODOLOGY Selection of Experimental Stimuli and Respondents The methodology was designed to test the theory of individual intensity in cognitive  response by utilizing both specific communication test stimuli as well as the general  experience of respondents. The specific experimental stimuli used consisted of two  television commercials for a well-known brand of frozen food, with a high positive image.  Each commercial featured a variety of products: one with several people featured; one only  a couple. In addition, one group of respondents was not exposed to a commercial and was  asked only to think shout advertising for the product with which they were familiar. To ensure a realistic response, subjects were carefully screened to be certain only  those people who belong to the product's target market, and who had experience with the  product category, were included. A total of 300 respondents were interviewed (female  household heads, 18+, with family incomes over $15,000), 100 in each of three widely  distributed geographical markets. One-third of the respondents in each market received  each of the treatment conditions. Respondents in each city were randomly assigned to treatment cells. Those assigned to  the first two cells were exposed to one of two television commercials. Each respondent was  exposed independently, and asked to watch the commercial very carefully, leaning  everything from it that they felt the advertiser wanted them to know. Next, following the  general procedure advanced by Greenwald (1968) and discussed by others (cf. Calder, Insko,  and Yandell 1974; Wright 1973 and 1974), respondents were asked to relate all of their  thoughts while viewing the commercial. Respondents in the third cell were not shown any  specific advertising; rather, they were asked for all of the things that come to mind when  thinking of looking at or reading advertisements for the product. In all treatment cells  thoughts were elicited and recorded one at a time. After all thoughts were recorded, a series of questions were asked relating to selected  cognitive structure measures. Each respondent was asked how likely she .would be to buy  the product advertised, measured over a five-point Likert type scale; then how strongly  she felt the product reflected specific beliefs associated with the advertising, using a  seven point balanced attitude scale. Analytic Plan Initially, each of the cognitive responses elicited from a respondent were classified  in the manner suggested by Wright (1973). Supportive arguments were classified as those  thoughts, beyond a simple copy-point playback, which evidenced a favorable reaction to the  product, its use, or the belief messages communicated. Counterarguments were those  thoughts that were generally directed against the product or its use, and those that  refuted message claims. In addition to these critical responses, three other categories  were recorded: positive and negative ad-related thoughts which addressed only the  executional elements, and neutral statements. Then, rather than averaging the total number  of responses elicited for each classification, those respondents offering only one thought  within a classification, two thoughts, etc. were grouped. In this way it is possible to  preserve the frequency of individual cognitive responses by type of response. Each of these distributions was compared over the three treatment cells. It was  hypothesized that there should be no significant difference in the general distribution of  cognitive response between cells, at least for the important supportive and  counterarguments, since the two commercial stimuli used had been pretested and both  communicated the same general message beliefs; and, importantly, these were the same  message beliefs generally communicated through the advertising for this brand over the  last several years (a campaign which included one of the two commercial tested here). As a  result, those respondents not directly stimulated by a specific commercial should  nonetheless have exhibited the same, or at least similar general cognitive structures, to  those exposed to the commercials. Incidence of responses were then compared with cognitive structure measures of belief  and intention to buy in order to establish whether a linear relationship might mediate  cognitive structure. RESULTS Table 1 shows the mean number of cognitive responses offered by classification for each  treatment cell studied. The high number of supportive arguments vs. other types of  cognitive responses is, no doubt, a function of the existing highly positive image of the  product. TABLE 1 SUMMARY OF MEAN NUMBER OF COGNITIVE RESPONSES ELICITED It is generally accepted (cf. Slash, Toy, and Dover 1978) that positive and negative  ad-related responses, as well as neutral responses, do not mediate cognitive structure.  For this reason, along with the fact that very few respondents provided positive or  negative ad-related responses, only supportive arguments and counterarguments will be  analyzed. Furthermore, because of the very low total number of counterarguments elicited,  and the fact that 34 of the 41 respondents offering a counterargument gave only one, the  statistical analysis will further be restricted to only the supportive arguments. The distribution of supportive arguments between treatment cells is shown in Table 2.  Little difference in either the overall distribution or average number of arguments  elicited appears to be in evidence. A chi-square analysis of the distribution indicated no  significant difference between the distributions (X2 = 4.90, d.f. = 8, p >  .05). TABLE 2 DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPORTIVE ARGUMENTS These results would suggest that there is no significant difference in the general  difference in the general distribution of cognitive responses (or at least, in this case,  supportive arguments) among treatment cells. Therefore, the subsequent analysis permits us  to look at total response over cells where appropriate. Belief measures for six constructs reflected in the advertising for this product were  measured via a seven point attitude differential scale. Mean beliefs averaged over the six  constructs for respondents offering one through five or more supportive argents are shown  in Table 3. The one inversion, between three and four supportive arguments was primarily  the result of one belief construct--the only one showing low overall belief. TABLE 3 MEAN BELIEF BY INCIDENCE OF SUPPORTIVE ARGUMENTS A 3 x 5 ANOVA of this attitudinal data (see Table 4) indicated only Support Arguments  to be statistically significant--this the result of a significantly increasing linear  trend as shown in Table 3. As the number of support arguments offered by a respondent  increased so did his positive attitudinal evaluation of the product. TABLE 4 ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE FOR ATTITUDINAL DATA Finally, the intention to purchase also appears to be strongly mediated by the number  of support arguments offered by a subject. Intention did increase linearly, as shown in  Table 5. TABLE 5 INTENTION TO PURCHASE An ANOVA of this data indicated that there was a significant difference of this  particular measure between treatment cells, this was occasioned by a mean purchase intent  of 3.84 in Cell 1 (those who saw one of the commercials) vs. 4.04 and 4.06 (among those  seeing the second commercial and those seeing no commercial, respectively). One commercial  was less effective than either the other commercial or the control in generating purchase  interest. However, there was no interaction between this difference and the number of  support arguments elicited; and, there was a significant linear trend in support  arguments, as indicated in Table 6. As the number of support arguments offered by an  individual respondent increased so did her interest in buying the product. TABLE 6 ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE FOR PURCHASE INTEREST DISCUSSION The results here indicate that there is a strong reason to suspect a linear effect  mediating the relationship between cognitive response and cognitive structure. Overall  belief increased with the number of support arguments offered, as did intention to  purchase. Because of the high positive image nature of the product involved, one is  tempted to believe these results are even more significant. Since both belief and interest  are already high, to stimulate even greater interest as a function of advertising based  cognitive response is surprising. Unfortunately, owing to that same high positive image,  linear effects among counterarguments could not be tested because of sample size  limitations. However, the trends, at least for purchase intent, suggested the predicted  linear functional relationship. That is, more counterarguments resulted in lover purchase  interest. It is reasonable to predict that a similar linear relationship might be observed for  products with less positive images. Here, however, one is equally likely to suspect that  the quality of support arguments, not only their existence and frequency, might be of  significance. The elicitation measure used in this study differs considerably from that commonly  employed in pretesting and on-air testing of advertising. Most typically, tabulations are  obtained of the percentage of respondents recalling various messages. Occasionally,  responses are tabulated by type of response (ad-related, sales point related, etc.).  Rarely, if ever, is a coding scheme employing cognitive response categories used. Yet, the  data presented here strongly suggest that the mean number of responses within cognitive  response categories (a "recall-type" measure) may be a significant correlate of  a motivational construct -- purchase interest. Whether these responses must be precursors  of shifts in purchase interest, however, remains a critical question. The findings of this study suggest that segmentation of groups by number of responses  might reveal if there is a critical number of support arguments correlated with  purchase interest; and/or, if any specific arguments or combinations of support arguments  are integral to promoting purchase interest, given that the critical number of responses  have been elicited. Additional commercial tests (with larger samples) would be necessary  to explore these questions. REFERENCES Calder, Bobby J., Insko, Chester A., and Yandell, Ben.

Cognitive and Affective Responses in Attribute-Based Versus End-Benefit  Oriented Advertising



Martin R. Lautman, ARBOR, Inc.Larry Percy, CREAMER, Inc.

ABSTRACT -     The question of cognitive and affective responses in attribute-based  versus end-benefit oriented advertising is explored. The two types of advertising are  shown to differ both in motivating purchase intent and, more fundamentally, in the type of  underlying response mechanisms generated. Product users and non-users predisposed toward  purchase are shown to be reacting primarily to the cognitive aspects of the advertising;  nonusers not predisposed toward purchase were shown to be reacting primarily to the  affective elements of the campaigns. The results were interpreted in terms of low  involvement theory.

The two types of advertising are  shown to differ both in motivating purchase intent and, more fundamentally, in the type of  underlying response mechanisms generated. Product users and non-users predisposed toward  purchase are shown to be reacting primarily to the cognitive aspects of the advertising;  nonusers not predisposed toward purchase were shown to be reacting primarily to the  affective elements of the campaigns. The results were interpreted in terms of low  involvement theory. For many people and for many products, the commercial is the product.  People structure their expectations on the basis of the commercial copy and visual images  and evaluate product performance against these expectations. The commercial may be the  consumer's only link between product expectations and their basic needs and preferences. Two types of commercial tactics address this linkage in very different  ways. In one, the product feature/ characteristic/ attribute approach, a specific  product-based attribute is highlighted. For example, an advertised product may be  described as convenient, nutritional, reliable or expensive. In the second approach, a  consumer end-benefit is highlighted and, for example, the advertised product may be  described as "keeping you slim," whelping your dog to live longer," or  preserving your memories (film)." Which of these two types of tactics will be more effective? Specifically,  in the case of a low calorie food product is it more advantageous to advertise that the  product will "taste good" or that the product will "help YOU look  beautiful?" A more fundamental issue related to this question is the nature of the  executional format used in these two different approaches. While there is no creative  mandate, in many product categories attribute-based advertising has tended to be of the  factual type involving "cognitive-type" thinking (Learn-Feel-Do) and executional  formats with the product as "hero". End-benefit advertising has tended to be  more image and mood oriented (Feel-Learn-Do) and to emphasize affective responses with the  consumer's reaction the focus. For example, Kodak's commercials have been described by  their agency as not intending to offer rational reasons for buying film, under the  assumption that emotion and not rationality motivates a consumer's purchase of film. Thus,  which of these two executional formats would be most effective, "mind-directed"  or "stomach-oriented," is a key concern in developing and implementing  advertising strategy consistent with a brand's strategic framework. PRIOR RESEARCH ON AFFECT IN ADVERTISING Given this distinction between affective and cognitive oriented  advertising formats, the question of appropriate measures to evaluate the difference  arises. A review of the literature yields a surprising lack of either empirical research  or theoretical approaches to this subject. The most similar research thrust seems to be  the literature on attitude toward the ad (Aad) versus attitude toward the brand (Ab).  Here, the assumption is explored that affective attitudes toward the advertising itself  and not just toward the product may have an impact upon product purchase. This idea has  stimulated a great deal of recent consumer research interest. After all, should not  someone respond more favorably to a message that is more favorably received than one less  favorably received? In fact, advertising researchers have drawn from a large body of research  in the psychology literature that would seemingly support this idea. For example, Bower  and his colleagues (Bower, 1981; Bower, Monteiro, and Gilligan, 1978) have studied the  relationship between memory and a person's mood during learning tasks. In the earlier  study, it was reported that emotional moot served as a distinctive learning-and-recall  context primarily when the subject had to keep separate several interfering sets of  material. Would this be a reasonable description of advertising in a clutter environment?  Perhaps, but the involvement required in their experiments seems quite beyond what one  might expect when presented with most advertising communications. Bower's 1981 study proposed an associative network theory where emotion  serves as a memory unit that can enter into associations with coincident events. But, here  again something must trigger the emotion unit. Should we expect this to occur in the  consumer's mind at the point-of-purchase, or when otherwise confronted with a brand  stimulus? Srull (1983) has attempted to deal with this question of mood and its  relationship to affective reactions to advertising. His preliminary findings suggest that  initial evaluations are strongly influenced by subjective mood states at the time of  information acquisition. Importantly, however, he also notes that there were significant  interactions between mood state at the time of retrieval and the type of information  provided. We would offer that this could also tend to mediate relationships between types  of message and the impact of affective reactions to the source of that message: that is,  the attitude toward the advertising. The seemingly common sense notion that one's reaction to an advertisement  will be generalized to the subject of the advertising has been appealing to many  advertising researchers as well as practitioners (Bartos, 1980; Light, 1980) despite zany  well-known examples to the contrary; among them, the consumer-hated 'White Tornado  campaign for Ajax, and "ring around the collar" campaign for Wisk. The explanation for the success of these "contrary" campaigns  has been attributed to another body of communication theory -- cue discounting -- where  the receiver was felt to simply forget or disassociate the source of the information from  the information itself. However, an alternative hypothesis has been offered by Silk and  Vavra (1974). They have suggested that, contrary to a straight linear relationship, a  J-shaped relationship exists between positive reaction to an advertisement and its  effectiveness; and, that the most effective advertising will be that which is either liked  very much or disliked very much. This could account for the effectiveness of disliked  advertising, while still maintaining a mediating role for attitudes toward the ad. Moore  and Hutchinson (1983), also found a similar 3-shaped response function after one week, but  noted that immediate response tended to be more linear. Most of the attempts to relate attitude toward the advertising and  attitude toward the advertised brand seem to be following information processing theory  lines. Lutz, MacKenzie, and Belch (1983), for example, have taken such a view in reporting  a study aimed at uncovering the possible causal mediating role of affective reactions to  advertising. While finding a significant mediating role for attitudes toward advertising,  they seem less certain as to why, offering several possible explanations (among them the  idea of "mood"). Shimp (1981) also postulated a mediating role for attitude toward the ad,  proposing that it is linearly related to attitudes toward the advertised brand, such that  the more positive a receiver's reactions are to specific advertising, the more positive  will be his reactions to the advertised product. Some of the most ambitious empirical work to date on this question comes  from Mitchell and his associates (Edell, 1982; Gardner, 1981; Mitchell, 1980, 1982a,  1982b, 1983; Mitchell and Olson, 1981). The Mitchell and Olson (1981) study looked at the  effect of manipulating the content of advertising. An analysis of brand attitude  (following Fishbein's expectancy-value formulation) suggested that something other than  the observed beliefs about the brand mediated the effect exposure to advertising had upon  brand attitude. Factor analysis of the scales used uncovered a clear evaluative dimension  in the measures used; and this, along with the brand attitude results from the  expectancy-value model, reliably accounted for the observed difference in brand attitude.  Mitchell and Olson concluded from these findings that attitudes toward an advertisement  could mediate the effects of emotional and visual advertising in the formation of brand  attitude. A methodological problem with the Mitchell and Olson study, however,  mitigates its generality. They used a latin square design for stimulus presentation such  that each respondent saw all four advertisements. Thus, consumer reactions to the ads seen  earlier in this study probably influenced later reactions. Specifically, seeing the verbal  claim of softness may have sensitized respondents to it in other ads, and in particular,  the ad portraying a kitten. Mitchell and Olson, apparently aware of this potential  confounding problem, had two other groups of respondents provide cognitive response  protocols immediately after exposure to each of the ads. They showed that, "When the  verbal claim preceded the kitten advertisement, about as many subJects mentioned softness  in their protocols for the kitten advertisement as when the kitten advertisement preceded  the verbal claim." They concluded that ... the kitten picture independently connoted  the semantic concept of softness." While this may be true, the effects on consumer  beliefs relative to softness, the focus of the analysis, remains undetermined. It is  reasonable to suspect that their findings were the result of contrast effects on beliefs;  that is, exposure to all of the advertisements had a strong and significant effect on  consumer beliefs relative to the softness of the alternative products. Mitchell (1980) has suggested that attitude toward the brand and attitude  toward the advertisement, way, in fact, represent two different channels in the  information acquisition process attitude toward the brand a verbal reaction to the product  and attitude toward the advertisement a process that generates a node in memory that  attaches to the memory trace of the advertising. Building upon this idea, he now suggests  (1983) that attitudes toward the ad mediate visual and emotional effects, and may  represent primarily a nonverbal channel. Ray and Batra (Batra and Ray, 1982; Ray and Batra, 1983) have addressed  the question of affect by combining information processing theory with the concept of  involvement (Krugman, 1965). They suggest that high and low involvement advertising  initiate different types of affective response. In the case of high involvement, affect is  the result of extensive cognitive activity; in the case of low involvement advertising,  affect is coupled with awareness (Zajonc's (1968) "mere exposure effects") since  few cognitive responses, if any, are created. All of these prior studies have tended to avoid directly manipulating the  type of advertising tactic being employed and, therefore, identifying the underlying  response mechanisms which might apply with different executional formats. Yet there is a  strong possibility that the type of execution will significantly influence both cognitive  and affective evaluations of the brand as well as the advertising itself. For example,  does the execution itself have specific influence over and above the beliefs associated  with the product as a result of the advertising? Furthermore, no attempt has been made as  of yet to simultaneously investigate alternative advertising tactics along with  differences in receiver response as might be present in users and non-users of the  product. Thus, the primary purpose of this study will be to explore the underlying  affective and cognitive mechanisms involved in end-benefit oriented versus product  attribute-based advertising. As a rationale for current practice, it would seem that in  end-benefit type advertising, affective reactions would have a greater impact in  motivating purchase while in product attribute-based advertising, cognitive reactions  would have the greater role. A secondary purpose of this study will be to explore the  effects of these alternative advertising tactics on different consumer segments. Analytic Plan The analysis will be conducted in two phases. First, we will identify  which campaigns did best and worst by usage segment and by diet behavior. In our second  phase, we will probe the cognitive and affective response mechanisms underlying the  performance of the different campaigns. This will be done by developing a series or scales  to quantity different underlying response mechanisms and then applying those scales to  explain the differential responses to the various campaigns by different product usage  segments. METHOD Study Design Four finished 30-second commercials for a recently introduced a food  product with lower than the typical number of calories were created. The product has been  positioned as an appetizing product for weight conscious women. The four commercials  varied in their content ranging on a continuum from what was judged to be attribute-based  to end-benefit oriented in their promotional content. Specifically, the commercials can be  described as follows.   1. Commercial A. Significant emphasis on product appearance and attributes      with eight close-up product beauty shots, and no presenter. 2. Commercial B. Some emphasis on product appearance and attributes with      three close-up product beauty shots and formal female presenter. 3. Commercial C. Minimal product emphasis with some emphasis on benefit to      the consumer with four close-ups of eyes and mouth of actress and three product beauty      shots. 4. Commercial D. Significant emphasis on appearance of consumer with five      close-ups of beautiful body of actress, two involving an admiring male, and three product      beauty shots.   In addition to the commercials, print ads which mirrored the commercial  copy were created. Five print ads were generated since it was of interest whether  Commercial C might be more effective with an end-benefit oriented print ad campaign or an  attribute - based print campaign, both of which were present to some degree in the  commercial. Thus, two ads, compatible with the commercial content, were created as  companion print ads. These campaigns were identified as the product attribute-based print  ad (C-PA) and the end-benefit oriented print ad (C-EB). Each of the five campaigns was  evaluated monadically. Subjects Respondents were intercepted and interviewed in central location test  facilities in five cities. An equal number of respondents were assigned to each of the  five treatment groups in each city. A total of 500 respondents were interviewed, 100 in  each of the five treatment cells. Along with standard security questions, respondents were screened for  being female heads of households between the ages of 18 to 65 who had used products in  that category in the past month. Quotas were set so that no more than 20% of the  respondents were between the ages of 45 to 65 and one-half of the respondents in each cell  had bought the test product in the past and were positively disposed towards buying it  again. Procedure After screening, respondents were given a pre-exposure constant sum  question and asked to identify the brand(s) of products in the category an,l quantity of  each they will buy in their next 10 purchases (packages). They were then shown a test  commercial, told to watch it carefully, and, after exposure, asked to rate it on an  adjective checklist. Following this they were shown the print ad and asked to read it  carefully. This was followed by a five point purchase intent scale,   "Based only on both the commercial and print ad you just saw how      likely would you be to buy (test brand)?"   an interest question,   "After having seen this advertising campaign, would you say that your      interest in buying (test brand) has increased, decreased, or remained the same?'   a post-exposure constant sue, and questions about new information learned,  consistency of the advertising campaign with personal experience, perceptions of any major  advantages of the advertised brand, and belief in overall superiority of the test brand  over competition. Additional substantive questions followed these, but since they are not  relevant to our discussion they will not be presented here. Along with standard  demographic questions, respondents were asked if they were currently on a diet or watching  their weight. RESULTS Treatment Cell Respondent Homogeneity Tests Two chi-square tests were conducted to insure that the treatment cells for  the five campaigns did not differ on the key demographic factors of age or diet behavior.  A chi-square test of Age x Campaign was observed to be non-statistically significant (X2 =  17.43, d.f. = 16, p > .05). Similarly, a chi-square test of Diet Behavior (on a diet,  watching weight, not on a diet) x Campaign was not statistically significant (X2 = 9.09,  d.f. = 8, p > .05). In order to test whether the five treatment cells were equivalent in terms  of pre-experimental usage of the test product, a Campaign x Diet Behavior x (test) Product  Usage (user, non-user) three way ANOVA was conducted with the dependent variable the  pre-exposure number of test packages intending to purchase. Other than the expected main  effect for Product Usage (p < .001) with users reporting significantly greater purchase  interest than non-users, no other main effects or interactions were statistically  significant. While the mean scores for the Diet Behavior cells were in the expected  direction (on a diet > watching weight > not on a diet), a significant main effect  for Diet Behavior was observed only when the Product Usage variable was deleted from the  analYsis. Campaign Performance A series of six three-way .,NOVAs  were conducted with the independent variables Product Usage, Diet Behavior and Campaign  and the dependent variables new information learned, consistency with personal experience,  major advantage citations for the advertised product, belief in the overall superiority of  the advertised product, purchase intent and the difference in post and pre  "purchases" in the constant sum question. All post-hoc tests were conducted  using the Tukey HSD procedure. The purpose of these tests were to determine if the five  campaigns varied in their ability to generate different responses relating to information  acquisition, perceptions of personal experiences and motivation (major advantage  citations, overall superiority belief, and intended purchases) among the different market  segments. Learn New Information. Statistically significant main effects were  observed for Product Usage (p < 001) and Campaign (p < .001). More information was  learned by non-users than by users (p < .05) and by respondents in the two most extreme  product attribute-based campaigns, A and B than in the two most end-benefit oriented  campaigns, C-EB and D (p < .05). The intermediate product attribute-based campaign,  C-PA, also scored significantly higher than its complementary end-benefit oriented  campaign, C-EB (p < .05). Consistency with Personal Experience. A statistically Significant main  effect for product usage (p < .001) and a product usage by campaign interaction (p <  .02) were observed. The source of the interaction was that while on an overall basis users  reported significantly greater consistency than non-users (p < .05), users found  campaign A consistent with their experience and nonusers found it inconsistent with their  experience at levels far greater than any other campaign; and, in campaign C-EB, users and  non-users did not differ at statistically significant levels. Major Advantage. Statistically significant main effects were observed for  Product usage (p< .001) and for Campaign (p < .05). significantly more users than  non-users cited major advantages for the test product (p < .01). With respect to the  campaigns, more major advantages were cited in the most product attribute-based Campaign A  than in either of the two most end-benefit oriented campaigns, C-EB and D. Overall Superiority. Statistically significant main effects were observed  for product usage (p < .001). Diet behavior (p < .05) and, (marginally) for Campaign  (p < .06). Users rated the test brand higher in overall superiority, and those on a  diet rated it significantly better than respondents either watching their weight or not  dieting (p < .05). As in the case of major advantage citation, the product  attribute-based campaign A, out performed either of the two most end-benefit oriented  campaigns, C-EB and D (p < .05). Purchase Intent. All three variables had statistically significant main  effects. Predictably, users were significantly higher in purchase intent than non-users (p  < .001) and respondents on a diet or watching their weight had significantly higher  purchase intent than non-dieters (p < .05). Higher purchase interest was observed for  all three product attribute-based campaigns, A, B and C-PA than for the two end-benefit  oriented campaigns, C-EB, and D (p < .05). Pre-Post Constant Sum. As is often the case with Constant Sum measures  because of "ceiling effects" with users, significantly more intended purchases  were stated by non-users than by users (p < .002). A statistically significant campaign  main effect (p < .03) was the result of the two most extreme product attribute-based  campaigns, A and B, having significantly greater shifts in intended purchases than the two  most extreme end-benefit oriented campaigns (p < .05). A (marginally) statistically  significant Product Usage by Diet Behavior interaction (p < .06) was the result of  non-dieters showing no statistically significant difference between users and non-users (p  > .05) while among those respondents watching their weight, non-users showed a  significantly greater shift than users (p < .05). In fact, respondents who were  watching their weight and were test brand users allowed a significantly smaller shift than  any non-user segment (p < .05). Scale Development While it has just been demonstrated that the product attribute-based  campaign clearly outperformed the end-benefit oriented campaigns and that diet behavior  significantly affected consumer reactions to all of the campaigns, the different  ,mechanisms which might be underlying consumer response to the four commercials has yet to  be identified. As such, one way ANOVAs were conducted on all 22 adjectives of the  adjective checklist. In each case, the independent variable was the four commercials and  the dependent variable was purchase intent. Fifteen (15) adjectives were selected as  showing discrimination among the four commercials (p < .10). A principle components  factor analysis with a varimax rotation of these adjectives was conducted. Three factors  were identified, using as a criterion an eigenvalue cutoff of 1.0 or higher. Inclusion of  a fourth factor did not seem defensible on either statistical (there was a sharp dropoff  between three and four factors in variance accounted for) or logical grounds. Table 1  shows the three factors. Each factor was considered a scale and a reliability analysis  indicated alpha levels of .82, .78 and .76 for the three scales, respectively. TABLE 1 DERIVED RESPONSE SCALES The three scales seemed to reflect three types of response structures -  affective positive, cognitive negative and cognitive positive. It remains to be determined  how the commercials differed in terms of these response mechanisms. Our prediction is that  the product attribute-based campaigns would significantly outperform the end-benefit  oriented campaigns on the cognitive positive measure with the reverse true for the  cognitive negative and affective positive measures. Campaign Differentiation in Terms of Response Mechanisms Three ANOVA's were conducted. In each, one of the three response scales  was the dependent variable and the independent variables were, as before, Product Usage,  Diet Behavior and Campaign. In the three way ANOVA on the affective positive scale, the only  statistically significant effect was the main effect for Campaign (p < .01). The  strongest end-benefit oriented Campaign D was rated higher than the product  attribute-based Campaign B (p< .05). Although not quite statistically significant, as  would be predicted, Campaign D also was rated higher than Campaign In the ANOVA on the cognitive negative scale, there were two statistically  significant effects, the main effects for Product Usage, where non-users had more  cognitive negative responses than users (p < .01), and for Campaign. In the case of the  latter effect, Campaign D had significantly more cognitive negative ratings than Campaigns  A or B. Campaign C, it might be noted, was positioned right where predicted, between D and  Campaigns A and B. The ANOVA on the cognitive positive scale produced two statistically  significant effects, a Product Usage main effect and a Campaign main effect, and one  marginally significant main effect for Diet Behavior. Users were observed to rate the  commercials higher than non-users (p < .01) and the most product oriented Campaign A  produced more positive associations than the most end-benefit oriented Campaign D (p <  .01). It might be noted once again that the intermediate Campaigns, B and C, fell in the  predicted order; that is B had the most cognitive positive associations after A. Regression Modeling of Advertising Response Up until now we have demonstrated that the campaigns had different impacts  upon the target market and that these effects seemed to relate to the underlying cognitive  and affective responses to the advertising stimuli. We now turn to the questions of 1)  whether these cognitive and affective responses make an independent contribution to the  overall purchase motivation over and above that accounted for by "background"  variables (age, income, product usage and diet behavior), and 2) whether the nature of the  mechanisms underlying these responses differ bs usage category Table 2 shows the results of a series of multiple regression models. These  models are tied together by a conceptual framework which suggests that cognitive responses  are more important in determining purchase interest to current product users and the most  susceptible non-users while affective responses are of primary importance to "hard  core" non-users. Models I and II are based on the total sample. Model II includes  Model I and demonstrates that inclusion of the affective and cognitive responses greatly  increases the amount of variance accounted for by the models. An F test showed that Model  II is a significant improvement over the strictly background Model I (F = 56.59, d.f. =  3,373, p < .001). It might be also noted that in terms of magnitude, each of the beta  weights for the two cognitive measures accounts for more than four times the explained  variance than does the affective measure. TABLE 2 MULTIPLE REGRESSION MODELS OF PURCHASE INTENT The high beta value for the number of pre-packages and our prior ANOVA  results suggested to us that users and non-users might be responding differentially to the  different campaigns. A Chow test (see Appendix A) clearly demonstrated this to be true (F  = 6.71, d.f. = 7,374, p < .001). The user and non-user models are shown as models III  and IV, respectively. Interestingly, only cognitive response levels were statistically  significant among users while both cognitive and affective responses were statistically  significant among non-users. In fact, for non-users, the beta weights for both cognitive  response and the affective response levels were now about equal, suggesting that all three  contribute about equally in motivating purchase intent. One further segmentation of the data is of interest, although sample size  limitations prevent conducting conclusive tests. We divided the non-user sample (Base =  199) on the basis of their diet behavior. One group was defined as  "susceptibles" (Base = 135) and included respondents categorized as on a diet or  watching their weight. The second group was defined as "non-susceptibles" (Base  = 64) on the basis of their not being on a diet or watching their weight. Models V  (Susceptibles) and VI (Non-Susceptibles) suggest that the underlying response mechanisms  of these two groups differ. Susceptibles seem to be motivated by cognitive response  mechanisms while non-susceptibles are motivated by the affective mechanisms. Figure 1  summarizes these effects. FIGURE 1 SUMMARY OF RESPONSE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING PURCHASE INTENT Lastly, additional multiple regression analyses, not reported here tue to  space limitations, incorporated a dummy variable in order to determine the impact of the  print ad and any of the other non-response mechanism based "background" variance  in the different cells. The underlying cognitive and affective response scales were found  to maintain their statistical significance even with this additional  "background" variable. CONCLUSIONS Our results showed that the attribute-based campaigns outperformed the  end-benefit oriented campaigns and that diet behavior predisposed the respondents towards  more positive reactions to all of the campaigns. Pursuing our interest in the process  underlying these findings, we developed a series of scales which showed that the campaigns  did, in fact, vary on the hypothesized cognitive and affective dimensions. The better  performing product attribute-based campaign commercials scored higher on the cognitive  positive dimension and the lower scoring end-benefit commercials scored higher on the  cognitive negative and affective positive dimensions. Our final analysis explored the nature of the relationship between these  underlying response dimensions and purchase interest. It was shown that these cognitive  and affective reactions contributed toward purchase interest in the test product over and  above the effects attributable to demographic, current product usage, and predispositional  (diet behavior) variables. Furthermore, it was found that users and non-users differed in  the relationship of their cognitive and affective responses to purchase interest.  Non-users relied more zn affective reactions. A further segmentation of the non-user group  identified two subgroups which differed in their responses: (1) a "susceptibles"  non-user subgroup, those with a positive predisposition toward product purchase as  evidenced by their engaging in some form of diet behavior who showed significant  relationships with purchase interest only for cognitive responses; and (2) a  "non-susceptibles" non-user subgroup who showed significant relationships with  purchase interest only for affective responses. Two conclusions seem to be suggested by these findings. First, advertising  campaign tactics can be differentiated along underlying consumer response dimensions and  these can be expected to include both cognitive and affective reactions to the advertising  itself. Second, cognitive responses, as defined in Table 1, appear to be more important in  motivating current product users or :hose non-users predisposed to usage while affective  responses are more important among the least predisposed non-users. It is tempting to  describe this differentia:ion as suggesting that rational arguments are needed to persuade  those respondents predisposed toward purchase while affective reactions are needed to  motivate those lot predisposed. If non-usage (but responsiveness to the advertising message) is viewed as  low (product) involvement, then the results of this study are consistent with that body of  literature. Low involvement is theorized to result in few cognitive responses and  unchanged attitudes. It is perceived as creating advertising awareness and pre-cognitive  affect. Here, however, awareness was con:rolled in the sense of the advertising being  presented in a forced exposure format; and, even in this environment, cognitive responses  were minimized. Thus, affective responses may be more important in low involvement  advertising, independent of "mere exposure" driven awareness. High involvement  is theorized as generating significant cognitive activity, corresponding to the responses  observed here among users and those predisposed toward Purchase. It was found that the product attribute-based campaign outperformed the  end-benefit oriented campaign. This may have been the result of high consumer familiarity  with the end benefit of the tested product. With a new product, one where product  attributes are not often advertised or a different product class/category, the end-benefit  oriented approach might prove to be superior. In any case, the confounding effects of  end-benefit campaigns tending to be affect oriented and product-based attribute campaigns  tending to rely on cognitive mechanisms would require separation in future studies in  order to provide a clear understanding of what "works best" in any given  situation.
