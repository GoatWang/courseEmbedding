ABSTRACT -     The current research examines some of the variables typically measured by  organizational buying behavior researchers (e.g., attribute importance, number of  potential vendors) and shows how one information processing variable, experience, relates  to these measured variables. While all outcomes were not statistically significant, the  results tend to support the enrichment hypothesis frequently examined by consumer behavior  researchers. The more experienced buyer tended to have a larger evoked set, have a larger  number of vendors in the final consideration set, possess a larger number of selection  criteria, and better discriminate among potential suppliers.

 Advances in Consumer Research Volume 14, 1987       Pages 387-391 THE ROLE OF PRIOR PRODUCT EXPERIENCE IN ORGANIZATIONAL BUYING BEHAVIOR Vicky L. Crittenden, Harvard University Carol A. Scott, UCLA Rowland T. Moriarty, Harvard University ABSTRACT -  The current research examines some of the variables typically measured by  organizational buying behavior researchers (e.g., attribute importance, number of  potential vendors) and shows how one information processing variable, experience, relates  to these measured variables. While all outcomes were not statistically significant, the  results tend to support the enrichment hypothesis frequently examined by consumer behavior  researchers. The more experienced buyer tended to have a larger evoked set, have a larger  number of vendors in the final consideration set, possess a larger number of selection  criteria, and better discriminate among potential suppliers. INTRODUCTION The role of prior experience (e.g., product knowledge, product  familiarity) in information processing has become a major topic of investigation in the  cognitive sciences (Chi, Glaser and Rees 1981; Larkin et al. 1980), and in recent years  has received increased attention from consumer researchers. Prior experience, or more  generally, some type of feedback mechanism from purchase experiences, has been included in  traditional models of consumer behavior (cf. Bettman 1979; Hansen 1972; Howard 1977;  Howard and Sheth 1969). More recently, several experimental studies have examined the  relationship between prior experience and consumer choice processes (e.g., Sudan 1985;  Beattie 1981; Johnson and Russo 1981, 1984). In these studies differences in  "experts" and "novices" information processing strategies have been  observed. Interestingly, however, the research on prior experience has not been as  pervasive in the area of organizational buying even though effects of experience, if  observed in this context, could be extremely important to organizational sellers.  Organizational researchers have distinguished among the different types of buying  decisions, such as new task, modified rebuy, and straight rebuy (Robinson, Faris, and Wind  1967; Lehmann and O'Shaughnessy 1974) relating the newness of the problem to the  organization with information requirements and to the consideration of alternative sources  of supply. However, these researchers have not examined differences in information  processing strategies based upon the individual's experience in purchasing the product  (regardless of the particular type Purchase for the organization). The research reported here seeks to contribute to our knowledge of  organizational buying processes by examining the relationship between the prior purchase  experience of organizational buyers and several information processing variables typically  measured by organizational buying behavior researchers (cf. Moriarty and Galper 1978;  Moriarty and Spekman 1984). In addition, it also contributes to the general literature on  the effects of prior experience. It may be easier to study and detect differences due to  prior knowledge or experience in organizational purchasing decisions because they often  involve more complex products that require more information processing in general, and  because they often take place over a longer period of time than consumer decisions (cf.  Ames and Hlavacek 1984; Cyert, Simon and Trow 1956). Experience here may be more of an  advantage than in consumer settings. ROLE OF PRIOR EXPERIENCE IN INFORMATION PROCESSING Two views of how prior knowledge affects information processing have been  put forward in the consumer behavior literature. In the first, it is hypothesized that  consumers highly familiar with a product will engage in less search for information than  consumers unfamiliar with the product. Highly familiar consumers are more likely to know  specific facts about existing alternatives, and therefore would not need to gather  additional information. Paradoxically, according to this "inverted-U"  hypothesis, consumers very unfamiliar with the product would also engage in little search.  For them, however, more than a little search is too difficult and cognitively taxing.  Consumers who know a moderate amount about the product would engage in the most search  because they have the ability to handle the incoming information and have a motivation to  acquire more. Bettman and Park (1980), for example, used the inverted-U 5 hypothesis to  interpret findings regarding the effects of | experience on the types of information  processed (e.g., prior information and attribute evaluations) and the processing  heuristics used (e.g., processing by attribute or by brand, comparisons to standards). In  this research, the moderate experience group did more processing of currently available  information and relied less on prior knowledge than did the high and low experience  groups. Similarly, Johnson and Russo (1981, 1984) found that moderately experienced  subjects asked to make a product choice recalled more statements about the product than ;  subjects with either high or low experience, perhaps indicating greater attention to, or  use of, information. According to a second hypothesis, however, knowledge about a particular  product facilitates learning new information. Highly familiar consumers should be able to  encode information about additional alternatives more efficiently and thus may tend to  gather more information than consumers not familiar with the product. Support for this "enrichment" hypothesis that existing knowledge  facilitates learning new information has also been found. In a complex usage situation,  Brucks (1984) found that knowledge increased search efficiency by allowing faster  recognition of poor or inappropriate alternatives and facilitated the asking of questions  about attributes of the alternatives. And, Johnson and Russo (1984) report a linear effect  in the levels of recall as a function of prior experience when subjects were asked to form  a judgment about each product. Despite the as yet unresolved differences between these two views, the  research into the impact of prior experience on decision-making behavior has helped  produce a better understanding of the nature of consumer buying behavior. In  organizational buying behavior contexts, however, little attention has been paid to  variables affecting the processing of information by members of the buying center, with  the exception of studies on the sources of information used (Moriarty and Spekman 1984;  Sheth 1973; Kelly and Hensel 1973; Ozanne and Churchill 1968), and information as a means  of risk reduction (Webster and Wind 1972). Thus, the current study borrows heavily from  the research on consumers in order to investigate the effects of prior purchasing  experience on information-processing strategies employed by organizational buyers. An  implicit assumption, then, is that organizational buyers will be subject to the same  cognitive limitations and strategies as end use consumers. HYPOTHESES Hypotheses regarding the effects of experience on  industrial/organizational buyers were derived from the theory and research on this topic  in consumer behavior. Specifically, the inverted-U and the enrichment hypotheses formed  the basis for predictions regarding four dependent variables: 1. More experienced buyers will include more alternate vendors in their  evoked set, i.e. the set that first came to mind when they were initially faced with the  decision, than less experienced buyers. 2. More experienced buyers will include a smaller number of vendors in  their final consideration set than less experienced buyers. 3. More experienced buyers will consider a larger number of attributes  when waking a purchase decision than will less experienced buyers. 4. More experienced buyers will perceive greater differences between  alternatives than less experienced buyers. As in previous consumer studies, prior experience in making these kinds of  purchase decisions should result in a greater awareness of, and knowledge about,  alternatives. This greater knowledge base will be reflected in the number of alternatives  that initially come to mind when facing a purchase decision, in the number of attributes  perceived to be important, and the distinctions made between alternatives on those  attributes. On the other hand greater knowledge or experience should make it easier to  recognize and disregard inappropriate alternatives. Thus, more experienced buyers may  ultimately consider only a few alternative vendors. Less experienced buyers' final  consideration sets may be larger because they are less able to evaluate and disregard  inappropriate alternatives they become aware of in their decision process. METHOD Data was collected from decision-making units (DMUs) in approximately 300  organizations that had made major procurements of nonintelligent data terminals within the  previous 24 months. These organizations represented a stratified random sample of Dun  & Bradstreet companies including five industry sectors (manufacturing, business  services, transportation, finance, and wholesaling/retailing) and three size  classifications (100 to 249 employees, 250 to 1,000 employees, and more than 1,000  employees). For purposes of the larger study of which this was a part, a telephone  snowballing technique was used to identify all participants in the decision to buy the  terminals. Questionnaires were sent to all decision participants who agreed to cooperate  with the study. Analysis for the current study is based on the responses of 455  individuals involved in the buying process for 319 organizations. To be included, a  respondent must have reported that he/she played at least a somewhat important role in the  search process, the vendor and product evaluation process, and the vendor selection  process. For example, an individual who was very involved in the initial vendor search  process but not involved in the final selection of vendors w not included. Thus, our  sample consists of individuals who were involved in the entire process, and not just a  part of it. [Other analyses were conducted with more stringent definitions (of both  experience and role) to test the sensitivity of the results to sample definition changes.  While the statistical results varied slightly due to different inclusion rules, the  direction of the mean responses were consistent throughout.] Independent Variable The independent variable in this study was the amount of prior experience  the individual had in making major data terminal procurement decisions. Past experience  with the product per se was not of interest, but rather the cognitive structures that were  presumably caused by having been previously involved in purchasing data terminals defined  the product-related experience. Of concern were the number of major data terminal system  procurement decisions the individual had participated in during his/her career (not just  in the current firm). As such, years of employment, years of experience in the company,  length of time in a position, or position title were not reliable measures of prior  experience. In addition, since participation in such a major purchase as data terminals is  generally not considered to be an everyday occurrence, it was felt that the individual  respondents would be able to accurately recall prior participation. Three experience groups were created: the low prior experience group  individuals reported participation in one or no previous decisions; moderate prior  experience subjects had participated in two or three previous decisions; high prior  experience group members had participated in four or more decisions. Three groups are the  minimum needed to detect any curvilinear relationship between experience and the dependent  variables and the maximum allowed by the variability in the experience measure in this  sample. Finally, an analysis was conducted to determine whether experience, as  measured in this study, was related to or confounded with the position of the respondent  in his/her company. A one-way analysis of variance showed no significant differences in  experience as a function of position in the company. Dependent Measures Four dependent measures were examined separately: the number of vendors  respondents reported to be in their initial evoked sets, the number of vendors he/she  reported as being in the final consideration set, the importance ratings for 33 product  and vendor attributes, and ratings of the degree of difference between vendors on the same  attributes. For the first of these, respondents merely were asked how many possible  suppliers came to mind when they first became aware of the company's needs. For the second  measure, respondents were asked how many vendors there were during the final stages of  selection. Ratings on 6-point Likert scales for 33 attributes formed the last two  measures. For each attribute, the respondent rated its importance and the degree of  difference among suppliers in the industry on that attribute. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Separate analyses of variance were used to test each hypothesis. The  independent variable in each instance was the respondent's experience (low, moderate,  high). When significant overall differences were found, Spjotvoll-Stoline tests (Kirk  1982) for paired comparisons were conducted to determine the location of the difference. Number in the Evoked Set The first hypothesis proposed that the more experienced industrial buyer  would include a greater number of alternative vendors in h$s/her evoked set when faced  with a purchasing decision. The analysis of variance revealed a significant effect of  expertise (F = 11.043, p < .05). As shown in Table 1, the more inexperienced the  purchaser, the smaller the size of the evoked set. Pairwise comparisons revealed  significant differences between the low and high groups and between the moderate and high  groups ( Z - .05). The difference between the low and moderate groups was not significant.  However, the absolute value of the difference between these means was .82 while the  critical difference that the pairwise comparison had to exceed to be declared significant  was .83. The results of this analysis demonstrate the potential influence that  prior knowledge exerts on organizational buying behavior. It is not surprising that the  more experienced buyer could call to mind more potential vendors when he/she first becomes  aware of the company's needs. The person who has had more experience with vendors and has  gone through the search process a few times is probably more aware of the vendors who  offer the needed equipment. TABLE 1 INFORMATION VARIABLES BY THE AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE THE BUYER POSSESSES Size of the Final Consideration Set As suggested by the second hypothesis, it seems likely that the more  experienced purchaser would be able to quickly eliminate inappropriate vendors and would  consider seriously only a small number of vendors when making the final decision. The  inexperienced purchaser may have a difficult time eliminating vendors due to a lack of  prior knowledge pertaining to equipment or services offered and would tend to obtain the  needed information from several vendors. Contrary to our expectations, the more experienced purchaser had a much  larger number of potential vendors in the final consideration set. While the overall  hypothesis of equity of means could not be rejected (F = 1.755), the average size of the  final consideration set became larger with increased experience (see Table 1). In fact,  the experienced buyers included a larger number of alternatives in their final  consideration set than in their initial evoked set, while the opposite was true for the  inexperienced buyers. These results are consistent with the "enrichment"  hypothesis--greater prior knowledge facilitated the collection of more knowledge. The  purchase of nonintelligent data terminals might be considered a complex usage situation,  and these results would lend support to findings that knowledge increased search  efficiency (Brucks 1984). The more inexperienced buyers may know so little about product  attributes and about different companies that they have difficulty evaluating alternative  suppliers. Our results in this particular context also suggest that risk may be an  important element in the buyer's task environment. An inexperienced buyer may perceive the  purchase decision as riskier than an experienced buyer, and thus may narrow his/her search  to only a few well-known suppliers. In the context stud ed here, inexperienced buyers may  have relied more on IBM, and felt less able to evaluate other, perhaps riskier choices.  Thus, future research will be needed to determine if these differences between experienced  and inexperienced buyers persist when there is less risk, or when there is not a dominant  supplier. Number of Important Attributes Buyers familiar with the particular product class were expected to use  more evaluative criteria in making a product choice (Beattie 1981; Scrull 1983). While the  more experienced buyers in the current study considered a greater number of attributes to  be important than did the other groups (Table 1), the overall analysis of variance was not  significant (F = 1.803). The list of product attributes was based on initial research on the data  terminal industry and on a review of several private studies conducted within the data  terminal industry. For all but five attributes, over 60 percent of the respondents rated  the attributes 4,5, or 6 on the importance scale of 1 (unimportant) to 6 (very important).  For example, 99.1 percent of the respondents replied that the "reliability of the  product" was important (i.e., a 4 5, or 6 on the measurement scale). Unfortunately,  the list of attributes may have been skewed too much towards obviously important things,  and respondents were not forced to prioritize them or make any kind of trade-offs among  them. Thus, the lack of significant effects on attribute importance may be due to too  little variability in the dependent measure, or to the fact that many attributes are  important in organizational buying situations but few are deterministic. One review of organizational buying behavior has suggested that  experienced purchasers emphasize price more than inexperienced purchasers (DeBruicker and  Summe 1985). In the current study, the five attributes receiving the lowest importance  ratings were: lowest price, vendor's willingness to negotiate price, vendor offers large  volume discounts, vendor visibility among top management people, and the aesthetics of the  product (style, design, color, size). Since three of the five attributes receiving low  importance ratings dealt in some way with price, future analysis should seek to determine  whether there is a difference among buyers with respect to the level of experienCe and a  reduced set of macro-attributes. Vendor Differences Consumer research has suggested that inexperienced buyers tend to perceive  fewer distinctions among suppliers on product attributes than do the more experienced  buyers (cf. Beattie 1981). The fourth hypothesis proposed just such a finding in the  industrial arena. Respondents were asked to indicate their opinion of the degree of  difference among suppliers on each of the 33 selection criteria for which they had given  importance ratings. The Likert scale ranged from l to 6, with 1 indicating that the  suppliers were all about the same and 6 signifying a big difference among suppliers.  One-way analysis of variance found a marginally significant overall difference between  level of experience and differences among suppliers (F = 2.657, p < .10). The average difference for the low experience group was 3.93, with the  average difference for the moderate and high experience groups being 4.03 and 4.19,  respectively. Analysis of the pairwise comparisons revealed that there was a marginally  significant difference between the low and high experience groups (< = .10). The other  pairwise comparisons were not significant. Possible explanations for this could be that it  takes quite a few purchase situations for the effect of experience to impact the  discriminatory processes of the buyer, or that not much is gained by having additional  experience. SUMMARY This research was motivated by the work being conducted in consumer  behavior which examines the relationship between prior experience and consumer decision  making. It was an initial attempt to empirically test consumer behavior theory in an  industrial marketing context. Some results supported previous consumer behavior findings,  while others did not. However, this is not unusual given the mixed results also reported  in the consumer behavior literature. Specifically, the current research tends to support the enrichment  hypothesis frequently examined by consumer behavior researchers. While statistical  significance was not always found, the more experienced buyer tended to:   - have a larger evoked set,  - have 6 larger number of vendors in the final consideration set,  - possess a larger number of selection criteria, and  - better discriminate among potential suppliers.   Previous organizational buyer behavior research has generally focused upon  the information requirements surrounding the type of buying situation. For example, a  straight rebuy situation would suggest that only a minimal amount of information was  required. Based upon the current research, it now becomes questionable whether a minimal  amount of information is required or if the buyer has just become more efficient in the  information search process. On the other hand, a new task buying situation, based upon  previous organizational behavior literature, would have had a greater information  requirement. However it is suggested here that the new task buyer would not have utilized  a greater amount of information. Research concerning the presence or absence of prior experience with a  product class has significant implications for the industrial marketer. Specifically, such  information is paramount for communications strategy development. Insight into how  experience affects the choice process can help in determining the type of information most  effective for buyers with differing levels of experience. Sales presentations could easily  be geared for the different levels of experience. While fairly common in industrial marketing, the method of data collection  in the current study is extremely different from the laboratory experiments typically  conducted in consumer behavior research, and there may be some difficulty in studying  information processing with an uncontrolled field study rather than in a controlled  experimental context. Studying information processes by way of mailed questionnaires does  not allow the experimenter to manipulate variables (e.g., experience) or to monitor the  process (e.g., time) that the respondent uses in making decisions. Additionally,  presenting the respondents with a list of "relevant" attributes and asking them  to rate the degree of importance of each may tend to bias the responses, in that the  respondent way not have thought of a particular characteristic but sees it as important  now that he/she knows about it. Finally, retrospective reports may not be as accurate for  the early as the latter stages of the decision. However, field research has the advantage  of tapping actual organizational buyers regarding actual buying decisions. The current research, of course leaves many questions regarding the  information processing strategies of organizational buyers unanswered. Further studies  must replicate and extend this study by including measures of many more processing  variables. With a more controlled method, perhaps we might be able to track information  search and use more precisely. Beyond this, the general area of prior knowledge or experience seems to be  important for understanding organizational buying behavior. Further research, for example,  could examine differences between levels of experience and the macro-attributes (e.g.,  price) that the buyer uses. Having an idea as to whether the buyer will focus his/her  final decision on price, sales competence, service, etc. would assist the industrial  marketer in determining which criteria to emphasize in the sales presentation. Finally, this study examined organizational buyers purchasing  nonintelligent data terminals. Future studies could examine organizational buyers at  opposite ends of the risk or complexity spectrum (such as office supplies, mainframe  computers) to determine whether the level of experience has different effects with  different types of products.

In the rush to automate, the marketing and sales function is the next frontier. As everybody knows, over the past decade information systems have been making great inroads in engineering and manufacturing. Automation has cut direct labor to a small fraction of production costs—an average of 8% to 12% in manufacturing companies. Therefore, wringing yet more cost reductions from production labor is increasingly difficult. In such technically advanced industries as computers, semiconductors, airframes, metalworking, and autos, incremental investments are now garnering diminishing returns.
On the other hand, investments in marketing and sales automation systems hold tremendous potential for productivity improvements. Marketing and sales costs average 15% to 35% of total corporate costs (not just production costs). So a focus on marketing and sales provides a welcome lever for boosting productivity. Moreover, the importance of marketing and sales services is growing. According to the U.S. trade representative and the National Association of Accountants, manufacturers’ service activities account for 75% to 85% of all value added.1 This means that the price a product can command is less a reflection of raw materials and labor than of marketing-related services like selecting appropriate product features, determining the product mix, and ensuring product availability and delivery.
In cases we have reviewed, sales increases arising from advanced marketing and sales information technology have ranged from 10% to more than 30%, and investment returns have often exceeded 100%. These returns may sound like the proverbial free lunch, but they are real.
Because of the complexity of their marketing organizations, large companies are good prospects for what we call marketing and sales productivity (MSP) systems. Tangles of national account management, direct sales, telemarketing, direct mail, literature fulfillment, advertising, customer service, dealers, and distributors all offer opportunities for efficiency improvements. But even small companies that adopt MSP systems can expect impressive results.
Marketing automation investments by a $7 billion electronics manufacturer and an $8 million custom printing company each produced a first-year return of more than 100%. The electronics concern installed a sales support system for more than 500 salespeople. Sales rose 33%, sales force productivity rose 31%, and sales force attrition dropped 40%. The reduced attrition alone produced savings in recruiting and training costs that paid for the company’s $2.5 million investment in less than 12 months. At the custom printer, an $80,000 investment in a minicomputer and telemarketing software returned a 25% increase in sales and attained payback in less than 6 months.
Increasing marketing productivity even a small amount can have a great impact on the bottom line. MSP systems have a double punch because they can reduce fixed costs and variable costs. Lower fixed costs mean lower breakeven points. So a given percentage increase in sales produces a correspondingly larger increase in operating profits, as the chart on the next page shows. Meanwhile, lower variable costs mean that every sale contributes more to the bottom line. Indeed, because lower variable costs make the slope of the new contribution curve steeper, the absolute size of the financial advantage continues to grow as sales rise. 



An MSP System Creates a Financial Advantage 

Despite the proven worth of this technology, few companies have automated any part of their marketing and sales functions. Even fewer appear to understand the significant strategic benefits that can accrue from marketing and sales automation; most early adopters have automated as a matter of faith rather than as part of a strategy for gaining competitive advantage. A better approach begins with an understanding of what marketing and sales automation can do, how it works, and how it can be implemented.
What the Systems Do 
Distinct from general office automation systems, MSP networks are of course specific to marketing and sales. They support more intense product or service differentiation, improved customer service, reduced operating costs, and more streamlined operations. Here are some MSP systems and the tasks for which they are customarily used. 
  
Salesperson productivity tools—Planning and reporting of sales calls, reporting of expenses, entering orders, checking inventory and order status, managing distributors, tracking leads, and managing accounts.
Direct mail and fulfillment—Merging, cleaning, and maintaining mailing lists; subsetting lists (or markets); tracking and forwarding leads; customizing letters, envelopes, and labels; generating “picking lists” for literature packages; and managing literature inventory.
Telemarketing—Merging, cleaning, and maintaining calling lists; subsetting lists (or markets); tracking and forwarding leads; ranking prospects; and prompting scripts (sales, customer service, and support).
Sales and marketing management—Providing automated sales management reports (sales forecasts, sales activity, forecasts versus actuals, and so on); designing and managing sales territories; and analyzing marketing and sales programs by such criteria as market, territory, product, customer type, price, and channel.







MSP systems can automate the work of a single salesperson, a single marketing activity like direct mail, or a company’s entire marketing and sales operation. MSP systems also cut across every type of information technology from single-user PCs to networks of PCs, minicomputers, and mainframes serving thousands of users.
A simple system meets the needs of one fast-growing $25 million producer of data communications equipment that sells its products through 65 distributors. To cut down on paperwork in handling sales leads, the company adopted a PC-based MSP system. (See the flow chart showing its operation.) Compare this with the networks supporting the more than 5,000 direct salespeople of a major office automation vendor. (See the “map” showing its operation.) This vendor’s system combines direct selling, distributor relationships, telemarketing, and direct mail to: generate, qualify, rank-order, distribute, and track sales leads; fill prospects’ requests for product and price information; update customer and prospect files; provide sales and technical product support by telephone; and automate order entry and sales reporting. 



A Simple MSP Flow Chart for Handling Leads

While the scales of these two networks are obviously vastly different, both of them collect, organize, and update information about every lead generated, every sales task performed, and every customer or prospect closed or terminated. What is less obvious, but no less important, is the basis both systems provide for improving marketing and sales executives’ decision making.
Most MSP data bases contain essential information on customers, prospects, products, marketing programs, and marketing channels. Some systems supplement the essentials with industry data (growth rates, entries, exits, and regulatory trends) and data on competitors (products, pricing, sales trends, and market shares). For most businesses, the information incorporates a subtle but important shift from other data bases. Rather than focusing on products (What was the cost to produce each unit? How many units were made, sold, and shipped?), the MSP data base is customer driven. 
  
Whenever marketing or sales activities are performed, the data base captures information that answers questions about customers and their needs. Who were the prospects? What were their interests? How were these interests generated? Which sales or marketing personnel performed which tasks? When were the tasks performed? Which follow-up tasks are required and when? Did any sales result? Gradually the data base becomes a rich source of marketing and sales information, enabling management to track marketing activities and measure the results of marketing programs.
How They Aid Productivity 
MSP systems improve productivity in two ways. First, automation of selling and direct marketing support tasks boosts the efficiency of the sales and marketing staff. Second, automating the collection and analysis of marketing information improves the timeliness and quality of marketing and sales executives’ decision making.
These networks make direct sales and direct marketing more efficient by automating highly repetitive support tasks, like answering requests for product literature and writing letters, and by reducing the time salespeople spend on nonselling tasks, like scheduling sales calls, compiling sales reports, generating proposals and bids, and entering orders. In 1985, Xerox installed an internally developed MSP system in its southern region. Xerox credits the system with a 10% to 20% gain in sales force productivity and with trimming $3 million off the company’s 1987 marketing support and overhead budget. By automating sales administration and support tasks, Xerox has given its salespeople more time to sell.2
MSP systems for direct marketing also hone the efficiency of customer contacts. For example, a system for the telemarketing function can schedule and dial calls based on the prospect’s priority, prompt the telemarketer with a sales script, and automatically update customer files. At Aratex Services, a $500 million uniform supply company based in Encino, California, telemarketers using the company’s old manual system each made 35 to 40 calls per day and about one sale per month. Working with an automated system, each telemarketer now makes 50 or 60 calls daily and lands three or four sales per month.3
Automated networks also elevate the impact of each sales communication. Access to the central data base gives salespeople and direct marketers information to improve the quality of the contact, whether it is by mail, by telephone, or in person. A large financial services concern uses a telemarketing system to handle account inquiries. While responding to a customer’s request or query, the telemarketer is prompted by the system to update the customer’s profile information and to cross-sell other financial products.
At a division of Vanity Fair that makes women’s and children’s apparel, salespeople use laptop PCs to access the corporate data base for up-to-date inventory and order status information on 2,000 stock-keeping units. This step has trimmed the company’s order cycle from more than two weeks to just three days. It also has made ordering more accurate, resulting in greater customer satisfaction, reduced order cancellations, and a 10% increase in sales.
In companies with many channels, MSP systems upgrade efficiency by using the central data base to track and coordinate all marketing activity. Without this coordination, independent marketing groups often unwittingly pursue conflicting goals. At one multibillion-dollar office automation company, a direct salesperson had just nailed down a big order by giving a key account the “maximum” price discount. Before the deal was signed, however, the telemarketing group reached this customer and undercut the salesperson’s price by 10%. Aside from the damage to its reputation, this vendor lost much of its expected margin on the sale.







This company is now installing an MSP system that will collect and organize information on all marketing programs and activities, including: (1) all customer contacts, whether by mail, phone, direct salesperson, or national account manager; (2) the status of all sales efforts; (3) the origins of all leads; (4) all leads that are being qualified internally and by whom, and all leads that have been forwarded to distributors; (5) all customers who decided to buy; (6) what and when they purchased; and (7) any incentives or promotions that helped close the deal. Coordination of information through this system is expected to prevent further embarrassments. 
  
A Management Tool 
Creation of an MSP data base is an investment in astute management. The data base chronicles every one of a company’s marketing and sales activities, from advertising that generates leads to direct mail and telephone qualification of the leads to closing the first sale—all the way through the life of each account. It enables marketing and sales management to relate marketing actions with marketplace results.
At the $25 million data communications company whose lead-handling system we diagrammed, marketing managers use this system to evaluate media placements on the basis of sales closed. Before this procedure was in place, the company had no way to link information on leads to sales and evaluated media placements solely on the number of leads generated, not closed.
MSP systems also reduce marketing inertia because they streamline the implementation of marketing programs. For example, after designing an in-house system to organize and manage its customer/prospect files, one $2.5 million industrial manufacturer let 70 manufacturer’s agents go and replaced them with in-house direct mail and telemarketing functions. The results? The company raised its accounts by 50% and cut marketing costs from 18% of sales to 13%.
Systems for sales force automation also drive the rapid implementation of less drastic changes in marketing programs. By using telecommunications software and laptop PCs, Du Pont’s Remington Arms division has trimmed the time requirement for a national rollout of pricing and promotional programs from two weeks to less than two days.
As marketing managers become accustomed to these systems, they find new uses for them, like analyzing and modeling the buying behavior of prospects and customers. The data base at Excelan, a $39 million marketer of circuit boards and software in San Jose, California, was essential in identifying a shift in customers’ buying behavior from a very technical product focus to an office automation orientation. This discovery has influenced the marketing and sales managers’ decisions about hiring and training employees as well as about selecting and developing new target markets.
Account histories also improve management’s ability to devise and implement account management policies based on profits. By linking orders, services delivered, and prices paid with the actual costs of lead generation, preselling, closing, distribution, and post-sale support, MSP systems furnish the tools for analyzing and adjusting the marketing mix. Grede Foundries, a Milwaukee producer of castings for original equipment manufacturers, has used the MSP system to develop a “perceived quality index” that yields a more complete and more accurate measure of customers’ reactions than simply tracking returned goods. The system also provides pricing support. By tracking quoted prices and final selling prices, the system gives management a better idea of the price that will win a particular job.4
Moreover, automated networks coordinate and direct sales resources—including salespeople, distributors and agents, direct mailers, telemarketers, and manufacturers’ representatives—toward the highest priority prospects and customers. Hewlett-Packard’s Qualified Lead Tracking System (QUILTS) electronically transmits inquiries to a telemarketing center, which qualifies and ranks them and electronically returns them to H-P headquarters. The company has trimmed the turnaround time for leads from as much as 14 weeks to as little as 48 hours. “Hot” leads are handled even faster; they are telephoned to the field sales force from the telemarketing center.5 Similarly, field salespeople in Chevron Chemical’s fertilizer division in San Francisco use laptop PCs to access rank-ordered prospect lists in the company’s mainframe. At any time, the salespeople have access to leads that are only 24 hours old. Before automation, new prospect lists were printed at headquarters and mailed to the field reps, which took one to two weeks.
Finally, the MSP data base is a management tool for making better use of marketing resources—that is, ensuring that they are employed to further corporate goals rather than the goals of individual marketing or sales groups. While this may sound like something management does without effort, our research shows that optimizing marketing resources is much more easily said than done. In several companies we’ve looked at, salespeople routinely discard hundreds or even thousands of sales leads, making little or no effort to evaluate or review them. In essence, they are dissipating the resources that generated these leads—budgets for advertising, trade shows, public relations, and other communications media. 
  
In their defense, the salespeople complain that pursuing raw leads is a waste of time. And they are generally right. In one of these companies, salespeople who followed up the raw leads averaged only one or two sales per month, while those who followed their “instincts” averaged more than three. The cost of pursuing the raw leads was at least one lost sale per salesperson per month. To the salespeople, ignoring the leads was common sense. On the other hand, the advertising group, which was evaluated on the number of leads generated, was increasing its budgets to generate more and more leads. One company has solved this problem by implementing an MSP system that will use telemarketing to qualify leads before sending them to the salespeople. The system will also close the loop, allowing management to evaluate both the company’s advertising placements and its sales efforts on the basis of their contributions to revenues and earnings. 

Economies of Scale? 

Small businesses may gain an initial competitive edge from MSP systems because they often can adopt these systems much faster than their big counterparts. With fewer levels of management, small companies are faster on their feet in making decisions. They also tend to have simpler marketing organizations, usually relying on a single-method, single-channel selling system like a small direct sales force. 
Large companies face two imposing barriers. First, they generally have both multiple layers of administration and cross-functional decision-making groups. When analyzing, evaluating, and adopting MSP systems, large companies draw in not only marketing and sales but also the accounting, finance, and MIS functions. Second—as a glance at the flow chart and map shows—their marketing organizations customarily rely on complex arrangements of communications methods and selling channels. Accordingly, their MSP systems require great sophistication and customization. 
In large companies, marketing and sales automation is a high-stakes decision needing the support of many parties. In a major telecommunications company, the evaluation and selection of an MSP system called for: (1) initial screening presentations by three software vendors; (2) detailed presentations to 15 senior executives; (3) a visit by eight managers to a company with an operating MSP system; and (4) at least nine internal follow-up meetings, including presentations to the vice president of marketing and sales, the general managers of the ten operating companies, the directors of the MIS and MIS-procurement groups, several financial analysts, and several senior salespeople. More than 40 people had a hand in the decision. All this work occurred in a period of more than nine months after the corporate decision to automate marketing and sales. 
But the story doesn’t end there. Once the company had selected a $200,000 off-the-shelf system, it spent 18 months and $250,000 more installing and customizing the software. During the next two years, functional additions to the system and training of the end users added more than $1 million to the cost.


Efficiencies gained through task automation and improved marketing management are interdependent and reinforcing. Task automation drives the collection of more complete customer and marketplace information, and more informed decision making targets marketing and sales activities where they are most effective. In this way, marketers get a bigger payoff from low-cost, low-impact selling methods, like direct mail and catalogs, as data bases customize the timing and content of mass-marketing campaigns. At the same time, high-cost, high-impact selling methods, like personal selling and national account management, become more efficient as MSP systems perform routine sales support tasks, reduce nonselling time, and synchronize the use of these resources.
When you combine low-cost, low-impact methods with high-cost, high-impact approaches to gain just the right amount of stimulus at just the right time, you can obtain hefty impact at minimum cost. Hewlett-Packard, for one, has taken advantage of this synergy and has discovered the savings made possible by orchestrating direct mail, telemarketing, and personal selling.
How to Get from Here to There 
The cases we have reviewed show that companies implementing MSP systems encounter many of the same barriers they would confront adopting any new technology.6 From our observation, the process can be streamlined by following six guiding principles.
1. Clarify the scale of the project as well as potential additions. An audit of the marketing and sales tasks will yield these categories: those that must be automated now, those that will or may be automated later, and those that will not be automated. This simple exercise will identify marketing and sales activities that must be coordinated and focus the automation effort on getting measurable results without sacrificing flexibility.
It is important to view the project not from the perspective of the marketing groups but from a corporate perspective. With a corporate view, the company can build a “battleship”—a system that takes advantage of information-sharing and task-coordination synergies. Without this strategic perspective, independent marketing groups are more likely to invest in a number of incompatible and wasteful “rowboats.” And even a rowboat can cause problems. At a big high-tech manufacturer, eight salespeople had their own PC-based sales force automation system installed. By raising issues of compatibility, data entry, and “file structure definitions,” they delayed the start-up of a company wide, 300-salesperson MSP system for more than a year.
2. Concentrate on tasks that can add value for the customer. As in other corporate activities, marketers can get competitive advantage in two ways: by lowering costs and by enhancing the differentiation of the product or service offering. At the custom printer we referred to, streamlined job-costing and order-entry processes enable customers to price and place orders with one phone call. The “real-time” order-entry and order-tracking capabilities of the Vanity Fair unit’s salespeople have upgraded its customer service. In both cases, customers benefit from better service, and sellers benefit from lower costs.
Other companies add value by using automation to improve the exchange of information during sales calls. The 22 salespeople in Hercules’s Fragrance and Food Ingredient Group use their laptop PCs and a computer program called Flavor Briefs to consult with prospects on applications. Otherwise, Hercules salespeople would be unable to provide such detailed advice on their product line’s many applications. The system saves the customer and the salesperson time and also furnishes a valuable service. 
  
3. In the budget process, account for hidden costs and intangible benefits. Budgeting for an MSP system entails overcoming three principal obstacles: high perceived financial risk, poorly understood benefits, and biased capital budgeting systems.
First, automating marketing and sales is costly. A typical hardware and software outlay per salesperson ranges from $4,000 to $7,000—so automating the tasks of 100 field salespeople can cost between $400,000 and $700,000. In addition, if the MSP system must communicate with other corporate information systems, it is likely to require the development of specialized minicomputer, mainframe, or communications networking software.
Department-level telemarketing or direct mail systems range in price from $30,000 to more than $100,000. Sales or marketing management software may up the price another $30,000 to $100,000. Of course, the cost of tying all these pieces together depends on how many pieces there are, where they are located, and how they communicate. It would not be unusual for a company with 500 salespeople as well as telemarketing, fulfillment, and direct mail operations to spend between $3 million and $5 million on integrated MSP hardware and software.
But the budget process must anticipate and account for hidden costs too. In a number of cases we studied, in-house information was so scattered and communications equipment so incompatible that simply preparing a customer list required a major effort. Other hidden costs include system customization, expert consulting, and end-user training. Depending on the circumstances, these services can double or even triple the overall cost.
Because malfunctioning of an automated marketing system can threaten a business’s revenue stream, it’s advisable to budget for the cost of two systems—automated and manual—until the network has proved out. Naturally, all these expenses ratchet up the perceived financial risk of MSP automation.
On the other side of the equation, estimating the full financial benefit of an MSP system is extremely difficult. Tangible productivity gains, like increases in selling time and cost reductions on telephone campaigns, can be gauged fairly accurately. But intangible productivity gains, like better marketing decision making, more responsive customer service, and deeper understanding of customers, are much more difficult to track.
Still, it would be a mistake to ignore them, especially since capital budgeting processes are often biased against intangible productivity investments. Furthermore, few marketing managers and even fewer sales managers know much about their companies’ capital budgeting processes—especially when huge investments in information technology are at stake. Senior executives have to take care that the process remains flexible enough to give MSP automation a reasonable evaluation.
An MSP system is a strategic investment for the whole corporation. But unlike other assets that are consumed over time, the more it is used, the more valuable it becomes. So it should be viewed as a long-term asset, not as the expense of a functional group. And, needless to say, senior management must match the scale of the company’s investment to the scale of the project. Otherwise, fragmented marketing budgets will foster fragmented automation. The result, as noted above, may be many MSP rowboats with little or no coordination or compatibility. 
  
4. Make any tests realistic. Because launching a full-scale network can be tremendously risky, most companies hedge their bets first by piloting automation on small portions of their marketing operations. A single function, like telemarketing or personal selling, is usually the test site. If this pilot is successful, the company adds more functions.
This ramp-up strategy, however, has serious drawbacks. It permits no insight into the complexity of coordinating multiple marketing and sales activities. Though single-function solutions may yield gratifying returns, evidence of their true worth may also stay hidden until they are combined into a system that demonstrates synergy. Consequently, estimates of financial returns based on single-function pilots may be negatively biased.
Finally, critical performance limitations may remain hidden unless the complexity and scale of the test parallel the system’s actual use. One big manufacturer’s telemarketing pilot ran flawlessly, providing the telemarketers with a steady stream of calls and instant access to customer profiles and scripts. But eventual integration of telemarketing with other MSP networks seriously degraded the performance of the overall system. Every time the telemarketers asked for new information during a call, they were confronted by blank computer screens for more than 40 seconds. As the business manager put it, “That’s a long time to talk about baseball.”
A company with a multichannel, multimethod marketing system is better off with a pilot plan that automates a multifunctional subset of the marketing organization. In this type of pilot, an integrated system, encompassing all marketing and sales functions, is installed for a single division, region, product line, or customer group. This experience is likely to be more realistic than the single-function approach.
5. Pinpoint the roles and responsibilities of those selecting, designing, and operating the system. Even standard MSP systems, though they may be touted as off-the-shelf products, require extensive customization. This necessity complicates the selection or design process in a number of ways.

The process requires expertise in technology (computers, data communications, and software) as well as in marketing and sales. 


Naturally, a company’s existing MIS systems are likely to constrain the choice (or development) of an MSP system. 


Marketing professionals and MIS professionals rarely speak a common language, and they often approach marketing automation projects with different perspectives. While marketing thinks about functionality (e.g., Will the system help perform marketing and sales tasks?), MIS people often focus on technical considerations (e.g., Will the system interact with other corporate information systems? Who is responsible for ensuring the integrity of corporate data bases?). 


 
It’s senior management’s job to make sure that the MIS and marketing professionals talk to each other and work together. It’s not easy. An MIS group may automate its conception of marketing and sales only to discover later that the automated system does not actually work. Everybody knows of cases in which the MIS department loads the sales force down with reams of report forms to complete and return to headquarters. Of course, much of the requested information is irrelevant from the salespeople’s standpoint, and the report forms end up in the same round file as the old lead cards.
During the long, complex process of designing and implementing a major MSP system, responsibilities sometimes become diffuse and project accountability gets blurred. In one case we know of, poorly defined responsibilities for MIS and marketing have caused big headaches. Bickering over cost allocations and data-base controls has made the company’s $1 million MSP system useless. The MIS group will not allow marketing to access the corporation’s data bases. But the marketing group’s computer budget is too low to keep the marketing data base up-to-date. (Not surprisingly, headquarters viewed the entire MSP development process as a marketing expense instead of a corporate investment.)
6. Modify the technology and the organization to support the system. As in every instance in which management implements new technology, it must pay close attention to the attitudes of people in the organization. In successful MSP implementations that we have seen, both the organization and the MSP system have gone through an interactive process of change—altering the technology to fit the marketing and sales environment, then altering the environment to fit the technology.
To be useful, for example, the MSP data base obviously must contain accurate, up-to-date information. Because obtaining this information requires sales-people to use the system and to support the information collection process, they have to become adept at using the new technology. Problems can result, however, if the end-users lack computer skills or if they are uninterested in using the system.
Training can overcome skill problems (if enough money is budgeted and enough time set aside), but lack of interest is harder to deal with. Experience suggests that the best way to sell the sales staff on the network is to demonstrate that it can give every user something back. That is, by helping salespeople or telemarketers work more productively, MSP systems can boost not only the company’s sales but also their sales and their compensation.
For many companies, postponement of automation of the marketing function may seem to be a good way of skirting a difficult decision, but this do-nothing posture condemns the organization to being a marketing laggard. It may also be a costly mistake. Early adopters of MSP systems have gained superior competitive advantage. Compared with their “manual” competitors, they perform selling tasks with greater economy and impact. They know their customers better and can tailor their sales communications to supply just the right amount of sales stimulus at just the right time. Overall, they craft and control their marketing programs more intelligently. In the long run, the competitive barriers they establish may change the nature of marketing in their industries.
In view of this impressive record, some marketers about to embark on automation may embrace unrealistically high expectations. But MSP systems cannot work miracles. They will not offset a poorly conceived or poorly executed marketing strategy. They will not compensate for an inferior sales force, and they will not sell inferior products. Complex MSP systems are difficult to implement, and the associated returns, like any other lasting accomplishment, have to be earned.

Roland: Roots in Electronic Instruments
From synthesizers and electronic drum kits to audio interfaces, mixing consoles, and instrument amplifiers, Roland has been providing musicians and recording engineers with musical tools since the mid-'70s. The heritage actually goes back even further: Ikutaro Kakehashi founded Ace Electronic Industries in 1960, producing a range of combo organs, guitar amps, and effects pedals. He was also contracted by Hammond Organ Co. to produce rhythm machines for their home organs. Kakehashi severed ties with both companies and founded Roland in 1972.
Modern Sounds for Modern Music
Even though Roland released their first synthesizer (the SH-1000) in 1973, it was the 1980s that would firmly position them in the world of electronic music technology. Now-iconic instruments like the TR-808 and TR-909 rhythm machines, the TB-303 bassline synthesizer, the JUPITER-8 and JX-3P analog synthesizers, and the D-50 digital synthesizer would all play a big part in shaping the sound of the '80s. In the '90s, Detroit techno and rave culture inspired a whole new generation of electronic musicians in the USA to re-discover the potential of these instruments. Fast forward to today, with a wide range of new instruments plus re-creations of the classics, and it's clear that Roland has influenced virtually every genre of electronic music.
Innovations for Musicians of All Types
Roland's mastery of electronic music equipment extends well beyond synths and drum machines. Their first electronic piano, the EP-30 from 1974, was the world's first such instrument with a touch-sensitive keyboard. Advancements like adding escapement to their premium piano keybeds gives their modern instruments expressiveness and playability that please discerning players. And Roland's SuperNATURAL sound engine offers realistic and lifelike instrument sounds across a wide range of their products, from their home digital pianos and synthesizers all the way to electronic drums and even accordions. All along the way, Roland also created iconic guitar and bass equipment ranging from instruments to effects pedals to amplifiers.
Tools That Transcend Genres
Some of Roland's early creations like the CE-1 Chorus Ensemble pedal, the RE-201 Space Echo, and the JV-80 synthesizer are highly sought after by vintage enthusiasts. Other player favorites like the JC-120 Jazz Chorus combo amplifier have remained in production for decades. This not only reflects the consistent quality of Roland instruments, it also speaks to their ability to rise above trends and create instruments that remain musically relevant for years.
