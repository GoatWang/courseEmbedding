Logitech International S.A. was co-founded in Apples, Vaud, Switzerland, in 1981 by two Stanford alumni, Daniel Borel and Pierluigi Zappacosta, and a former Olivetti engineer, Giacomo Marini.[4]
The mass-marketed computer mouse was the product that made Logitech well-known. The range of products offered improvements over a product originally developed at LAMI (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) by professor Jean-Daniel Nicoud and engineer André Guignard, who was involved in the design changes of the computer mouse originally invented by Douglas Engelbart.
For a time during its formative years, Logitech's Silicon Valley offices occupied space at 165 University Avenue, Palo Alto, California, home to a number of noted technology startups.[5]
From there, Logitech expanded its product line (see below) to encompass many mass market computer peripherals and beyond (such as the "Harmony" range of programmable universal remote controls).
In 2007, Logitech licensed Hillcrest Labs' Freespace motion control technology to produce the MX Air Mouse, which allows a user to use natural gestures to control a PC.[6][7]
In August 2008, Logitech acquired Ultimate Ears, supplier of custom in-ear monitors for professional musicians and earphones for the consumer market.[8]
In December 2008, Logitech announced that it had manufactured one billion mice since 1985.[9]
In August 2009, Logitech introduced the Logitech Unifying receiver, which enabled multiple wireless devices to connect through one USB port.[10]
In May 2010, Logitech, in partnership with Google, introduced the Internet-enabled television; named Google TV.[11]
In May 2011, Logitech entered the tablet market with a line of accessories, including cases and keyboards, speakers and mice for iPad and Android-based tablets.[12]
In July 2011, Logitech acquired the mobile visual communications provider, Mirial.[13]
In January 2013, Bracken Darrell became Logitech’s chief executive officer and then CEO Guerrino De Luca continued as Logitech’s chairman of the board.[14]
In November 2013, the company announced the launch of its new iPhone game controller, the PowerShell, which also doubles as a battery pack with a built-in 1500mAh battery.[15]
Logitech's profits were hurt by the proliferation of tablet devices.[16][17] In 2013 the company made a loss, but returned to profit in 2014.
On July 8, 2015, Logitech announced the biggest brand transformation in its history. The transformation included a new, simplified and modernized logo and the announcement of a greater emphasis on design going forward. Logitech also highlighted that they are looking to move beyond PC peripherals.[18][19][20]
In July 2015, Logitech announced a 2 percent first-quarter revenue drop to $470 million, due to a strong dollar and falling demand for the company's computer accessories. Logitech has been focusing on new lines like wireless music speakers, videoconferencing and video game controllers to offset a decline in personal computers and weak demand for mice and keyboards[21]
In September 2015, Logitech and Prezi announced a plan to work together on co-marketing and product development.[22]
In April 2016, Logitech agreed to pay $7.5 million penalty related to accusations that it and some former executives improperly inflated the company's results for its 2011 fiscal year to meet guidance and other accounting violations. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said the alleged accounting issues left investors without an accurate view of the Swiss-U.S. company's finances.[23]
On April 12, 2016, Logitech acquired Jaybird, makers of fitness-focused wireless earbuds and trackers for $50 million.[24]
On September 15, 2016, Logitech announced that they had purchased the Saitek brand and assets from Mad Catz for $13 million in cash.[25]
On July 11, 2017, Logitech has agreed to acquire ASTRO Gaming, makers of professional gaming equipment (mainly headset solutions), for $85 million in cash.[26]
Production[edit]
The first Logitech mice were made in Le Lieu, in the Swiss Canton of Vaud by Dubois Depraz SA.[citation needed]

Production facilities were then established in the US, Taiwan, Hungary and Ireland before being moved subsequently to Suzhou, China. As of 2005[update], the manufacturing operations in China produce approximately half of Logitech's products. The remaining production is outsourced to contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers in Asia.[citation needed]

Logitech International S.A. (commonly referred to as Logitech or Logi, stylized as logitech, previously LOGITECH) is a Swiss global provider of personal computer and mobile accessories, with global headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland and American headquarters in Newark, California. In addition to its Swiss and American facilities, the company has offices throughout Europe, Asia and the rest of the Americas. Logitech's sales and marketing activities are organized into three geographic regions: America (AMR); Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA); Asia Pacific (AP).
The company develops and markets personal peripherals for PC navigation, video communication and collaboration, music and smart home. This includes products like keyboards, mice, tablet accessories, webcams, Bluetooth speakers, universal remotes and more.
The name Logitech is derived from the French word for software, "logiciel"[3]. In Japan, Logitech was established as Logicool to avoid conflict with the Logitec brand.

Logitech International S.A. was co-founded in Apples, Vaud, Switzerland, in 1981 by two Stanford alumni, Daniel Borel and Pierluigi Zappacosta, and a former Olivetti engineer, Giacomo Marini.[4]
The mass-marketed computer mouse was the product that made Logitech well-known. The range of products offered improvements over a product originally developed at LAMI (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) by professor Jean-Daniel Nicoud and engineer André Guignard, who was involved in the design changes of the computer mouse originally invented by Douglas Engelbart.
For a time during its formative years, Logitech's Silicon Valley offices occupied space at 165 University Avenue, Palo Alto, California, home to a number of noted technology startups.[5]
From there, Logitech expanded its product line (see below) to encompass many mass market computer peripherals and beyond (such as the "Harmony" range of programmable universal remote controls).
In 2007, Logitech licensed Hillcrest Labs' Freespace motion control technology to produce the MX Air Mouse, which allows a user to use natural gestures to control a PC.[6][7]
In August 2008, Logitech acquired Ultimate Ears, supplier of custom in-ear monitors for professional musicians and earphones for the consumer market.[8]
In December 2008, Logitech announced that it had manufactured one billion mice since 1985.[9]
In August 2009, Logitech introduced the Logitech Unifying receiver, which enabled multiple wireless devices to connect through one USB port.[10]
In May 2010, Logitech, in partnership with Google, introduced the Internet-enabled television; named Google TV.[11]
In May 2011, Logitech entered the tablet market with a line of accessories, including cases and keyboards, speakers and mice for iPad and Android-based tablets.[12]
In July 2011, Logitech acquired the mobile visual communications provider, Mirial.[13]
In January 2013, Bracken Darrell became Logitech’s chief executive officer and then CEO Guerrino De Luca continued as Logitech’s chairman of the board.[14]
In November 2013, the company announced the launch of its new iPhone game controller, the PowerShell, which also doubles as a battery pack with a built-in 1500mAh battery.[15]
Logitech's profits were hurt by the proliferation of tablet devices.[16][17] In 2013 the company made a loss, but returned to profit in 2014.
On July 8, 2015, Logitech announced the biggest brand transformation in its history. The transformation included a new, simplified and modernized logo and the announcement of a greater emphasis on design going forward. Logitech also highlighted that they are looking to move beyond PC peripherals.[18][19][20]
In July 2015, Logitech announced a 2 percent first-quarter revenue drop to $470 million, due to a strong dollar and falling demand for the company's computer accessories. Logitech has been focusing on new lines like wireless music speakers, videoconferencing and video game controllers to offset a decline in personal computers and weak demand for mice and keyboards[21]
In September 2015, Logitech and Prezi announced a plan to work together on co-marketing and product development.[22]
In April 2016, Logitech agreed to pay $7.5 million penalty related to accusations that it and some former executives improperly inflated the company's results for its 2011 fiscal year to meet guidance and other accounting violations. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said the alleged accounting issues left investors without an accurate view of the Swiss-U.S. company's finances.[23]
On April 12, 2016, Logitech acquired Jaybird, makers of fitness-focused wireless earbuds and trackers for $50 million.[24]
On September 15, 2016, Logitech announced that they had purchased the Saitek brand and assets from Mad Catz for $13 million in cash.[25]
On July 11, 2017, Logitech has agreed to acquire ASTRO Gaming, makers of professional gaming equipment (mainly headset solutions), for $85 million in cash.[26]
Production[edit]
The first Logitech mice were made in Le Lieu, in the Swiss Canton of Vaud by Dubois Depraz SA.[citation needed]

Production facilities were then established in the US, Taiwan, Hungary and Ireland before being moved subsequently to Suzhou, China. As of 2005[update], the manufacturing operations in China produce approximately half of Logitech's products. The remaining production is outsourced to contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers in Asia.[citation needed]

Logitech International S.A. was co-founded in Apples, Vaud, Switzerland, in 1981 by two Stanford alumni, Daniel Borel and Pierluigi Zappacosta, and a former Olivetti engineer, Giacomo Marini.[4]
The mass-marketed computer mouse was the product that made Logitech well-known. The range of products offered improvements over a product originally developed at LAMI (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) by professor Jean-Daniel Nicoud and engineer André Guignard, who was involved in the design changes of the computer mouse originally invented by Douglas Engelbart.
For a time during its formative years, Logitech's Silicon Valley offices occupied space at 165 University Avenue, Palo Alto, California, home to a number of noted technology startups.[5]
From there, Logitech expanded its product line (see below) to encompass many mass market computer peripherals and beyond (such as the "Harmony" range of programmable universal remote controls).
In 2007, Logitech licensed Hillcrest Labs' Freespace motion control technology to produce the MX Air Mouse, which allows a user to use natural gestures to control a PC.[6][7]
In August 2008, Logitech acquired Ultimate Ears, supplier of custom in-ear monitors for professional musicians and earphones for the consumer market.[8]
In December 2008, Logitech announced that it had manufactured one billion mice since 1985.[9]
In August 2009, Logitech introduced the Logitech Unifying receiver, which enabled multiple wireless devices to connect through one USB port.[10]
In May 2010, Logitech, in partnership with Google, introduced the Internet-enabled television; named Google TV.[11]
In May 2011, Logitech entered the tablet market with a line of accessories, including cases and keyboards, speakers and mice for iPad and Android-based tablets.[12]
In July 2011, Logitech acquired the mobile visual communications provider, Mirial.[13]
In January 2013, Bracken Darrell became Logitech’s chief executive officer and then CEO Guerrino De Luca continued as Logitech’s chairman of the board.[14]
In November 2013, the company announced the launch of its new iPhone game controller, the PowerShell, which also doubles as a battery pack with a built-in 1500mAh battery.[15]
Logitech's profits were hurt by the proliferation of tablet devices.[16][17] In 2013 the company made a loss, but returned to profit in 2014.
On July 8, 2015, Logitech announced the biggest brand transformation in its history. The transformation included a new, simplified and modernized logo and the announcement of a greater emphasis on design going forward. Logitech also highlighted that they are looking to move beyond PC peripherals.[18][19][20]
In July 2015, Logitech announced a 2 percent first-quarter revenue drop to $470 million, due to a strong dollar and falling demand for the company's computer accessories. Logitech has been focusing on new lines like wireless music speakers, videoconferencing and video game controllers to offset a decline in personal computers and weak demand for mice and keyboards[21]
In September 2015, Logitech and Prezi announced a plan to work together on co-marketing and product development.[22]
In April 2016, Logitech agreed to pay $7.5 million penalty related to accusations that it and some former executives improperly inflated the company's results for its 2011 fiscal year to meet guidance and other accounting violations. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said the alleged accounting issues left investors without an accurate view of the Swiss-U.S. company's finances.[23]
On April 12, 2016, Logitech acquired Jaybird, makers of fitness-focused wireless earbuds and trackers for $50 million.[24]
On September 15, 2016, Logitech announced that they had purchased the Saitek brand and assets from Mad Catz for $13 million in cash.[25]
On July 11, 2017, Logitech has agreed to acquire ASTRO Gaming, makers of professional gaming equipment (mainly headset solutions), for $85 million in cash.[26]

The first Logitech mice were made in Le Lieu, in the Swiss Canton of Vaud by Dubois Depraz SA.[citation needed]

Production facilities were then established in the US, Taiwan, Hungary and Ireland before being moved subsequently to Suzhou, China.

The remaining production is outsourced to contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers in Asia.[citation needed]

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth above in Item 1A, Risk Factors, and below in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview of Our Company Logitech is a world leader in designing, manufacturing and marketing products that have an everyday place in people's lives, connecting them to the digital experiences they care about. More than 35 years ago Logitech created products to improve experiences around the PC platform, and now it is designing products that enable better experiences consuming, sharing and creating any digital content (e.g., music, gaming, video), whether it is on a computer, mobile device or in the cloud. Logitech's brands of include Logitech, Jaybird, Logitech G and Ultimate Ears. Our products participate in five large markets that all have growth opportunities: Music, Gaming, Video Collaboration, Smart Home and Creativity & Productivity. We sell our products to a broad network of domestic and international customers, including direct sales to retailers and e-tailers, and indirect sales through distributors. Our worldwide channel network includes consumer electronics distributors, retailers, mass merchandisers, specialty electronics stores, computer and telecommunications stores, value-added resellers and online merchants. We operate in a single operating segment: Peripherals. In fiscal years prior to fiscal year 2016, we operated in two segments: Peripherals, including retail and OEM products; and Lifesize Video Conferencing. During fiscal year 2016, we divested the Lifesize Video Conferencing segment, and exited the OEM business. Our financial results treat the Lifesize segment as discontinued operations for all the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. From time to time, we may seek to partner with, or acquire when appropriate, companies that have products, personnel, and technologies that complement our strategic direction. We continually review our product offerings and our strategic direction in light of our profitability targets, competitive conditions, changing consumer trends and the evolving nature of the interface between the consumer and the digital world. On September 15, 2016, we acquired Saitek product line for a total consideration of approximately $13.0 million (the "Saitek Acquisition"). The Saitek Acquisition is expected to enhance the breadth and depth of our product offerings and expand our engineering capabilities in simulation products. On April 20, 2016, we acquired Jaybird LLC of Salt Lake City, Utah ("Jaybird") for a purchase price of $54.2 million, including a working capital adjustment and payment of a line-of-credit on behalf of Jaybird, along with an additional earn-out of up to $45 million in cash based on achievement of growth targets over two years (the "Jaybird Acquisition"). Jaybird is a leader in wireless audio wearables for sports and active lifestyles, and the acquisition of Jaybird expands our long-term growth potential in our Music market. On December 28, 2015, we and Lifesize, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Logitech which holds the assets of our Lifesize video conferencing business, entered into a stock purchase agreement with three venture capital firms. Immediately following the December 28, 2015 closing of the transaction, the venture capital firms held 62.5% of the outstanding shares of Lifesize, which resulted in a divestiture of the Lifesize video conferencing business by us. The historical results of operations and the financial position of Lifesize are included in the consolidated financial statements of Logitech and are reported as discontinued operations within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We exited our OEM business during our fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2015. The results of our OEM business are included in our financial statements as part of continuing operations for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 and prior periods. There is no revenue and cost associated with this business in future periods. Summary of Financial Results Our total net sales for fiscal year 2017 increased 10% in comparison to fiscal year 2016 due to an increase in retail sales, partially offset by a decrease in OEM sales as a result of exiting the OEM business in the third quarter ended December 31, 2015. The results of operations for Jaybird and Saitek have been included in our consolidated  Logitech International S.A. | Fiscal 2017 Form 10-K | 39 Table of Contents  statements of operations from the acquisition date. For fiscal year 2017, Jaybird and Saitek contributed a total of $65.7 million of net sales. Retail sales during fiscal year 2017 increased 14% compared to fiscal year 2016. Retail sales increased 12%, 19% and 11% in the Americas ("AMR"), EMEA and Asia Pacific, respectively.  Logitech International S.A. | Fiscal 2017 Form 10-K | 40 Table of Contents  Business Seasonality, Product Introductions and Business Acquisitions We have historically experienced higher net sales in our third fiscal quarter ending December 31, compared to other fiscal quarters in our fiscal year, due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions and business acquisitions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Product introductions can also impact our net sales to distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and often channel inventory of an earlier model product declines as the next related major product launch approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. However, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of our future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance.  Logitech International S.A. | Fiscal 2017 Form 10-K | 41 Table of Contents  end-users. Accruals for the estimated costs of consumer rebates and similar incentives are recorded at the later of time of sale or when the incentive is offered, based on the specific terms and conditions.  Logitech International S.A. | Fiscal 2017 Form 10-K | 42 Table of Contents  there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for Logitech's products or an unanticipated change in technological or customer requirements, we may be required to record additional write-downs that could adversely affect gross margins in the period when the write-downs are recorded.

Logitech International S.A. (commonly referred to as Logitech or Logi, stylized as logitech, previously LOGITECH) is a Swiss global provider of personal computer and mobile accessories, with global headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland and American headquarters in Newark, California. In addition to its Swiss and American facilities, the company has offices throughout Europe, Asia and the rest of the Americas. Logitech's sales and marketing activities are organized into three geographic regions: America (AMR); Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA); Asia Pacific (AP).
The company develops and markets personal peripherals for PC navigation, video communication and collaboration, music and smart home. This includes products like keyboards, mice, tablet accessories, webcams, Bluetooth speakers, universal remotes and more.
The name Logitech is derived from the French word for software, "logiciel"[3]. In Japan, Logitech was established as Logicool to avoid conflict with the Logitec brand.

Logitech International S.A. was co-founded in Apples, Vaud, Switzerland, in 1981 by two Stanford alumni, Daniel Borel and Pierluigi Zappacosta, and a former Olivetti engineer, Giacomo Marini.[4]
The mass-marketed computer mouse was the product that made Logitech well-known. The range of products offered improvements over a product originally developed at LAMI (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) by professor Jean-Daniel Nicoud and engineer André Guignard, who was involved in the design changes of the computer mouse originally invented by Douglas Engelbart.
For a time during its formative years, Logitech's Silicon Valley offices occupied space at 165 University Avenue, Palo Alto, California, home to a number of noted technology startups.[5]
From there, Logitech expanded its product line (see below) to encompass many mass market computer peripherals and beyond (such as the "Harmony" range of programmable universal remote controls).
In 2007, Logitech licensed Hillcrest Labs' Freespace motion control technology to produce the MX Air Mouse, which allows a user to use natural gestures to control a PC.[6][7]
In August 2008, Logitech acquired Ultimate Ears, supplier of custom in-ear monitors for professional musicians and earphones for the consumer market.[8]
In December 2008, Logitech announced that it had manufactured one billion mice since 1985.[9]
In August 2009, Logitech introduced the Logitech Unifying receiver, which enabled multiple wireless devices to connect through one USB port.[10]
In May 2010, Logitech, in partnership with Google, introduced the Internet-enabled television; named Google TV.[11]
In May 2011, Logitech entered the tablet market with a line of accessories, including cases and keyboards, speakers and mice for iPad and Android-based tablets.[12]
In July 2011, Logitech acquired the mobile visual communications provider, Mirial.[13]
In January 2013, Bracken Darrell became Logitech’s chief executive officer and then CEO Guerrino De Luca continued as Logitech’s chairman of the board.[14]
In November 2013, the company announced the launch of its new iPhone game controller, the PowerShell, which also doubles as a battery pack with a built-in 1500mAh battery.[15]
Logitech's profits were hurt by the proliferation of tablet devices.[16][17] In 2013 the company made a loss, but returned to profit in 2014.
On July 8, 2015, Logitech announced the biggest brand transformation in its history. The transformation included a new, simplified and modernized logo and the announcement of a greater emphasis on design going forward. Logitech also highlighted that they are looking to move beyond PC peripherals.[18][19][20]
In July 2015, Logitech announced a 2 percent first-quarter revenue drop to $470 million, due to a strong dollar and falling demand for the company's computer accessories. Logitech has been focusing on new lines like wireless music speakers, videoconferencing and video game controllers to offset a decline in personal computers and weak demand for mice and keyboards[21]
In September 2015, Logitech and Prezi announced a plan to work together on co-marketing and product development.[22]
In April 2016, Logitech agreed to pay $7.5 million penalty related to accusations that it and some former executives improperly inflated the company's results for its 2011 fiscal year to meet guidance and other accounting violations. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said the alleged accounting issues left investors without an accurate view of the Swiss-U.S. company's finances.[23]
On April 12, 2016, Logitech acquired Jaybird, makers of fitness-focused wireless earbuds and trackers for $50 million.[24]
On September 15, 2016, Logitech announced that they had purchased the Saitek brand and assets from Mad Catz for $13 million in cash.[25]
On July 11, 2017, Logitech has agreed to acquire ASTRO Gaming, makers of professional gaming equipment (mainly headset solutions), for $85 million in cash.[26]
Production[edit]
The first Logitech mice were made in Le Lieu, in the Swiss Canton of Vaud by Dubois Depraz SA.[citation needed]

Production facilities were then established in the US, Taiwan, Hungary and Ireland before being moved subsequently to Suzhou, China.

The remaining production is outsourced to contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers in Asia.[citation needed]

Logitech International S.A. (commonly referred to as Logitech or Logi, stylized as logitech, previously LOGITECH) is a Swiss global provider of personal computer and mobile accessories, with global headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland and American headquarters in Newark, California. In addition to its Swiss and American facilities, the company has offices throughout Europe, Asia and the rest of the Americas. Logitech's sales and marketing activities are organized into three geographic regions: America (AMR); Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA); Asia Pacific (AP).
The company develops and markets personal peripherals for PC navigation, video communication and collaboration, music and smart home. This includes products like keyboards, mice, tablet accessories, webcams, Bluetooth speakers, universal remotes and more.
The name Logitech is derived from the French word for software, "logiciel"[3]. In Japan, Logitech was established as Logicool to avoid conflict with the Logitec brand.

Second Logitech logo, used from 1985 to 1988.



Fourth Logitech logo, used from 1996 to 2015.



Fifth Logitech logo, used from 2012 to 2015.

Logitech International S.A. was co-founded in Apples, Vaud, Switzerland, in 1981 by two Stanford alumni, Daniel Borel and Pierluigi Zappacosta, and a former Olivetti engineer, Giacomo Marini.[4]
The mass-marketed computer mouse was the product that made Logitech well-known. The range of products offered improvements over a product originally developed at LAMI (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) by professor Jean-Daniel Nicoud and engineer André Guignard, who was involved in the design changes of the computer mouse originally invented by Douglas Engelbart.
For a time during its formative years, Logitech's Silicon Valley offices occupied space at 165 University Avenue, Palo Alto, California, home to a number of noted technology startups.[5]
From there, Logitech expanded its product line (see below) to encompass many mass market computer peripherals and beyond (such as the "Harmony" range of programmable universal remote controls).
In 2007, Logitech licensed Hillcrest Labs' Freespace motion control technology to produce the MX Air Mouse, which allows a user to use natural gestures to control a PC.[6][7]
In August 2008, Logitech acquired Ultimate Ears, supplier of custom in-ear monitors for professional musicians and earphones for the consumer market.[8]
In December 2008, Logitech announced that it had manufactured one billion mice since 1985.[9]
In August 2009, Logitech introduced the Logitech Unifying receiver, which enabled multiple wireless devices to connect through one USB port.[10]
In May 2010, Logitech, in partnership with Google, introduced the Internet-enabled television; named Google TV.[11]
In May 2011, Logitech entered the tablet market with a line of accessories, including cases and keyboards, speakers and mice for iPad and Android-based tablets.[12]
In July 2011, Logitech acquired the mobile visual communications provider, Mirial.[13]
In January 2013, Bracken Darrell became Logitech’s chief executive officer and then CEO Guerrino De Luca continued as Logitech’s chairman of the board.[14]
In November 2013, the company announced the launch of its new iPhone game controller, the PowerShell, which also doubles as a battery pack with a built-in 1500mAh battery.[15]
Logitech's profits were hurt by the proliferation of tablet devices.[16][17] In 2013 the company made a loss, but returned to profit in 2014.
On July 8, 2015, Logitech announced the biggest brand transformation in its history. The transformation included a new, simplified and modernized logo and the announcement of a greater emphasis on design going forward. Logitech also highlighted that they are looking to move beyond PC peripherals.[18][19][20]
In July 2015, Logitech announced a 2 percent first-quarter revenue drop to $470 million, due to a strong dollar and falling demand for the company's computer accessories. Logitech has been focusing on new lines like wireless music speakers, videoconferencing and video game controllers to offset a decline in personal computers and weak demand for mice and keyboards[21]
In September 2015, Logitech and Prezi announced a plan to work together on co-marketing and product development.[22]
In April 2016, Logitech agreed to pay $7.5 million penalty related to accusations that it and some former executives improperly inflated the company's results for its 2011 fiscal year to meet guidance and other accounting violations. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said the alleged accounting issues left investors without an accurate view of the Swiss-U.S. company's finances.[23]
On April 12, 2016, Logitech acquired Jaybird, makers of fitness-focused wireless earbuds and trackers for $50 million.[24]
On September 15, 2016, Logitech announced that they had purchased the Saitek brand and assets from Mad Catz for $13 million in cash.[25]
On July 11, 2017, Logitech has agreed to acquire ASTRO Gaming, makers of professional gaming equipment (mainly headset solutions), for $85 million in cash.[26]
Production[edit]
The first Logitech mice were made in Le Lieu, in the Swiss Canton of Vaud by Dubois Depraz SA.[citation needed]

Production facilities were then established in the US, Taiwan, Hungary and Ireland before being moved subsequently to Suzhou, China. As of 2005[update], the manufacturing operations in China produce approximately half of Logitech's products. The remaining production is outsourced to contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers in Asia.[citation needed]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
