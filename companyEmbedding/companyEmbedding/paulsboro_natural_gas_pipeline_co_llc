Start Preamble
The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) will prepare an environmental assessment (EA) that will discuss the environmental impacts of the Delaware River Pipeline Relocation Project (project) involving construction and operation of facilities by Paulsboro Natural Gas Pipeline Company, LLC (PNGPC) in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, and Gloucester County, New Jersey. The Commission will use this EA in its decision-making process to determine whether the project is in the public convenience and necessity.
This notice announces the opening of the scoping process the Commission will use to gather input from the public and interested agencies on the project. You can make a difference by providing us with your specific comments or concerns about the project. Your comments should focus on the potential environmental effects, reasonable alternatives, and measures to avoid or lessen environmental impacts. Your input will help the Commission staff determine what issues they need to evaluate in the EA. To ensure that your comments are timely and properly recorded, please send your comments so that the Commission receives them in Washington, DC on or before February 18, 2016.
If you sent comments on this project to the Commission before the opening of this docket on December 11, 2015, you will need to file those comments in Docket No. CP16-27-000 to ensure they are considered as part of this proceeding.
This notice is being sent to the Commission's current environmental mailing list for this project. State and local government representatives should notify their constituents of this proposed project and encourage them to comment on their areas of concern.
If you are a landowner receiving this notice, a pipeline company representative may contact you about the acquisition of an easement to construct, operate, and maintain the proposed facilities. The company would seek to negotiate a mutually acceptable agreement. However, if the Commission approves the project, that approval conveys with it the right of eminent domain. Therefore, if easement negotiations fail to produce an agreement, the pipeline company could initiate condemnation proceedings where compensation would be determined in accordance with state law.
PNGPC provided landowners with a fact sheet prepared by the FERC entitled “An Interstate Natural Gas Facility On My Land? What Do I Need To Know?” This fact sheet addresses a number of typically asked questions, including the use of eminent domain and how to participate in the Commission's proceedings. It is also available for viewing on the FERC Web site (www.ferc.gov).
Public Participation
For your convenience, there are three methods you can use to submit your comments to the Commission. The Commission encourages electronic filing of comments and has expert staff available to assist you at (202) 502-8258 or efiling@ferc.gov. Please carefully follow these instructions so that your comments are properly recorded.
(1) You can file your comments electronically using the eComment feature on the Commission's Web site (www.ferc.gov) under the link to Documents and Filings. This is an easy method for submitting brief, text-only comments on a project;
(2) You can file your comments electronically by using the eFiling feature on the Commission's Web site (www.ferc.gov) under the link to Documents and Filings. With eFiling, you can provide comments in a variety of formats by attaching them as a file with your submission. New eFiling users must first create an account by clicking on “eRegister.” If you are filing a comment on a particular project, please select “Comment on a Filing” as the filing type; or
(3) You can file a paper copy of your comments by mailing them to the following address. Be sure to reference the project docket number (CP16-27-000) with your submission: Kimberly D. Bose, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street NE., Room 1A, Washington, DC 20426.
Summary of the Proposed Project
PNGPC is seeking authorization from the Commission under Sections 7(b) and 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) to relocate, replace, and abandon approximately 2.4-miles of a 6- and 8-inch diameter natural gas pipeline extending across the Delaware River Start Printed Page 4287between Delaware County, Pennsylvania and Gloucester County, New Jersey. The pipeline currently transports approximately 38 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCF/d) of natural gas from the Spectra Energy Partners, LP Texas Eastern Transmission 16-inch-diameter pipeline to a refinery owned by Paulsboro Refining Company LLC (PRC), a PNGPC affiliate, in Paulsboro, New Jersey, to support PRC refinery operations. Natural gas transport would increase to 57.7 MMSC/d, and the sole customer served by the pipeline is, and would continue to be, the PRC refinery.
In 2014, an underwater portion of the pipeline was damaged as a result of the United States Army Corps of Engineers' (USACE) dredging activities in the Delaware River, as part of the Delaware River Main Channel Deepening Project (45-Foot Project). The 45-Foot Project is ongoing and the anticipated project completion is 2017. The USACE imposed a deadline to PNGPC to have the pipeline relocated and the segment within the river removed by June 2017.
The Delaware River Pipeline Relocation Project would consist of the following:

Removal of approximately 425-feet of existing pipeline west of the Delaware River shipping channel;
removal of 4,179-feet of existing pipeline near Philadelphia International Airport;
abandonment in place of approximately 8,153-feet of 6- and 8-inch-diameter pipeline;
construction of 2.6 miles of a new 12- and 24-inch-diameter pipeline adjacent to the abandoned line, of that, 8,550-feet will be installed using the horizontal directional drill method under the Delaware River;
installation of a new pig launcher at an existing metering site in Delaware County, Pennsylvania;
modification of an existing PRC connection to include new block valves, check valves, and reducers in Gloucester County, New Jersey; and
construction of a new PRC tie-in facility to include a pig receiver, block valves, and a reducer in Gloucester County, New Jersey.

The general location of the project facilities is shown in appendix 1.[1] 

Land Requirements for Construction
Construction of the proposed facilities would require the temporary use of about 28.6 acres of land. Operation of the facilities would require the permanent use of about 4.5 acres. The remaining 24.2 acres would be restored or reverted to former uses.
The EA Process
The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts that could result from an action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. NEPA also requires us [2] 
           to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. This process is referred to as “scoping.” The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues. By this notice, the Commission requests public comments on the scope of the issues to address in the EA. We will consider all filed comments during the preparation of the EA.
In the EA we will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed project under these general headings:

Geology and soils;
land use;
water resources, fisheries, and wetlands;
cultural resources;
socioeconomics;
vegetation and wildlife;
air quality and noise;
endangered and threatened species;
public safety; and
cumulative impacts.

We will also evaluate reasonable alternatives to the proposed project or portions of the project, and make recommendations on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas.
The EA will present our independent analysis of the issues. The EA will be available in the public record through eLibrary. Depending on the comments received during the scoping process, we may also publish and distribute the EA to the public for an allotted comment period. We will consider all comments on the EA before making our recommendations to the Commission. To ensure we have the opportunity to consider and address your comments, please carefully follow the instructions in the Public Participation section, beginning on page 2.
With this notice, we are asking agencies with jurisdiction by law and/or special expertise with respect to the environmental issues of this project to formally cooperate with us in the preparation of the EA.[3] 
           Agencies that would like to request cooperating agency status should follow the instructions for filing comments provided under the Public Participation section of this notice. Currently, the Federal Aviation Administration, U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Philadelphia District, have expressed their intention to participate as a cooperating agency in the preparation of the EA to satisfy their NEPA responsibilities related to this project.
Consultations Under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
In accordance with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation's implementing regulations for section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, we are using this notice to initiate consultation with the applicable State Historic Preservation Offices (SHPO), and to solicit their views and those of other government agencies, interested Indian tribes, and the public on the project's potential effects on historic properties.[4] 
           We will define the project-specific Area of Potential Effects (APE) in consultation with the SHPOs as the project develops. On natural gas facility projects, the APE at a minimum encompasses all areas subject to ground disturbance (examples include construction right-of-way, contractor/pipe storage yards, compressor stations, and access roads). Our EA for this project will document our findings on the impacts on historic properties and summarize the status of consultations under section 106.
Environmental Mailing List
The environmental mailing list includes federal, state, and local government representatives and agencies; elected officials; environmental and public interest groups; Native American Tribes; other interested parties; and local libraries and newspapers. This list also includes all affected landowners (as defined in the Commission's regulations) who are Start Printed Page 4288potential right-of-way grantors, whose property may be used temporarily for project purposes, or who own homes within certain distances of aboveground facilities, and anyone who submits comments on the project. We will update the environmental mailing list as the analysis proceeds to ensure that we send the information related to this environmental review to all individuals, organizations, and government entities interested in and/or potentially affected by the proposed project.
If we publish and distribute the EA, copies will be sent to the environmental mailing list for public review and comment. If you would prefer to receive a paper copy of the document instead of the CD version or would like to remove your name from the mailing list, please return the attached Information Request (appendix 2).
Becoming an Intervenor
In addition to involvement in the EA scoping process, you may want to become an “intervenor” which is an official party to the Commission's proceeding. Intervenors play a more formal role in the process and are able to file briefs, appear at hearings, and be heard by the courts if they choose to appeal the Commission's final ruling. An intervenor formally participates in the proceeding by filing a request to intervene. Instructions for becoming an intervenor are in the “Document-less Intervention Guide” under the “e-filing” link on the Commission's Web site. Motions to intervene are more fully described at http://www.ferc.gov/​resources/​guides/​how-to/​intervene.asp.

Additional Information
Additional information about the project is available from the Commission's Office of External Affairs, at (866) 208-FERC, or on the FERC Web site at www.ferc.gov using the “eLibrary” link. Click on the eLibrary link, click on “General Search” and enter the docket number, excluding the last three digits in the Docket Number field (i.e., CP16-27). Be sure you have selected an appropriate date range. For assistance, please contact FERC Online Support at FercOnlineSupport@ferc.gov or toll free at (866) 208-3676, or for TTY, contact (202) 502-8659. The eLibrary link also provides access to the texts of formal documents issued by the Commission, such as orders, notices, and rulemakings.
In addition, the Commission offers a free service called eSubscription which allows you to keep track of all formal issuances and submittals in specific dockets. This can reduce the amount of time you spend researching proceedings by automatically providing you with notification of these filings, document summaries, and direct links to the documents. Go to www.ferc.gov/​docs-filing/​esubscription.asp.

Finally, public meetings or site visits will be posted on the Commission's calendar located at www.ferc.gov/​EventCalendar/​EventsList.aspx along with other related information.

Use Advanced Terms?
Yes  
No   







Using Advanced Search
 
    The Advanced Terms capability of our Compliance Expert puts the power of our Lucene-based search engine at your fingertips. 
    It provides you with multiple options for a more powerful and efficient search experience. 
    Importantly, though, by choosing to use Advanced Terms you render the dropdown filters in the Advanced Search null. 
    Hence, you only can use advanced terms or use the preset filters and keywords, but you cannot use both in the same search.
  

About Modifiers and Boolean Search Connectors

    Using the term modifiers below, you will be able to construct a rich query to find results for your search. First, some important background:
  

A query is broken up into terms and operators. There are two types of terms: Single Terms and Phrases.
A Single Term is a single word such as "test" or "hello".
A Phrase is a group of words surrounded by double quotes such as "hello dolly".
Multiple terms can be combined together with Boolean operators to form a more complex query.


    Each term can be further revised by a term modifier:
  

Wildcard Searches

You can perform a wildcard search within a single term, but not within a phrase.
The single character wildcard search looks for terms that match that with the single character replaced. For example, to search for "text" or "test" you can use the search:
        te?t

Multiple character wildcard searches looks for zero or more characters. For example, to search for "test", "tests" or "tester", you can use the search:
        test*

You can also use the wildcard searches in the middle of a term:
        te*t

Note, however, that you cannot use a * or ? symbol as the first character of a search.


Fuzzy Searches

    Fuzzy searches help find words that sound the same but are spelled differently (such as "roam" and "Rome"), 
    words that have alternative spellings("labor" and "labour"), 
    those that are misspelled, and those that include a base word but include prefixes and/or suffixes 
    (search results for the word "plan" will include "preplan" and "planning"). 
    To do a fuzzy search use the tilde symbol (~) at the end of a single-word term. 
    For example to search for a term similar in spelling to "roam" use the fuzzy search:
  

roam~


Proximity Searches

    You can find words that are within a specific distance away from one another. 
    To perform a proximity search, use the tilde symbol (~) followed by the number of words that can separate your search words. 
    For example:
  

"federal corporation"~2 will find "federal deposit insurance corporation".


Term Boosting

    If there is a term in your search query of particular importance, you can increase its relevance to the query using the carat operator (^"). 
    If you want to indicate that the word Treasury is more important in your search, use the query:
  

Treasury^5 guidance


    The higher the boost factor, the more relevant that term will be in your result set.
  

Boolean Operators

    Of course, the search query also supports the standard set of Boolean operators to specify how your search terms should be combined. 
    The default operator is OR, so if there is no operator specified, the query engine assumes an OR.
  

The OR operator links two terms and finds a matching document if either of the terms exist in a document.
The AND operator matches documents where both terms exist anywhere in the text of a single document.
The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term after NOT. It cannot be used with just one term specified in the search.
The NEAR operator links terms and finds a matching document if the terms are located within five words. 


Grouping

    We support using parentheses to group clauses to form sub-queries. 
    This can be useful if you want to control the Boolean logic for a query:
  

(federal AND guidance) OR regulation

Paulsboro Natural Gas Pipeline Co. LLC, 156 FERC ¶61,159 (2016) 











156 FERC ¶ 61,159

	UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
	FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION

	Before Commissioners:  Norman C. Bay, Chairman; Cheryl A. LaFleur, Tony Clark, and Colette D. Honorable.

Paulsboro Natural Gas Pipeline Company LLC

	Docket No. CP16-27-000

	ORDER ISSUING CERTIFICATE AND GRANTING ABANDONMENT

	(Issued September 7, 2016)

	1. On December 1, 2015, Paulsboro Natural Gas Pipeline Company LLC (Paulsboro) filed an application, pursuant to sections 7(b) and (c) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA)[1] and Part 157 of the Commission’s regulations,[2] requesting authorization to relocate an approximately 2.4-mile-long, 6- and 8-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline located between Delaware County, Pennsylvania, and Gloucester County, New Jersey (Delaware River Pipeline Relocation Project).

	2. As discussed below, the Commission will grant the requested authorization, subject to certain conditions.

I. Background and Proposal

	3. Paulsboro, a Delaware limited liability company, is a natural gas company as defined by section 2(6) of the NGA.[3]  Paulsboro is a subsidiary of PBF Holding Company LLC (PBF Holding), which is a subsidiary of PBF Energy Company LLC (PBF Energy Co.).

	4. The pipeline was originally constructed by Mobil Oil Corporation (Mobil Oil) in 1941 as part of a 6.5-mile-long pipeline to deliver refined petroleum products from its refinery in Paulsboro, New Jersey, to a delivery terminal in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[4]  The fuel oil pipeline was later decommissioned in 1972.  In 1998, the Commission issued Paulsboro’s predecessor, Mobil Natural Gas Pipeline Co. (Mobil Natural Gas), a certificate to (1) convert a portion of the pipeline from refined petroleum products service to natural gas service, (2) construct and operate certain appurtenant and interconnection facilities, and (3) to transport natural gas exclusively for Mobil Oil.[5]  The 1998 order allowed Mobil Natural Gas to operate on a proprietary basis and did not require Mobil Natural Gas to provide open access transportation services.  Specifically, the Commission waived the provisions of Part 154 of the regulations that require the filing of a gas tariff because “Mobil Natural Gas will serve only Mobil Oil and does not propose to charge Mobil Oil a transportation rate.”[6]

	5. Paulsboro’s pipeline is approximately 2.4 miles long, originates in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, at an interconnection with Texas Eastern Transmission, LP (Texas Eastern) northwest of the Philadelphia International Airport (Philadelphia Airport), runs under the Delaware River, and terminates at the delivery point to the Paulsboro Refinery in Gloucester County, New Jersey.  The pipeline is currently capable of transporting the equivalent of approximately 40,000 dekatherms per day (Dth/day).  The delivery point to the refinery is adjacent to the Delaware River. [7]

	6. Paulsboro proposes the Delaware River Pipeline Relocation Project to comply with a directive from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to remove a portion of the existing pipe from the Delaware River.  The existing pipeline is within the navigation channel, which is currently being deepened from 40 feet to 45 feet as part of the USACE’s Delaware River Main Channel Deepening Project (Delaware River 45-Foot Project).  On August 4, 2014, a USACE contractor struck and damaged the pipeline during dredging activities.  Paulsboro repaired the damaged pipeline pursuant to its emergency blanket authority and resumed service.  On October 27, 2014, USACE informed Paulsboro that the deadline to remove and relocate the pipeline is June 30, 2017.

	7. Paulsboro proposes to abandon 12,332 feet of 6-and 8-inch-diameter pipeline (including the segment within the navigation channel).  Paulsboro will abandon by removal approximately 4,179 feet of the pipeline, which includes approximately 425 feet of 8-inch-diameter pipeline within the Delaware River navigation channel (straddling Pennsylvania and New Jersey) and approximately 3,754 feet of 6-inch-diameter pipeline within the Philadelphia Airport property in Delaware County, Pennsylvania.  Paulsboro will abandon in place approximately 8,153 feet of the existing pipeline, mainly located on the Philadelphia Airport and on property owned by the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) and by the City of Philadelphia, as well as in certain portions of the Delaware River outside of the navigation channel.[8]

	8. To replace the abandoned pipeline, Paulsboro proposes to install approximately 12,130 feet of 24-inch-diameter pipeline, originating at the interconnection with Texas Eastern, and approximately 1,562 feet of 12-inch-diameter pipeline, from the entry point to Paulsboro, New Jersey, to the tie-in with the refinery facilities.  The increased pipe size will enable Paulsboro to provide up to 60,000 Dth/day of service to the refinery.

	9. In addition, Paulsboro proposes to install a new pig launcher at the Texas Eastern meter station on the Pennsylvania side of the pipeline and to construct a new aboveground Paulsboro Refinery tie-in, which will include a new pig receiver, block valves, and a reducer.

	10. Paulsboro also requests waivers of certain filing, reporting, and other regulatory requirements otherwise applicable to an interstate pipeline owner and operator, and a Part 157, Subpart F blanket construction certificate to perform certain routine activities.

II. Public Notice, Interventions, and Comments

	11. Notice of Paulsboro’s application was issued on December 11, 2015, and published in the Federal Register on December 17, 2015.[9]  The notice established January 4, 2016, as the deadline for filing comments and interventions.  PSEG Energy Resources & Trade, LLC and Conrail filed timely, unopposed motions to intervene, which were granted by operation of Rule 214(c)(1) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice and Procedure.[10]

	12. In its intervention, Conrail raised concerns that Paulsboro had not contacted it to discuss safety related issues, or to request a right of access to the Conrail right-of-way.  Conrail also requested that the Commission condition approval of the application upon Paulsboro’s adherence to Conrail’s safety requirements and that Paulsboro indemnify Conrail of any environmental remediation obligations arising out of construction disturbances.  On January 19, 2016, Paulsboro filed a response to Conrail’s comments stating that it intended to cooperate with Conrail.  On July 13, 2016, Conrail filed a letter stating that it has been negotiating with Paulsboro on the use of Conrail’s right-of-way and was hopeful that an agreement would be reached.

	13. Delaware Riverkeeper Network filed comments about environmental and safety matters including impacts on ecosystems, habits, water quality, and the need for an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).  These comments are addressed in the Environmental Assessment (EA) and, as appropriate, in the environmental section of
	this order.

III. Discussion

	14. Since the facilities Paulsboro seeks to abandon have been used to transport natural gas in interstate commerce subject to the Commission’s jurisdiction and the proposed replacement facilities will be used for jurisdictional service, the proposed abandonment, construction, and operation of the facilities are subject to the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (e) of section 7 of the NGA.

A. Abandonment

	15. Section 7(b) of the NGA allows an interstate pipeline company to abandon jurisdictional facilities only if the abandonment is permitted by the present or future public convenience or necessity.[11]  The applicant has the burden of providing evidence to show that the abandonment is permitted under this standard.  The Commission has stated that continuity and stability of existing service are the primary considerations in assessing the public convenience or necessity of a permanent cessation of service under NGA section 7(b).[12]

	16. Paulsboro requests authorization to abandon by removal and in place approximately 2.4 miles of pipeline extending from its interconnection with Texas Eastern to its tie-in with the Paulsboro Refinery, including pipeline located within the Delaware River.  Paulsboro states that the Delaware River Relocation Project will accommodate USACE’s Delaware River 45-Foot Project, safeguard the continued operation of its pipeline facilities, ensure continuation of existing service to the Paulsboro Refinery, and accommodate potential future commercial operations at the refinery.[13]  Because the facilities to be abandoned will be replaced by the facilities discussed below, the proposed abandonment will not adversely impact the existing customer, the Paulsboro Refinery. 

	17. Based on the above, we find that the proposed abandonment is permitted by the public convenience and necessity.  Therefore, we will approve the abandonment.

B. Replacement Pipeline

1. Certificate Policy Statement

	18. The Commission’s Certificate Policy Statement provides guidance for evaluating proposals to certificate new pipeline construction.[14]  The Certificate Policy Statement establishes criteria for determining whether there is a need for a proposed project and whether the proposed project will serve the public interest.  The Certificate Policy Statement explains that in deciding whether to authorize the construction of major new pipeline facilities, the Commission balances the public benefits against the potential adverse consequences.  The Commission’s goal is to give appropriate consideration to the enhancement of competitive transportation alternatives, the possibility of overbuilding, subsidization by existing customers, the applicant’s responsibility for unsubscribed capacity, the avoidance of unnecessary disruptions of the environment, and the unneeded exercise of eminent domain in evaluating new pipeline construction.

	19. Under this policy, the threshold requirement for existing pipelines proposing new projects is that the pipeline must be prepared to financially support the project without relying on subsidization from its existing customers.  The next step is to determine whether the applicant has made efforts to eliminate or minimize any adverse effects the project might have on the applicant’s existing customers, existing pipelines in the market and their captive customers, or landowners and communities affected by the route of the new facilities.  If residual adverse effects on these interest groups are identified after efforts have been made to minimize them, the Commission will evaluate the project by balancing the evidence of public benefits to be achieved against the residual adverse effects.  This is essentially an economic test.  Only when the benefits outweigh the adverse effects on economic interests will the Commission proceed to complete the environmental analysis where other interests are considered.

	20. As stated above, the threshold requirement for pipelines proposing new projects is that the pipeline must be prepared to financially support the project without relying on subsidization from its existing customers.  The pipeline was constructed as a proprietary line for use exclusively to deliver natural gas to the affiliated Paulsboro Refinery.  Paulsboro provides no service to third-party shippers and does not have a FERC tariff.  Therefore, we find that the threshold no-subsidy requirement has been met.

	21. Because the project is designed to maintain and augment existing service to the current customer, we find the proposal will not degrade service to that customer and there will be no adverse impact on other pipelines or their captive customers.  Further, no pipeline company or their captive customers has protested Paulsboro’s application.

	22. We further find that Paulsboro has taken steps to minimize any adverse impacts on landowners and communities that might be affected by the project.  Paulsboro Refining, Conrail, the Philadelphia Airport, and Dave Henderson are the main property owners affected by the project.  As discussed above, Conrail and Paulsboro continue to negotiate and are optimistic that an agreement will be reached that will permit Paulsboro to cross Conrail’s property.  Paulsboro and Mr. Henderson are continuing to negotiate easement agreements.  The Philadelphia Airport and Paulsboro are also working to revise existing easements and leases to address requirements for the existing pipeline on airport property.[15]

	23. The proposed project will ensure continued transportation of natural gas supplies to the refinery and compliance with the USACE directive and will shield the pipeline from further damage that could result from the Delaware River 45-Foot Project.  Based on the benefits that will result from the project, with no adverse impacts on Paulsboro’s existing customer and other pipelines and their captive customers and minimal impacts on landowners and surrounding communities, we find that Paulsboro’s proposal is consistent with the Certificate Policy Statement, and, as conditioned in this order, is required by the public convenience and necessity.

C. Blanket Construction Certificate

	24. A Part 157 blanket certificate gives an interstate pipeline authority automatically, or after prior notice, to construct, acquire, or abandon eligible pipeline facilities subject to the blanket certificate regulations’ costs limits and environmental conditions.  Because Paulsboro is operating a jurisdictional pipeline facility for which this order grants certificate authorization, we will also grant the requested Part 157, Subpart F blanket construction certificate authorizing Paulsboro’s performance of certain routine activities in conjunction with its operation of the pipeline.

D. Rates and Accounting

	25. Paulsboro requests continuation of a general waiver of the Commission’s rate schedule and tariff filing requirements under Part 154 of the Commission’s regulations that would otherwise apply to its activities under the authority requested.  Paulsboro also requests waiver of a number of accounting and reporting requirements, including those requirements under Parts 158, 201 (including the Uniform System of Accounts), 225, and 250 of the Commission’s regulations.  In addition, Paulsboro requests waiver of Part 260 of the Commission’s regulations, which includes the requirement to file Form Nos. 2 and 2-A.[16]  Although Paulsboro asks for waiver from Part 260, it acknowledges that recent Commission precedent indicates that even if a pipeline receives waiver, it must file Pages 1 and 520 of Form Nos. 2 or 2-A with the Commission.[17]   Therefore, Paulsboro’s requested waiver excludes the annual filing of these pages and, if applicable, payments of the Commission’s Annual Charges Assessment in accordance with the Commission’s regulations.

	26. Paulsboro affirms that it does not intend to transport third-party gas.  Therefore, consistent with previous certificates that were issued to companies with similar operations,[18] the Commission finds the public interest would not be served by subjecting Paulsboro to all of the regulatory requirements applicable to interstate natural gas pipeline companies.  Accordingly, Paulsboro’s request for waiver of the Commission’s otherwise applicable regulatory requirements is granted, as requested.

	27. However, Paulsboro is required to file Page 1 and Page 520 of Form No. 2-A by April 18 of each year.  Moreover, if Paulsboro receives a bona fide request for third-party service, the Commission will reexamine these waivers.  Therefore, this certificate is conditioned to require Paulsboro to apply for blanket transportation authority under Part 284 of the Commission’s regulations within 30 days of Paulsboro’s receipt of any bona fide request to provide service.  In the event of a request for firm transportation service, Paulsboro must comply with the applicable Part 284 reporting obligations and business practices.

E. Environmental Analysis

	28. On January 19, 2016, the Commission issued a Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Assessment for the Proposed Delaware River Pipeline Removal Project and Request for Comments on Environmental Issues (NOI).  The NOI was mailed to interested parties including federal, state, and local officials; agency representatives; environmental and public interest groups; Native American tribes; local libraries and newspapers; and affected property owners.

	29. In response to the NOI, the Commission received comments from three state agencies and one non-governmental organization.  The Commission also received environmental comments with a filed intervention.  The primary issues raised during the scoping process concerned cultural resources, permitting requirements, easement negotiations, and the scope of the Commission’s National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analysis.

	30. To satisfy the requirements of NEPA, our staff prepared an EA for Paulsboro’s proposal that was placed in the public record on July 18, 2016.  All comments received in response to the NOI were addressed in the EA.  The analysis in the EA addresses geology, soils, water resources, wetlands, vegetation, fisheries, wildlife, threatened and endangered species, land use, recreation, visual resources, cultural resources, air quality, noise, safety, cumulative impacts, and alternatives.  No comments were received on the EA.

	31. Based on the analysis in the EA, we conclude that if constructed in accordance with Paulsboro’s application and supplements, and in compliance with the environmental conditions in the Appendix to this order, our approval of this proposal would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

	32. Any state or local permits issued with respect to the jurisdictional facilities authorized herein must be consistent with the conditions of this certificate.  The Commission encourages cooperation between interstate pipelines and local authorities.  However, this does not mean that state and local agencies, through application of state or local laws, may prohibit or unreasonably delay the construction or operation of facilities approved by this Commission.[19]

	33. The Commission, on its own motion, received and made a part of the record in this proceeding all evidence, including the application, as supplemented, and exhibits thereto, and all comments submitted herein, and upon consideration of the record,

The Commission orders:

	(A) A certificate of public convenience and necessity is issued to Paulsboro, authorizing it to construct and operate the proposed project, as described and conditioned herein, and as more fully described in the application.

	(B) A blanket construction certificate is issued to Paulsboro under Subpart F of Part 157 of the Commission’s regulations.

	(C) The certificate authorized in Ordering Paragraph (A) is conditioned on:

	(1) Paulsboro’s proposed project being constructed and made available for service within two years of the date of this order, pursuant to section 157.20(b) of the Commission’s regulations;

	(2) Paulsboro’s compliance with all applicable Commission regulations, particularly the general terms and conditions set forth in paragraphs (a), (c), (e), and (f) of section 157.20 of the Commission’s regulations and all other applicable regulations are not waived pursuant to Ordering Paragraph (E) below; and

	(3) Paulsboro’s compliance with the environmental conditions listed in the Appendix to this order.

	(D) Paulsboro’s request to abandon facilities, as described in this order and in the application, is granted, subject to the conditions described herein and in the Appendix.

	(E) Paulsboro shall notify the Commission within 10 days of the date(s) of its abandonment(s) of facilities as authorized by this order.  Paulsboro shall complete authorized abandonments within one year from the date of this order.

	(F) Paulsboro shall notify the Commission’s environmental staff by telephone, e-mail, and/or facsimile of any environmental noncompliance identified by other federal, state, or local agencies on the same day that such agency notifies Paulsboro.  Paulsboro shall file written confirmation of such notification with the Secretary of the Commission (Secretary) within 24 hours.

	(G) The waiver request is granted of Parts 154, 158, 201, 225, 250, as well as Part 284, and Part 260 of the Commission’s reporting requirements with the exception of Page 1 and Page 520 of FERC Form No. 2-A, subject to review and reconsideration by the Commission if Paulsboro receives a bona fide request for transportation service, as conditioned and more fully discussed above.

	By the Commission.

Paulsboro Natural Gas Company, LLC

Environmental Conditions

	As recommended in the environmental assessment (EA), this authorization includes the following conditions:

	1. Paulsboro shall follow the construction procedures and mitigation measures described in its application and supplemental filings (including responses to staff data requests) and as identified in the EA, unless modified by the order.  Paulsboro must:

	a. request any modification to these procedures, measures, or conditions in a filing with the Secretary of the Commission (Secretary);

	b. justify each modification relative to site-specific conditions;

	c. explain how that modification provides an equal or greater level of environmental protection than the original measure; and

	d. receive approval in writing from the Director of the Office of Energy Projects (OEP) before using that modification.

	2. The Director of OEP has delegated authority to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure the protection of all environmental resources during construction and operation of the project.  This authority shall allow:

	a. the modification of conditions of the order; and

	b. the design and implementation of any additional measures deemed necessary (including stop-work authority) to assure continued compliance with the intent of the environmental conditions as well as the avoidance or mitigation of adverse environmental impact resulting from project construction and operation.

	3. Prior to any construction, Paulsboro shall file an affirmative statement with the Secretary, certified by a senior company official, that all company personnel, environmental inspectors (EIs), and contractor personnel will be informed of the EIs’ authority and have been or will be trained on the implementation of the environmental mitigation measures appropriate to their jobs before becoming involved with construction and restoration activities.

	4. The authorized facility locations shall be as shown in the EA, as supplemented by filed project site drawings.  As soon as they are available, and before the start of construction or abandonment, Paulsboro shall file with the Secretary any revised detailed facility maps/plot plans at a scale not smaller than 1:6,000 with station positions for the facilities approved by the order.  All requests for modifications of environmental conditions of the order or site-specific clearances must be written and must reference locations designated on these maps/plans.

	Paulsboro’s exercise of eminent domain authority granted under the NGA section 7(h) in any condemnation proceedings related to the order must be consistent with these authorized facilities and locations.  Paulsboro’s right of eminent domain granted under the NGA section 7(h) does not authorize it to increase the size of its natural gas facilities to accommodate future needs or to acquire a right-of-way for a pipeline to transport a commodity other than natural gas.

	5. Paulsboro shall file with the Secretary detailed alignment maps/sheets and aerial photographs at a scale not smaller than 1:6,000 identifying all route realignments or facility relocations, and staging areas, pipe storage yards, new access roads,
	and other areas that would be used or disturbed and have not been previously identified in filings with the Secretary.  Approval for each of these areas must be explicitly requested in writing.  For each area, the request must include a description of the existing land use/cover type, documentation of landowner approval, whether any cultural resources or federally listed threatened or endangered species would be affected, and whether any other environmentally sensitive areas are within or abutting the area.  All areas shall be clearly identified on the maps/sheets/aerial photographs.  Each area must be approved in writing by the Director of the OEP before construction in or near that area.

	This requirement does not apply to extra workspace allowed by the Commission’s Upland Erosion Control, Revegetation, and Maintenance Plan and/or minor field realignments per landowner needs and requirements which do not affect other landowners or sensitive environmental areas such as wetlands.

	Examples of alterations requiring approval include all route realignments and facility location changes resulting from:

	(i) implementation of cultural resource mitigation measures;

	(ii) implementation of endangered, threatened, or special concern species mitigation measures;

	(iii) recommendations by state regulatory authorities; and

	(iv) agreements with individual landowners that affect other landowners or could affect sensitive environmental areas.

	6. Within 60 days of the acceptance of the certificate and before construction or abandonment by removal begins, Paulsboro shall file an Implementation Plan with the Secretary for review and written approval by the Director of the OEP.  Paulsboro must file revisions to the plan as schedules change.  The plan shall identify:

	a. how Paulsboro will implement the construction procedures and mitigation measures described in its application and supplements (including responses to staff data requests), identified in the EA, and required by the order;

	b. how Paulsboro will incorporate these requirements into the contract bid documents, construction contracts (especially penalty clauses and specifications), and construction drawings so that the mitigation required at each site is clear to onsite construction and inspection personnel;

	c. the number of EIs assigned, and how the company will ensure that sufficient personnel are available to implement the environmental mitigation;

	d. company personnel, including EIs and contractors, who will receive copies of the appropriate material;

	e. the location and dates of the environmental compliance training and instructions Paulsboro will give to all personnel involved with construction and restoration (initial and refresher training as the project progresses and personnel change);

	f. the company personnel (if known) and specific portion of Paulsboro’s organization having responsibility for compliance;

	g. the procedures (including use of contract penalties) Paulsboro would follow if noncompliance occurs; and

	h. for each discrete facility, a Gantt or PERT chart (or similar project scheduling diagram), and dates for:

	(i) the completion of all required surveys and reports;

	(ii) the environmental compliance training of onsite personnel;

	(iii) the start of construction and abandonment by removal; and

	(iv) the start and completion of restoration.

	7. Paulsboro shall employ at least one EI.  The EI shall be:

	a. responsible for monitoring and ensuring compliance with all mitigation measures required by the order and other grants, permits, certificates, or other authorizing documents;

	b. responsible for evaluating the construction contractor’s implementation of the environmental mitigation measures required in the contract (see condition 6 above) and any other authorizing document;

	c. empowered to order correction of acts that violate the environmental conditions of the order, and any other authorizing document;

	d. a full-time position, separate from all other activity inspectors;

	e. responsible for documenting compliance with the environmental conditions of the order, as well as any environmental conditions/permit requirements imposed by other federal, state, or local agencies; and

	f. responsible for maintaining status reports.

	8. Beginning with the filing of its Implementation Plan, Paulsboro shall file updated status reports with the Secretary on a bi-weekly basis until all abandonment by removal, construction, and restoration activities are complete.  On request, these status reports would also be provided to other federal and state agencies with permitting responsibilities.  Status reports shall include:

	a. an update on Paulsboro’s efforts to obtain the necessary federal authorizations;

	b. the construction status of the project, work planned for the following reporting period, and any schedule changes for stream crossings or work in other environmentally sensitive areas;

	c. a listing of all problems encountered and each instance of noncompliance observed by the EIs during the reporting period (both for the conditions imposed by the Commission and any environmental conditions/permit requirements imposed by other federal, state, or local agencies);

	d. a description of the corrective actions implemented in response to all instances of noncompliance, and their cost;

	e. the effectiveness of all corrective actions implemented;

	f. a description of any landowner/resident complaints which may relate to compliance with the requirements of the order, and the measures taken to satisfy their concerns; and

	g. copies of any correspondence received by Paulsboro from other federal, state, or local permitting agencies concerning instances of noncompliance, and Paulsboro’s response.

	9. Prior to receiving written authorization from the Director of the OEP to commence construction or abandonment of any project facilities, Paulsboro shall file with the Secretary documentation that it has received all applicable authorizations required under federal law (or evidence of waiver thereof).

	10. Paulsboro must receive written authorization from the Director of OEP before placing the new pipeline into service.  Such authorization will only be granted following a determination that rehabilitation and restoration of the right-of-way and other areas affected by the project are proceeding satisfactorily.

	11. Within 30 days of placing the authorized facilities in service, Paulsboro shall file an affirmative statement with the Secretary, certified by a senior company official:

	a. that the facilities have been constructed and abandoned in compliance with all applicable conditions, and that continuing activities will be consistent with all applicable conditions; or

	b. identifying which of the conditions in the order Paulsboro has complied with or will comply with.  This statement shall also identify any areas affected by the project where compliance measures were not properly implemented, if not previously identified in filed status reports, and the reason for noncompliance.

	12. Paulsboro shall not begin construction or abandonment activities until:

	a. Commission staff receives comments from the National Marine Fisheries Service regarding the proposed action relative to the Atlantic sturgeon and shortnose sturgeon;

	b. The Commission completes any necessary Endangered Species Act Section 7 consultation with the National Marine Fisheries Service for the Atlantic sturgeon and shortnose sturgeon; and

	c. Paulsboro has received written approval from the Director of OEP that construction or use of mitigation measures may begin.

	13. Paulsboro shall not begin abandonment or construction until it files with the Secretary a copy of the determination of consistency with the Coastal Zone Management Plan issued by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.

	14. Paulsboro shall not begin construction or abandonment of facilities and/or use of staging, storage, or temporary work areas and new or to-be- improved access roads until:

	a. Paulsboro files with the Secretary comments on the cultural resources report and archaeological avoidance and protection plan from the New Jersey State Historic Preservation Office;

	b. the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation is afforded an opportunity to comment if historic properties would be adversely affected; and

	c. Commission staff reviews and the Director of OEP approves the cultural resources reports and plans, and notifies Paulsboro in writing that treatment plans/mitigation measures (including archaeological data recovery) may be implemented and/or construction may proceed.

	All materials filed with the Commission containing location, character, and ownership information about cultural resources must have the cover and any relevant pages therein clearly labeled in bold lettering:  “CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION - DO NOT RELEASE.”

Royalty Questions and Answers. 
If you are planning to divest your oil and gas royalties, or if you are working on an estate valuation, we can help guide you through the sometimes confusing world of minerals and royalties. There are no questions too simple or too complicated to ask. When it’s as important as your estate, you need to know. Please feel free to call us, and we can give you objective assistance from an experienced professional. 
Why Sell Your Royalty?
Here are some of the reasons one might consider selling their oil and gas royalty interests: 

Estate Liquidation
 Cash Flow Needs
 Paperwork/accounting elimination
 Asset Re-class (Depletable to Non-Depletable)

This last reason to sell your oil and gas interests is that just like any natural resource, your interests deplete with time. Plain and simple, this means your royalty checks ultimately cease and your ultimate asset valuation is zero. Selling your interest and investing in a non-depletable asset class (real estate, securities, certificates of deposits) aids in securing the corpus or principal part of your investment. This is why many professional money managers elect to sell.
Estate Valuation
When someone leaves behind a mineral interest in their estate, sometimes it becomes a burden for the person who receives the inheritance. Whether it’s the unfamiliar paperwork or the burden of maintenance involved, heirs of mineral estates can call Anthem for help. We will gladly help valuate your mineral interest and make an offer. Some of our clients use our valuations in probate proceedings.

How We Value Your Interests.
Anthem Oil and Gas, Inc. has well over 50 years combined royalty experience among its principal partners, including our Chief Geologist, Dan George, who served as an exploration and development geologist for Texaco and Chevron Texaco for 23 years. 
Anthem will not send you a blanket offer in a letter based on some errant tax roll value. We take the time and effort to make sure it is valued properly, via your check stub detail, production histories and reservoir characteristics, which most of the time, equates to a larger offer for you.
Following are factors we consider when valuing your minerals/royalties/overrides:

Historical production performance
 Reservoir characteristics
 Commodity pricing
 Concentration risk (one well vs. multiple wells like in a unit)
 Future drilling possibilities
 Operator

To determine the value of an interest, we begin at looking at the specific reservoir. Since oil and gas are depleting resources, every reservoir of petroleum has a decline rate feature. Anthem determines the decline rate of the reservoir and from that information, we can determine how many months of reserves are probably left. The number of months of reserves are indirectly proportionate to the steepness of the decline curve. Every reservoir has its own unique characteristics, due to a vast array of reasons, whether geological or even what gathering techniques the operator uses, such as water or gas driven reserves. Once we have determined the volume and characteristics of the reserves, we begin to value the interest.
Value is then determined by current commodity price versus future pricing, appropriate discount rate and how we want to ‘risk back’ value, meaning the cost of capital versus some risk variable.
Simply put, reservoirs end up depleting (meaning that all royalty checks eventually cease with time). Royalty owners are in essence selling part of their reserves each month that they receive a check. Our acquiring your interest is just a matter of adding all your future check amounts, applying a fair discount rate to account for both interest and risk, and offering you that amount. Upon your receiving our offer, we are happy to go over all the variable factors included in our evaluation, including our discount rates and risk allocation, This open book policy is what differentiates us from any other buyer of oil and gas royalties that we are aware of in this industry.
How does it work?
This is the easy part. If you would like a free “no obligation” evaluation and offer for your interest(s), please call us at (432) 684-8200 and/or fax your most recent monthly check stubs from your properties to (432) 685-3143. Upon our receipt of your information, we will generate a preliminary offer for your interest as soon as possible. Anthem will pay for all costs associated with deed preparation, title review and other closing expenses. If you accept our offer, we will review your title, then you will get your funds in just a few weeks.

What about non-producing mineral interests?
We are also interested in purchasing your non-producing mineral interests as well. Please contact us to find out more.

  Pipe2016: Steam (Steam Analysis)








Pipe2016: Steam (Steam Analysis)







Pipe2016: Steam analyzes the steady state flows and pressures in steam distribution networks. Flows are steady, one-dimensional, and saturated. Pipe2016: SuperSteam is an advanced version of Steam. SuperSteam was developed specifically for modeling distribution networks designed for superheated steam.




Pipe2016: Steam is useful for determining the effects of demand or load changes. It can accommodate large networks, looped systems, and multiple supply and load points. Several scenarios may be set up in a single model, such as load changes or open/closed valves.










CALCULATION FEATURES
MODEL FEATURES







Uses appropriate data from the latest steam tables to calculate the required state parameters (IAPWS-IF97).
Automatically balances mass, energy and other thermo-dynamic equations irrespective of the model complexity.
Allows for multiple scenario simulations in one model run, e.g., what-if scenarios, such as:

Studying the effect of increasing or decreasing of load factors in a single run.
Changing certain model parameters/characteristics, e.g., pipe diameter, pipe roughness, on/off status of a valve, specific load change at any node.





Multiple compressors with pressure-flow
characteristic
Multiple pressure reducing valves (PRVs)
Multiple steam generating sources (both high and low pressure stations)
User-specified steam loads
Wide variety of supported elements & devices
Powerful GUI features








INPUT
OUTPUT REPORTS




SYSTEMS PARAMETERS:
 



Reference Pressure – highest supply pressure for the system
Global Load – factor that may be applied to assigned loads
Pipes – Diameter, Darcy-Weisbach roughness, fittings (bends, T’s, reducers, etc.), length (may be scaled by default)
Nodes – Elevations, loads
Compressors/Fans – Pressure/flow characteristics or useful power
Supplies – Supply pressure or pressure/flow characteristics for variable pressure supplies
Loss Elements – Loss/flow characteristics
Regulators – Pressure setting
General  – No initial flow or pressure assumptions are required. Any number of parameter changes may be made within the same analysis. At least one fixed pressure node or reservoir is required for each system.




Low pressure areas are highlighted
Highest mach number (indication of choking condition) and the pipeline in which it occurred is listed
Summary of results including total load in the system
Flows in/out of each supply/receiving node
Detailed report on pressure reducing valves (PRVs), flow rates, specified pressure setting, pressure drop
Detailed report on compressor operation





*Mass Flow Units – English or SI. kg/hr, lb (mass)/hr, MBTU/hr

  Pipe2016: Surge Overview








Pipe2016: Surge Overview


Pipe2016: Surge is state-of-the-art transient analysis software. Surge provides an advanced graphical interface and allows an easy transition between steady-state and transient flow modeling. More than 40 years of extensive development brings an integrated surge analysis program that includes numerous advanced features and produces astonishingly fast analysis. Surge has been extensively tested and verified. It has been widely used by various industries, including applications at nuclear facilities. Several thousand software packages have been supplied to engineers worldwide.
Transient (surge) protection and analysis is crucial to the success of a hydraulic distribution system. Surge analysis should be included in the design phase to ensure the safety and the long- and short-term reliability of the system.
Download the demo and experience first-hand this powerful transient analysis software. The Surge demo includes: 10 pipes, 1 Pump, 1 SDO, 1 active valve and 1000 feet (300m) total pipe length with a 6-inch (150mm) pipe diameter.
