He remembers the moment like it was yesterday.“Next to the birth of my children, it’s the greatest achievement I’ve ever had,” Kopelson says. “There’s no high like an Academy Award.”Kopelson, now 79, can vividly recall everything about the date of March 24, 1986. He remembers that Dustin Hoffman nearly announced the Best Picture winner without naming the nominees, that he was wiping wife Anne’s lipstick off his mouth in front of 38.93 million viewers and that his best laid plans went awry: despite rehearsing his speech in front of a video camera and writing careful “crib notes,” he was so overcome by the win that he briefly lost the power of speech.“I got through the first two sentences before my mouth dried up to such an extent that I could barely open my jaw. The nerves had gotten to me,” the producer admits. “I had a momentary loss of speech. I looked down at the cards in my hand and they were all out of order. I can’t tell you what the panic was like.”But Kopelson, of course, pulled it together and walked offstage to thunderous applause after giving what he proudly reaffirms was a “great speech.” This is the moment that made Arnold Kopelson, the gave him the career he has today. It is why “everyone in this town – everybody — takes my call.” Because he never intended to have a career in the entertainment industry – never mind such a successful one – the enormity of his achievement is staggering.Kopelson started his career in the commercial world as a lawyer for motion pictures and banking, which eventually brought him into production. It wasn’t until he was practicing at a firm that represented several banks that were making loans to film companies that Kopelson started learning the language of entertainment, so to speak. He began traveling around the world with an independent movie financier and realized there was a specific niche he could fill in the international market for film financing.What he found was a Western called The Last Rebel starring legendary NFL star Joe Namath. “He was not an actor,” Kopelson admits. “I didn’t realize how bad the movie was, but it sold all over the world. I made more money in my press book with that one film than in any year of being a lawyer. Everyone wanted that movie.”Arnold with Joel Schumacher and Michael Douglas on the set of Falling DownArnold with Michael Douglas on the set of Falling DownThe popularity of the film set Kopelson on his path of success licensing the movies of others. “I set up deals, I’d get a completion guarantee, and then I’d start the movie with a profit. That lasted until movies started to get very expensive, and it brought me into larger productions. But by that time, Platoon had happened.”He recalls the moment he first read Platoon’s script, which was written by the then-virtually unknown Oliver Stone. “I was overcome,” he recalls. “I called Oliver when I had read 50 pages, and he said, ‘Not so fast; finish the script.’ So I got into bed with Anne, and I started reading. I got goose flesh. I pictured myself as the star, walking through the jungle and never knowing when I was going to get a bullet in the head. I was totally captivated by the writing. I had an actual fantasy of winning an Academy Award while I was reading it. I thought it was the greatest writing I had ever seen.“When I finished, I had tears streaming down my face. Anne asked what was wrong, and I told her I was incredibly moved. She asked, ‘Will it make money?’ I said, ‘I really don’t know, but it’s just real quality and I have to make it. She told me to follow my instincts, so I met with Stone and we made a partnership to do the film.”Few realize that the making of Platoon almost didn’t happen with Stone as a director, but that Kopelson figured out a way to save the day.  “Oliver was just great, but Orion [the film company that produced Platoon] didn’t know if he could direct; they thought he couldn’t do it. He was working on a film called Salvador and Orion wanted him to make cuts because they thought it was too violent, and he was refusing. So I put my legal hat on and found out what specific cuts they wanted to make. I said, ‘If he makes these cuts, will you wholly or partially finance Platoon?’ They said yes, so I prepared the contract, specifying the cuts, and then met with Oliver and said, ‘This is your chance to make the movie of your dreams.’”The rest, as they say, is history, forging a relationship between the two men that has lasted for nearly 30 years. “I saw Oliver a few weeks ago; we’ve maintained a relationship,” Kopelson says now, adding, “I have great feelings for him for making Platoon. It was his dream, his story and an extraordinary movie. I’m grateful to him. It got me an Oscar early on in my career.” That career is one of success. His 30 movies to date such as Se7en, A Perfect Murder and Eraser have earned over $3 billion globally and have been responsible for one Academy Award and an additional 17 nominations. And it just keeps on going: Kopelson currently has a plethora of projects in development.“I’m busier now that I have been in years,” the producer admits. He is working on several films as well as two television series, which is a natural evolution considering that he’s sat on the Board of Directors at CBS for nearly seven years. “We just closed a deal to do a television series based on my movie, Devil’s Advocate, with John Wells Productions, and I’m also acting as a consultant on a series based on my movie, Outbreak, and an untitled series about going to Mars. It’s a reality-based fictional story,” he says.He is working on four films, including a picture that Oscar winner William Friedkin will direct, as well as a film about George Gershwin and another based on the life of Dennis Hopper. The latter is currently being written and has been approved by the late actor’s family; he is working closely with the icon’s daughter on the project.The film Kopelson is most enthusiastic about is his remake of Alfred Hitchcock’s 1951 thriller Strangers on a Train, which he’s developing for Warner Bros. He reveals that the modern-day version is ever-so-slightly tweaked from the original. The plot revolves around two strangers – a tennis player and a psychopath – who meet on a train. The psychopath suggests that because each of the characters wants to “get rid” of someone, they should swap murders and thus, neither will get caught.David Seltzer, the writer of Bird on a Wire and The Omen has changed the tennis player character of Guy to a businessman with the same name who is about to be named Chairman of a highly profitable company; the psychopath, Bruno, will remain the same. “I want to get a major player for the Bruno role,” Kopelson says. “We’re in the process of going after that now.”Though he’s certainly going to have a hand in the casting process, Kopelson notes that he won’t have complete control, which is quite unlike what he was used to at the beginning of his career. “Hollywood is very different now,” he acknowledges. “On every one of my movies, I would cast every role. I would cast the major parts, the studio would approve it and then I would work with a casting agent for all of the minor roles; for that I wouldn’t have to get studio approval. Today, if you can get a movie made at all, you’re lucky.”Despite his success, Kopelson is also familiar with rejection. “Every movie I’ve ever made has been rejected somewhere, and I’m talking about the blockbusters,” he admits. “You have to have passion, persistence and determination. Those are the three qualities that one must possess to be a successful producer and to make great movies. And I do persist. I don’t care if I’ve been turned down five times…I like to win.” PREVIOUS POST  NEXT POST Detail TherapyThe Suite Life: Five Of The Top Hotels In Beverly Hills Are Celebrating The City's Centennial Year In Styleconnect with haute living NationalFacebookTwitterPinterestInstagramWant haute living newsletter delivered to your inbox?

Life and career[edit]
Kopelson was born in Brooklyn, USA. After earning a Doctorate in Jurisprudence from New York Law School, Kopelson practiced entertainment and banking law, specializing in motion picture financing, and for many years acted as counsel to numerous banks and financial institutions serving the motion picture industry.
Kopelson later formed Inter-Ocean Film Sales, Ltd. with Anne Feinberg, who would become his wife, to represent independent motion picture producers in licensing their films throughout the world and also to finance motion picture production. The Kopelsons now produce films together.
Arnold Kopelson has produced 29 motion pictures. He has been honored with an Academy Award for Best Picture, a Golden Globe Award, and an Independent Spirit Award, all for his production of Platoon. He received a Best Picture Academy Award nomination for his production of The Fugitive. Kopelson's films have been collectively responsible for 17 Academy Award nominations and over $3 billion in worldwide receipts.
Kopelson was named Producer of the Year by The National Association of Theatre Owners, was honored with a Lifetime Achievement in Filmmaking Award from Cinema Expo International, received the Motion Picture Showmanship Award from the Publicist Guild of America, and was inducted into Variety's Show Biz Expo Hall of Fame. He has also received other awards for his productions of Outbreak, Seven, and The Devil's Advocate and was further honored by the Deauville Film Festival with its highest award for his significant contribution to the entertainment industry.
With Paramount Pictures, Kopelson produced Twisted, starring Samuel L. Jackson, Andy García and Ashley Judd, which was directed by Philip Kaufman; and with 20th Century Fox, Don't Say a Word, starring Michael Douglas, and Joe Somebody, starring Tim Allen.
Kopelson also produced A Perfect Murder, also starring Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow, U.S. Marshals, starring Tommy Lee Jones, and the Costa Gavras-directed film, Mad City, starring Dustin Hoffman and John Travolta.
His other films include Eraser, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger; Falling Down, starring Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall; Out for Justice, starring Steven Seagal; Triumph of the Spirit, starring Willem Dafoe; and Murder at 1600, starring Wesley Snipes and Diane Lane.
For many years, Kopelson has served on the Executive Committee of the Producers Branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and is a member of the Board of Mentors of the Peter Stark Motion Picture Producing Program at the University of Southern California.
He has lectured on filmmaking at Harvard Business School, American Film Institute, Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, New York Law School, the Writers Guild of America, the Independent Feature Project West, The Kagan Seminar, University of Southern California, and University of California at Los Angeles, among other places, and has also written several articles about motion picture financing. In 1998, Kopelson received the New York Law School Distinguished Alumnus Award for Lifetime Achievement.
Arnold Kopelson has been a member of the Board of Directors of CBS Corporation since March 2007. While continuing to develop and produce motion pictures, Kopelson's activities are centered on television production.
Personal life[edit]
He is married to Anne Kopelson. They have a daughter, Stephanie Lisa Kopelson, and two sons, Peter Laurence Kopelson, Evan Jared Kopelson.[1] The Kopelsons live in Beverly Hills, California.

Life and career[edit]
Kopelson was born in Brooklyn, USA. After earning a Doctorate in Jurisprudence from New York Law School, Kopelson practiced entertainment and banking law, specializing in motion picture financing, and for many years acted as counsel to numerous banks and financial institutions serving the motion picture industry.
Kopelson later formed Inter-Ocean Film Sales, Ltd. with Anne Feinberg, who would become his wife, to represent independent motion picture producers in licensing their films throughout the world and also to finance motion picture production. The Kopelsons now produce films together.
Arnold Kopelson has produced 29 motion pictures. He has been honored with an Academy Award for Best Picture, a Golden Globe Award, and an Independent Spirit Award, all for his production of Platoon. He received a Best Picture Academy Award nomination for his production of The Fugitive. Kopelson's films have been collectively responsible for 17 Academy Award nominations and over $3 billion in worldwide receipts.
Kopelson was named Producer of the Year by The National Association of Theatre Owners, was honored with a Lifetime Achievement in Filmmaking Award from Cinema Expo International, received the Motion Picture Showmanship Award from the Publicist Guild of America, and was inducted into Variety's Show Biz Expo Hall of Fame. He has also received other awards for his productions of Outbreak, Seven, and The Devil's Advocate and was further honored by the Deauville Film Festival with its highest award for his significant contribution to the entertainment industry.
With Paramount Pictures, Kopelson produced Twisted, starring Samuel L. Jackson, Andy García and Ashley Judd, which was directed by Philip Kaufman; and with 20th Century Fox, Don't Say a Word, starring Michael Douglas, and Joe Somebody, starring Tim Allen.
Kopelson also produced A Perfect Murder, also starring Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow, U.S. Marshals, starring Tommy Lee Jones, and the Costa Gavras-directed film, Mad City, starring Dustin Hoffman and John Travolta.
His other films include Eraser, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger; Falling Down, starring Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall; Out for Justice, starring Steven Seagal; Triumph of the Spirit, starring Willem Dafoe; and Murder at 1600, starring Wesley Snipes and Diane Lane.
For many years, Kopelson has served on the Executive Committee of the Producers Branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and is a member of the Board of Mentors of the Peter Stark Motion Picture Producing Program at the University of Southern California.
He has lectured on filmmaking at Harvard Business School, American Film Institute, Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, New York Law School, the Writers Guild of America, the Independent Feature Project West, The Kagan Seminar, University of Southern California, and University of California at Los Angeles, among other places, and has also written several articles about motion picture financing. In 1998, Kopelson received the New York Law School Distinguished Alumnus Award for Lifetime Achievement.
Arnold Kopelson has been a member of the Board of Directors of CBS Corporation since March 2007. While continuing to develop and produce motion pictures, Kopelson's activities are centered on television production.
Personal life[edit]
He is married to Anne Kopelson. They have a daughter, Stephanie Lisa Kopelson, and two sons, Peter Laurence Kopelson, Evan Jared Kopelson.[1] The Kopelsons live in Beverly Hills, California.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
