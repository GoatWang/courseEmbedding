History[edit]
In October 2009, the company was founded as OS76 by John Colgrove and John Hayes. Mike Speiser of Sutter Hill Ventures was an early board member.[2] It raised a $5 million series A round led by Sutter Hill. In August 2010, it raised another $20 million, led by Greylock Partners with participation by Sutter Hill. Scott Dietzen, former president and CTO of Zimbra (acquired by VMware in January 2010), and former CTO of BEA Systems, became chief executive in October 2010.[3] In August 2011, the company announced an investment from the venture-capital arm of Samsung Electronics, which along with Redpoint Ventures contributed to a $30 million series C funding round.[4] Vice president of engineering Bob Wood joined at that time from Omneon (acquired by Harmonic, Inc.).[5]
In August 2012, Pure Storage raised $40 million in series D funding round led by Index Ventures partner Mike Volpi, along with existing investors.[6] An investment of undisclosed amount from In-Q-Tel (associated with the US Central Intelligence Agency) was announced in May 2013.[7] Another investment (round "E") of $150 million was announced in August 2013, including T. Rowe Price and Tiger Global Management.[8]
In October 2013, EMC Corporation filed lawsuits against several former sales employees who left to join Pure Storage.[9][10] A $225 million series F funding round closed in April 2014.[11] Tim Riitters, a former Google exec, joined as chief financial officer (CFO) in August 2014.
On October 6, 2015, Pure Storage priced their initial public offering at $17 per share, raising about $400 million.[12] It started trading on the New York Stock Exchange with the symbol PSTG.[13]
FlashArray[edit]
Pure Storage released a flash memory product called FlashArray on August 23, 2011.[1] Deployed in a data center, FlashArray is marketed to accelerate applications like server virtualization, desktop virtualization, database systems and cloud computing that required very high rates of random I/O operations per second.[14] InfiniBand technology connected controllers, and Fibre Channel connected to server computers.[15]
The second generation FlashArray, released on May 16, 2012, included new software and an enhanced data integrity fabric.[16] It was promoted with higher resiliency, encryption with zero key management, a new web user interface, command line interface, and support for VMware's vStorage interface.[17] In August 2012, the firm released new software features including iSCSI connectivity using 10 Gigabit Ethernet, snapshots, and integration with VMware vCenter.[18]
Pure Storage used multi-level cell flash memory which has higher capacity, for the same price, than single-level cell memory, at the cost of increased wear on and reduced life expectancy of the cells. Using software such as data compression known as data deduplication, the firm markets the FlashArray to compete with traditional rotating disk arrays.[19] The company estimated FlashArray required about 20% of the power and space required for traditional arrays.[20] The firm's flash memory is packaged in shelves of solid state memory devices (SSDs), from two known suppliers, sTec, Inc. and Samsung.[21]
FlashBlade[edit]
FlashBlade is Pure's second all-flash offering designed for high-performance workloads.[22]
Awards[edit]

History[edit]
In October 2009, the company was founded as OS76 by John Colgrove and John Hayes. Mike Speiser of Sutter Hill Ventures was an early board member.[2] It raised a $5 million series A round led by Sutter Hill. In August 2010, it raised another $20 million, led by Greylock Partners with participation by Sutter Hill. Scott Dietzen, former president and CTO of Zimbra (acquired by VMware in January 2010), and former CTO of BEA Systems, became chief executive in October 2010.[3] In August 2011, the company announced an investment from the venture-capital arm of Samsung Electronics, which along with Redpoint Ventures contributed to a $30 million series C funding round.[4] Vice president of engineering Bob Wood joined at that time from Omneon (acquired by Harmonic, Inc.).[5]
In August 2012, Pure Storage raised $40 million in series D funding round led by Index Ventures partner Mike Volpi, along with existing investors.[6] An investment of undisclosed amount from In-Q-Tel (associated with the US Central Intelligence Agency) was announced in May 2013.[7] Another investment (round "E") of $150 million was announced in August 2013, including T. Rowe Price and Tiger Global Management.[8]
In October 2013, EMC Corporation filed lawsuits against several former sales employees who left to join Pure Storage.[9][10] A $225 million series F funding round closed in April 2014.[11] Tim Riitters, a former Google exec, joined as chief financial officer (CFO) in August 2014.
On October 6, 2015, Pure Storage priced their initial public offering at $17 per share, raising about $400 million.[12] It started trading on the New York Stock Exchange with the symbol PSTG.[13]
FlashArray[edit]
Pure Storage released a flash memory product called FlashArray on August 23, 2011.[1] Deployed in a data center, FlashArray is marketed to accelerate applications like server virtualization, desktop virtualization, database systems and cloud computing that required very high rates of random I/O operations per second.[14] InfiniBand technology connected controllers, and Fibre Channel connected to server computers.[15]
The second generation FlashArray, released on May 16, 2012, included new software and an enhanced data integrity fabric.[16] It was promoted with higher resiliency, encryption with zero key management, a new web user interface, command line interface, and support for VMware's vStorage interface.[17] In August 2012, the firm released new software features including iSCSI connectivity using 10 Gigabit Ethernet, snapshots, and integration with VMware vCenter.[18]
Pure Storage used multi-level cell flash memory which has higher capacity, for the same price, than single-level cell memory, at the cost of increased wear on and reduced life expectancy of the cells. Using software such as data compression known as data deduplication, the firm markets the FlashArray to compete with traditional rotating disk arrays.[19] The company estimated FlashArray required about 20% of the power and space required for traditional arrays.[20] The firm's flash memory is packaged in shelves of solid state memory devices (SSDs), from two known suppliers, sTec, Inc. and Samsung.[21]
FlashBlade[edit]
FlashBlade is Pure's second all-flash offering designed for high-performance workloads.[22]
Awards[edit]
In 2015, Pure Storage was awarded the best place to work by the San Francisco Business Times, in the large companies category.[23] Pure Storage was named as silver winner in the Wall Street Journal 2012 Technology Innovation Awards.[24] Pure Storage and Samsung won one of two awards for enterprise business applications at an August 2012 flash memory trade show.[25] Pure Storage was selected for the Red Herring Top 100 Americas Award in 2012.[26] Pure Storage was named one of 10 "hot emerging companies" by CRN Magazine in May 2012.[27] Pure Storage was among the top 25 best places to work in Silicon Valley, of companies with 51-101 employees by the San Francisco Business Times.[28] Pure Storage announced it was a silver winner of the Enterprise Product of the Year in Best in Biz Awards 2011.[29]

History[edit]
In October 2009, the company was founded as OS76 by John Colgrove and John Hayes. Mike Speiser of Sutter Hill Ventures was an early board member.[2] It raised a $5 million series A round led by Sutter Hill. In August 2010, it raised another $20 million, led by Greylock Partners with participation by Sutter Hill. Scott Dietzen, former president and CTO of Zimbra (acquired by VMware in January 2010), and former CTO of BEA Systems, became chief executive in October 2010.[3] In August 2011, the company announced an investment from the venture-capital arm of Samsung Electronics, which along with Redpoint Ventures contributed to a $30 million series C funding round.[4] Vice president of engineering Bob Wood joined at that time from Omneon (acquired by Harmonic, Inc.).[5]
In August 2012, Pure Storage raised $40 million in series D funding round led by Index Ventures partner Mike Volpi, along with existing investors.[6] An investment of undisclosed amount from In-Q-Tel (associated with the US Central Intelligence Agency) was announced in May 2013.[7] Another investment (round "E") of $150 million was announced in August 2013, including T. Rowe Price and Tiger Global Management.[8]
In October 2013, EMC Corporation filed lawsuits against several former sales employees who left to join Pure Storage.[9][10] A $225 million series F funding round closed in April 2014.[11] Tim Riitters, a former Google exec, joined as chief financial officer (CFO) in August 2014.
On October 6, 2015, Pure Storage priced their initial public offering at $17 per share, raising about $400 million.[12] It started trading on the New York Stock Exchange with the symbol PSTG.[13]
FlashArray[edit]
Pure Storage released a flash memory product called FlashArray on August 23, 2011.[1] Deployed in a data center, FlashArray is marketed to accelerate applications like server virtualization, desktop virtualization, database systems and cloud computing that required very high rates of random I/O operations per second.[14] InfiniBand technology connected controllers, and Fibre Channel connected to server computers.[15]
The second generation FlashArray, released on May 16, 2012, included new software and an enhanced data integrity fabric.[16] It was promoted with higher resiliency, encryption with zero key management, a new web user interface, command line interface, and support for VMware's vStorage interface.[17] In August 2012, the firm released new software features including iSCSI connectivity using 10 Gigabit Ethernet, snapshots, and integration with VMware vCenter.[18]
Pure Storage used multi-level cell flash memory which has higher capacity, for the same price, than single-level cell memory, at the cost of increased wear on and reduced life expectancy of the cells. Using software such as data compression known as data deduplication, the firm markets the FlashArray to compete with traditional rotating disk arrays.[19] The company estimated FlashArray required about 20% of the power and space required for traditional arrays.[20] The firm's flash memory is packaged in shelves of solid state memory devices (SSDs), from two known suppliers, sTec, Inc. and Samsung.[21]
FlashBlade[edit]
FlashBlade is Pure's second all-flash offering designed for high-performance workloads.[22]
Awards[edit]
In 2015, Pure Storage was awarded the best place to work by the San Francisco Business Times, in the large companies category.[23] Pure Storage was named as silver winner in the Wall Street Journal 2012 Technology Innovation Awards.[24] Pure Storage and Samsung won one of two awards for enterprise business applications at an August 2012 flash memory trade show.[25] Pure Storage was selected for the Red Herring Top 100 Americas Award in 2012.[26] Pure Storage was named one of 10 "hot emerging companies" by CRN Magazine in May 2012.[27] Pure Storage was among the top 25 best places to work in Silicon Valley, of companies with 51-101 employees by the San Francisco Business Times.[28] Pure Storage announced it was a silver winner of the Enterprise Product of the Year in Best in Biz Awards 2011.[29]

History[edit]
In October 2009, the company was founded as OS76 by John Colgrove and John Hayes. Mike Speiser of Sutter Hill Ventures was an early board member.[2] It raised a $5 million series A round led by Sutter Hill. In August 2010, it raised another $20 million, led by Greylock Partners with participation by Sutter Hill. Scott Dietzen, former president and CTO of Zimbra (acquired by VMware in January 2010), and former CTO of BEA Systems, became chief executive in October 2010.[3] In August 2011, the company announced an investment from the venture-capital arm of Samsung Electronics, which along with Redpoint Ventures contributed to a $30 million series C funding round.[4] Vice president of engineering Bob Wood joined at that time from Omneon (acquired by Harmonic, Inc.).[5]
In August 2012, Pure Storage raised $40 million in series D funding round led by Index Ventures partner Mike Volpi, along with existing investors.[6] An investment of undisclosed amount from In-Q-Tel (associated with the US Central Intelligence Agency) was announced in May 2013.[7] Another investment (round "E") of $150 million was announced in August 2013, including T. Rowe Price and Tiger Global Management.[8]
In October 2013, EMC Corporation filed lawsuits against several former sales employees who left to join Pure Storage.[9][10] A $225 million series F funding round closed in April 2014.[11] Tim Riitters, a former Google exec, joined as chief financial officer (CFO) in August 2014.
On October 6, 2015, Pure Storage priced their initial public offering at $17 per share, raising about $400 million.[12] It started trading on the New York Stock Exchange with the symbol PSTG.[13]
FlashArray[edit]
Pure Storage released a flash memory product called FlashArray on August 23, 2011.[1] Deployed in a data center, FlashArray is marketed to accelerate applications like server virtualization, desktop virtualization, database systems and cloud computing that required very high rates of random I/O operations per second.[14] InfiniBand technology connected controllers, and Fibre Channel connected to server computers.[15]
The second generation FlashArray, released on May 16, 2012, included new software and an enhanced data integrity fabric.[16] It was promoted with higher resiliency, encryption with zero key management, a new web user interface, command line interface, and support for VMware's vStorage interface.[17] In August 2012, the firm released new software features including iSCSI connectivity using 10 Gigabit Ethernet, snapshots, and integration with VMware vCenter.[18]
Pure Storage used multi-level cell flash memory which has higher capacity, for the same price, than single-level cell memory, at the cost of increased wear on and reduced life expectancy of the cells. Using software such as data compression known as data deduplication, the firm markets the FlashArray to compete with traditional rotating disk arrays.[19] The company estimated FlashArray required about 20% of the power and space required for traditional arrays.[20] The firm's flash memory is packaged in shelves of solid state memory devices (SSDs), from two known suppliers, sTec, Inc. and Samsung.[21]
FlashBlade[edit]
FlashBlade is Pure's second all-flash offering designed for high-performance workloads.[22]
Awards[edit]
In 2015, Pure Storage was awarded the best place to work by the San Francisco Business Times, in the large companies category.[23] Pure Storage was named as silver winner in the Wall Street Journal 2012 Technology Innovation Awards.[24] Pure Storage and Samsung won one of two awards for enterprise business applications at an August 2012 flash memory trade show.[25] Pure Storage was selected for the Red Herring Top 100 Americas Award in 2012.[26] Pure Storage was named one of 10 "hot emerging companies" by CRN Magazine in May 2012.[27] Pure Storage was among the top 25 best places to work in Silicon Valley, of companies with 51-101 employees by the San Francisco Business Times.[28] Pure Storage announced it was a silver winner of the Enterprise Product of the Year in Best in Biz Awards 2011.[29]

History[edit]
In October 2009, the company was founded as OS76 by John Colgrove and John Hayes. Mike Speiser of Sutter Hill Ventures was an early board member.[2] It raised a $5 million series A round led by Sutter Hill. In August 2010, it raised another $20 million, led by Greylock Partners with participation by Sutter Hill. Scott Dietzen, former president and CTO of Zimbra (acquired by VMware in January 2010), and former CTO of BEA Systems, became chief executive in October 2010.[3] In August 2011, the company announced an investment from the venture-capital arm of Samsung Electronics, which along with Redpoint Ventures contributed to a $30 million series C funding round.[4] Vice president of engineering Bob Wood joined at that time from Omneon (acquired by Harmonic, Inc.).[5]
In August 2012, Pure Storage raised $40 million in series D funding round led by Index Ventures partner Mike Volpi, along with existing investors.[6] An investment of undisclosed amount from In-Q-Tel (associated with the US Central Intelligence Agency) was announced in May 2013.[7] Another investment (round "E") of $150 million was announced in August 2013, including T. Rowe Price and Tiger Global Management.[8]
In October 2013, EMC Corporation filed lawsuits against several former sales employees who left to join Pure Storage.[9][10] A $225 million series F funding round closed in April 2014.[11] Tim Riitters, a former Google exec, joined as chief financial officer (CFO) in August 2014.
On October 6, 2015, Pure Storage priced their initial public offering at $17 per share, raising about $400 million.[12] It started trading on the New York Stock Exchange with the symbol PSTG.[13]
FlashArray[edit]
Pure Storage released a flash memory product called FlashArray on August 23, 2011.[1] Deployed in a data center, FlashArray is marketed to accelerate applications like server virtualization, desktop virtualization, database systems and cloud computing that required very high rates of random I/O operations per second.[14] InfiniBand technology connected controllers, and Fibre Channel connected to server computers.[15]
The second generation FlashArray, released on May 16, 2012, included new software and an enhanced data integrity fabric.[16] It was promoted with higher resiliency, encryption with zero key management, a new web user interface, command line interface, and support for VMware's vStorage interface.[17] In August 2012, the firm released new software features including iSCSI connectivity using 10 Gigabit Ethernet, snapshots, and integration with VMware vCenter.[18]
Pure Storage used multi-level cell flash memory which has higher capacity, for the same price, than single-level cell memory, at the cost of increased wear on and reduced life expectancy of the cells. Using software such as data compression known as data deduplication, the firm markets the FlashArray to compete with traditional rotating disk arrays.[19] The company estimated FlashArray required about 20% of the power and space required for traditional arrays.[20] The firm's flash memory is packaged in shelves of solid state memory devices (SSDs), from two known suppliers, sTec, Inc. and Samsung.[21]
FlashBlade[edit]
FlashBlade is Pure's second all-flash offering designed for high-performance workloads.[22]
Awards[edit]
In 2015, Pure Storage was awarded the best place to work by the San Francisco Business Times, in the large companies category.[23] Pure Storage was named as silver winner in the Wall Street Journal 2012 Technology Innovation Awards.[24] Pure Storage and Samsung won one of two awards for enterprise business applications at an August 2012 flash memory trade show.[25] Pure Storage was selected for the Red Herring Top 100 Americas Award in 2012.[26] Pure Storage was named one of 10 "hot emerging companies" by CRN Magazine in May 2012.[27] Pure Storage was among the top 25 best places to work in Silicon Valley, of companies with 51-101 employees by the San Francisco Business Times.[28] Pure Storage announced it was a silver winner of the Enterprise Product of the Year in Best in Biz Awards 2011.[29]

Scott Dietzen, former president and CTO of Zimbra (acquired by VMware in January 2010), and former CTO of BEA Systems, became chief executive in October 2010.[3] In August 2011, the company announced an investment from the venture-capital arm of Samsung Electronics, which along with Redpoint Ventures contributed to a $30 million series C funding round.[4] Vice president of engineering Bob Wood joined at that time from Omneon (acquired by Harmonic, Inc.).[5]
In August 2012, Pure Storage raised $40 million in series D funding round led by Index Ventures partner Mike Volpi, along with existing investors.[6] An investment of undisclosed amount from In-Q-Tel (associated with the US Central Intelligence Agency) was announced in May 2013.[7] Another investment (round "E") of $150 million was announced in August 2013, including T. Rowe Price and Tiger Global Management.[8]
In October 2013, EMC Corporation filed lawsuits against several former sales employees who left to join Pure Storage.[9][10] A $225 million series F funding round closed in April 2014.[11] Tim Riitters, a former Google exec, joined as chief financial officer (CFO) in August 2014.
On October 6, 2015, Pure Storage priced their initial public offering at $17 per share, raising about $400 million.[12] It started trading on the New York Stock Exchange with the symbol PSTG.[13]
FlashArray[edit]
Pure Storage released a flash memory product called FlashArray on August 23, 2011.[1] Deployed in a data center, FlashArray is marketed to accelerate applications like server virtualization, desktop virtualization, database systems and cloud computing that required very high rates of random I/O operations per second.[14] InfiniBand technology connected controllers, and Fibre Channel connected to server computers.[15]
The second generation FlashArray, released on May 16, 2012, included new software and an enhanced data integrity fabric.[16] It was promoted with higher resiliency, encryption with zero key management, a new web user interface, command line interface, and support for VMware's vStorage interface.[17] In August 2012, the firm released new software features including iSCSI connectivity using 10 Gigabit Ethernet, snapshots, and integration with VMware vCenter.[18]
Pure Storage used multi-level cell flash memory which has higher capacity, for the same price, than single-level cell memory, at the cost of increased wear on and reduced life expectancy of the cells. Using software such as data compression known as data deduplication, the firm markets the FlashArray to compete with traditional rotating disk arrays.[19] The company estimated FlashArray required about 20% of the power and space required for traditional arrays.[20] The firm's flash memory is packaged in shelves of solid state memory devices (SSDs), from two known suppliers, sTec, Inc. and Samsung.[21]
FlashBlade[edit]
FlashBlade is Pure's second all-flash offering designed for high-performance workloads.[22]
Awards[edit]
In 2015, Pure Storage was awarded the best place to work by the San Francisco Business Times, in the large companies category.[23] Pure Storage was named as silver winner in the Wall Street Journal 2012 Technology Innovation Awards.[24] Pure Storage and Samsung won one of two awards for enterprise business applications at an August 2012 flash memory trade show.[25] Pure Storage was selected for the Red Herring Top 100 Americas Award in 2012.[26] Pure Storage was named one of 10 "hot emerging companies" by CRN Magazine in May 2012.[27] Pure Storage was among the top 25 best places to work in Silicon Valley, of companies with 51-101 employees by the San Francisco Business Times.[28] Pure Storage announced it was a silver winner of the Enterprise Product of the Year in Best in Biz Awards 2011.[29]

Pure Storage Announces Purity//FA 5.0 Software: Features New Cloud Integrations, Brings Pure's Signature Simplicity to Stretch Clustering, VVols, QoS, and More

SAN FRANCISCO, June 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Pure Storage (NYSE: PSTG), the market's leading independent all-flash data platform vendor for the cloud era, today announced new software and hardware innovations for the FlashArray product line that redefine tier one storage to meet the needs of a new generation of mission-critical cloud era workloads. With today's introduction of Purity ActiveCluster, CloudSnap native cloud integration, Policy QoS, VVols, the 100 percent NVMe DirectFlash™ Shelf and much more within Purity//FA 5.0 software, Pure Storage customers gain new levels of reliability, coupled with effortless agility and efficiency, to safely consolidate more application workloads. 



Traditional Tier 1 storage has long represented the pinnacle of reliability for the most mission-critical applications, but is not optimized for fast innovation, or to keep up with the demands of cloud-era applications. With the release of Purity//FA 5.0, Pure Storage seeks to end the compromise for customers. Organizations can now leverage best-in-class reliability and sophisticated enterprise replication in a purpose-built all-flash array, rich with data efficiency technologies, flash optimization and cloud integration.
"To truly drive modern business and IT transformation in the cloud era, nothing less than always-on and lightning-fast will do for mission-critical applications," said Rob Kwak, Manager, Systems Engineering & Ops at Redbox. "With the addition of Purity ActiveCluster and Policy QoS, Pure has delivered the best of both worlds - the performance we expect from tier 1 infrastructure coupled with the simplicity we expect from Pure Storage." 
The signature feature in Purity//FA 5.0 is ActiveCluster, a true active/active metro stretch cluster solution. Purity ActiveCluster extends availability to an unprecedented level, and provides business continuity across the data center or metro region. Application workloads on clustered Oracle, SQL Server, SAP, VMware Metro Storage Cluster (vMSC) or Hyper-V continue to run transparently and effortlessly, even if an unexpected issue causes the array, network or data center to fail. Pure Storage FlashArray offers 99.9999 percent availability, now proven over two years, inclusive of maintenance and generational upgrades. 
"Over the last year, we exponentially grew the number of users on our platform. Pure has helped us improve our platform availability, efficiency and performance which ultimately helps us scale," said Venky Rangachari, VP Technical Operations & IT, Anaplan. "Combined with best-in-class availability that maximizes our operational efficiency, Pure has helped deliver a consistently excellent experience for our customers."
ActiveCluster was designed from the ground-up for simplicity. It is fully-integrated into FlashArray, requires no add-on gateway hardware and is included at no additional cost - which makes stretch clustering available to any application. ActiveCluster can be configured in minutes with only four commands, and features the Pure1 Cloud Mediator, removing the need for managing a cumbersome third-site witness. For three datacenter (3DC) clusters, ActiveCluster is fully-integrated with Purity asynchronous replication, enabling a third recovery site to be added anywhere in the world. ActiveCluster is available to existing FlashArray customers as a non-disruptive Evergreen upgrade to Purity//FA 5.0. 
Purity//FA 5.0 is our largest software release ever, and in addition to ActiveCluster, includes more than 10 additional new features built to extend reliability, performance, cloud integration, cloud automation and developer openness, including:

Policy-Based QoS. QoS is essential for consolidating multiple tiers of workloads onto a single FlashArray, or implementing Service Provider business models. Purity's ultra-simple, Always-On QoS is extended in this release to include sophisticated policy management, which enables customers to define Bronze/Silver/Gold tiers of workloads for worry-free consolidation, or add per-workload limits for Service Providers to enable differential billing.
Purity CloudSnap. Customers have increasingly leveraged the public cloud for low-cost backup, retention, DR, and to enable agile application development workflows. FlashArray introduces Purity CloudSnap, a new capability for moving snapshots to and from the public cloud. First, supporting Amazon Web Services (AWS), CloudSnap enables snapshot backup to S3 and Glacier, with recovery options into EBS or back to FlashArray. CloudSnap can restore customer's data in the public using the cloud's native storage formats, which enables full use of public cloud PaaS services. CloudSnap represents Pure's first step to much deeper public cloud integration within Purity. 
Snap to FlashBlade and NFS. Purity's Snap technology has been greatly enhanced to seamlessly move data copies off FlashArray for long-term retention. The feature uses a new Portable Snapshot format which encapsulates recovery metadata within the Snapshot. Purity Snapshots can now seamlessly be moved to FlashBlade or any NFS target for long-term retention. The migration and recovery is seamlessly managed within Purity's snapshot management policies, which enables snapshot retention on open, lower-cost media options.
VMware VVols.  Designed for cloud automation, VMware VVols and storage policy-based management bring automation and compliance to VMware-based clouds.  Pure's VVols implementation offers new levels of simplicity and hosts the VASA provider right on the FlashArray, which enables accelerated VMFS → VVols conversion, and enabling simple P→V and V→P migrations.
Purity Run. Now, Pure offers an array that also serves as an open platform to run custom code, extend interfaces, and enable analytic processing to happen where data is stored. Purity Run enables customers to host VMs and Containers on the FlashArray itself, which opens up new avenues for extensibility and integration. Purity Run creates a safe, dedicated, performance-and-security-isolated CPU and Memory space to run customer code, and supports use cases for Edge, remote office, analytic and database appliances.
Windows File Services for Purity. Many FlashArray customers want to consolidate point SMB and NFS file shares onto FlashArray. Purity Run now integrates with Windows File Services (WFS) bringing best-of-breed SMB 2/3 and NFS 3/4 protocols onto FlashArray. WFS, fully integrated and optimized for FlashArray, is fully supported by Pure Storage, and can be easily managed with the native Microsoft management stack.
Microsoft ODX. Integration with the Offloaded Data Transfer (ODX) API brings fast, transparent, automatic data copy and move services for files and VMs, onto FlashArray. By offloading the data transfer to the storage array, our ODX implementation minimizes latencies, maximizes array throughput, and reduces resource usage such as CPU and network consumption on the host systems.
Docker Persistent Volumes. With container technology increasing in mainstream adoption, there is an immediate customer need to deliver persistent storage for containerized applications. With Certified Docker Volume Plugin for FlashArray, customers can extend the benefits of all-flash shared storage to their new containerized applications. The Pure Storage integration brings persistent storage to the docker ecosystem that extends to orchestrators like Swarm, Kubernetes and Openshift.
Compression 2.0. Purity//FA 5.0 boosts Purity's already market-leading data reduction with an additional 25 percent improvement in compression effectiveness, and further improves all-flash cost efficiency for database and application workloads. All of this is made possible by the introduction of new self-selecting compression algorithms to match the most appropriate data sets.
2X Performance Improvements. Purity//FA 5.0 caps off a year of steady improvements in write performance for FlashArray, delivering up to a 2X improvement in write throughput, available to all FlashArray customers as a simple non-disruptive software upgrade.
In addition to these numerous new software features, Pure is also announcing the new 100% NVMe DirectFlash Shelf. First announced in April 2017, the new 100 percent NVMe FlashArray//X is the industry's first mainstream NVMe all-flash array, and leverages Pure's uniquely software-defined DirectFlash Modules. The new DirectFlash Shelf enables the expansion of FlashArray//X beyond its base chassis, and provides NVMe expansion over a dedicated 50 Gb/S RoCE v2 NVMe/F fabric. DirectFlash Shelf further extends Pure's leadership in NVMe, defining the all-flash architecture that will drive performance and density gains for the next decade.
"With hybrid cloud environments expected to be the future for most enterprises, IT is entering what many are calling the 'Cloud Era,'" said Eric Burgener, research director Storage, at IDC.  "Storage infrastructure designed for tier one workloads in the cloud era must not only meet the traditional high performance and "six nines" availability requirements, but must also meet a new set of expectations for scalability, efficiency, flexibility, ease of use, cloud integration, and simple, non-disruptive technology refresh. Companies like Pure Storage, with their FlashArray//X storage array and the Evergreen Storage Program, are delivering on these requirements."
More Information Features described within will be available as part of the Purity//FA 5.x release train, with multiple releases planned throughout 2017. Purity Run, Compression 2.0, 2X write rate, Microsoft ODX, and Docker Persistent Volumes are available now. ActiveCluster, Policy QoS, VVOLs, Snap to FlashBlade and NFS, and Windows File Services are planned to be available in Q3. CloudSnap and the DirectFlash Shelf are planned for Q4 release. All feature timing and final content are subject to change, and dates above are Pure fiscal quarters.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
