Fallbrook Technologies Announces Executive Changes for its NuVinci Cycling Division
Mar 3 17
NuVinci Cycling, division of Fallbrook Technologies, has strengthened its sales and marketing team once again with two additional experienced senior managers. Joining the team are Billy van den Ende, Director of Sales and Niels van der Steen, Retail Marketing Manager. Billy van den Ende will report directly into David Hancock, Fallbrook's Managing Director, Bike Division. He will oversee the team of OEM Business Developers as well as the Customer Account Management team. With an extensive background in customer acquisition and brand management stemming from years in the urban mobility and technology industry, Billy brings highly relevant experience to lead the team of OEM business developers and the inside sales team. Before joining NuVinci Cycling, Billy was responsible for the direct to consumer bike brand, Canyon Bicycles in the Benelux market. Prior to that, he worked at the European HQ in Dublin for Google. Furthermore, Remco Voorhorst has been promoted internally to the new Head of Customer Accounts Management and Business Developer Emerging Markets. After successfully managing a wide range of customer-care responsibilities in the last 10 months, Remco is now moving on to this combination role, which is key for the implementation of the company's strategy for 2017 and beyond. He will report to Billy van den Ende and focus on developing the OEM business outside of DACH and BENELUX. Niels van der Steen has an extensive sales and marketing background in the bike and sports industry and built experience at Shimano Europe and Puma. During the last three years, Niels was responsible for global sales and trade marketing at Science in Sport. He will be responsible for all marketing activities directed at retailers globally and oversee the team of retail development managers in the field. Niels will report directly to Anne Guethoff, Director of Marketing.


NuVinci(R) Cycling Introduces N330f(TM), a Commercial Grade Bicycle Groupset
Feb 15 17
NuVinci Cycling, a division of Fallbrook Technologies, introduced N330f -- the ultimate rental and commercial grade bicycle groupset. The N330f provides durability like no other transmission due to the specifically designed hardware components. With a ratio range of 330%, a maximum continuous torque of 80Nm and 200kg maximum permissible vehicle weight, this transmission is specifically designed for usage in the bike share and commercial environment. Throughout the product lifecycle, it offers the best value compared to existing solutions. This value is predominantly provided by N330f reducing service and maintenance costs compared to non-commercial grade, competitive products. Common pain points for operators of bike share programs and commercial bicycle fleets include the misuse or even abuse of the bicycle by its user, high maintenance costs, and unpredictable service cycles.These pain points are addressed with the launch of N330f. Riding a N330f NuVinci Optimized™ bicycle means concentrating less on operating the bike and more on what's important such as traffic, road hazards, or the scenery. Stepless shifting works whether the user is freewheeling, shifting under load, or waiting at a traffic light. Interruption of the ride caused by locked gears or even a broken-down bike is now a thing of the past. The N330f transmission includes an individual three-pawl freewheel which ensures even pawl engagement for higher durability, increasing the overall strength of the transmission. Also, the group offers a three millimeter offset sprocket. This enables the use of a one-eighth inch chain which lasts longer than regular chains. The pad-printed logo preserves and extends the high-end look of the product. The associated, new C3f controller features a specifically-designed rubber material which ensures comfort, a better ride, and a longer grip life. The new cable locking screw (four millimeters) offers an extremely durable, overdrive cable end fixture and protects against higher pullout forces.

We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of      shares of common 
stock in this offering will be approximately $     million, assuming an initial 
public offering price of $    per share, which is the midpoint of the range set
forth on the cover page of this prospectus,and after deducting the underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.
 
We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate 
purposes and for the repayment of indebtedness on our line of credit, the 
proceeds of which $2.0 million was borrowed on April 2, 2008 to purchase 
manufacturing assets and $0.5 million was borrowed on August 2, 2010 to fund 
working capital. The revolving line of credit expires December 31, 2010 and 
bears interest at a fluctuating rate equal to the highest of the prime rate, 
LIBOR plus 1.5%, or the Federal Funds Rate plus 1.5%. The highest rate was 
3.25% under the prime rate as of June 30, 2010. As a result, management will 
retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this 
offering. Pending use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to 
invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade 
securities.
 
An increase or decrease of           shares from the expected number of shares
to be sold by us in the offering, assuming no change in the assumed initial
public offering price per share, would increase or decrease our net proceeds
from this offering by $      . A $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed
public offering price of $      per share, the midpoint of the range set forth
on the front cover of this prospectus, would increase or decrease our expected
net proceeds by approximately $      , assuming the number of shares offered 
by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and
after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us. We expect to use any additional net proceeds
from this offering for general corporate purposes.


Suppliers of drive train components in the bicycle industry currently include 
two dominant companies, Shimano Corporation (Japan) and SRAM Corporation 
(Chicago, IL USA). Commonly cited problems in the industry include limited 
flexibility, long lead time supply and long term purchase commitments. These 
two primary competitors produce bicycle drive train products in derailleur and 
internal geared hub form. Of these two companies, Shimano has the largest 
market share, which is currently estimated to be above 60% of the world’s 
drivetrain requirements, and competes on quality and price. These Shimano 
geared systems are well known products that consumers use in everyday riding. 
We expect to compete successfully in this market by offering products with 
features that are not available in the products of our competitors, namely an 
infinite number of gear ratios, or speeds, from low to high, without any 
shocks, jerking or mis-shifting. As we increase our sales, we expect to reduce 
the market share of these competitors.
 
As described above, the NuVinci technology should be addressing several 
applications that currently do not utilize CVTs. However, our plans include the
sale of products into the automotive market, which has a mature competitive 
base. While we will not directly compete with automakers or automotive 
suppliers on similar products, we may be competing with the incumbent product 
manufacturers of alternators and other accessories that may see our products as
a threat to their higher margin products.
 
In the lawn and garden equipment end market, we will be replacing existing 
hydrostatic transmissions with our own products. While our licensee, 
Hydro-Gear, is a significant manufacturer of hydrostatic transmissions, there 
are other manufacturers of hydrostatic transmissions that produce products 
against which our products will compete.
 
For automotive primary transmissions, JATCO, a subsidiary of Nissan, is 
recognized as the CVT market leader. Many of our current or potential 
competitors have greater market presence, longer operating histories, stronger 
name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, 
technical, sales and marketing, manufacturing and other resources than we have.
Moreover, if one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with 
another of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could 
adversely affect our customer relationships and competitive position or 
otherwise affect our ability to compete effectively. Notwithstanding the 
presence of JATCO as the market leader, we expect to compete with them in the 
automotive industry through introduction of products for end market 
applications that are not currently offered by JATCO and which we believe its 
products cannot effectively address. Our CVAD products take advantage of the 
unique packaging and geometry of our NuVinci technology to allow packaging a 
CVT as a drive for accessories in the very limited space available in an 
engine compartment.


Company Description
We are a company that has developed and that markets, manufactures and 
distributes a patented technology, sold under the “  NuVinci  ” brand. We have
operations in California and Texas, as well as contract manufacturing 
capability in China. Our technology, which is currently only


 commercially
available for bicycles, consists of a new type of continuously variable 
transmission (CVT) that we believe can be used in a wide variety of end market
applications. A transmission is a mechanical device that provides speed and 
torque conversion from a rotating power source using gear ratios, or speeds. A 
CVT is a transmission that effectively has an infinite number of gear ratios, 
or speeds, between its lowest and highest speeds. Our  NuVinci  technology is 
designed to improve the overall efficiency and performance of vehicles and 
equipment that operate at various speeds, such as bicycles, automobile 
accessories, wind turbines and lawn mowers. Our  NuVinci  technology provides 
smooth, continuous progression from one speed to another through its range with
no breaks or jerks, allowing the transmission output speed to change, while the
engine or motor speed stays at its speed of peak efficiency or power. 

We sell or plan to sell our products directly to vehicle and equipment
manufacturers and aftermarket products distributors. In some end markets, we
license our products to other companies to manufacture and sell in their
respective industries, from which we derive licensing fees or royalties on the
sales of their products. In other end markets,we intend to enter joint ventures
with development partners that would manufacture and market our products. We
anticipate that we will share in the sales of such products. We also provide
engineering and support services to vehicle and equipment manufacturers to help
them implement our technology in their products.

Our technology is currently available in the global market for bicycle
transmissions, through bicycle manufacturers, aftermarket equipment distributor
and retailers, where it has been used to replace the rear wheel gear changing
assembly, or derailleur, and is currently the only commercially available CVT
for bicycles. We are also currently developing applications of our core
technology for a number of other target end markets that we believe, based on
our research, have near-term commercial potential. These include alternators,
air conditioning compressors, power steering pumps and superchargers for the
automotive accessory drive market where the CVT will allow the accessory to
operate at a constant speed regardless of the varying engine speed, and primary
transmissions for the electric vehicle, small wind turbine and lawn care
equipment markets where the CVT will provide variable drive speed to the wind
turbines or vehicles.

To date, we have primarily been an early stage development company focused on
the development of our core technology and formation of initial commercial
partnerships. We have raised approximately $62 million in financing to develop
and patent our core technology, design and produce prototypes to test the
application of our technology in products for our customers and develop the
operational capabilities needed to support targeted sales of our products. We
have developed a patent portfolio covering our core technology and end market
applications of our technology that includes over 365 patents and pending
applications around the world. We have established a sales presence in Europe,
where we have a branch office for sales and customer support. We also have a
contract manufacturing relationship with a manufacturer in China and have begun
establishing an office in Shanghai to oversee the activities of that
manufacturer and support exploration of other opportunities in China. We
currently plan to expand our sales efforts to support increased sales in 2010
and 2011. In 2009, we earned $1,044,000 in total revenues from products sales
and services at a total net loss of $17,226,000. During the six months ended
June 30, 2010, we earned $460,000 in total revenues from product sales and
services and had a total net loss of $6,726,000.

Collaboration is easy.I love that the company made a point to have various departments meet with new hires on day one AND there continues to be contact.ConsGiven that this is a small company, sometimes people are a little too territorial. Change is welcomed... But for the other departments. The laid back environment is sometimes counter productive. The facilities are somewhat dour and outdated given the area.Advice to ManagementContinue striving for improvements in technology and strategy.

The flexible hours are great and makes it easy to manage a healthy work/life balance. It's been a challenging job but I'm really enjoying it and feel that I get a lot of the support that I need to succeed in the position.ConsThough management is very supportive in providing you with the right tools that you need to do your job, there are a lot of processes and procedures that you'll need to figure out on your own. It's a plus in some instances since you can develop and create your own process and workflow, but as a new employee it can be a bit of a challenge in the beginning.Advice to ManagementI've noticed A LOT of positive changes since I've been here, so keep doing what you're doing.

It basically consist of one chief engineer who does all the work as far as mechanical design work goes. Electrical/computer science/controls work is all done by one person as well. Senior management go to these two for everything. They only work under engineering agreements.

Combine that with the cross functional nature of the company and you get exposure to new aspects of business that make you a better, more qualified individual for the future.Culture – Fallbrook is just plain fun to work for! The environment is relaxing overall; there isn’t unnecessary pressure coming from upper management to portray the company as something it’s not through needless dress codes and universally required work hours. When the going gets tough everyone buckles down as a team to get the project complete, and when it’s finally finished we celebrate as a team. Granted, it hasn’t always been this way. However, the past year has shown a complete shift in the company wide atmosphere and HR is making leaps and strides to make it better and better.Bottom-line, I’m proud to work for Fallbrook Technologies.ConsThe majority of cons I would potentially list here are being continually improved upon which I consider a PRO. However, one area I’m not seeing as much improvement in is individual employee recognition.Employee Recognition – there just isn’t a whole lot of recognition for some of the incredible work the individuals do for the company. Fallbrook is great at giving credit where credit is due when it comes to big, companywide wins. However, individual accomplishments are often unacknowledged and internal promotions tremendously rare.Advice to ManagementKeep doing what you’re doing! The attitude shift of HR and upper management over the past year is truly making an incredible difference in the daily activities within the company. Fallbrook is genuinely a joy to work for and a worthy cause to pour my life into.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (3) Fallbrook Technologies Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Fallbrook Technologies 2016-02-10 06:13 PST Feb 21, 2016 Helpful (7)"Trying to cover up the past"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Product Development Engineer in Cedar Park, TXCurrent Employee - Product Development Engineer in Cedar Park, TXDoesn't RecommendNeutral OutlookNo opinion of CEOI have been working at Fallbrook Technologies full-time (More than 8 years)ProsWe still have jobs.

We are having serious issues hiring capable Engineers because our reputation is not good. The players have not changed which leads to the continuation of friction between upper and lower levels of management. Every month brings panic as the next Board Meeting approaches.

The lay off of 27 people in April only made things worse.

What you can do with NuVinci® Technology?There is a lot you can achieve:  Improved energy management, higher performance, more effective and reliable controls and sustainable solutions.  You can tailor your systems to your specific needs rather than limiting your system choices based on constraints, which may no longer be applicable.Accessory speeds don’t have to be dictated by vehicle ground speed so engine designers can change the whole paradigm of an engine front end, realizing space savings, energy savings and performance improvements all together. With the ability to vary speed or torque as desired with a continuously variable planetary (CVP) transmission, system designers are not constrained by the limitations of their current system capabilities.  Variable process flow using mechanical rather than motor control provides a new avenue to solve problems in industrial systems.Fallbrook Technologies is “Changing Gears to Spheres” with NuVinci CVP technology.  What can you do with NuVinci?

 On Road/Off Road 
 While today’s on- and off-road vehicles continue to evolve and strive to be more fuel efficient, perform better and operate more safely, new technologies are needed to make these challenging goals a reality. The NuVinci portfolio of vehicle applications is diverse, but all have the common objective of improving performance, ride quality and fuel economy through the use of NuVinci CVP technology, in a new type of CVT (continuously variable transmission).  
 Visit On Road/Off Road  

 Accessory Drives 
 Accessory drives incorporating NuVinci continuously variable planetary (CVP) technology increase fuel economy and vehicle performance by optimizing system operation.  The addition of a CVT transmission to an accessory drive can make tradeoffs among engine performance, system efficiency and fuel economy a thing of the past. 
 Accessory Drives  

 Industrial 
 The NuVinci CVP technology enables enhanced performance for a variety of industrial applications.In addition to the advantages of a CVT or IVT (infinitely variable transmission), NuVinci technology allows power to be connected and transferred in multiple ways as it enables multiple power paths for summing, dividing or managing power flow.   
 Industrial  

 Cycling 
  NuVinci® Cycling has its own website: www.nuvincicycling.com, which is also available in German and Dutch.NuVinci Optimized cycling provides a unique riding experience with smooth, continuously variable shifting.  The Harmony™  intelligent auto-shifting system changes ratios based on a desired cadence. The drivetrains can extend the range of eBikes and are maintenance free.
