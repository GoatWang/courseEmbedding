Transocean Partners LLC: A 27.9% Better Bargain Than When Lynch-Bell Bought






EnergyStockChannel.com




Feb 16, 2016 10:49 AM EST













 




























































 There's an old saying on Wall Street about insider buying: there are many possible reasons to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy. Back on September 4, Transocean Partners LLC's Director, Michael David Lynch-bell, invested $16,650.00 into 1,500 shares of RIGP, for a cost per share of $11.10. Bargain hunters tend to pay particular attention to insider buys like this one, because presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money.    START SLIDESHOW:Click here to find out which 9 other energy stock bargains you can buy cheaper than insiders »   In trading on Tuesday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Transocean Partners LLC ( RIGP) and achieve a cost basis 27.9% cheaper than Lynch-bell, with shares changing hands as low as $8.00 per share. It should be noted that Lynch-bell has collected $0.36/share in dividends since the time of their purchase, so they are currently down 24.7% on their purchase from a total return basis. Transocean Partners LLC shares are currently trading up about 1.8% on the day. The chart below shows the one year performance of RIGP shares, versus its 200 day moving average:    Looking at the chart above, RIGP's low point in its 52 week range is $5.89 per share, with $17.09 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $8.12. By comparison, below is a table showing the prices at which RIGP insider buying was recorded over the last six months:     Purchased Insider Title Shares Price/Share Value   09/04/2015 Michael David Lynch-bell Director 1,500 $11.10 $16,650.00    The current annualized dividend paid by Transocean Partners LLC is $1.45/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend has an upcoming ex-date of 02/18/2016. Below is a long-term dividend history chart for RIGP, which can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend with approx. 18.2% annualized yield is likely to continue.
