History




POOLCORP is the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies, equipment and related leisure products with a long and distinguished history of customer service coupled with quality products. The company currently trades on the NASDAQ stock market under the ticker "POOL".
 The company was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1993 as SCP Holding Corp. In 1995, the company changed names to SCP Pool Corporation and on May 16, 2006, the name was changed to Pool Corporation (POOLCORP). Corporate headquarters are based in the New Orleans suburb of Covington, Louisiana.

	Entering New Products

POOLCORP has continuously expanded its lines to include products that complement the outdoor lifestyle, incorporating construction materials, fencing and backyard accessories over the years. In late 2005, POOLCORP added irrigation and landscape products to its inventory with the acquisition of Automatic Rain Co. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Horizon Distributors Inc. As a leading regional wholesale distributor of irrigation and landscape products for the professional trade, Horizon’s addition expanded our offerings and provided POOLCORP with a solid distribution platform to the irrigation and landscape marketplace.
In August 2006, POOLCORP increased its irrigation footprint, adding Wickham Supply Inc. and Water Zone LP and their 14 distribution sales centers to the POOLCORP network. In March 2008, POOLCORP further expanded its complementary product offerings with the acquisition of National Pool Tile Group, Inc. (NPT). As the leading wholesale distributor of pool tile and composite pool finishes, NPT provides POOLCORP with a significant opportunity to grow its market share of product offerings used in the swimming pool refurbish and construction markets.
In all, we offer more than 160,000 national brand and private label products including non-discretionary pool maintenance products, such as chemicals and replacement parts; packaged pool kits, which include walls, liners, bracing and other materials; whole goods,which include cleaners, filters, heaters, pumps and lights; construction materials used for pool installations and remodeling; irrigation and landscape products, including a complete line of commercial and residential irrigation products and parts; power equipment for the professional landscape market; specialty products, which include light fixtures and built-in barbecues; and golf irrigation and water management products.

	Reaching New Markets
As a complement to our vast product line, POOLCORP launched www.swimmingpool.com on the World Wide Web in November 2004. The site was designed as a central location for pool owners and pool fans to research pool safety, financing, remodeling and design.
Features of the site include a dealer locator for finding local retailers, builders, remodelers and service professionals; request a quote from a qualified builder or remodeler; an extensive gallery of pool photos; a kid-friendly section to help acquaint young swimmers with pool fun and pool safety; and an online listing of pool enhancing products from poolside grill islands to underwater lighting.
