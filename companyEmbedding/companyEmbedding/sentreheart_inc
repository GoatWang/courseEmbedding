You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

SentreHEART Inc., aMAZE Trial Receives FDA Approval for Stage II Expansion based on 100 Subject Interim Safety and Performance Analysis
Jun 5 17
SentreHEART, Inc. announced FDA approval to expand to Stage II of the aMAZE Trial. The approval comes as a result of pre-specified analysis of adjudicated safety and performance results from initial 100 enrolled subjects by independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) and FDA. The aMAZE Trial aims to assess improved outcomes in the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AFib) when the LARIAT is used to close the left atrial appendage (LAA) in adjunct to Pulmonary Vein Isolation (PVI) catheter ablation in those patients that suffer from drug-refractory, persistent and long-standing persistent AFib. The Trial is designed in two sequential stages, with data from both stages used in primary endpoint analyses. Stage I intended to monitor the adjudicated safety and performance results of the LARIAT in the first 100 consecutively enrolled subjects against pre-specified criteria, as assessed by an independent Data Monitoring Committee. With Stage II approval, SentreHEART will expand the aMAZE trial to 65 centers across the United States and limited International locations.


SentreHEART, Inc. Completes Stage I Enrollment Milestone in aMAZE Trial
Jan 6 17
SentreHEART, Inc. announced that it has completed the Stage I enrollment milestone in the aMAZE Trial. The Trial aims to assess improved outcomes when the LARIAT Suture Delivery System is used to close the left atrial appendage in adjunct to Pulmonary Vein Isolation catheter ablation in those patients that suffer from drug-refractory, persistent and long-standing persistent AFib. Stage I of the aMAZE Trial is designed to assess safety and performance of the LARIAT procedure in the first 100 consecutively enrolled subjects, assessed by independent adjudication and data monitoring committees. The first subject was enrolled into the aMAZE Trial in October 2015 and the Trial is currently recruiting subjects in 34 U.S. centers. It is anticipated that by mid 2017, the aMAZE Trial will expand to 50 centers across the U.S., and in limited international locations. AFib is an irregular, rapid heartbeat or quivering of the upper chambers of the heart called the atria due to a malfunction in the heart’s electrical system. It is the most common sustained arrhythmia and a major global public health problem due to its associated morbidity, including stroke and heart failure, diminished quality of life, and increased mortality. Approximately 33.5 million individuals worldwide suffer from AFib, with close to 5 million new cases occurring each year. Studies have demonstrated the LARIAT not only closes the LAA mechanically1 but may also isolate electrical activity within the LAA2. Having a non-implant option that may both electrically and mechanically isolate the LAA is a potentially important addition to the treatment armamentarium for clinicians treating patients with persistent or longstanding persistent AFib. The LARIAT has the potential to eliminate the LAA as a source of AFib and nidus for thrombus. Unlike other implant solutions for AFib, the aMAZE Trial seeks to potentially treat the underlying disorder of AF by mechanically and electrically isolating the base of the LAA using the percutaneous, non-implant LARIAT suture delivery device.

Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.
Ensure that document matches include...

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

Enter your phrase:




3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.

 Details Hidden


Prospect Venture Partners

                                    Prospect Venture Partners focuses on investments in commercially attractive biomedical technology and life science companies that have outstanding management teams, proprietary products and innovative technology or services. They participate in new company incubations, first and second venture financing rounds and expansion capital financings of later-stage private and public companies with proven business models. Initial investments range from $500,000 to $10 million with $10 million to $20 million invested over the life of a company. Prospect Venture Partners will serve as a lead investor or as a co-lead in a syndicate. The firm typically takes a seat on the boards of their portfolio companies.                                




 Details Hidden


Vivo Capital LLC

                                    Vivo Ventures invests in US-based companies with therapeutic products in clinical development. Although they focus on companies with later-stage products, the firm is willing to work with companies (and their founders) that may not have significant infrastructure. They invest in companies with promising products at all financing stages (Series A to public companies) and work closely with founders and management to complete the development and commercial launch of those products and achieve a successful exit. When considering investments, Vivo Ventures emphasizes the following criteria: (1) the quality of the company's underlying technology, including supporting preclinical and clinical data (2) the market potential of the company's products (3) the strength of the company's intellectual property and (4) the strength of the company's management team.                                




 Details Hidden


U.S. Venture Partners

                                    Presidio Management Group invests in the information technology, clean technology and healthcare sectors. They are particularly interested in semiconductors, software as a service (SaaS), networking/storage solutions, wireless data, the Internet version 2.0, biomedical devices and new drugs with profound social benefits. They look for markets in excess of $1 billion in revenue potential and rarely invest in companies focusing on markets less than $300 million. Their investment horizon is 3 to 10 years.
