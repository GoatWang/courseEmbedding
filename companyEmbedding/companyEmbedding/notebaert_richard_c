      ■ Richard C. Notebaert (pronounced 
      
        note
      
      -a-bärt), who was born in Canada but raised in Columbus, Ohio, was
      a happy warrior, eager to take on new challenges and to mingle with
      workers, shareholders, and customers to show them his vision of a bright
      future even during the most miserable of times. A low-key personality, he
      had the common touch and would converse as easily with blue-collar workers
      as he did with corporate executives. He was responsible for making
      Ameritech one of the most successful "Baby Bells" (companies
      spun off from AT&T in an antitrust settlement), he was credited
      with saving Tellabs from dissolution, and he staved off bankruptcy

      for Qwest when the situation appeared hopeless. Although he was visionary
      in terms of what he foresaw his companies providing in services, his
      business techniques were classic: anticipate developments in the
      marketplace, cut costs, and organize a company around its
      customers' needs.
    

      THE COMPANY MAN
    

      Notebaert's career began while he was in college, when he took a
      job washing trucks. While in college he married Peggy, who was one of the
      anchors of his life throughout his sometimes tumultuous career. He worked
      in both marketing and services during the first decade of his career at
      Ameritech; he began his rapid rise up the corporate ladder when he
      received his MBA in 1983. It was an opportune time to have earned an MBA
      because AT&T, which had long held a monopoly on
       telephone communications in the United States, was being broken up into a
      long-distance carrier and five new local phone companies. One of the new
      local companies was Ameritech Corporation, which received the states of
      Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin as its territory.
      Notebaert quickly became the vice president of marketing and operations
      for Ameritech Communications, one of the divisions of Ameritech
      Corporation.
    

      When Notebaert became president of Ameritech Mobile Communications in
      1986, the cellular communications industry was just beginning to catch on;
      through aggressive marketing, he built the customer base of
      Ameritech's cellular telephone division to 950,000. Near the end of
      Notebaert's tenure as president of Indiana Bell Telephone Company,
      in February 1992, William Weiss, Ameritech's chief executive
      officer and chairman of the board, held a special meeting of the
      company's management. He had asked each attendee to write about
      what Ameritech should be doing in the future and then had each read aloud
      his views during the meeting. Notebaert's presentation caught
      Weiss's attention with its expansive view of Ameritech's
      possibilities, advocating that the company develop video conferencing;
      blend the Internet, telephones, and televisions into one vast interactive
      service; and offer "quality of life" services, such as
      safety and security.
    

      At age 45 Notebaert was considered young by the standards of Ameritech
      executives, but in 1992 Weiss promoted him to president of Ameritech
      Services, where Notebaert put his ideas to work, beginning a security
      monitoring service that would have 340,000 customers by 1999. Notebaert
      proved to be an excellent motivator of employees, communicating with and
      inspiring even the lowest ranks through open communications and easy
      accessibility. In January 1993 Weiss and the board of directors of
      Ameritech named Notebaert vice chairman of the board, and in June 1993
      they named him president and chief operating officer of Ameritech, leaping
      him past many more senior executives. During this period, Notebaert helped
      expand Ameritech's international operations, including Telecom
      Corporation in New Zealand and Belgacom in Belgium. Ameritech played a
      crucial role in the creation of Belgacom, which was the first of
      Belgium's government monopolies to be privatized.
    

      When Notebaert became president and CEO of Ameritech in January 1994, he
      took charge of a company that had 12 million local phone customers, 2.5
      million cellular customers, and $14.9 billion in annual revenue. Notebaert
      wanted Ameritech to have a share in the long-distance phone call market,
      but a court ruling and government regulators, both federal and state,
      forbade the Baby Bell from selling long-distance services where it had a
      monopoly on local phone service. Weiss and Notebaert had worked closely
      together to reorganize Ameritech's corporate structure from five
      divisions by state to one in which the state operations were merged into a
      whole and then divided by product lines, such as local telephone services
      and cellular services. When Weiss retired on April 20, 1994, Notebaert
      added chairman of the board to his other offices.
    

      Notebaert hired marketing specialists to run the new divisions of
      Ameritech, and he changed Ameritech's stodgy style of advertising
      that emphasized its stability and long heritage to one that targeted
      specific aspects of the marketplace, such as small businesses, emphasizing
      Ameritech's high-tech new services. He worked with government
      regulators as partners, not foes, in opening the marketplace to
      competition. Notebaert pressed hard to have Ameritech's local
      telephone territories opened to Ameritech's long-distance telephone
      services, and he took the daring step of opening Ameritech's
      five-state territory to local telephone competition. AT&T leaped at
      the chance and almost immediately began competing for the lucrative
      Chicago local market. Notebaert hoped that the move to set aside
      Ameritech's local telephone service monopoly in exchange for a
      competitive marketplace would encourage regulators and the courts to allow
      Ameritech to compete for long-distance services. This plan put rural
      telephone users at a disadvantage because urban telephone income had
      traditionally subsidized the low-profit rural markets. Notebaert proposed
      a "universal service fund" that would help keep down rural
      telephone costs to consumers by having all American telephone companies
      contribute to it. In spite of these efforts and proposals, regulators
      refused to allow Ameritech to offer long-distance services in the
      five-state territory. By the end of 1994 Ameritech had 48,000 employees
      and had operations in all 50 states and in 40 countries.
    

      In 1995 Notebaert targeted economic development, education, and quality of
      life for Ameritech's marketing. He hoped to develop services that
      helped businesses process their sales electronically, that helped people
      commute electronically by working at home and using telephone lines to
      connect them to their offices, that helped students attend classes from
      home through a blend of telephones and computers, and that enhanced the
      security of people through electronic alarms and swift contact of support
      and emergency services. Further, he foresaw "electronic
      government" in which government business could be done with
      Ameritech Internet services—for example, allowing lawyers to file
      court briefs electronically. He also wanted voice-activated telephones
      that allowed a caller just to say a name and have the telephone
      automatically dial the appropriate phone number; when he found that the
      Ameritech research and development team was trying to create a
      voice-activated telephone with a capacity to understand 40 names but
      already had an inexpensive one that recognized 10 names, he trimmed the
      research and sent the 10-name telephone to market. During 1995 he cut
      about 6,000 jobs, saving Ameritech $350 million. He asked regulators to
      allow Ameritech to keep the savings because regulations at the time forced
      such savings to be passed on as lower telephone rates—a practice
       that discouraged corporate efficiency and encouraged bloated corporate
      bureaucracies.
    

      In spite of Ameritech's inability to offer long-distance services
      to its local customers, the company's fortunes boomed during
      Notebaert's tenure, and he became a very rich man. Always busy in
      local affairs in Chicago, where Ameritech was based, he even donated $5
      million to help build the Peggy Notebaert Natural History Museum in 1998;
      it quickly became a prime destination for visitors to the city. When
      Ameritech was sold to SBC Communications in 1999, Notebaert received a
      severance bonus of approximately $21 million. Ameritech had had five
      straight years of growth under Notebaert's leadership, with a 45
      percent growth in revenues. Its market capitalization tripled to $70
      billion. Notebaert sold Ameritech to SBC for $72 billion, a windfall for
      Ameritech's shareholders.
    

      MAKING PROFITS AMID DISASTER AT TELLABS
    

      Notebaert promised his family that he would take some time off from work
      and spend it with them, but there seemed little doubt that he would take a
      job again. In August 2000, only 10 months after the sale of Ameritech, the
      board of directors of Tellabs offered him the offices of president and
      CEO, and he accepted. The management had hopes of tripling its revenues in
      the next three years, and the board of directors thought Notebaert had
      what was needed to guide the company through expansion. Notebaert was
      known for his combination of creativity and steady leadership, and
      Ameritech had been a customer of Tellabs, which meant that Notebaert was
      familiar with Tellabs' products.
    

      Tellabs manufactured parts for communications systems. In 2000 its
      revenues were $3.3 billion. The dot-com revolution had spawned numerous
      companies that needed equipment for communications and for hosting Web
      sites, and the possibilities for electronics communications seemed
      limitless. But in 2000 the dot-com collapse began, with hundreds of
      communications and Internet companies going out of business. Surviving
      companies found themselves with overcapacity—more room for business
      than there was business to be had. The decline in business meant that many
      Tellabs customers had already purchased more Tellabs products than they
      could use, which in turn meant that Tellabs lost business it had counted
      on.
    

      Tellabs was in danger of going out of business almost as soon as Notebaert
      settled into his new positions. During the first eight months of 2001, he
      cut 1,000 jobs at Tellabs, including managers, with 50 employees taking
      early retirement and the others being laid off. They represented 12
      percent of Tellabs' workforce. The labor cuts saved Tellabs $120
      million. Notebaert himself cut his pay for 2001 by 26 percent and took no
      bonuses. Revenues for the year were $2.3 billion, down $1 billion from the
      year before. In 2002 Notebaert continued to cut jobs, reducing the
      workforce by a total of 38 percent from 8,900 when he first joined Tellabs
      to 5,500. "It was awful. You hate firing people—nobody
      enjoys it—but we did what we had to do," he asserted in 2002
      (
      
        Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service
      
      , June 17, 2002).
    

      During Notebaert's tenure at Tellabs, the company's stock
      dropped from $50 to $10 per share, yet when he left the company, he was
      praised by those who worked with him, and he was credited not only with
      saving Tellabs from extinction but also with making it profitable in 2002.
      He had done "what's right for the business as a
      whole," he said (
      
        DenverPost.com
      
      , June 23, 2002), and he left the company in sound financial condition,
      although much smaller than it had been, with $1 billion in cash reserves
      in the bank. He had accomplished his goals in part by focusing Tellabs on
      two profitable lines of products: the Titan optical products that helped
      networks interact and the Cablespan line of cables used in electronic
      communications. He aggressively pursued sales of Tellabs products globally
      in 80 countries. When it was announced that he was leaving Tellabs, the
      company's stock fell 6.76 percent in one day.
    

      THE CHALLENGE OF QWEST
    

      Qwest was America's fourth-largest telephone company, but it was in
      poor shape. In 1999 it had purchased the local phone service provider U.S.
      West, nicknamed U.S. Worst for its bad customer service, at a cost of $38
      billion. Thereafter, the company was beset by problems, although the true
      extent of the problems became known only after Notebaert took over control
      and had the company's financial records examined.
    

      During 2000 and 2001 Qwest's stock price fell 92 percent. It had
      revenues of $20 billion in 2001, but it also had $26 billion in debt. It
      was being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal
      Bureau of Investigation, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
      for falsifying financial reports and perpetrating underhanded schemes that
      made it look like it was earning money when it was not. In one scheme
      Qwest sold access to its telephone network to companies that then sold
      Qwest access to their networks for the same amount of money, meaning that
      no one actually made a profit; however, Qwest entered the bogus sales into
      its financial books as income to inflate its reported revenues to fool
      investors into thinking Qwest was doing better than it really was. CEO
      Joseph P. Nacchio began fishing around Qwest's Yellow Pages
      business to potential buyers to bring in enough money to stave off
      disaster. Qwest was on the verge of bankruptcy when Note-baert joined it.
    

      Nacchio was a flamboyant leader who drew publicity to himself and his
      company and who had pursued an audacious expansion of Qwest. When the
      company's board of directors
       looked for a replacement, they favored the low-key manner and traditional
      economics represented by Notebaert. The board of directors offered
      Notebaert $1.1 million in salary plus bonuses that would increase his
      annual income to $1.69 million, and the directors offered him a $14
      million bonus if he remained leader of the company until age 65. In May
      2002 rating agencies relegated Qwest's bonds to junk bond status.
      Yet Notebaert may have relished taking leadership of a huge corporation
      and the challenge of setting it straight. Still, it is unlikely that he
      realized just how badly off the company was when he became CEO and
      chairman of the board on June 17, 2002, and relocated to Denver, Colorado,
      home of Qwest's headquarters. The company was in danger of collapse
      at any time during 2002. Its fiber-optics network alone was losing more
      than $500 million annually.
    

      Qwest stock rose 20 percent the day Notebaert was hired. In July 2002 he
      removed five Qwest executives from their posts and brought in three
      executives who had worked with him at Ameritech: Oren G. Shaffer, CFO at
      Ameritech from 1994 to 2000, was made vice chairman at Qwest; Joan H.
      Walker, vice president of corporate communications at Ameritech from 1996
      to 1999 and senior vice president of global affairs for Pharmacia in 2002
      when hired by Notebaert, became senior vice president of corporate
      communications; and Gary R. Lytle, leader of Ameritech's Washington
      office from 1992 to 2000, became vice president of policy and law. Shaffer
      went quickly to work, mending fences by visiting the SEC accountant in
      charge of the SEC's investigation of Qwest and by auditing the
      company's books. He found $1.1 billion in phony income listed for
      2002.
    

      Notebaert found himself in charge of a company of 56,000 U.S. employees
      that saw a 14 percent decline in revenue from January to September 2002
      and therefore might not be able to meet its payroll. 
      
        Fortune
      
       called Qwest "one of the biggest wrecks in America"
      (January 20, 2003). Notebaert began campaigning among the rank-and-file
      workers that summer, traveling to meet them in groups, usually small, to
      tell them of the future he saw for Qwest and to enlist their help, asking
      wage earners to cut back on the hours they worked. The company's
      27,000 union members agreed to forego their scheduled 3 to 4 percent pay
      increases in exchange for performance bonuses in 2003. Notebaert opened
      permanent communication between himself and his employees. On the basis of
      his good name, Notebaert persuaded Bank of America to pull lenders
      together to lend Qwest $750 million to stave off immediate bankruptcy.
    

      In an action that Notebaert later said he had never done before and hoped
      never to do again, he pressed Qwest bondholders to forgive much of the
      debt owed to them. He did this by noting that Qwest could go bankrupt and
      that those who agreed to exchange their bonds for bonds worth 40 percent
      less would be placed at the head of the line of investors who would be
      paid first from Qwest's assets, implying that those bondholders who
      did not exchange their notes might get nothing at all if the company died.
      This tactic angered bondholders, but enough of them accepted the offer to
      reduce Qwest's bonded debt from $5.2 billion to $3.3 billion. In
      2003 some bondholders sued Qwest over the bond restructuring.
    

      By the end of 2002 Notebaert had reorganized Qwest's corporate
      structure into three units: business customer services, general consumer
      services, and wholesale marketing. He tried to extend Qwest's
      long-distance services to the old U.S. West local service territories, but
      as at Ameritech, regulators refused the plan. As 2003 began Qwest had 25
      million customers in 14 states, a formidable customer base if Qwest could
      dig out from under its debts, but the company lost 4.9 percent of its
      customers from June 2002 to June 2003. Due in May were $3.2 billion in
      debts that Notebaert and Shaffer managed to persuade debt holders to
      restructure into longer-term payments. In 2003 Notebaert sold
      Qwest's Yellow Pages for $7 billion, which was applied to debts.
      Both Qwest's $16 billion fiber-optics network of 190,000 miles of
      lines and its long-distance network (in areas where Qwest offered no local
      phone service) were losing money, and financial analysts suggested that
      Qwest should sell them, but Notebaert saw them as part of a profitable
      future and insisted that Qwest hang on to them. He reduced the
      fiber-optics network from 14 servers to seven because the network was not
      receiving enough customers to use more than seven; he then moved the
      fiber-optics network into the jurisdiction of the corporation's
      business unit. Notebaert shaved off costs even further by cutting 3,500
      jobs during 2003. By the end of 2003 Qwest had lost perhaps $470 million
      for the year on $14.3 billion in revenue but had reduced its overall debt
      to $16 billion.
    

      These results were achieved not only by cuts but also by new strategies.
      Notebaert changed the focus of business services from large corporations
      to midsize businesses, exploiting a new (for Qwest) market. He formed a
      partnership with Sprint for national wireless service, giving Qwest a big
      share of the cellular phone market. Part of his strategy rejected the
      possible sale of Qwest and rejected the possible acquisition of smaller
      companies; Notebaert pursued alliances such as that with Sprint to expand
      Qwest's markets without incurring more debts. He placed emphasis on
      good customer relations and would pose as a consumer to call Qwest
      customer service representatives to make sure they were delivering good
      service. Overall, he gave his employees the impression that he was always
      involved in the company's day-to-day business and that he cared
      about them and their work.
    

      During 2003 Notebaert was appointed by President George W. Bush to the
      National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, where he worked
      to establish standards for new communications technologies and to find
      ways to secure America's communications networks from sabotage
       by terrorists. When Notebaert accepted his appointments at Qwest, he and
      his wife moved from Chicago to Denver, although they kept an apartment in
      Chicago so that they could visit with family and friends. In Denver they
      were active in the United Way and other local charities.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
