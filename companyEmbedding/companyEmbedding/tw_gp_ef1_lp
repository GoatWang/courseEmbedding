The Power to Create. Canon is proud to present the highly anticipated EOS 5D Mark III. With supercharged EOS performance and stunning full frame, high-resolution image capture, the EOS 5D Mark III is designed to perform. Special optical technologies like the 61-Point High Density Reticular AF and an extended ISO range of 100-25600 (expandable to 50 (L), 51200 (H1) and 102400 (H2) make the EOS 5D Mark III ideal for shooting weddings in the studio or out in the field, and great for still photography. Advanced professional-level high definition video capabilities (that includes a host of industry-standard recording protocols and enhanced performance) make it possible to capture beautiful cinematic movies in EOS HD quality. A newly designed 22.3 Megapixel full-frame Canon CMOS sensor, Canon DIGIC 5+ Image Processor, and shooting performance up to 6.0 fps provide exceptional clarity and sharpness, even when capturing rapidly-unfolding scenes. Additional technological advancements include an Intelligent Viewfinder, Canon's advanced iFCL metering system, High Dynamic Range (HDR), and Multiple Exposure mode - all of which that help make the EOS 5D Mark III the perfect multimedia tool.

22.3 Megapixel full-frame CMOS sensor  The EOS 5D Mark III features a newly developed Canon full-frame 22.3 Megapixel CMOS sensor that's designed from the ground up to create high resolution, perfectly detailed images with unprecedented speed and clarity. A full 24 x 36mm, the sensor captures 5784 x 3861 large individual 6.25 μm pixels and has a much-improved S/N ratio. A new photodiode structure with an increased photoelectric conversion rate increases the sensor's sensitivity by approximately 2 stops over previous models, meaning higher ISOs with the lowest noise of any EOS digital camera. And a 2-line 8-channel simultaneous signal readout means speeds of up to 6.0 fps (RAW + JPEG) are possible! 14-bit A/D conversion, wide range ISO setting 100-25600 (L: 50, H1: 51200, H2: 102400)  The EOS 5D Mark III not only offers 14-bit signal processing for excellent image gradation, it delivers higher standard and expanded ISOs, and a score of new options to enhance shooting in varied and fast-changing lighting situations. With a standard range of ISO 100-25600, the EOS 5D Mark III represents a 2-stop increase in sensitivity over previous cameras. Thanks to the improved signal-to-noise ratio of the new sensor and powerful noise reduction, the EOS 5D Mark III can shoot at expanded sensitivities down to ISO 50 (L) and up to 51200 (H1), and even 102400 (H2)!  DIGIC 5+ Image Processor for enhanced noise reduction and blazing processing speed  The EOS 5D Mark III uses a DIGIC 5+ Image Processor. Working with two 4-channel A/D converter front-end processing circuits, and delivering speeds of up to 6.0 fps (RAW + JPEG), and the DIGIC 5+ Image Processor improves data processing performance and features new algorithms that promote greater noise reduction at higher ISOs. In addition to conventional image processing functions the DIGIC 5+ Image Processor offers real-time compensation for chromatic aberration in both still and motion images.  All new 61-Point High Density Reticular AF  The newly designed 61-Point High Density Reticular AF features an Offset Array Sensor (with staggering AF point arrangement) to deliver greater accuracy, no matter the situation. It offers multi-zone wide-area AF for better tracking, has 5 central dual cross-type points (f/2.8 diagonal), 21 central cross-type points (f/5.6 horizontal & vertical) and 20 outer cross-type points (f/4.0 horizontal), and is sensitive in extremely low-light situations (EV-2 for a central point with a f/2.8 lens). iFCL Metering with 63-zone dual-layering metering sensor  The EOS 5D Mark III features Canon's multi-layer 63-zone iFCL (intelligent Focus Color Luminance) Metering System that integrates the cameras AF system into its readings. By taking into account the color and luminosity surrounding the chosen AF point(s), this new system delivers an entirely new level of accuracy, especially in situations where the light changes quickly. The metering sensor enables evaluative, center weighted, partial and spot metering, plus offers 5-step exposure compensation for perfectly exposed images, every time. EOS HD Video with manual exposure control, multiple frame rates and selectable All i-frame or IPB compression.  The EOS 5D Mark III offers both All-I and IPB compression, supports H.264/MPEG-4 AVC High Profile, and automatically splits files greater than 4GB (FAT specifications) for extended recording without interruption. It offers the option of timecoding during recording only (Rec Run) or at all times (Free Run), useful for multi-camera shoots. It also features improved sound recording adjustment capabilities, offering 64-step volume control accessible through the Quick Control screen during video shooting, plus a dedicated headphone jack for convenience in shooting.

The quality of the materiel is excellent and I would recommend this product.  It fits all of the Arca style plates and is easy to install.  It is a little bigger than the original lens foot, so it may take some getting used to.  If your hand-holding the lens, it may be easier to rotate the lens foot to the top of the lens for better access to the zoom tension and focusing rings.  Other than that, I think this is a great addition to the lens.

By Cardinalfrom Ottawa ON CanadaComments about Kirk LP-61 Replacement Foot for Canon EF 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L IS II USM Lens:I keep wondering why Canon was that negligent in devising such a silly foot for their 100/400 mm Mk 2.Granted, there is still some slight rebound with the Kirk product but nothing to compare with Canon's inept product.This ,replacement foot is essential to get great results from the new lens.Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friendWas this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review1/20/2017 5.0I highly recommend this product.

It makes so much more sense to have the foot be arca-type compatible so you can mount it directly to the tripod quick release, rather than needing to screw on an additional quick release plate like you do with the OEM foot. The only reason I deducted a star is 1) price is a bit steep; 2) I wish the slot for attaching the strap was toward the back of the foot, rather than at the front; the way it is now, because it's so far forward, the center of balance is way off when you carry the lens & camera by the strap; 3) this foot is rather low profile, which is good in terms of portability and keeping the center of gravity low when mounted on the tripod -- but that also means there's not a lot of room between the foot and the lens if you're the type (like me) who likes to carry the lens by the foot.  Even with fairly skinny hands and fingers, I have trouble comfortably using this foot as a handle for carrying the lens.(5 of 5 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review12/13/2016(2 of 2 customers found this review helpful) 5.0Very Sturdy By Thomasfrom undisclosedComments about Kirk LP-61 Replacement Foot for Canon EF 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L IS II USM Lens:Great, sturdy replacement foot with gimbal plate built in. Double rails too. Canon factory foot constantly worked loose from big screw as well as add on gimbal plate always coming loose. Kirk replacement foot with gimbal plate molded into it, hasn't come loose yet and is much more steady and sturdy on monopod and tripod mount. Looked at three different makes and liked this one best.

Is it easy to hold the lens using this foot?  It's awkward to carry the lens using the original lens foot without adding a longer lens plate.


Eric P  on Sep 3, 2016








Best Answer: In my experience it depends on how you position your hand on the Canon lens foot and whether the foot is rotated from bottom of lens to top of lens.Method 1I am right handed so tend to carry with my right hand. With the Canon foot I carry with the camera body facing forward and the lens pointing behind me. This way, I can get two fingers under the foot (between lens and foot) to cradle the foot and my thumb then presses on the back of the foot to lock my grip in place. The back of the foot is flush with nothing jutting out.Method 2If I reverse this and have the lens pointing forward with camera at rear, if feels less secure with just two fingers cradling the lens. I try to stuff my little finger at the back of the foot to lock the grip but find this does not feel as relaxed and secure as Method 1.With the Kirk foot, there is more metal sticking out behind the foot (the Canon foot is flush) and this offers more to grab onto (bottom lens position) and therefore provides a more secure grip. If you rotate the ring so that the foot is at the top of the lens, then both lens feet tend to be a bit limited in that the pentaprism bulge on the camera body doesnât allow my (large) fingers to grip the foot securely. The Kirk rear flange sits closer to the pentaprism housing than the angled and flush rear section of the Canon foot.Generally, the way I hold this combo, the Kirk foot offers a better, more relaxed carry. I only tend to carry for short periods and I suspect that carrying for longer periods could be a little uncomfortable unless you have a long plate attached and the foot is at the bottom of the lens.

If you mean "hold" using the KIRK adaptor as a handle to pick up or carry the lens (walking around, say), then the answer is yes--I do this all the time and it feels comfortable and sturdy.  If you mean "hold" as in hand-hold while shooting, then (of course) all you have to do is rotate the lens collar so the tripod foot is out of your way. In general the Kirk foot is far better than the Canon foot that comes with the lens, especially when using the lens on a tripod.

If you have issues with the OEM lens foot, then you probably will with this one, too. It's a little bigger and you need a wrench to attach/remove the foot. However, it does not require another Arca Swiss plate like the OEM foot. Personally, the Kirk lens foot does not get in my way at all when carrying the camera/lens or when actually shooting, so I leave the foot attached at all times. I carry the 7D2 + 100-400L II using a Black Rapid shoulder strap

It is much better than the original foot and fits an Arca Swiss clamp.  I however am unsure whether it would fit a Really Right Stuff clamp.  It fits other clamps well and is in my opinion significantly easier to carry by hand than the original foot.  I would however suggest if shooting by hand to remove the foot of turn it upright-either one.

The foot works well with Arca-Swiss quick release mechanisms. This or the original foot can be easily and quickly rotated to the side or top of the lens for ease of hand-held operation. I hand-hold most of the time and use the foot frequently with a Wemberley Sidekick and do not find it to be a problem.

Yes Eric, it is much easier to balance and use the foot as a way to carry and balance for your shot. I found it even more help full when shooting vertically " portrait" I turn the lens so that the foot sits at 270 degrees while the body of the camera is in portrait mode.

The foot is not extra long and is not rounded at the top. Yes, you can carry the lens that way but the footwas not designed (with that in mind) so I would not say that it's "comfortable". It is what it is.

The length is about the same as the Canon foot. I can carry the mounted lens by this foot: thanks to the little bit of metal sticking out in the back it feels a bit secure than the Canon foot.

Carrying the lens with either foot is no problem. The reason I got the new foot was because it still fit in the case whereas the original foot with an arca plate would not.

Is this an appropriate replacement foot to use with the Manfrotto 200PL Quick Release plate?  If not, what do you recommend for the Manfrotto set-up?


A shopper  on Mar 21, 2017








Best Answer: Yes, you could fix the Manfrotto 200PL to this.  However, it would not be an elegant or robust solution ... too many interface points.  I suggest you use this foot on the lens and source a replacement tripod head which has an Arca-Swiss fixing.  Alternatively, just fit the 200PL direct to the Canon foot supplied wiht the lens.

Assuming that you are using this on a Canon 100-400 L ll, you could use it but the real advantage to the Kirk foot is that it has a very stable Arca mount built in.  It also seems to have a slightly lower profile than the Canon foot that comes with the lens.  My thought is that the Canon foot might actually be slightly better to mount a Manfrotto plate to because of the ribbed bottom.

I use two different mounts for this lens: a gimbel with an Arca female plate.  This is cumbersome for hiking though.  I also purchased the Manfrotto 057 Ball Head.  It has an Arca-style mounting that accepts this add-on foot.  This is a better combo for hiking/travel.

The LP 61 is for an Arca-Swiss head. You would have to attach the Manfrotto 200PL plate to the LP-61 for it to attach to the Manfrotto set up. Just attach the 200PL plate to the foot that comes with the lens.

No, I would stick with the original foot, as this one is has an integrated arca-swiss plate, and you'd still have to attach a manfrotto plate, which defeats the purpose.

Is there a mounting screw with a clip ring option?  I want to know if there is a way to connect this replacement foot to my black rapid strap?


Derek T  on Feb 17, 2016








Best Answer: When the product shipped to me, it included a Pan-head, socket cap screw and a 3mm Allen Key with a good sized blue plastic T-handle.When inserted and tightened, the Pan-head screw is at the bottom of a (stepped) well, approx. 1âx1â opening and maybe Â½â deep.Issues to explore if you were to have a clip ring in place of the Pan-head screw: the ring may not sit inside the âwellâ and even if it did, there may be a problem where the strap would press against the edges of the âwellâ â it could apply torque to the screw?CheersDennis

Yes. From description: "This LP-61 Replacement Foot from Kirk is for the Canon EF 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L IS II USM Lens. It has 1/4"-20 and 3/8"-16 threaded holes as well as a slot for attaching a strap." Screw the Rapid FastenR into the 1/4-20 hole. (Or one of the other Black Rapid fastener devices...I think they are all 1/4-20, one of the standard tripod screw sizes.)

It did not come with that type of screw. You will have to look for that in tripod accessoriesor miscellaneous accessories. The foot does allow you to loop a strap through the leadingedge however. Basically, the same idea.

Does Canon make a replacement for this foot?


Christy C  on Oct 19, 2016








Best Answer: Canon does not make a replacement foot for the 100-400II IS Lens like the Kirk LP-61. Really Right Stuff makes a similar replacement foot, but is slightly more expensive, and has a taller profile. They'll both work well with a Swiss-Arca clamp.

The Canon-supplied foot on the 100-400 II does not work with an Arca-style clamp. You can either buy a plate (many different suppliers) to attach to the bottom of the Canon foot or you can buy the RRS or Kirk replacement foot which has the appropriate plate built in. I chose the latter, a Kirk LP-61, after trying a plate attached to the Canon-supplied foot. I found when carrying the mounted lens on tripod over my shoulder for a time, the thumbscrew on the foot tended to loosen, with attendant stability and security problems. The replacement foot is a much better solution. And no, Canon does not make a replacement foot with the Arca-style plate built in.

The foot that comes with the 100-400mm IS II doesn't have the grooves, in the sides, to work with the Swiss-Acra clamp. I replaced mine with this Kirk plate3 and it has worked very well. It is better than just attaching a plate to the bottom of the existing foot.

No they do not. The Canon foot is not designed to fit an Arca-Swiss plate very well. The best option if you want to mount lens on Arca-Swiss is to purchase a 3rd-party foot like the Kirk, which is excellent.

If You Like the Feel of Wood






            Posted by Albert Johnston on 20th Dec 2016
        
This is a spring assisted liner lock from Tac-Force with a black epoxy coated 3.5 concave clip point blade. (probably 440 series stainless steel) The bolster liner plates have the same surface treatment, The bolsters are  stainless steel with a titanium nitrite treatment. The scales are Pakkawood.  The fit and finish are good. The knife has a nice substantial 'feel' in the hand. A good all around daily carry / work knife. The blade on this knife came out smoothly with the thumb rocker but I like mine to really 'pop' so I adjusted the blade axial pivot screw with a T-9 Torx  driver till I got it where I wanted it. Not really necessary but I've been a mechanic for 40+ years and cant resist the urge to 'fiddle' with things. 8<) The scales could have been stained a little darker for my personal tastes but all in all, a very nice folder for an excellent price.  



Great buy

Why I like it is that it's a quick opening knife. I like the wood on it. 



Beautiful folding knife

After shopping several places for a custom knife I decided on this Tac Force Multi-Purpose Folder. I couldn't have made a better choice. Appearance and workmanship far exceeds the more expensive knives on the market.      



Fantastic!

Target Pests
Bifen LP Granules will kill fleas ticks roaches spiders ants scorpions and many other listed insects.
For Use In
Bifen granules are designed for outdoor application only such as lawns turf farms golf courses parks sports fields etc.
Application
Bifen L/P is applied at a rate of 25lbs per 1/4 acre for most insects and can be applied with a granule spreader or by hand. It is a professional granular insecticide so make sure to wear protective equipment like gloves and long pants and sleeves when applying.

After spreading Bifen L/P, apply a light covering of water to activate the product. Be sure to keep pets and children off of the treated area until dry. Once dry, it is recommended to mow after the application of Bifen L/P.
Keep all pets and kids off of treated area until dry.
Coverage Area
Each bag will cover 1/4 acre.
Time to Kill

                    Bifen LP Granules                

                            By Norma Jarman                             on 5/14/2016                     


                    I had really high hopes for this product.  The reviews I read were great, and I was excited to receive the product and see if make a difference.  We have lots of fleas this season (warm winter--didn't freeze and kill everything!), and I was looking for something to kill them in my yard.  I spread an entire bag in both my front and back yard (it is a small space).  Unfortunately the fleas are still around.  I was so optimistic about this that I purchased 2 bags...going to give it another try, but I don't have high hopes.

                    I treated my yard 7 years ago with this product and the house with other products that I purchased from ePestSolutions.com and I have not had any flea problems until this year.  I treated the yard and house again and we are flea free!!! Love these products.

                    granules help provide a residual barrier
around the exterior of your home to help control insects .

                    Chinch bugs beware, this product works. I have used this for 2 years now, and have lost no lawn to the dreaded chinch bug. But it has also helped to control the ant population in my yard as well as other insects. I would recommend this to anyone with a lawn insect product.

Sting's twelfth solo studio album, 57th & 9th, his first pop/rock project in over a decade, will be released on November 11, 2016. The ten-song collection, produced by Martin Kierszenbaum, represents a wide range of Sting s musical and songwriting styles, from the ferocious, Road Warrior-style imagery of Petrol Head to the classic folk narrative Pretty Young Soldier. The first single, I Can't Stop Thinking About You, shows Sting at his most propulsive and danceable, evidence of the influence his music continues to have on pop today.

A smile should then cross your face as you realize you're in for a real treat -- a new Sting album that is probably his best traditional one sinceTen Summoner's Tales.  Sting seems more at ease with delivering a "pop/rock" album (as its being promoted in light of recent work ranging from an interesting but little-heard Broadway musical soundtrack The Last Ship [Amazon Exclusive Super Deluxe Edition] to the head-scratching middle-of-the-road offering Symphonicities) than he did with his last two -- Brand New Day and Sacred Love.  These two albums suffered perhaps from Sting trying too much to branch out into current pop trends (new country, r&b, dance, etc.), but here Sting sticks to what has proved to be his bread & butter -- strong songwriting coupled with really catchy melodies.  You can't get much better choruses than the title track, "Down, Down, Down" and "Petrol Head."  In another decade, these three songs would be Top 40 hits.  Those days may be over, but it'd be hard to deny that these songs are just as strong as his best solo work.  "Down, Down, Down" is especially great with uncharacteristically vulnerable lyrics and vocals ("Here comes the sound I've never heard before/The sound that tells me when you're walking out my door.")  "One Fine Day" reminds listeners that perhaps Neil Finn is not the only legendary songwriter still capable of writing 3 minute clever pop songs just as strong as their classic work and sounding like they didn't even break a sweat in the process.  The first 2/3 the album at its heart is Sting and longtime guitarist Dominic Miller and drummer Vinnie Colaiuta banging through some very good rock songs.  The last third slows down a bit and recalls more of Sting's esoteric solo work.  The energy clearly shifts beginning with the Dylanesque "Heading South on the Great North Road."  The best track on the album may be the haunting "If You Can't Love Me" which recalls "I Burn For You" from The Police days; I can picture this a song that 5 or 10 years from now will be turned into a hit for an artist like Adele.  I wish "Inshallah" would pick up a bit at the end to pack perhaps a greater emotional punch, but it and closing track "This Empty Chair" make for a calm, quiet end to a very strong albeit short album.  Combined with a lot of strong material from The Last Ship soundtrack as well as the incredible recent tour with Peter Gabriel, it's great for a life long fan to see Sting having a burst of creativity that seems to have been missing throughout the 00s.  Happy for him & grateful 40+ years later he's still providing his fans great music.Read more11 comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsThe King of Pain removes his Hairshirt for One Fine Day!!!Bywhipitgoodon December 12, 2016Format: Audio CD|Verified PurchaseSting, at his best, is soulful, sincere, charismatic, humble, and above all honest.  He still speaks his mind here, as always, but he does it in a palatable way, making the listening experience joyful rather than a drudgery.  There's still a bit of gloom and doom around, but he does a good job of preventing his darker impulses from engulfing his good nature.  One of life's bitter ironies is that being intelligent may give you the ability to see problems, but not necessarily the skill or the resources to solve them.  And intelligence may give you the ability to catch a glimpse of perfection, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's within your reach.  So Sting gets the blues, as many of us do.  But on THIS record, he seems to have recovered his mojo.  This is well-crafted, but not over-wrought.  It has the feel of a loose jam record, similar to Regatta De Blanc, but obviously more mature and pop-oriented.  Sting has spent many years chasing after esoteric musical ideas, continually testing his own artistic bravery as well as his fan's patience.  But this time around, he stops worrying about what a "serious" artist might do, and he just rocks.  Many people, and some musicians, are incapable of rocking, so to have a guy like Sting come around and show us all how it's done is great fun.  Is he off somewhere flogging himself for "selling out" with this latest record, when he could've broken new artistic ground by fusing disparate instruments such as the tuba, ukulele, kazoo and pennywhistle into some bizarre opus?  Perhaps.  But you know what?  There's nothing wrong with re-discovering melody, harmony, rhythm and so forth.  Does tight, rhythmic, melodic-sounding pop music lead you in the direction of the Beatles?  Yes-they wrote the book on this style of music, so of course it does.  Don't apologize for having a good time.  We weren't put here to suffer, you know?  And there's nothing wrong with plagiarism if you're plagiarizing your own work, which he sometimes does.  To be successful in the pop idiom, one must condense sophisticated lyrical and musical ideas with great force, in such a way that discards the superfluous aspects but retains the essential elements-all the while blending the familiar and the experimental in various proportions to create something that is at once comforting but also vaguely challenging.  It's a balancing act.  It's a craft.  Sting is great at it when he wants to be.  And it's not something to be scoffed at or embarrassed about.  He has brought a lot of happiness to a lot of people.  I, for one, have been listening for over 30 years.  I have few regrets.  You won't either, should you choose to buy this.  Enjoy!Read more11 comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 stars) Glad to hear him kicking it like thisByNon De Plumeon December 23, 2016Format: Audio CD|Verified PurchaseWhoever said this isn't rock got the wrong CD. :) Glad to hear him kicking it like this.The thing is, an artist is a person who grows and changes like everyone else. You may ski, watch football, grow a garden and work on a '70s muscle car in your spare time. Why does Sting have to turn out the same commercial stuff for our consumption? Sacred Love was far from artistic suicide. He gained a huge listening base he didn't have before. He didn't pass off his olde English Lute work as Police tunes. It's really all music. Take it or leave it. Buy the stuff of his you like. Yet respect him as a person who has free will to make the music that he wants to express.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsSting's Return to RockByJohn M.on January 12, 2017Format: Audio CD|Verified PurchaseThis album marks Sting's "return" to a more Rock & Roll effort than we've heard from him in over a decade.  As a life long fan, I can say there is some very good work on this disc.  The material has a very stripped down almost "corner bar band" kind of vibe with a real energy.  The band sounds better and tighter than ever.  Sting's voice is showing it's age, however, with a much lower singing register and seemingly permanent gravel.  This album was recorded in a short period of time - on purpose.  Unfortunately, some of the material reflects this.  Almost as if time was running out and they had to get more songs thrown together.  As I said, there are some real gems on this disc.  The songs that are good are very, very good - and the songs that aren't...well, they sound like it.  However, overall, I would recommend giving it a try.  At the end of the day, this album is a new release from a truly brilliant musician and storyteller and it offers something for everyone.Read more0Comment|

A unit process model based methodology to assist productsustainability assessment during design for manufacturingMichael D. Eastwood*, Karl R. HaapalaIndustrial Sustainability Laboratory, School of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering, 204 Rogers Hall, Oregon State University, Corvallis,OR 97331, USAarticle infoArticle history:Received 18 April 2014Received in revised form28 July 2015Accepted 26 August 2015Available online 3 September 2015Keywords:Product sustainability assessmentDesign for manufacturingUnit process modelabstractAs the growth in demand for sustainable manufacturing continues, companies must begin to makeconscious decisions with regard to the sustainability of their products. Thus, design and manufacturingengineers must consider economic, environmental, and social aspects simultaneously when developingproducts and process ﬂows. The purpose of this research is to develop a sustainable assessment meth-odology to both improve the accuracy of existing approaches in identifying the sustainability impacts of aproduct and to assist manufacturing decision makers. The methodology developed utilizes unit processmodeling and life cycle inventory techniques. Combining these approaches allows for conductingproduct sustainability assessment at the process level by quantifying a selected set of sustainabilitymetrics. A demonstration of the methodology to assess three design alternatives for a bevel gear ispresented. The developed methodology is capable of quantifying the sustainability metrics by aggre-gating information from the process level. It was found that the various metrics require different ag-gregation methods from the manufacturing process to the manufacturing system level. The generalapproach can be applied to aid the investigation of tradeoffs during the design decision making processfor a wide range of products.© 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.1. IntroductionThe product manufacturing industry is starting to incorporateeconomic, environmental, and social aspects of sustainability intodesign decision making processes. The degradation of the envi-ronment caused by economic advancement led to the discussion ofthe notion of sustainable development on an international level atthe 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Devel-opment. The conference covered several issues including thegrowing scarcity of water, the depletion of non-renewable sourcesof energy, and human health problems in the workplace and thecommunity (United Nations Conference on Environment andDevelopment, 1992). A major contributor to these issues wasfound to be the unsustainable production patterns in industry. Theconference resulted in creating three major agreements includingAgenda 21, The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development,and The Statement of Forest Principles (United Nations Conferenceon Environment and Development, 1992). These agreementscomprise of a program of action and a series of principles to addressall areas of sustainable development.In the United States, regulations are documented within the USCode of Federal Regulations (Code of Federal Regulations, 2014),and includes regulations such as the Clean Air Act, the Clean WaterAct, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The UnitedStates Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) enforces these reg-ulations to ensure the protection of human health and the envi-ronment (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2014).Regulations have forced companies to face the challenge ofbalancing economics with environmental and social aspects. It is adifﬁcult task to reduce energy and natural resource consumptionand ensure the well-being of employees, customers, and the com-munity, all the while remaining economically competitive.As consumers are becoming aware of sustainability in a broadsense, they are placing value on economic, environmental, andsocial responsibility. Thus, they are generating demand for moresustainable products and practices. Retailers are recognizing thecost beneﬁts of reducing material consumption and eliminatingwastes, and are demanding it from their suppliers. In some in-stances, retailers are requiring documentation from their suppliers* Corresponding author.

If so, I will return to buy many more.

Am nearly out of ink so I am reordering and really like the fact that this order is costing less than my first order due to a % off and free shipping. Your prices are much lower than the big box stores. I am on Social Security and this discount  really helps.Thank You!

A bit more definition would be helpful                                 Overall Rating:               Would Shop Here Again:               Likelihood To Recommend:   Full ratings for this review »                Paradigmpi                           Jul 27, 2017            I really like your inks - have used your brother inks for about 10 years and have found them EXCELLENT.

Jul 27, 2017  I did not realize how bad my first replacements were when I ordered a 2nd set. I now know they are not very good or my first order was ok. I really do not know. I learned a  lesson.
