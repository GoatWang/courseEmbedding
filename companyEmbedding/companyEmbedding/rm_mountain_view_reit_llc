1Information about portfolio holdings and business sector diversification is as of March 31, 2017 and is subject to change.
2Senior secured loans, second lien loans, mezzanine debt and selected equity investments may be risky, and we could lose all or part of our investment. Most loans in which we invest will not be rated, or would be if they were rated by a rating agency, as "below investment grade" quality. Below investment-grade quality securities are commonly known as "junk" and may be considered more speculative with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal.

Testimonials











 Livvy Nallipogu
CEO at IntegrityTek


Working with Kriss at Rocky Mountain Drones has been amazing. He is a great teacher and a guide, you will not regret working with him. He has taught me a lot about Drone Technology and industry itself added to that he is also a great human being. You will surely learn a lot through him. Thank you Kriss for everything.

 








 Bruce Borowsky
Triple Threat Digital


Kriss’s class was extremely helpful in helping me to understand the complexities of not only reading, but understanding, the myriad of information necessary to successfully complete the Part 107 exam – sectional maps, weather, airspace, rules, etc. He did a great job teaching me – I easily passed the test last week with an 82% – thanks Kriss!
