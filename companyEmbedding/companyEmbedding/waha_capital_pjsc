Waha Capital is an Abu Dhabi-listed investment company that offers shareholders and third-party investors exposure to high-potential opportunities in diversified asset classes.
The Company manages assets across several sectors, including aircraft leasing, healthcare, financial services, energy, infrastructure, industrial real estate and capital markets.
Through its Principal Investments unit, Waha Capital has established a strong investment track-record, deploying capital in sectors that display robust demand fundamentals and that have been prioritised by governments in the Middle East and North Africa region. 
The company has also built a strong capability in managing global and regional credit and equity portfolios, which have enhanced the diversification and liquidity of Waha Capital’s balance sheet.
The excellent performance of the company’s principal investments and capital markets portfolios has laid the foundations for the launch of an asset management business aimed at third-party investors.   
Established in 1997, Waha Capital has been consistently profitable – its investment teams are singularly focused on deploying capital efficiently, where they see and can add value, in order to deliver sustainable and attractive returns to shareholders and investment partners.

Waha Capital also benefits from a roster of prominent local shareholders that includes Mubadala Development Company, and a distinguished board, chaired by H.E. Hussain Jasim Al Nowais.
While Waha Capital manages investments globally, the company remains deeply rooted in Abu Dhabi's economy and operates at the centre of influential business networks in the United Arab Emirates and the wider Middle East region. By investing in key growth sectors, the company is a contributor to the ongoing development of a dynamic private sector – an important component of the region's economic diversification plans.
