			If your goal is to generate income from your investments, explore these model portfolios.

Get started




















A path toward an income-generating portfolio
As an investor, you have your own knowledge of funds, tolerance for risk, and preference for asset allocation. Matching your unique financial situation to a particular goal—such as investing for growth and income—requires research and strategy.
To help you craft or adjust your investment approach, we've developed three models of income-generating portfolios: Conservative Income, Balanced Income, and Growth Income.
These portfolios emphasize interest and dividend income as a component of total return for a given level of investment risk. While the primary focus of the portfolios is to provide income, the underlying mutual funds continue to seek growth of capital over the long term.
 Make the models work for you 
Start by assessing your current circumstances and your short- and long-term financial goals; then compare and contrast the three model portfolios.
Review the methodology document (PDF) to learn how these models were created. This information can help inform your research into each individual fund, as well as into other funds, including non-Fidelity funds.
Use these model portfolios to help you research investments, refine your existing portfolio, and even build your own income-focused portfolio.

Income-Focused Balanced




Income-Focused Growth

This asset mix may be appropriate for investors who wish to minimize fluctuations in market value, compared to an equity-only portfolio, and who seek to emphasize dividend and interest income (versus capital appreciation) as a component of total return.

								  The primary objective of the Fidelity Fund Portfolios-Income is to provide a representation of just one way you might construct a portfolio of Fidelity mutual funds, designed for the purpose of providing a focus on interest and dividend income, over a range of long term risk levels, which are consistent with the asset allocations of a (sub)set of Fidelity’s Target Asset Mixes (TAMs). The Fidelity Fund Portfolios–Income represent three distinct income‐focused model portfolios (Conservative–Income, Balanced–Income, and Growth–Income) consistent with different levels of long-term risk.

From our experts




									
								
									A case for dividends 


They’re not just for income, particularly when dividends are reinvested.




									
								
									Tips for volatility 


When markets get choppy, it pays to have a plan, and to stick to it.

As rates rise, consider valuations, payout ratios, and growth potential to find long-term value.



















Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.


          Diversification and asset allocation do not ensure a profit or guarantee against a loss.
	
    

          Investing involves risk, including risk of loss.
	
    

          Stock markets, especially foreign markets, are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.
	
    

          In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible.
	
    

          Fidelity's guidance is educational and should not be the primary basis of your investment decisions. Please see themodel portfolio methodology (PDF) for more information about how the models are created. You should also carefully research any fund you may be considering prior to making an investment decision. You may consider another allocation and other investments, including non‐Fidelity funds, having similar risk and return characteristics may be available.
	
    

          We can change or update the model portfolios at any time. Fidelity will not notify you when they are updated. The model portfolios may contain taxable bond funds. The model portfolios do not attempt to consider the effect of income taxes on performance or returns and does not reflect any opinion on the tax‐appropriateness of the portfolio for any investor. Depending on your tax situation, municipal bond funds may be more appropriate for you. Model portfolios do not consider the effect of taxes, fees and/or expenses associated with investing. Please consult with your investment or tax advisor, if applicable, prior to taking action.
	
    

          In applying the model portfolio or any other results to your individual situation, be sure to consider other assets, income and investments (e.g., home equity, savings accounts or other retirement accounts) in addition to assets designated for this goal. The model portfolios are not designed to maximize return or predict the highest performing funds.

Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.







Past performance is no guarantee of future results.



Diversification and asset allocation do not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss.


          * Fidelity's goal is to make financial expertise broadly accessible and effective in helping people live the lives they want. With assets under administration of $5.6 trillion, including managed assets of $2.1 trillion as of September 30, 2016, we focus on meeting the unique needs of a diverse set of customers: helping more than 24 million people invest their own life savings, nearly 20,000 businesses manage employee benefit programs, as well as providing nearly 10,000 advisory firms with technology solutions to invest their own clients' money.
	
    

          1. Fidelity Management & Research Company and Fidelity Institutional Asset Management, as of 9/30/16. Data is unaudited. These figures reflect the resources of Fidelity Management & Research Company, a U.S. company, and its subsidiaries. Research professionals include portfolio managers, research analysts and research associates.
	
    

          2. Highly rated funds are defined as those funds that have a 4- or 5-Star Morningstar rating. For each fund, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingTM metric each month by subtracting the return on a 90-day U.S. Treasury Bill from the fund's load-adjusted return for the same period, and then adjusting this excess return for risk. The top 10% of funds in each broad asset class receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) Although gathered from reliable sources, data completeness and accuracy cannot be guaranteed by Morningstar.
	
    

          3. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time. Fidelity's government and U.S. Treasury money market funds will not impose a fee upon the sale of your shares, nor temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets because of market conditions or other factors.
	
    

          4. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. The fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund's sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


          5. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Because the share price of the fund will fluctuate, when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what you originally paid for them. The fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund's sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.


          Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.
	
    

The securities of smaller, less well known companies can be more volatile than those of larger companies.


Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.


In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible.



Indexes are unmanaged. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

Fidelity Strategic Funds are multi-asset-class strategies that seek to address key income needs—bond income from global sources, non-bond income from dividend-paying securities, and real return to help protect against inflation—by investing in a diversified mix of fixed income and/or equity investments chosen for their historical combined performance.

Fidelity® Trend Fund: Portfolio Manager Q&A

DECEMBER 31, 2016

Fund Managers
Daniel Kelley
Q&A


An interview with Portfolio Manager Daniel Kelley

Dan, how did the fund perform for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016?
The fund returned 4.57%, which lagged the 7.08% gain of the benchmark Russell 1000® Growth Index but beat the peer group average. 
Our underperformance of the benchmark came in the first half of the year, as worries over a possible recession pushed investors toward less volatile, but more expensive, stocks with little or no earnings growth. 
This backdrop wasn't a good fit with my long-term strategy of investing in "mispriced earnings growth" – stocks that seem attractively priced relative to their earnings growth prospects. While a lot of growth fund managers focus on finding the fastest earnings growth without much concern for valuation, I tend to look at earnings growth on a price-per-pound basis. I prefer stocks that give us the opportunity to benefit twice: once when earnings beat estimates and then again as more investors become willing to pay up for a business showing signs of improvement. 
In the second half of the year, sticking with my strategy paid off. I found "mispriced earnings growth" in more economically sensitive sectors, which had cheaper price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples than the benchmark average. I thought these stocks could see price gains if a couple things went right. Energy stocks, for example, seemed ripe to rally if oil prices started to rise. Financial services stocks seemed likely to gain if interest rates began to climb. These factors played out, helping relative performance but not enough to eliminate our earlier performance gap.   

Which sectors and stocks hurt performance versus the benchmark? 
We lost the most ground from security selection in the information technology and health care sectors, together roughly 46% of the benchmark. Our biggest stock disappointments came from the pharmaceuticals, biotechnology & life sciences segment, an overweight, and  included Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, a non-benchmark holding, and Allergan. 
In July 2015, Israel-based Teva offered to buy Allergan's generic-drug business. I thought this acquisition and new products in the pipeline would boost Teva's earnings-growth outlook. But the firm was hurt by regulatory delays that prolonged the deal's closure until August 2016 and by general concern over potential caps on drug prices. Teva's stock returned -41% for the fund, and I eliminated the position by period end. 
However, I kept a reduced stake in Ireland-based Allergan, which I thought would benefit from becoming a branded-only company. Allergan has a strong medical aesthetics franchise that includes the anti-wrinkle treatment Botox®. A buyout offer that fell through and concern about drug price caps pressured the stock. 
In health care equipment & services, our sizable underweighting in UnitedHealth Group, the No. 1 U.S. health insurer, hurt. I viewed the stock as expensive, but strong earnings reports drove its 38% return in the index. 

Outside of health care, which stocks were notable detractors from relative performance? 
Our overweighting in electric car company Tesla Motors weighed on performance. Tesla is gearing up for a sizable increase in production with its new Model 3 car. The stock was pressured by uncertainty about how long the ramp up will take and how profitable the car will be, coupled with Tesla's already high P/E. I recently toured Tesla's new lithium battery factory outside of Reno. I came away encouraged that the company is on track to reduce battery costs – a major cost component of its cars – and, hence, will be able to generate attractive profit margins on the Model 3. The future earnings potential made the stock price seem more attractive to me.
In tech, our underweighting in software giant Microsoft detracted, as restructuring efforts paid off and the stock rallied. I thought the stock was a bit expensive, which is why it was not fully weighted in the fund.  

All these stocks are pretty different… 
They are. I think of growth stocks in three "buckets." UnitedHealth, Allergan, and Microsoft fit into my "quality growth" bucket. These tend to be large, well-known companies with proven management teams, high returns on capital, strong balance sheets and what I consider to be attractive stock prices relative to stable or accelerating earnings growth. I cut our "quality growth" exposure from 65% to 45% of fund assets by year-end, using the proceeds for more-attractive opportunities elsewhere. 
Tesla is a good example of "secular growth" – companies with high and sustainable earnings growth rates, often driven by a unique technology, a product that's in high demand, or a growing trend. "Secular growth" stocks tend to be more expensive versus current earnings than "quality growers," so there's more risk attached.
The third – and most exciting – bucket is "opportunistic growth." These are stocks – such as Teva – that I think are cheap but near an upward inflection point. When they go up, you can really get paid. But when they don't work out, the declines can be substantial. Our "opportunistic growth" exposure rose from roughly 10% to 32% of assets this year, the highest in the five years I've run the fund. 

Let's shift gears and talk about what helped relative performance. 
Sure. Stock picks in energy, financials and industrials – each an overweighting at period end – gave the biggest boost. I added to energy early in 2016, expecting improving supply/demand dynamics to spur higher oil and gas prices. One of my purchases was pipeline operator Williams Companies, a stock that was depressed by low commodity prices and, in my opinion, misplaced concern over significant risk to its cash flow if any of its customers went out of business. Higher commodity prices, coupled with a dividend cut that helped cash flow and eased credit concerns, resulted in a 67% gain in the fund's shares. 
In financials, our non-benchmark, sizable stake in Bank of America returned 35%. I had established this position because I thought the share price looked cheap relative to the bank's future earnings power, especially in light of recent cost cuts and the potential for higher interest rates. Then, the election of Donald Trump as president fueled expectations of deregulation and lower corporate tax rates, which helped bank stocks take off. 
In industrials, chemicals distribution company Univar stood out. I viewed this non-benchmark stock as depressed because the company had been undermanaged. In May, Univar appointed a new CEO with a track record of transformation at a previous company. I initiated a position over the summer. Plans to improve profit margins and a higher earnings outlook spurred a 50% gain in the fund's shares. All three stocks were "opportunistic growers." 

What's your outlook from here, Dan? I'm encouraged. Expectations are that economically sensitive sectors, which had been left for dead in 2016, will gain going forward from pro-growth initiatives under the new administration. In addition, I think we could see some market volatility, which often can create opportunities to buy "mispriced earnings growth." ■ 





Dan Kelley on the fund's sizable exposure to financials:


"One of the biggest changes I made this past year was to increase exposure to the financials sector, which rose from roughly 5% of assets to about 11% by year-end. Financials, which are not known for fast earnings growth, represented only about 3% of the Russell 1000 Growth Index.
"This shift is a classic example of my 'mispriced earnings growth' approach. Improving economic data in the back half of 2016 prompted me to look more closely at banks and diversified financials. Their earnings had not been growing for a couple years, as continued low interest rates kept a lid on net interest margins – the difference between what lenders earn on loans and pay on deposits. Plus, modest economic growth had kept loan growth in check, while much stricter compliance regulations, since the 2008 financial crisis, had boosted costs.   
"I thought financials stocks looked cheap relative to their earnings growth potential if interest rates were to rise. Most notably, I established a sizable stake in Bank of America and increased exposure to Northern Trust, making these non-benchmark positions top holdings by year-end. 
"Both stocks posted strong gains, benefiting from a rise in the 10-year Treasury yield in the second half of 2016 and prospects of higher net interest margins. But the real game changer was the election, which spurred hope that reduced government regulations and lower corporate tax rates would lead to higher returns and more capital going back to shareholders. Despite the sector's recent run, year-end prices on many financials, in my view, still seemed attractive relative to their earnings growth outlooks." 



Key Takeaways



The fund returned 4.57% for the year ended December 31, 2016, lagging the 7.08% return of the benchmark Russell 1000® Growth Index. 

Nearly all the underperformance came in the first half of 2016 when Portfolio Manager Dan Kelley's focus on "mispriced earnings growth" was out of favor. 

In the second half of 2016, Dan's strategy worked well, as some of the more economically sensitive stocks in the fund saw sizable rebounds. However, outperformance in the second half was not enough to offset the earlier underperformance.  

For the year, stock picks in the information technology and health care sectors hurt most, outweighing gains from selection in energy, financials and industrials. 

Dan expects more economically sensitive sectors to benefit from President Trump's plans to spur growth. In addition, market volatility will likely create more buying opportunities for "mispriced earnings growth."





MARKET RECAP


The S&P 500® index returned 11.96% in 2016, rising sharply on post-election optimism for economic growth. The year began during a fairly volatile stretch, with stocks hampered by persistent oil-price weakness and U.S.-dollar strength. Markets regained momentum in February amid U.S. job gains, a rally in energy and other stimuli that helped keep the roughly seven-year uptrend intact. Markets tumbled briefly following the U.K.'s June 23 vote to exit the European Union – dubbed "Brexit" – then recovered quickly and settled into a flattish stretch until the November 8 U.S. presidential election. Stocks reacted to the outcome by reaching a series of all-time highs. For the year, energy (+27%) led the way amid two strong rallies in commodity prices, one in the spring and another in November. Telecommunication services (+23%) was close behind, as demand for dividend-paying equities was high early in the period. Cyclical sectors, including financials (+22%), industrials (+18%) and materials (+17%), also posted strong gains. Conversely, consumer staples (+5%) and consumer discretionary (+6%) lagged the index, the latter hurt as online competition continued to pressure brick-and-mortar retailers. Real estate (+3%) struggled due to expectations for rising interest rates, while health care (-2%) was hampered by an uncertain political and regulatory outlook.

What Fidelity Trend Fund Likes About Apple, Amazon And Alphabet 






MARIE BEERENS
10/28/2016


 Reprints




Investors will find quite a few leading stocks in Fidelity Trend Fund (FTRNX), but it's taken more than just owning the likes of Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook for fund manager Dan Kelley to keep his fund apace or ahead of peers and the stock market.
Much of the fund's success can be traced to what goes on behind closed doors: depth of research, fund manager experience, investment philosophy and the timing of buys and sells.
And Kelley's views about several of his top holdings, appearing below, reveal a good deal about his plan of attack for beating the market.
The $1.6 billion large-cap growth fund was up 3.43% year to date, through Wednesday, well ahead of its peers' 1.7%, and a bit behind the S&P 500's 6.52%. But its long-term track record is also looking good: Average returns over the past three, five and 10 years amount to 9.05%, 13.88% and 8.54%, respectively. The S&P 500 turned in 9.0%, 13.91% and 6.68% for those periods.

IBD's TAKE: Stock holdings of top-performing mutual funds are a great place to look for investment ideas. But before buying any, you should thoroughly analyze them using such tools as IBD Stock Checkup.

Fidelity Trend is also an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Award-winner, having beaten the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31.
Kelley, the fund's manager since 2012 and with Fidelity since 2005, says Trend's main differentiating factor is it selects stocks with mispriced growth. "I don't really care as much about how fast the growth is, I care about what I'm paying for the rate of growth."
As a result, he likes "being paid twice, with both positive earnings revisions and a valuation re-rating if I'm right on those positive earnings revisions." Estimated P-Es of stocks are adjusted lower when expected earnings are revised upward. This improves the attractiveness of such stocks.
Kelley segments growth stocks into three buckets: quality, secular and opportunistic growers. Quality growth companies have proven management teams, stable earnings-growth profiles and strong balance sheets. Examples include Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) and Visa (V).
Secular growers "are companies where I get a little discomfort in the valuation on near-term numbers, but they have the ability to grow at a very high organic growth rate for quite some time, and usually for longer than the market expects." Salesforce.com (CRM) and Facebook (FB) fall in this category.
Asked for his view on top holding Apple (AAPL), which just reported fiscal Q4 earnings and its first decline in annual profit in 15 years, Kelley said he could only comment on the situation as of the fund's last filing, Aug. 31.
"In general, Apple needs to continue to innovate further on the smartphone for customer demand to remain high and earnings to grow," he said. "The smartphone has become the most important device in most people's lives as the average person checks in 100 times a day. Hence, Apple needs to continue to provide customers with the best user experience, leading operating performance, and exciting new features to drive growth."
On Amazon (AMZN), he said the company, as of the fund's latest filing, still looked cheap vs. its long-term growth potential. "What has changed from prior years, is the market has come to further appreciate the Amazon Web Services business and the long-term opportunity for that business, both from a revenue growth and earnings potential," he said. "In addition, with respect to the core retail business, more retailers have embraced Amazon as a powerful distribution platform, which has allowed the company to operate more as a marketplace and enhanced the company's margin profile."
The third bucket includes opportunistic growth companies such as Williams Cos. (WMB). "Those are companies that tend to trade at cheap valuations due to some concern — whether it be a cyclical company and the market gets worried about excess capacity, whether it be some sort of company-specific issue — and those names usually have the highest probability of being re-rated once we see some positive change," he explained.
In the case of American natural-gas producer Williams, Kelley says that once they didn't get acquired, they started to make some corporate governance moves — changing the board and reducing their risk profile — which led to a re-rating of their stock.
"Williams stock increased 28% in price from the end of July through Sept. 30," Kelley noted. "It was the second-biggest contributor to fund performance during 3Q16. Before owning WMB, the fund had a preference to hold WPZ (Williams Partners (WPZ), a Williams affiliate), which also benefited from some of the same de-risking and commitment to balance-sheet improvement that Williams did.
As a general rule, Kelley tries not to take huge sector bets. However, earlier in the year he did allocate about a 500 basis point overweight vs. the fund's Russell 1000 Growth index benchmark in the energy sector, which significantly contributed to the fund's performance.
As to the three buckets, he usually lets the market dictate where the most compelling value is. That said, the quality bucket has probably been the largest one over time, comprising about 60% of the fund.
Metal-packaging maker Ball (BLL) and water-pump and valve producer Xylem (XYL) both strongly contributed to last quarter's fund performance.
Xylem has pulled back 9% from its early October peak and has fallen below its 50-day moving average.
Kelley's take: "While I can't comment on specific market moves that have happened since our latest public holdings disclosure, I think it's important to note that I take a long-term perspective when making investments on behalf of fund shareholders and look to take advantage of possible short-term market dislocations."
Global food-and-ketchup manufacturer Kraft Heinz (KHC) is a company that may have low organic growth and a high multiple, but it has a management team that are great capital allocators, points out Kelley. "When they combined Kraft and Heinz, they took out a lot of cost. ... the management are really known to be really good operators of companies and they can go in and run them much leaner than they were run before. And so, what's happened historically, is that the synergies from these large-scale acquisitions had been much greater than initially expected."
