Sliding Control Cables | Aero Controlex




















Quick Contact +


















Request Information





Sliding Control Cables
Sliding control cables refer to all push/pull assemblies which utilize an internal core and external conduit. The core is typically made up of woven wire strands which operate within an enclosing conduit. The operating characteristics of these controls, efficiency, backlash, and minimum bend radii are determined by the materials of construction and size of the core and conduit.
Application
Sliding control cables have high load carrying capabilities and are more robust, but generally less efficient. They derive their name from the linear "sliding" motion of the core within the conduit.
Sliding controls can be used on virtually any application with a wide variety of configurations and sizes.
Typically, sliding controls are characterized by less stringent efficiency and backlash requirements. Light or heavy loads, highly configured, small in size, rigid conduits, field replaceable cores, flexible races and tension - loaded applications favor sliding controls.
