Effect of age on the distribution of oil in Eastern redcedar tree segments

            Dunford, N.T.; Hiziroglu, S.; Holcomb, R.
        

            Eastern redcedar is widespread in the US and produces significant amount of biomass. Open-grown trees invade abandoned fields and compete with valuable forage species in pastures and rangelands. Value-added product development from redcedar is vital for management of eastern redcedar. Cedarwood oil is a valuable component which can be used for further value-added product development. This study examined the effect of age on the distribution of oil in redcedar tree segments. Trunks of eastern redcedar ( Juniperus virginiana L.) trees at different stages of growth (26–63 years old) were divided into three sections (top, center and lower). Each section was fractionated separately into bark, heartwood and sapwood segments. Heartwood and sapwood samples from each tree section were analyzed for oil content and composition. A hydrodistillation method was used for oil extraction. Volatile components of tree segments were examined by using a Gas Chromatograph-headspace analysis technique. The heartwood of eastern redcedar contained significantly higher oil than sapwood. Older trees had more oil in the heartwood than younger trees. Both redcedar bark and leaves contained significantly lower oil content than the cedarwood. There were also significant differences in the oil composition of bark, leaves and wood fractions. Cedarwood oil extraction may benefit from prior separation of tree segments prior to oil extraction. However, the economic feasibility of separation prior to an extraction process needs to be further studied. Required extra capital investment and operating costs need to be examined, as well as whether sapwood is worth processing.

IntroductionEastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana L.) is one of themost widely distributed indigenous conifers in the easternUS. Low value and irregular growth patterns of easternredcedar make this species ineYcient as a raw material forlumber manufacture. Currently the wood from easternredcedar is used for fence posts and novelty items. It is esti-mated that there are more than seven million acres (2.8 mil-lion hectares) of redcedar in Oklahoma (Payne et al., 1999).Redcedar has many serious adverse environmental impactssuch as degrading grasslands, increasing wildWre hazardsand displacing native wildlife and plant populations. Value-added product development from readcedar is vital fordevelopment of environmentally and economically soundland management strategies.Oil obtained from wood of eastern redcedar (VirginianCedarwood oil or Red Cedarwood oil) has long been usedin a very broad range of products due to its unique proper-ties such as its odor, repellency or toxicity to many pests,and antibacterial, antifungal, and antitermitic activitiesଝPublished with approval of the Director, Oklahoma AgriculturalExperiment Station.*Corresponding author.
