Our content feeds use RSS (Really Simple Syndication) to enable you to subscribe to receive content from websites. If you have a reader on your computer you will not have to check individual websites for updates – the reader does it for you.
You can get a reader by downloading one to your computer. The simplest way is to sign up to a free web-based service such as Netvibes.

A filer must promptly update its 13D filing in case of acquisition or disposition of 1% or more of the securities that are the subject of the filing. These filings may be a precursor to hostile takeovers, company breakups, and other “change of control” events.

Item 4 of the Schedule 13D is hereby further amended to add the following at the end thereof:


On November 3, 2015 Letterone and its affiliates engaged in an internal reorganization, as a result of which, ATTL UK became the sole shareholder of ATTL Holdings.


Subject to various factors (including, without limitation, Turkcell's business and prospects, the performance of the Shares in the market, availability of funds, alternative uses of funds, and money, stock market and general economic and industry conditions, future developments at Turkcell and applicable law), the Reporting Persons may acquire or dispose of securities of Turkcell. Any purchases or dispositions of securities in Turkcell may be in the open market or privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise. The Reporting Persons may, from time to time, and reserve the right to, change their plans or intentions and to take any and all actions that they deem appropriate to maximize the value of their investment in Turkcell; there can be no assurance that the Reporting Persons will acquire or dispose of securities of Turkcell. In order to maximize the value of their investment in Turkcell, the Reporting Persons may, from time
to time, consider, evaluate or propose various possible transactions involving Turkcell or its subsidiaries or affiliates.
�

On March 13, 2015, Alfa Telecom Turkey served a notice on Cukurova Finance International (the �Deadlock Option Notice�) which required Cukurova Finance International to make an election either to buy or sell 51 Group B shares in Cukurova Telecom Holdings by April 12, 2015. Cukurova Finance International did not make any election under the Deadlock Option Notice. Pursuant to the Shareholders� Agreement and Regulation 16.5 of the Articles of Association of Cukurova Telecom Holdings, Cukurova Finance International has been deemed to have elected to sell the entirety of its 51 Group B shares in Cukurova Telecom Holdings (the �Option Shares�), which shares represent 51% interest in Cukurova Telecom Holdings and correspond to an indirect shareholding of approximately 13.76% in Turkcell, on the terms contained in the Deadlock
Option Notice. Cukurova Finance International contests the validity of the Deadlock Option Notice.
�
On October 8, 2015, Alfa Telecom Turkey executed a deed of conditional transfer (the �Deeds of Conditional Transfer�) separately with each of three Dutch foundations � Strategic Technology Stichting, Telecom and Technology Stichting and Operational Technology Stichting (each a �Stichting�). Under each Deed of Conditional Transfer, Alfa Telecom Turkey agreed that immediately and conditionally upon receiving from Cukurova Finance International a share transfer form or forms in respect of the Option Shares, it will cause to be transferred 17 Option Shares to each Stichting in return for an equivalent number of depository receipts, thereby neither acquiring title to the Option Shares nor having the ability to exercise control over them. The foregoing summary of the Deeds of Conditional Transfer is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Deeds
of Conditional Transfer, which are attached as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2 and 99.3 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.�
�
As a result of the ongoing arbitration proceedings, the Reporting Persons are unable to determine at this time when completion of the sale of the Option Shares pursuant to the Deadlock Option Notice and their subsequent transfer pursuant to the Deeds of Conditional Transfer will occur.
�
The Reporting Persons believe that, following transfer of the Option Shares to the Stichtings, the Reporting Persons will no longer control Cukurova Telecom Holdings and therefore will no longer beneficially own any shares in Turkcell.


�
Except as described in this Item 4, none of the Reporting Persons has formulated any plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any matter required to be disclosed in response to paragraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.
�


� 


� 





� 


�
�
Item 5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer.


Item 5(b) of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended to read in its entirety as follows:


(b) Cukurova Telecom Holdings may be deemed to have the sole power to vote or direct the vote, and sole power to dispose or direct the disposition of, the 1,122,000,000.238 Shares held by Turkcell Holding, representing 51.0% of the total number of Shares outstanding, by virtue of Cukurova Telecom Holdings� 52.91% interest in Turkcell Holding. Further, Alfa Telecom Turkey may be deemed to have shared power to vote or direct the vote, and shared power to dispose or direct the disposition of, the 1,122,000,000.238 Shares held by Turkcell Holding, representing 51.0% of the total number of Shares outstanding. Alfa Telecom Turkey shares such power to vote or direct the vote, and to dispose of or direct the disposition of, the Shares held for the account of Turkcell Holding with Cukurova Finance International by virtue of Alfa Telecom Turkey�s and Cukurova Finance International�s joint ownership of Cukurova Telecom Holdings (in which
Alfa Telecom Turkey holds a 49% ownership interest and Cukurova Finance International holds the remaining 51% interest) and the provisions of the Shareholders Agreement.


Each of ATTL Limited, ATTL Holdings, ATTL UK, LIHS and Letterone may be deemed to have sole power to direct the voting and disposition of��the 1,122,000,000.238 Shares held by Turkcell Holding by virtue of their direct and indirect ownership of Alfa Telecom Turkey.
�

Item 6. Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships With Respect to Securities of the Issuer.
�
Item 6 of the Schedule 13D is hereby further amended to incorporate the description of the Deadlock Option Notice and the Deeds of Conditional Transfer set forth in Item 4 above.
�
Item 7. Material to be Filed as Exhibits.

The information in Item 7 is hereby amended and supplemented as follows:

The 986,572,563 shares of Common Stock held for the account of L1T represent approximately 47.85% of VimpelCom's voting capital, i.e. adding VimpelCom�s outstanding convertible voting preferred stock to the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock.��To the best of the Reporting Persons� knowledge, none of the persons listed in Annex A holds any shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock (other than as described in this Item 5).��Neither the filing of this Amendment nor any of its contents will be deemed to constitute an admission that any of the Reporting Persons is the beneficial owner of any shares of VimpelCom (other than as described in this Item 5(a)) for the purposes of Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or for any other purposes, and such beneficial ownership is expressly disclaimed.


The above calculated percentages are based on 1,756,731,135 shares of Common Stock and 305,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock outstanding as of December 31, 2014 as reported in the Company�s Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 24, 2015.
