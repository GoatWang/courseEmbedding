This drew me to Linux, since I was already teaching myself DOS at the time, and my curiosity got me to pick up basic HTML, JavaScript, and Perl. Since then, I have expanded on Linux, done a lot with shell scripting (BASH, primarily), dabbled in Python when time permits, and have also taken some Java classes.Most recently, from 2012 to present day, I have enjoyed diving into OpenStack - and its many projects. I especially like how so many things can work together to serve so many purposes. I have been involved with OpenStack since its Diablo release and am always looking forward to the great advances, features, and bug fixes that each new release brings.RecommendationsA preview of what LinkedIn members have to say about Steven:Steven has a reputation for providing thorough and well thought out technical solutions.
