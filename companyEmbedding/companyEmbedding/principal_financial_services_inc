                        plan or investment advice from Principal® but may be used as general guidelines
                        to help you make retirement planning or other personal financial decisions. Responsibility for these
                        decisions is assumed by you, not Principal. Individual results will vary.
                        You should regularly review your savings progress and post-retirement needs.            



              All projections, analysis and calculation results are estimates and depend on many factors,

Your Retirement Wellness Score



                Your Retirement Wellness Score indicates the percentage of your pre-retirement income that is estimated to be
                              available at the specified retirement age (based on your personalized inputs and current assumptions). Studies
                              suggest replacing at least 70-85% of your income in retirement.                *
              

                The score compares what you are estimated to have in monthly income at retirement against your estimated monthly
                                pre-retirement income. For example, based on your inputs you may have $1,000 per month when you retire, but your
                                monthly pre-retirement income is $2,000. Your Retirement Wellness Score would be 50.              

                This score, and what you will have, are merely estimates based on information provided by you and several
                              financial assumptions, including a 4.5% withdrawal rate. This information may be valued as of different dates.
                              This is not a guarantee of future income.              

                Your Retirement Wellness Score always assumes you are replacing 100% of your pre-retirement income.
                              So, it will not change if you make changes that impact your desired income in retirement.

Save for retirement an easy way.

Does your employer offer a 401(k) or 403(b) plan? These common retirement savings plans can help make the process of saving for retirement easy.What does a 403(b) or 401(k) plan offer?These plans can help you build your retirement savings with:Automatic payroll deductions to help you make saving a habitReduced taxable income, since your pre-tax contributions lower your taxable incomeMatched contributions from some employers, up to a certain percent (check with your benefits administrator)Long-term savings and growth potential across a variety of the plan’s investment optionsDoes your employer offer a 401(k) or 403(b) plan with services through Principal®? Enroll online now 

 
A little today may be a lot tomorrow.

If you’re already enrolled in a 401(k) or 403(b) plan with services by Principal, you might consider increasing the amount you contribute from each paycheck. Even a few extra dollars per paycheck may add up significantly over time—and it only takes a few minutes.Log in to increase your contributions. 

 
Looking for a 401(k) or 403(b) plan loan?

When bills or debt feel overwhelming, it can be tempting to consider borrowing against your account in a 403(b) or a 401(k) plan. But the trade-offs can be steep—and we want to make sure you understand them.In the long run, you may pay more than the loan amount you withdraw, including:Any initial set-up and quarterly loan fees;Taxes you pay on the money you use to repay your loan; andLoan interest rates over timeOn top of that, you may miss out on potential growth and compounding of your earnings, which can be a major advantage of long-term savings in an account under 401(k) and 403(b) plans.To give you an idea, $20,000 in a 401(k) or 403(b) account could triple in 20 years at an average 7% rate of return —but not if you withdraw it today. Log in to learn more about retirement loans, and talk to your financial professional before you make a decision.

Life Insurance 

Coverage not just for your life, but for your life’s purposeLife insurance protects those who depend on your life, so there’s no sudden monetary shortage in the event of your death. A life insurance policy can help your family recover from loss and continue to:Pay for your final expensesPay off a mortgagePay for childcare and education costsCover outstanding debtsComplete a retirement planAccess estate liquidityProvide lifetime incomeIf someone besides you depends on your income, life insurance can help provide for your loved ones at a time when they may need it the most. 

Two types of life insurance for evolving needsPrincipal® offers a range of life insurance products to fit your current and future needs. For a mix of short- and long-term needs, you may even elect both types. 


Term Life InsuranceGives you budget-based coverage for a specific period of time. 

Permanent Life InsuranceOffers long-term coverage for long-term benefits. 


Already have life insurance through work?That’s a great start, but group life insurance provides a base level of protection and isn’t designed to meet 100% of your life insurance needs.Plus, if you switch jobs, your coverage could change, leaving you vulnerable to losing accumulated benefits in your job transition.Ask your company’s benefits administrator about your group policy, and talk to your advisor about how to supplement your policy for minimal cost.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.
