Supplies



What do I need for orchestra class?FMS Orchestra Supplies I know it can be so confusing (and expensive!) to try to find supplies for stringed instruments--especially if you are like most people and don't know anything about these instruments.   I have assembled some information below and have included some links to where you may order these at a discount over the prices in our local music stores.  Please read size information correctly (especially as it pertains to shoulder rests).  If you have a question about the size of your child's instrument, please feel free to contact me--I will be happy to help you!  You can also look inside the instrument through one of the holes on the front shaped like the letter "f."  You will see the ID tag with the maker's name, the date and often times a size indication inside.  Again, if you have any questions about anything supply-related, please let me know and I will be happy to help you!  Instruments:  First of all, let me say just a few brief words about buying instruments.  One of the scariest days of my teaching career came about when I saw violins for sale on one of the end caps in Target!  I know that we all want to find bargains, but I would just like to say that where musical instruments are concerned, you REALLY get what you pay for.  I have seen so many well-meaning people lose so much money on "cheap" instruments they find on ebay or at department stores.  We call these "VSOs"--Violin Shaped Objects. These instruments are seldom constructed well and set the student up for failure with an instrument that just doesn't hold up well to even the most careful use.  Click HERE to read further about how to avoid the dreaded VSO.  As my grandma always told me, "if it looks too good to be true, it probably is."  Some great student model instruments that are tried and true are: Glaesel, Scherl and Roth, and Knilling.  You can find these for sale in the paper and in local music shops in the area.  You can find really great deals on used instruments as well!  I am always happy to help you with your decision before you ever spend any money.  ***Please understand that while colored instruments and bows are great for flashy solo performances, they are not permitted for use in our school orchestra.*** Please contact me when you are ready to make an instrument purchase and I will be glad to help steer you in the right direction! Books:     ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS 2000  This year we will be using the Essential Elements 2000 books.  6th grade will need Book 1 (orange trim), 7th grade Book 2 (purple trim) and 8th grade students will need Book 3 (green trim). It is actually more cost effective to get a book from one of our local music stores as they do not charge shipping. There are plenty of books waiting at Musician Supply, Palmetto Strings, or Star Music.  Please be sure to double check that you have the correct book for the instrument your child plays!  The name of the instrument appears on the upper right hand corner of cover of the book.  Rosin:   Rosin is used on the bows to help them make sound.  It usually comes in a small square or rectangular box and is VERY fragile.  Chances are all students would appreciate a nice new cake of rosin!  It is pretty inexpensive (less than $5.00) and can best be purchased in a local music store.  A little more expensive, but really fun is "Rockin Rosin." This rosin is made in specialty shapes that the kids love, but costs a little more--around $12 each.  It might be nice for a gift or special occasion!  Instrument polish:    Stringed instruments require a special kind of polish for the wood and varnish.  Instruments should be polished about once a month to keep them looking nice. Please don't be tempted to use furniture polish on a stringed instrument!  You can purchase instrument polish in the local stores as well and should be under $5.00.Shoulder rest:   Shoulder rests are a MUST for violin and viola players, especially as we work on advanced concepts this year that require perfect posture.  I recommend the Kun shoulder pad (pictured above) as it is built well and holds up well to the abuse of a sixth grader!  You can often find these much cheaper online.  Here is a link for you.  Please be careful to enter the correct instrument size in the drop down menu on the page.  http://www.swstrings.com/product/accessories/viola/GP-187C1/2, 3/4 and 4/4 (full sized) violins ***13 and 14 inch violas use 4/4 violin shoulder rests***15 inch and larger violas will use a special viola shoulder rest, also available in the drop down menu on the above page.  **Extra hint:  Shoulder rests do not fit in most instrument cases.  It is good to have a shoulder rest case that clips to the exterior of the instrument case to hold the shoulder rest, since bookbags  may be detrimental to a shoulder rest.  Many of my students used pencil pouches or you can find one in several different colors in the local music stores for about $10.00.  Here is also a link to one that is a little less expensive online:  http://www.swstrings.com/product/accessories/viola/GP-EZPTuner:    The students will be learning how to tune their instruments this year in orchestra class!  We will be using the Korg tuners similar to the one in the picture above.  I know that many students have smart phones and tablets that will have apps that can do a fine job of tuning instruments.  Most of these tuner apps are even free! However, if you would like to purchase one of the Korg tuners, here is a link to the tuner on Amazon:  http://www.amazon.com/Korg-CA1-Chromatic-Tuner/dp/B002PMHAVS/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1375989899&sr=8-2&keywords=korg+tunerMetronome:    Metronomes are used a great deal in music to practice to a steady beat.  We frequently use a metronome in class, and I encourage the students to practice at home with a metronome as well.  There is a free one for use online that can be found at http://www.metronomeonline.com/  If you would like to purchase an inexpensive one online, here is a good link for you: http://www.amazon.com/Wittner-MT50-Quartz-Metronome/dp/B0002E2YMG/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1375991546&sr=8-4&keywords=metronome  Music stand:   Music stands are a must for good practice at home.  They promote good posture while practicing and will be used in concerts for years to come.  This is a staple that all music students should have!  I am providing a link to a very inexpensive model, but there are MANY varieties, depending on how much money you wish to spend.  Here is my recommendation: http://www.swstrings.com/product/accessories/all/GP-KB900Extra strings:   Having an extra set of strings available is SUCH a convenience!  If a string breaks in class and a student has an extra on hand, I can replace the string in about a minute and the student loses no class time.  Much money can be saved by purchasing a set online as opposed to running out to the local music store and buying one emergency string at a time!  It's like having a spare tire when you need it.  I recommend the D'Addario Prelude Strings for this age--they are strong strings, priced fairly, and hold up well.  Here are some links by instrument (check sizes carefully!).  We use ball end strings--no loop end.  You can buy individual strings, but you save money on the sets--they are sold at the bottom of the drop down list that appears on the web page:Violin:  http://www.swstrings.com/product/strings/violin/GP-J810SViola: http://www.swstrings.com/product/strings/viola/GP-J910SCello:  http://www.swstrings.com/product/strings/cello/GP-J1010SBass:  http://www.swstrings.com/product/strings/bass/GP-J610S

Dual Sport Helmets
The best of both worlds
When it comes to power sports enthusiasts – some love the mud and grime of off-road adventures, some love the speed of the pavement, and some love to mix it up and ride wherever their journey takes them. When you look at traditional off road and street motorcycle gear – it’s never more apparent than within the helmet category. They look completely different because they address the different needs associated with each riding style. Fulmer dual sport helmets combine the best features of both helmet designs into a single package that can be effectively used in off-road and on-road riding.

Our power sport helmet heritage dates back to 1969. Simply put - we know helmets. The cornerstone of our legacy is providing customers feature-filled helmets at a great value. This continues today. That being said, we have to be ever evolving in providing riders with the most up-to-date helmet safety technology available, without breaking their budgets. We are driven to provide customers with state-of-the-art helmet technologies, featuring amazing graphics and style details so you can enjoy your chosen mode of adventure in the best and safest way possible.
