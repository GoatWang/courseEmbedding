It hasn't taken long for real estate crowdfunding pioneer Fundrise to take advantage of the latest SEC rule changes in order to offer a $50 million e-REIT fund.
Founded in 2012, Fundrise was the first company to crowdfund investment for U.S. real estate online, raising $325,000 for Maketto in Washington D.C.
Fast-forward four years later, Rise Companies Corp. announces the first crowdsourced REIT fund investment, for the maximum $50 million allowed under SEC Rule A+.
Individual investors will be able to invest minimum of $1,000, or 100 shares at $10.00 -- up to 10% of annual income, per the A+ rules.
If you haven't been following the fast-moving world of Internet-based real estate crowdfunding, it may be time to start paying attention.
The training wheels have been removed, and now online real estate equity fundraising is about to put on a pair of "big-boy pants."

Source - Fundrise SEC filing Nov. 18, 2015
Crowdfunded real estate in the U.S. has been almost exclusively offered on a project by project basis to accredited investors because of how the rules have evolved since the passage of the Jobs Act in 2012.

Crowdfunded real estate investments can have projected returns of 5% to 20% or higher. Typical projected holding periods can be from 9 months to over 5 years, but they generally range from 12 to 36 months.
One issue holding back some accredited investors was the inherent difficulty of creating a diversified portfolio within the real estate crowdfunded portion of their portfolio.
Minimum investment amounts typically have been $5,000 to $10,000 which makes creating a diversified portfolio of crowdfunded investments difficult for investors with less than $50,000 to $100,000 to allocate to just crowdfunded real estate.

Source: FINRA.org
In attempt to help with diversification, Fundrise has recently offered a few portfolio investments for accredited investors, allowing them to invest in more than one project.
The Big News
The $50 million Fundrise e-REIT will be structured as a blind pool which will investment in a diversified portfolio of both debt and equity real estate investments, which are more fully described in the Preliminary Offering Circular Form 1-A filed with the SEC.
This gives investors looking for higher yields the option of investing $1,000 in a diverse pool of professionally managed assets may appear to be a far more appealing option.
This certainly will attract interest from existing accredited customers, as well as help to attract new investors to the Fundrise platform who now can qualify under the Regulation A+ rules.
According to the release:
The $50,000,000 Fundrise Real Estate Investment Trust intends to invest in a diverse portfolio of U.S. commercial real estate properties, such as apartments, shopping centers, and office buildings, that generate cash flow paid out to investors in regular dividends.

The Fundrise e-REIT sponsor has facilitated or originated 56 real estate programs previously on its platform, with an aggregate purchase price of $3 billion as of August 31, 2015.
Of the $3.0 billion aggregate real estate purchase prices, our sponsor offered through its Programs approximately $58.3 million, consisting of approximately $15.0 million of commercial real estate loan assets, $39.8 million of investments in commercial real estate (through majority-owned subsidiaries with rights to receive preferred economic returns), and $3.5 million of other commercial real estate investments.
Notably, the $3 billion value includes a $5,000,000 financing participation for 3 World Trade Center in Manhattan, which skews the aggregate number higher.
Real Estate Crowdfunding - Background
The rate of growth for the largest and most successful real estate crowdfunding platforms has been exponential during the past two years.
In some ways real estate crowdfunding is like the "Wild West" with new platforms popping up each month. Many crowdfunding sites have a similar look and feel, and it can be daunting to try and sort out the serious players from the potential fly-by-night outfits.
Based upon my research, the one characteristic the top platforms all have in common is the ability to pre-fund and close on a real estate investment before turning around and offering it to the public.
Platforms which pre-fund have all been evaluated by financial institutions, private equity and/or venture capital firms and have typically received $25 million or more in funding.
These investors are often attracted to the scalable nature of these online investing platforms. Fundrise investors include Renren, Inc. (NASDAQ: RENN), as well as well-known private real estate firms.
Three distinct examples of successful real estate crowdfunding platforms are:


Prodigy Network (equity - large NYC residential and mixed use);

Patch of Land (senior debt - residential value-add); and

Fundrise (preferred equity - existing and new commercial).


Each of these platforms offer an assortment of debt and equity investments, but I chose to emphasize the predominant asset class which differentiates them.
I have interviewed CEOs from all three platforms during the past year, and written a brief overview of each platform, which can be found here, here and here.
Will Crowdsourcing Disrupt Other Models?
One asset class that might be at risk over time from crowdsourced REIT investment alternatives would be the non-traded REITs which are typically sold by investment advisors.
The non-traded REIT space has recently attracted quite a bit of scrutiny and negative press. Bad behavior by some players, including high front-loaded fees, has come home to roost. These fees typically ranged from 10%-15%, and were not always fully disclosed by advisors.
Regulatory agencies including the Department of Labor and the SEC have stepped in, and new rules are being put into place including FINRA RN 15-02 for 2016.

Source: CNLSecurities.com
Here is a link to an SEC Investor Bulletin from Aug. 31, 2015 which includes this bold print warning for investors:
These fees can represent up to 15 percent of the offering price, which lowers the value and return of your investment and leaves less money for the REIT to invest.
Many accredited investors have been sold these non-traded REIT "products" by financial advisors in the past, only to discover that it is difficult to create "Alpha" when only 85%-90% of the investment is actually used to buy real estate.
There are also high quality non-traded REIT alternatives such as W.P. Carey Inc. (NYSE: WPC) with a 42 year history of delivering 10% or better returns for loyal fund investors. There have been 15 WPC funds that have gone full-cycle, and no long-term investor has ever lost money.

Since U.S. crowdfunded real estate is a new asset class, industry pioneers can only have a four year track record. This severely limits the number of projects which have come "full-cycle," with a return of capital, and the ability to calculate an IRR or ROIC.
More Net-Proceeds To Invest
Underwriting costs and discounts associated with a typical IPO distributed by Wall Street investment banks can eat up 7% or more of an offering.
By utilizing the Fundrise online platform to distribute the 5,000,000 authorized shares, the organizational fees described in the Form 1-A offering appear to be ~ 2.4%. There were zero fees included for Underwriting Discounts and Commissions.
Notably, organizational and offering costs estimated to be ~$500,000 will also be reimbursed to the fund Manager over time.
Investors will not pay upfront selling commissions in connection with the purchase of our common shares. We will reimburse our Manager for organization and offering costs, which are expected to be approximately $500,000. Reimbursement payments will be made in monthly installments, but the aggregate monthly amount reimbursed can never exceed 0.50% of the aggregate gross offering proceeds from this offering.
The Fundrise REIT Entity Organizational Chart below is difficult to read, which is unfortunate, but was taken directly from the Nov. 18, 2015 SEC filing.

Source - Fundrise SEC filing Nov. 18, 2015
There is no such thing as a free lunch. There will be fee payments to Sponsor affiliates for ongoing services performed which include a 1% annual fee and a 0% to 0.05% affiliate management fee.
As usual, interested investors should do their own due diligence to understand these and other fees which are charged depending upon the circumstances. (For instance there is a fee that can be charged to deal with non-performing assets, and fees to compensate for underwriting costs).

Putting The Crowd Back Into Funding
Recently there has been a trend in real estate crowdfunding platforms to turn to institutions for a large percentage of an individual project funding. The 9% to 15% returns projected for a typical crowdfunded deal are attracting institutions with access to low cost funds. Retail investors may not realize that they are often investing side by side with institutions.
If you think about it, these crowdfunding firms have built underwriting and distribution platforms to handle a high volume of transactions. Once a platform has been vetted, it can be more efficient for an institution to utilize a crowdfunding site to originate deals. The platform gains more visibility regarding its fund raising, and therefore is able to grow at a faster rate.
Fundrise co-founder Dan Miller discussed this growing trend of "Crowdfunding Without The Crowd" in a July 2015 interview with therealdeal.com. The Fundrise e-REIT initiative clearly helps to combat this trend. It also represents a huge leap forward for the original vision for Fundrise,"â¦a goal to democratize commercial real estate investment," which Ben Miller shared with me last summer.
My understanding is that Fundrise would be able to offer a $50 million e-REIT every 12 months under the current rules.
Investor Takeaway
Like any other investment, the Fundrise REIT contains risks. As you would expect, there are plenty of them discussed in the Preliminary Offering document. The document follows the S-11 disclosure format so it is similar in many respects to what you would expect to find in any IPO prospectus.
Initially the Fundrise REIT shares are valued at $10.00 apiece. After July 2016, The REIT NAV will be calculated at the end of each quarter and will be used to value the shares. The REIT intends to pay quarterly distributions, the major attraction, but of course there are no guarantees.
There is a modicum of liquidity on a quarterly basis which is discussed in the Offering. This is another plus for the Fundrise REIT vs most crowdfunding options. However, this REIT is essentially an illiquid investment, and only suitable for investors who don't need the funds to pay the rent, buy groceries or cover next semester's tuition.

Many Seeking Alpha readers are aware that I regularly write about publicly traded REITs and similar publicly traded investments. They have the advantage of liquidity, more stringent reporting requirements, and in most cases a longer track record for investors to evaluate.
A simple method for investors to include real estate as an alternative investment for their portfolio would be to invest in REIT funds or ETFs. The Vanguard REIT Index ETF (NYSEARCA: VNQ), currently pays a distribution yielding just under 4%. Here is a link to an article which I wrote about REIT ETFs and portfolio diversification for investors who aren't familiar with this asset class.
Meanwhile, investors with a longer time horizon, looking for higher yield will soon have the Fundrise REIT to consider.
Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in WPC, VNQ over the next 72 hours.

                Is Fundrise's New eREIT Right for You?            


    By Warren Cassell | December 31, 2015 â 2:16 PM EST    






Share















































Real estate is one of the best performing alternative asset classes for investors who would like to diversify their portfolio or simply do not enjoy the volatile nature of the stock market. Contrary to popular belief, one does not need to be extremely wealthy to have interests in property. In the past, investing in real estate, especially large commercial properties, was something that was only reserved for high net worth individuals (HNWI) however the rise of online real estate crowdfunding platforms and publicly traded real estate investment trusts (REITs) have made it a lot easier for the average investor to get access to real estate investments.
Fundrise, for example, is one of the many online crowdfunding marketplaces out there that have pooled relatively small sums of money from everyday people and used those funds to assist property developers to finance their projects. To date, developers on the website have raised more than $10 million. Founded in 2012 by two brothers named Benjamin and Dan Miller, Fundrise recently made headlines when it announced the launch of the world's first online REIT, or as they call it "eREIT."
Earlier this month, Fundrise began processing subscriptions for their $50 million initial public offering (IPO), but they were quickly forced to temporarily discontinue selling shares of the eREIT due to high demand. On the first day of the offering, Fundrise received an average of $21,400 in subscription requests every minute. Investors were required to purchase a minimum of 100 shares at a rate of $10 per share. Although the Fundrise eREIT looks like it will be a very promising investment, it certainly is not for everyone. Here are three important things to ask yourself when determining whether or not an equity stake in Fundrise's eREIT would make sense in your investment portfolio.
Do You Mind Investing in an Illiquid Asset?
One of the main differences between Fundrise's eREIT and traditional REITs is the level of liquidity. Traditional REITs are traded on a stock exchange and are given a mark to market (MTM) valuation every minute of a trading day. This gives investors the ability to sell a portion, or all, of their REITs within a couple of minutes if needed. The Fundrise eREIT is not listed on an exchange, and as a result, units can only be redeemed at the end of each quarter. This can help to force an investor to take a long-term horizon, but it can also be a problem if an investor needs immediate access to cash for an emergency. (See also, Fundrise CEO Ben Miller On 'Why Pre-Funding Matters.)
Do You Need the Income?
Federal law requires that all REITs distribute no less than 90% of their annual income to their unit holders. Fundriseâs eREIT is not excluded from this requirement. As a result, the company intends to make a "high yield cash distribution" at the end of every quarter. This can be great for those investors who are looking to create an additional revenue stream. However, the eREIT might not be ideal for investors who do not immediately need investment income.
It is important to remember that unlike corporate dividends, that are taxed at a low rate, REIT distributions are taxed at the normal income tax rate. This is why REITs are often called tax-inefficient investments. Investors who own REITs tend to hold them in retirement accounts that have favorable tax treatments, like a Roth IRA, but it is not possible to do this with the Fundrise eREIT.
In some cases, an investor may end up realizing higher net returns, and a lower tax bill, by investing in a stock that reinvests the majority of earnings instead of distributing it to shareholders.
How Risk Tolerant Are You?
Fundriseâs eREIT is probably not suitable for your investment portfolio if you consider your tolerance for risk to be low or fairly moderate. As a new investment fund, the eREIT has no previous operating history to look at in order to determine how good the management team is. This also makes it hard to make calculated predictions on how well the eREIT will perform in the future.
When compared to the management teams of publicly traded REITs, the management of Fundriseâs eREIT lacks many years of experience. In the companyâs offering circular that was filed with the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC), it was disclosed that the eREIT's initial management team consists of four members, the oldest of whom is only 39-years-old. Furthermore, the eREIT had no non-executive board members at the time of writing.
Depending on your age and overall goals, an investment in the eREIT might be worth the speculation. On the other hand, other investors might not feel comfortable with the risk associated with the startup nature of the eREIT. Publicly traded REITs might be a much more suitable alternative for conservative investors like retirees, who want a reliable flow of income while protecting their principal. (See also, 3 Ways Millennials Can Invest in Rental Properties.)
The Bottom Line
REITs and property crowdfunding platforms have made it extremely easy for the average investor to include real estate investments in his or her portfolio. Just this month, Fundrise, a crowdfunding website, launched the worldâs first Internet REIT. Like traditional REITs, Fundriseâs eREIT will give its unitholders the opportunity to benefit from income-producing property. While eREits are similar to traditional REITs in that respect, there are a number of differences between the two. For instance, shares in Fundriseâs eREIT can only be redeemed at the end of each quarter, and as such may not be a suitable investment for many retail investors. Additionally, the eREIT might be tax-inefficient for young investors who could benefit much more by realizing capital gains rather than investment income. Conservatives investors should also note that Fundrise is a new player in the REIT business, and as such may be riskier than other REITs because of its unproven track record.

The Income eREIT focuses primarily on making debt investments in commercial real estate assets that generate steady cash flow. To date, the Income eREIT has executed on this strategy by identifying institutional quality assets of sub-institutional size, particularly in urban metro markets.The Income eREIT has followed three core principles in selecting potential assets:* Small Assets: We believe targeting assets that fall under the radar of big banks and investment funds allows us to achieve higher relative returns.* Regulatory Inefficiencies: Increased banking regulations as a result of the 2008 financial crisis have opened up new opportunities for more flexible lenders to expand into the market.* Urban Infill Location: Generally real estate assets located in the core of large cities benefit from higher demand, and higher pricing, due to the relative lack of supply.For more information on the Income eREIT's strategy and operations, please see our in-depth Performance Analysis Report.Â

Strategy


The Growth eREIT focuses on acquiring and owning commercial real estate assets that have the potential to appreciate in value over time. This opportunistic investment strategy is centered primarily on multi-family assets of institutional quality that are sub-institutional in size.The Growth eREIT has followed three core principles in selecting potential assets:* Workforce Housing: There is a growing need for affordably-priced apartments, referred to as âworkforce housingâ. However, there is a limited supply of existing apartments that meet that demand. The result is that affordably priced apartments face little competition from newly built apartments. We believe this growing demand and lack of supply will result in existing âworkforce housingâ increasing in value over time.* Low Cost Basis: The Growth eREIT seeks to acquire properties below their replacement cost, a strategy known as âvalue investingâ. In other words, the price paid to acquire a property is less than what it would cost someone else to build a similar property in the same location today.Â * Long-Term Fixed Financing: Interest rates on loans for acquiring apartment buildings are at historic lows. By securing long-term, fixed rate debt today, the Growth eREIT is able to maximize consistent cash-flow while also reducing volatility over the term of the investment.For more information on the Growth eREIT's strategy and operations, please see our in-depth Performance Analysis Report.

Fundrise To Offer Novel Product For Real Estate InvestorsGet MoreFor Your Moneyâ¢  CREDIT CARDS  TRAVEL ROUND THE WORLD Fundrise To Offer Novel Product For Real Estate InvestorsFundrise, the crowdfunding platform for commercial real estate investors, last week filed plans with the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch an offering under Regulation A+ for a real estate investment trust (REIT). Regulation A+, a modification of an earlier rule, results from Title IV of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act of 2012. It allows non-accredited investors to purchase certain securities that previously were available only to accredited investors. The filing, a preliminary offering circular, seeks permission to launch a $50 million IPO for the Fundrise Real Estate Investment Trust, LLC. The REIT shares will be available for sale only on Fundrise's website, not through brokers or exchanges. By eliminating broker fees and distributing shares online, Fundrise will reduce the offering's costs, and the savings of 70 to 90 percent of upfront expenses will be passed down to investors, according to the filing. By invoking Regulation A+, Fundrise avoids having to register the REIT shares with the SEC and allows non-accredited investors access to the REIT shares. An accredited investor has either $1 million in net wealth (excluding a primary residence) or income of at least $200,000 ($300,000 for joint tax filers) in each of the previous two years. Regulation A+ provides a safe harbor for companies to raise up to $50 million through the public issuance of non-registered securities. Up to now, real estate crowdfunding platforms could market to the general public but could only sell securities to accredited investors. Regulation A+, which went live in May 2015, stems from Title IV of the JOBS Act and should not be confused with Title III equity crowdfunding rules, now in final review and slated to become operational in the second quarter of 2016.Non-accredited investors will be able to invest in the Fundrise REIT to the extent of 10 percent of their net worth or annual income, whichever is greater. Fundrise will price the REIT shares at $1,000 each, meaning that folks with net worth or annual income as low as $10,000 will be able to invest. REITS are basically mutual funds for real estate properties. When you buy REIT shares, you own a proportional amount of the underlying portfolio of real estate investments controlled by the REIT manager. REITs are a way for investors to achieve instant diversification within the real estate sector. REIT investors are completely passive, in that they have no managerial responsibilities related to the portfolio properties. In its filing, Fundrise explicitly points out a number of risks to investors, including:Requiring investors to hold their shares for up to three months, as share redemption will be available on a quarterly basis.The REIT shares may turn out not be safe and viable.The disclosures required of a Regulation A+ REIT are substantially less than those of registered, listed REITs. Simply put, investors will have less information with which to make decisions.Fundrise has no experience as a REIT operator.There is no secondary market to sell the REIT shares, and Fundrise has no plans to list the shares on a trading exchange.Eric Bankupdated  Nov 24, 2015TweetEric Bank is a contributing writer at GET.com.

Review of Fundriseâs eREIT vs Traditional REIT


Published by Salvador Briggman. Find him on Twitter.











 




 




 




Iâve been talking a lot about Real Estate Crowdfunding in the last year. Iâve even gone so far as to write an Amazon ebook on the topic.
The reason that I want to put RECF on everyoneâs radar, along with Fundriseâs new Income and Growth eREIT, is because I believe that technology is fundamentally changing a historically archaic industry.
Whenever an industry is being disruptedÂ by a tech startup, my ears perk up. You can smell opportunity in the air. I love it.
However, just because these new investment options exist, doesnât mean that they are right for you.
Thatâs why I want to delve in-depth into some of the differences between an eREIT and a traditional REIT, along with whether or not you should add a Fundrise eREIT to your real estate investment portfolio.
A Traditional REIT
REITs, or real estate investment trusts, came about in the 1960s to give investors a way to invest in real estate the way they invest in stocks. Basically, the REIT owns income-producing real estate and you, as the investor, own shares of the REIT. These shares pay out dividends and naturallyÂ have market value.
As of 2014, âThe global index included 456 stock exchange listed real estate companies from 37 countries representing an equity market capitalization of about $2 trillion (with approximately 78% of that total from REITs).â
The majority of REITs out there are publicly traded on the stock market, giving them a high degree of liquidity. If you want to get out of an investment, you just have to sell your shares.
When youâre investing, there are two types of REITs to choose from, Equity REITs and Mortgage REITs.
As youâd guess, Equity REITs focus on delivering dividends to their investors from income-producing properties. The mangers of these properties will be collecting rents from residential and commercial real estate. Youâll also benefit from their efforts spent buying and selling assets that are a part of the portfolio.
On the other hand, Mortgage REITs invest in real estate mortgages and mortgaged-backed securities. Think of these as simple debt or fixed-income investments. Youâll be collecting dividends when the mortgages pay out interest or when the portfolio managers sell off mortgages. Mortgage REITs are also publicly traded.
If youâd like to learn more about REITs, Iâd recommend checking out this simple guide which provides a good overview of the investment class.
The biggest takeaway from traditional REITs is that theyâre:

Liquid
Publicly traded
Bought through a broker

Fundriseâs eREIT

Fundrise announced the launch of their eREIT at the end of 2015 and itâs been growing like wildfire, with over $70 million already invested in 2016.
Their eREIT falls under the newly created Regulation A+ rules, which allows offers to solicit investment from the general public for up to $50 million over a continuousÂ period.Â This means that both accredited and non-accredited investors can invest in their Income or Growth eREIT.
With investment minimums as low a $1,000, Fundriseâs eREIT is similar to a traditional REIT, but there are a few key exceptions.
Liquidity: The eREIT is NOT publicly traded. This is both a pro and a con. On the positive side, the price of your shares is not subject to the volatility of the stock market. On the downside, itâs not as easy for you to instantly sellÂ your shares and get out of the investment. Think of it as more of a long-term investment.
Fees and Investment Model: When youâre purchasing a traditional REIT, youâre going through a broker. You make the order and they make the purchase.Â Youâre naturally going to incur fees from the middle man. With Fundrise, youâre purchasing the securities directly through the platform. Youâre directly interacting with the offerer. Thatâs why the fees will differ with Fundrise.
âAssuming a fully subscribed offering, each eREIT anticipates having a reimbursement of organizational expenses of approximately 2%, marketing and distribution expenses of each offering up to 1%, and annual ongoing asset management fees and operational expenses of approximately 1-1.5%.
Ongoing asset management fees of between 1-1.5% is significantly lower than the fees that are associated with a traditional REIT, which also doesnât take into account broker costs.
Remember how we divided traditional REITs into the Equity or Mortgage category? You can adopt a similar mindset when looking through the Fundrise Growth eREIT and Income eREIT.
The website reads,Â âThe Income eREIT intends to acquire assets that pay returns on a more current basis, which is anticipated to produce more predictable and reliable cash flows; however, the Growth eREIT intends to acquire assets that it expects to have greater appreciation over time, which may produce larger returns but less frequent distributions.â
Basically, the GrowthÂ eREIT focuses on equity assets that appreciate over time and produce cashflows and the Income eREIT focuses on debt or fixed-income assets that produce cashflows from interest payments.
The biggest takeaway is that you can use Fundrise to invest in real estate with lower fees, but the REITs wonât be publicly traded.
Which should you choose?
It comes down to your investment goals, time horizon, and comfort when it comes to risk. Keep in mind that all investments are inherently risky. Real estate crowdfunding is no different. Al
