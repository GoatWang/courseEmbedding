 National CineMedia: Niche Industry Leader Selling At An 8-Year Low - National CineMedia, Inc. (NASDAQ:NCMI) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»National CineMedia: Niche Industry Leader Selling At An 8-Year LowJun.15.17 | About: National CineMedia, (NCMI) Jeff Marston Contrarian, event-driven, valueSummaryA bad Q1 2017 print led to a 28% sell-off. The stock now hovers at prices not seen since late 2008.National CineMedia enjoys a strong industry position and stable free cash flows.Uncertainty abounds, but the shares are worth double the current price.

 Business Overview National CineMedia, Inc. (NASDAQ:NCMI) is in the business of selling screen time to advertisers looking to plug their wares to movie theater audiences. If you've ever been to a movie in America, you've seen National CineMedia's flagship product - the string of advertisements, lasting approximately 10 minutes, just before the theater goes totally dark and the previews start. National CineMedia breaks up this block of screen time into a couple dozen short slices and sells it to advertisers. 

 Source: National CineMedia Investor Presentation dated June 2, 2017 The company also sells in-lobby marketing and promotional placements and operates several state-of-the-art digital advertising platforms. You may wonder why theater chains would allow National CineMedia to sell ad spots in their theaters. In other words, why don't the theater chains just sell the ads and keep all that revenue for themselves? The answer to this question is crucial to understanding National CineMedia's business model. In 2005, subsidiaries of the three largest theater chains; AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AMC), Regal Entertainment Group (NYSE:RGC) and Cinemark Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CNK) created National CineMedia in order to essentially outsource the ad monetization aspect of their theater operations. National CineMedia therefore refers to AMC, Regal and Cinemark as "founding members", or "founders". In exchange for long-term, guaranteed access to the founding members' movie theaters, National CineMedia owes the founders theater access fees which must be no less than 12% of the firm's aggregate advertising revenue. Therefore, the relationship between National CineMedia and the three founders is mutually beneficial. The founders all have a stake in National CineMedia's success and vice versa. This unique arrangement provides National CineMedia with a strong moat.
 In the niche industry of movie theater ad sales, National CineMedia is the undisputed leader with around 50% of total market share.

 Source: NCMI Investor Presentation Investment Thesis
 With that overview out of the way, I'll dive into the reasons why I bought National CineMedia shares recently. Although this isn't a name with earth-shattering fundamentals, the bottom line is that there is a good price for almost any business, and right now, NCMI's stock is firmly in deep value territory. On May 4th, National CineMedia reported a Q1 2017 performance that caused investors to stampede out of the stock like someone yelled fire in a crowded theater. On May 5th, NCMI closed at 8.34; down a stunning 28.2% from the 11.63 close on May 4th. Since then, the stock has continued to wander down to where it now hovers in the high 7s. NCMI hasn't traded below 8 since December 2008, which means that the stock currently trades at roughly an eight-year low. Bear in mind that in 2008, National CineMedia's operating cash flow was less than one-fourth what it is today and the dividend was less than half of today's payout. 

 NCMI Stock Price Three-Month History. Chart from Morningstar. Companies report bad quarters all the time but very rarely does a bad print result in a 28% sell-off. I believe there are a few reasons why this occurred. The general idea is that fear and uncertainty have been building around any name connected to traditional video for years and around NCMI in particular. The bad quarterly results tipped the scales leading to outright panic. First, NCMI hired a new CEO less than two years ago and leadership transition always causes uncertainty. Second, Credit Suisse analyst Omar Sheikh expressed the conventional wisdom on February 1st when he downgraded NCMI along with several other names connected to the movie theater industry (after all, everyone knows that Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Video will eventually kill brick and mortar theater chains, right?). Third, National CineMedia's balance sheet is more than a little scary. On the positive side, no maturities are due until 2019 and the leverage ratios are nowhere near being in breach of covenant. However, total liabilities have been greater than total assets for years, which means the company has a negative book value. Long-term debts are 944M for a firm with a market cap of less than 500M. These numbers should make any investor cautious.
 Finally, if the market is worried about the future of brick and mortar theaters, then it is especially pessimistic regarding what's been happening in the traditional advertising space lately. Perhaps most importantly, the proliferation of diverse media and entertainment options makes it harder and harder for advertisers to reach consumers where they are. Some observers contend that traditional marketing is doomed, and that in order to reach a target audience, businesses must pile resources into new, fragmented channels like social media. Although NCMI operates a cutting edge digital ad platform, the firm is, by and large, a "traditional" marketing broker that would presumably be hurt by a macro trend like this. With all this noise, fear and uncertainty in the background, the bad print on May 4th served as a tipping point that sent the shares tumbling. The Fear is Overblown Now I'm not going to say that the negative factors described above aren't valid cause for concern. Cheap stocks are always cheap for a reason. What I'm saying is that I believe the fear is overdone and NCMI's shares have solid value at their current price. The Discount Cash Flow Analysis below produces an intrinsic value for the company of 16.70 - more than double the current price. Here are the assumptions and inputs I used: - NCMI will continue to plod along as a no-growth dividend stock. 0% growth in free cash in perpetuity. - The firm delivers annual free cash flow results equal to its average result over the last 10 years. FCF is 104M per year going forward. I believe this is a conservative number considering that 2016's FCF result was 118M and the average for the last four years was 112M. - Discount rate is 10%. I believe this is a conservative discount rate considering it is unlikely that most investors will be able to find a risk-free investment yielding a 10% rate of return under current market conditions.                Year 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026   Free Cash Flow (in millions of USD) 104 104 104 104 104 104 104 104 104 104   Discount Factor 1.1 1.21 1.33 1.46 1.61 1.77 1.95 2.14 2.36 2.59   Discounted Value of FCF (in millions of USD) 95 86 78 71 65 59 53 49 44 40   Sum of Discounted Cash 638M   Discounted Perpetuity Cash 364M   Shares Outstanding 60.3M   Intrinsic Value Per Share $16.70   Of course, just because I think the shares are worth 16.70 doesn't mean they will reach that level any time soon and in particular we will likely need at least one catalyst to get back to that level. However, for what it's worth, the latest sell side analyst to weigh in on the name, Eric Wold from B. Riley and Co., reiterated his buy rating and assigned a $16 price target so at least one industry professional seems to concur with my valuation. How Can a Company Have a P/E of 20 and a P/FCF of 4? Note: The next few paragraphs are meant to explain a couple points that are important to understand when analyzing National CineMedia's financial statements. If the company didn't pop up when you ran your last screen for cheap stocks, there's a good reason why. So far, I've been talking up NCMI's strong free cash flow but haven't mentioned earnings or profit once. If you look at the earnings data in isolation, you'll notice that the valuation doesn't look great with a trailing P/E of almost 20. This gives an earnings yield, or capitalization rate, of about 5%. Further, since the earnings look somewhat weak, the dividend payout ratio also looks scary at over 200%. In other words, dividend payments appear to be double earnings which would appear to be unsustainable. However, if we compare the earnings to the cash flow numbers, a surprise awaits. At a current price of 7.78 and last year's free cash flow per share of 1.96, we get a P/FCF under 4 for an impressive free cash flow yield of over 25%. Companies like Enron are notorious for inflating earnings through arcane accounting tricks, but in this case, NCMI's earnings are actually much LOWER than we'd expect them to be. So what gives? Why the big disparity between earnings and free cash? The explanation has to do with the nuances surrounding the way National CineMedia amortizes its intangible assets. If you look at the firm's balance sheet, you'll see that the vast majority of the value on the asset side is in the form of intangible assets. These intangibles consist of the long-term contracts that NCMI holds with various movie theater chains such as founders AMC, Regal and Cinemark to sell screen time and other opportunities to advertisers. NCMI amortizes these assets (i.e. the contracts) on a straight line basis over their remaining useful lives. Now consider that NCMI never purchased these contracts from the founders and indeed the "price" that the company paid basically amounts to its side of the contract- i.e. its agreement to dole out a portion of aggregate advertising revenue to the founders and the other theater operators.
 So if NCMI never paid a price for the vast majority of its assets, how can it assign a value to them? The answer is found on page 7 of the 2016 10-K: NCMI's "intangible assets with its founding members are recorded at the fair market value of NCM, Inc.'s publicly traded stock as of the date on which the common membership units were issued". Say what? Basically, NCMI issues a special type of stock called a Common Membership Unit to the founders in order to ensure that the founders receive an appropriate share of the company's ad revenues designed to correspond with the number of theaters that each founder provides NCMI access to. Since the Common Membership Units are interchangeable with the NCMI stock, their value is appropriately equal to the value of the company's stock. And since the firm is (theoretically) getting a square deal here, the value of the contract it receives in exchange for issuing Common Membership Units should be equal to the value of the Units issued. Finally, since NCMI issued most of its Membership Units early in its history when the stock traded at higher prices (the 2007 IPO price was $21), the assets currently on the balance sheet are priced higher than any assets that the company would acquire today. This means that NCMI is still amortizing highly priced intangibles that it acquired over 10 years ago. The bottom line is that NCMI has 755.1M worth of rather arbitrarily valued intangible assets on its balance sheet that need to be amortized every single quarter. The result is a large and unavoidable accounting expense that has nothing to do with operating performance but which occurs like clockwork every quarter and serves to obscure what would be otherwise very strong earnings. The only way NCMI could hope to avoid this amortization expense in the future would be to significantly write down the value of its intangible assets. Such an event would be a double-edged sword for the firm because by writing down its intangibles, NCMI's book value would immediately plummet deeper into negative territory, but at the same time, reported net income would likely be vastly improved going forward.
 Now to be clear, I'm not criticizing the accounting rules surrounding the amortization of intangible assets here and clearly NCMI's contracts with the founders have an expiration date so they must be losing value over time. However, it's hard not to conclude that the way the assets are valued is quite arbitrary. So what can we finally conclude from all this? That in the case of National CineMedia, the cash flow statement is the most reliable indicator of actual business performance. The income statement is flawed in such a way that strong earnings are obscured by largely arbitrary amortization expenses. This is a company with strong EBIT numbers and strong free cash flow. Possible Investing Strategies Buy and hold types might like this name as a dividend play. During the Q1 earnings call, CFO Katie Scherping stated that "we intend to pay a regular quarterly dividend for the foreseeable future..." If a long-term strategy appeals to you, I recommend paying close attention to the leverage ratios and debt covenants. As mentioned above, the debt levels are higher than most dividend investors like to see in a safe, long-term hold. Alternately, I believe this name could work well as an asymmetric short-to-mid term turnaround play. CEO Andy England made the case for such a strategy early in the call: We anticipate the first three quarters of 2017 will be challenging while Q4, enabled by content partner spending and Star Wars, will be solid. We expect the value of our 2017 transition and investments will be reflected with meaningful activities in digital, National Spot sales, stabilized network, along with continued strength in the film slate beginning later this year and into next will drive growth in 2018 and beyond. If England's prediction comes to fruition, then the Q4 2017 print could serve as the catalyst the market needs to re-value the stock back to its historical range. Further, with all the priced-in pessimism, a positive surprise in Q2 or Q3 could serve as an upside catalyst. If you like the odds of any of these short-to-mid term events coming to fruition, then a long dated call option strategy may achieve superior results while limiting downside exposure.

National CineMedia, Inc. Announces Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Date And Conference Call











Short Interest Expands By 11.4% For NCMI













Short Interest Falls 29% For NCMI
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 06/15/2017 settlement date, which shows a 995,603 share decrease in total short interest for National CineMedia Inc , to 2,431,765, a decrease of 29.05% since 05/31/2017. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.

Jun 27, 2017 1:40 PM EDT













YieldBoost National CineMedia To 38.6% Using Options
Shareholders of National CineMedia Inc looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 12% annualized dividend yield can sell the August covered call at the $7.50 strike and collect the premium based on the 30 cents bid, which annualizes to an additional 26.6% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost), for a total of 38.6% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $7.50 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but NCMI shares would have to advance 2% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 6.1% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

National CineMedia Seeks Acquisitions
May 23 17
National CineMedia, Inc. (NasdaqGS:NCMI)'s Director and Chief Executive Officer Andrew J England recently stated, "We are (open to acquisition opportunities). M&A is certainly not a focus of NCM in general. It never has been and our ability and desire to do that is limited. What we're really interested in doing is leveraging the assets that we do have to build out that digital presence. And like any media company, having -- we always have some inventory that we don't sell because we can't get the price we want for it and we want to maintain the integrity of that pricing structure. So we always have some inventory that is just perfectly positioned to talk to digital movie assets. So that's how -- we're really interest in and perhaps there'll be some equity stakes in the future.
But it's -- but our focus is on building and partnering, but maybe a little bit of buying too."

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Share the screen with
the world’s best content


Movies are at the heart of American culture. With the biggest budgets, best talent, and blockbuster storytelling it’s primetime, live event programming every week.
You’ve been there. That 50-foot screen, HD image and surround sound create an all-encompassing experience in a captive environment — making it the most effective way to reach and engage audiences. No distractions. No DVR. No remote control. Imagine if you could tap into that emotional connection right in the moment. Oh wait... you can.

The #1 network on weekends

NCM’s average weekly audience translates to a Nielsen rating of over 7.0 in adults 18 to 49, making FirstLook one of the top 10 primetime shows in the U.S. every week. In terms of average monthly reach, we rank 5th right between the Broadcast and major Cable Networks.  And to no surprise, NCM is the largest reach network on weekends.  And that’s only our movie screens - our reach goes beyond that.
We’ve got integrated, digital video platforms that capture the attention of millions of moviegoers before, during and after the movie. The best part is, we’re not just reaching an audience. We’re reaching the right audience — your target audience.
Do we have your attention? Because we most definitely have theirs.





Bigger really is better

Today, people are in full control of what they watch. As advertisers, you are constantly battling fragmented audiences, declining reach, and ad-skipping technology.  Who’s even watching your ads anymore?
That’s where we come in.
Our audience is in full “show me what you got” mode — staring up at a giant screen in a dark, comfortable movie theater. They are fully focused on your ad and we can prove it. According to Nielsen, NCM gets 33% higher engagement levels than live sports and broadcast prime TV.
Call NCM to harness the power of America’s Movie Network.

National CineMedia (NCM) is an American cinema advertising company. NCM displays ads to U.S. consumers in movie theaters, online and through mobile technology. NCM presents cinema advertising across a digital in-theater network, consisting of theaters owned by AMC Entertainment Inc., Cinemark Holdings, Inc., Regal Entertainment Group and other regional theater circuits.
The publicly-traded National CineMedia, Inc. (NASDAQ: NCMI) owns 43.7% and is the managing partner of NCM. Regal, Cinemark and AMC hold the remainder of NCM shares.
The company is perhaps best known to the general public for its advertising preshow, FirstLook.

FirstLook[edit]
FirstLook is NCM's pre-feature programming. FirstLook consists of pre-show advertising and entertainment,[1] provided by content partners such as ABC Networks, A&E Television Networks, Amazon, Disney, Fandango, Google, Hulu, Microsoft, NBC, Nintendo and Turner Broadcasting System[2] interspersed with advertising. The program is approximately 20 minutes, and is timed to end exactly at the movie's start time, before any trailers. It is delivered via satellite, and several different versions are provided depending on the movie's MPAA rating.
If a 3D movie is showing, a special "FirstLook 3D" is shown after the original version. This consists of 3D advertisements.
If a G or PG movie is showing, a children's version of FirstLook, named "FirstLook Play", is shown in lieu of the original version. This usually is for movies directed at children with those ratings, though some PG movies may still have the regular FirstLook programming.
FirstLook is the successor to Regal's The 2wenty preshow, introduced to that chain in 2003. FirstLook carries largely that same format, the main difference being that while 2wenty was Regal-exclusive, FirstLook is fed to founding members circuits AMC, Cinemark, and Regal, as well as many NCM affiliate circuits such as Goodrich Quality Theaters, Hollywood Theaters, and Kerasotes.
Fathom Events[edit]
Fathom Events, formerly known as NCM Fathom, was a division of National CineMedia that offered alternative entertainment events in movie theaters. In December 2013, it was announced that NCM was restructuring Fathom Events as a new stand-alone entity owned by AMC, Cinemark, Regal Entertainment Group and NCM, with NCM retaining a 4% stake in the company.[3]
Past entertainment events have included:

NCM Digital[edit]
The NCM Digital offers 360-degree integrated marketing programs in combination with cinema, encompassing thousands of entertainment-related web sites and hundreds of mobile applications.
Firstlookonline.com is a consumer-based initiative targeting movie-going audiences with new movie content, trailers, movie showtimes and extended information.
Rejected merger[edit]
In May 2014, Screenvision entered into a merger agreement with NCM for US$375 million.[4] The merger was blocked by the Department of Justice over anti-trust concerns, since Screenvision and NCM together would supply advertising to 34,000 of the nation's 39,000 movie theaters.[5] In March 2015, Screenvision and NCM terminated their deal and NCM paid Screenvision a $26.8 million termination payment.[6]

Share the screen with
the world’s best content


Movies are at the heart of American culture. With the biggest budgets, best talent, and blockbuster storytelling it’s primetime, live event programming every week.
You’ve been there. That 50-foot screen, HD image and surround sound create an all-encompassing experience in a captive environment — making it the most effective way to reach and engage audiences. No distractions. No DVR. No remote control. Imagine if you could tap into that emotional connection right in the moment. Oh wait... you can.

The #1 network on weekends

NCM’s average weekly audience translates to a Nielsen rating of over 7.0 in adults 18 to 49, making FirstLook one of the top 10 primetime shows in the U.S. every week. In terms of average monthly reach, we rank 5th right between the Broadcast and major Cable Networks.  And to no surprise, NCM is the largest reach network on weekends.  And that’s only our movie screens - our reach goes beyond that.
We’ve got integrated, digital video platforms that capture the attention of millions of moviegoers before, during and after the movie. The best part is, we’re not just reaching an audience. We’re reaching the right audience — your target audience.
Do we have your attention? Because we most definitely have theirs.





Bigger really is better

Today, people are in full control of what they watch. As advertisers, you are constantly battling fragmented audiences, declining reach, and ad-skipping technology.  Who’s even watching your ads anymore?
That’s where we come in.
Our audience is in full “show me what you got” mode — staring up at a giant screen in a dark, comfortable movie theater. They are fully focused on your ad and we can prove it. According to Nielsen, NCM gets 33% higher engagement levels than live sports and broadcast prime TV.
Call NCM to harness the power of America’s Movie Network.

National CineMedia (NCM) is an American cinema advertising company. NCM displays ads to U.S. consumers in movie theaters, online and through mobile technology. NCM presents cinema advertising across a digital in-theater network, consisting of theaters owned by AMC Entertainment Inc., Cinemark Holdings, Inc., Regal Entertainment Group and other regional theater circuits.
The publicly-traded National CineMedia, Inc. (NASDAQ: NCMI) owns 43.7% and is the managing partner of NCM. Regal, Cinemark and AMC hold the remainder of NCM shares.
The company is perhaps best known to the general public for its advertising preshow, FirstLook.

FirstLook[edit]
FirstLook is NCM's pre-feature programming. FirstLook consists of pre-show advertising and entertainment,[1] provided by content partners such as ABC Networks, A&E Television Networks, Amazon, Disney, Fandango, Google, Hulu, Microsoft, NBC, Nintendo and Turner Broadcasting System[2] interspersed with advertising. The program is approximately 20 minutes, and is timed to end exactly at the movie's start time, before any trailers. It is delivered via satellite, and several different versions are provided depending on the movie's MPAA rating.
If a 3D movie is showing, a special "FirstLook 3D" is shown after the original version. This consists of 3D advertisements.
If a G or PG movie is showing, a children's version of FirstLook, named "FirstLook Play", is shown in lieu of the original version. This usually is for movies directed at children with those ratings, though some PG movies may still have the regular FirstLook programming.
FirstLook is the successor to Regal's The 2wenty preshow, introduced to that chain in 2003. FirstLook carries largely that same format, the main difference being that while 2wenty was Regal-exclusive, FirstLook is fed to founding members circuits AMC, Cinemark, and Regal, as well as many NCM affiliate circuits such as Goodrich Quality Theaters, Hollywood Theaters, and Kerasotes.
Fathom Events[edit]
Fathom Events, formerly known as NCM Fathom, was a division of National CineMedia that offered alternative entertainment events in movie theaters. In December 2013, it was announced that NCM was restructuring Fathom Events as a new stand-alone entity owned by AMC, Cinemark, Regal Entertainment Group and NCM, with NCM retaining a 4% stake in the company.[3]
Past entertainment events have included:

National CineMedia (NCM) is an American cinema advertising company. NCM displays ads to U.S. consumers in movie theaters, online and through mobile technology. NCM presents cinema advertising across a digital in-theater network, consisting of theaters owned by AMC Entertainment Inc., Cinemark Holdings, Inc., Regal Entertainment Group and other regional theater circuits.
The publicly-traded National CineMedia, Inc. (NASDAQ: NCMI) owns 43.7% and is the managing partner of NCM. Regal, Cinemark and AMC hold the remainder of NCM shares.
The company is perhaps best known to the general public for its advertising preshow, FirstLook.

FirstLook[edit]
FirstLook is NCM's pre-feature programming. FirstLook consists of pre-show advertising and entertainment,[1] provided by content partners such as ABC Networks, A&E Television Networks, Amazon, Disney, Fandango, Google, Hulu, Microsoft, NBC, Nintendo and Turner Broadcasting System[2] interspersed with advertising. The program is approximately 20 minutes, and is timed to end exactly at the movie's start time, before any trailers. It is delivered via satellite, and several different versions are provided depending on the movie's MPAA rating.
If a 3D movie is showing, a special "FirstLook 3D" is shown after the original version. This consists of 3D advertisements.
If a G or PG movie is showing, a children's version of FirstLook, named "FirstLook Play", is shown in lieu of the original version. This usually is for movies directed at children with those ratings, though some PG movies may still have the regular FirstLook programming.
FirstLook is the successor to Regal's The 2wenty preshow, introduced to that chain in 2003. FirstLook carries largely that same format, the main difference being that while 2wenty was Regal-exclusive, FirstLook is fed to founding members circuits AMC, Cinemark, and Regal, as well as many NCM affiliate circuits such as Goodrich Quality Theaters, Hollywood Theaters, and Kerasotes.
Fathom Events[edit]
Fathom Events, formerly known as NCM Fathom, was a division of National CineMedia that offered alternative entertainment events in movie theaters. In December 2013, it was announced that NCM was restructuring Fathom Events as a new stand-alone entity owned by AMC, Cinemark, Regal Entertainment Group and NCM, with NCM retaining a 4% stake in the company.[3]
Past entertainment events have included:

The Metropolitan Opera live from New York City
Live concerts (The Black Eyed Peas, Queen, Paul Rodgers, Celine Dion, Garth Brooks, David Gilmour, Linkin Park, Kiss, Rod Stewart, Depeche Mode, Korn, Beastie Boys, The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Green Day, Bon Jovi, Bowling for Soup, Brooks & Dunn, Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival, Rush, Elton John, Peter Gabriel, Aly & AJ, Jesse McCartney, Usher, Jimmy Buffett, One Direction, Aerosmith, Yes, Meat Loaf, Godsmack,Michael Bublé, Carole King, Josh Groban, Phish, Matchbox Twenty, Prince, Kenny Chesney, Elvis Presley, Les Misérables)
Live sporting events (Mayweather/Márquez, UFC 111, Hopkins/Jones 2, Mayweather/Mosley, UFC 115, Final Four Games of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Márquez/Díaz 2, UFC 118, Mosley/Mora, UFC 121, Mayweather/Ortiz, UFC 143, Mayweather/Cotto, UFC 154, Mayweather/Guerrero, Mayweather/Álvarez, UFC 167, Mayweather/Maidana 1, Mayweather/Maidana 2, UFC 181-185, UFC 187-UFC 189, UFC 192, Cotto/Alvarez)
Various films courtesy of Turner Classic Movies
Live town halls and other original programming[citation needed]
Filmed Broadway Musicals (e.g. Memphis: Direct from Broadway)
National Theatre Live: filmed plays from the National Theatre in London
Anime films
Children's films

NCM Digital[edit]
The NCM Digital offers 360-degree integrated marketing programs in combination with cinema, encompassing thousands of entertainment-related web sites and hundreds of mobile applications.
Firstlookonline.com is a consumer-based initiative targeting movie-going audiences with new movie content, trailers, movie showtimes and extended information.
Rejected merger[edit]
In May 2014, Screenvision entered into a merger agreement with NCM for US$375 million.[4] The merger was blocked by the Department of Justice over anti-trust concerns, since Screenvision and NCM together would supply advertising to 34,000 of the nation's 39,000 movie theaters.[5] In March 2015, Screenvision and NCM terminated their deal and NCM paid Screenvision a $26.8 million termination payment.[6]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
