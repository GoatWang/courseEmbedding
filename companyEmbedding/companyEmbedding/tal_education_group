BEIJING, July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- TAL Education Group ("TAL" or the "Company") (NYSE:   TAL), a leading K-12 after-school tutoring services provider in China, today announced that it will change its American depositary share ("ADS") to Class A common share ("Share") ratio from one (1) ADS representing two (2) Shares to three (3) ADSs representing one (1) Share. The Company will file an amendment to its registration statement on Form F-6 and a registration statement on Form F-6 (collectively, the "Form F-6") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") to reflect the change in the ADS ratio. The Company anticipates that the change in the ADS ratio will be effective on August 16, 2017, subject to the SEC having declared the Form F-6 to be effective on or before that date.








Holders of TAL ADSs of record as of the close of business on August 8, 2017 will receive five (5) additional ADSs for every one ADS held on that date. For TAL's ADS holders, this ratio change will have the same effect as a 6-for-1 ADS split.
The ADS ratio change will have no impact on TAL's underlying Shares. Furthermore, no action by ADS holders is required to effect the ratio change.

TAL Education Group to Acquire Firstleap Education

Sep 20, 2015, 23:00 ET
		  		  							
						 from   TAL Education Group 











 
















































 

 




















 


BEIJING, Sept. 20, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- TAL Education Group (NYSE:   XRS) ("TAL" or the "Company"), a leading K-12 after-school tutoring services provider in China, announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Firstleap Education ("Firstleap"), which provides all-subject tutoring service in English in China to children aged from 2 to 15 years old. 
Founded in 2009, Firstleap provides all-subject tutoring service in English in China to children aged from 2 to 15 years old through both its online platform www.firstleap.cn and over 60 learning centers. It now serves more than 20,000 students in over 20 cities in China and maintains high retention rate and customer satisfaction rate. 
"We are excited about our acquisition of Firstleap as we believe it will complement and extend our tutoring service offerings in the pre-K to college space, as well as help us gain more insight into childhood development and learning," said TAL's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Bangxin Zhang. "Firstleap has built a strong online-to-offline platform offering comprehensive tutoring services to children. This acquisition aligns well with our vision to position TAL at the intersection of where education meets technology. After the acquisition, we plan to keep Firstleap as a separate brand for independent operation within the company structure. Firstleap will continue to provide practical English training focusing on qualitative development in the live context, as is the latest trend in English tutoring. Our organic small class Lejiale English business will be specialized in exam-oriented English subject tutoring, while our other proprietary brand Lewaijiao will provide online one-on-one oral English tutoring by native English speaking teachers. The separate brands will also work together with Shunshun Liuxue, the online C2C overseas studies consulting platform in which we have invested recently. We expect to see all these separate brands to grow into integrated businesses under the TAL umbrella." 
The total consideration for this acquisition is not disclosed for reasons of commercial sensitivity.
