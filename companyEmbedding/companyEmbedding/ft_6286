The rug  we received looked nothing like this.  It was totally red. I took it to Home Depot to return and they talked with the HD warehouse and it was reported that this rug is no longer being manufactured.  Yet the rug we received is not on the website.   Therefore we returned the rug.  Why would HD have a rug like the one above of their website and discontinue it.  This makes for poor merchandising and customer service.

                    What a great place to call home. Albany has so very much to offer. The city parks and rec department has a vast array of activities that are available to the public. In the summer months the Cool Pool is open at Swanson Park, "The pool features a zero depth entry and is 4.5' deep at its deepest. COOL! has a 36' high slide and a Lazy River. The play structure is surrounded by a large amount of water that is only 18" deep". Albany also hosts a concert series every summer called River Rhythms at Monteith Park where vendors sell food and drink. The summer of 2017 will host artists such at Tracey Lawrence, John Michael Montgomery, a Michael Jackson tribute concert, Pablo Cruise and more. Albany also has a community garden and a Saturday market. If you are a dog owner you can enjoy our dog park. If you are adventurous we have a skate park too. Our library has 2 locations and children's storybook times that run Monday through Friday. For the older individual try one of the many activities at the Albany Senior Center. We will soon have the Carousel open too. All of these wonderful activities are available to the public and much much more.

Built for EVGA Precision XOC
This new version of Precision is built for the NVIDIA Pascal architecture and combines the best of EVGA Precision and EVGA OC Scanner to give you never before seen overclocking features and built in automatic tuning.


EVGA ACX 3.0 Cooling
 EVGA ACX 3.0 once again brings new and exciting features to the award winning EVGA ACX cooling technology. SHP 2.0 gives increased heatpipes and copper contact area for cooler operation, and optimized fan curve for even quieter gaming. Of course, ACX 3.0 coolers also feature optimized swept fan blades, double ball bearings and an extreme low power motor, delivering more air flow with less power, unlocking additional power for the GPU.


10 Phase Power Design
Robust power design for extreme overclocking.


Adjustable RGB LED
An adjustable RGB LED that can be controlled in EVGA PrecisionX OC



Awards of the EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 FTW GAMING, 08G-P4-6286-KR, 8GB GDDR5X, ACX 3.0 & RGB LED (08G-P4-6286-KR)

                  Overall though this is a feature packed card that checks all the boxes for what an aftermarket card should be
                



Bit-Tech
2016/06/01





                  What you do get is a respectable factory core overclock, a well made and good looking card, and a premium cooling solution that makes good use of its slightly boosted size to remain very quiet in all situations. The extra power circuitry credentials may appeal to some as well, and the RGB lighting and exclusive features in Precision XOC are neat too. Ultimately, the GTX 1080 FTW makes a compelling case for you to opt for it instead of the similarly priced Founders Edition
                



HiTech Legion
2016/06/01





                  All overclocks were achieved using EVGA Precision XOC which I feel is one of the best laid out and through overclocking tools in the industry. It is laid out very well and easy to use, all its functions can be found in the GUI without guessing what tab to click to get you where you want to be, OSD always works, fan options actually set the correct fan curves and voltage regulation is simple and undaunted. Compared to other OC tools even with other manufacturers cards for personal use I have always found myself reverting back to Precision X. ACX 3.0 Cooling with RGB LED is one of the most efficient cooling systems on the market and the RGB will make your case as happy as a pig in … (well you know). The EVGA 1080 FTW comes with one of the highest factory overclocked GPUs in its price point. At this time no other single GPU on the market can outperform the GTX 1080.
                



Paul's Hardware
2016/06/01





                  All things considered, EVGA has built a very nice card around the 1080 with an effective cooler and some extra value features above what you get with the Founder's Edition
                



Babel Tech Reviews
2016/06/01





                  We have no trouble giving a big recommendation to the EVGA GTX 1080 FTW ACX 3.0.  At $679 it looks great, runs cool and is very quiet, and its out of the box performance is higher than the Founders Edition of the GTX 1080 which costs $20 more.
                



TechSource
2016/06/01





                  In conclusion the FTW Edition is a beast of a card, it's well made, aesthetically pleasing, extremely quiet and comes with the RGB LED feature...
                



Tech of Tomorrow
2016/06/01





                  ...This card runs great, seems like the cooling technology on it is doing a solid job and at the end of the day for those folks out there who don't want a founders edition card the FTW might be just what you're looking for.
                



Hexus
2016/06/01





                  We increased the core speed to +105MHz and memory to +520MHz. The end result was a consistent boost speed of 2,062MHz across a trio of benchmarks.  Showing how similar overclocking performance is amongst GTX 1080s, especially using our methodology of not increasing the voltage, the EVGA took top spot...
                



Bjorn3D
2016/06/01





                  The EVGA GTX 1080 FTW Gaming ACX 3.0 is highly over engineered, heavy overkill, and Geekalicious.
                



Tweak Town
2016/07/01





                  EVGA's new GeForce GTX 1080 FTW GAMING ACX 3.0 is one of the best-looking GP104-powered cards on the market right now, with some stellar performance and silent cooling.
                



Fudzilla
2016/08/01





                  The EVGA GTX 1080 FTW is fast graphics card, and our conclusion is short. Go for it if you can afford it, with this horse you can win any race.
                



Hardware Canucks
2016/09/01





                  The ACX 3.0 cooler here is very efficient and keeps the card completely quiet and temp maxxing out at 75c at load, which is fantastic to see with the card boosting to 1936MHz on its own.
