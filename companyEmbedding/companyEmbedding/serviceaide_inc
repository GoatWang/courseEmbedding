Its simple no-friction onboarding and rich out-of-the-box functionality lets organizations get started immediately with zero implementation risk.

ServiceAide Introduces Robust Yet Affordable New Service Desk

Organizations Have New Option to Raise Customer Satisfaction and Lower Service Management Costs




Jun 22, 2017, 7:30am EDT














SAN JOSE, Calif. and SÃO PAULO, Brazil, June 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- ServiceAide, Inc., announces immediate availability of their new Service Desk product, giving organizations affordable choices of a robust Service Desk or comprehensive Service Management suite with verified ITIL processes. Cloud Service Management™ now becomes a product line that includes the Service Desk and Service Management editions. Both SaaS products are accessed by end-users, support analysts and administrators using a browser and dedicated mobile app.



"Since 2004 organizations have used our IT Service Management (ITSM) suite to deliver excellent service without having to expand their IT team and budget," said Wai Wong, ServiceAide's CEO. "We are pleased to offer a choice of two Service Management solutions to meet specific needs and budgets. Organizations no longer need to compromise and get by with inadequate homegrown or commercial help desk solutions, or overpay for highly customizable software that has high ongoing maintenance burdens and costs."
The Service Desk edition is available via ServiceAide's website on a self-service try-to-buy basis. Its simple no-friction onboarding and rich out-of-the-box functionality lets organizations get started immediately with zero implementation risk. Afterward they can leverage the powerful codeless flexibility to configure it on their own without adding specialized personnel or engaging costly professional services. As organizations expand and evolve, they can easily adapt their solution to remain aligned with changing business objectives and evolving workflows. They can also upgrade to the Service Management edition seamlessly without risk and cost.
About ServiceAide™ Provides Service Management solutions with quick onboarding, low-burden administration and hence deliver a fast time to value and low ongoing cost of ownership. A growing global portfolio of clients benefit from these comprehensive and flexible solutions to deliver excellent customer service and ensure that IT systems meet business objectives. All products are built with the Hyper-SaaS™ architecture that simplifies creating and operating solutions for specific teams, departments and entire organizations; each with custom-tailored service catalogs, approvals and process workflows.
