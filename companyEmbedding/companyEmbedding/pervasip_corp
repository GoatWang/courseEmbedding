   Pervasip Corp - PVSP    Pervasip Corp. (USOTC:PVSP) develops and delivers products and technologies to emerging agricultural markets, with a focus on improving grow conditions, yields and value in hydroponic and other indoor grow facility applications. Canalytix and Plaid Canary Corporation are two subsidiaries of Pervasip that operate in the emerging agricultural markets. The operating results of these entities are consolidated and included in the consolidated financial statements of Pervasip.    About Us  Initiatives  Pervasip Corp  SEC Filings                      Comprehensive Cannabis Analytics, Extraction and Testing In recent years, regulations surrounding cannabis have changed dramatically in several states.  Recreational marijuana use in Colorado was legalized effective January 1, 2014 for individuals 21 and over. Our goal is to be at the forefront of the analytics, extraction and testing process in Colorado, and to eventually provide those services for cannabis products in other states.   Commercial and recreational growers are able to obtain superior results when they use scientific analysis, and medical marijuana regulations require extensive testing of product prior to reaching patients, including potency, pesticide, residual, heavy metal and microbial testing. We have developed scientific methods for the analysis of cannabinoids in flowers, concentrates, and edibles with the use of various instrumentation.  We also plan to assist medical marijuana specialty production facilities in order to better regulate, calculate proper dosage, and understand the importance of consistency in product. Gardening is a science and growers should not rely solely on the visual information and destructive analysis to determine health and potential yields. We believe we possess the know-how to offer commercial clients the ability to double the yield at approximately 30% of the cost of other plant enhancement techniques. Implementation of advanced instrumentation is a major key to efficient operations where plant yields are maximized, costs are reduced, and impacts on the environment are minimized.  We have identified several areas where tremendous opportunity exists for portable chemical sensing instrumentation.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM) N/A     EPS (TTM)  $0.00      Market Cap $377,801     Shares Outstanding 3.78 B     Public Float N/A     Yield PVSP has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.

Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest ()   N/A      ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.
