* This undertaking does not affect any limits Section 102(a) of the National Securities Markets
        Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to
        require information. As a result, if the securities that are the subject of this Form D are "covered securities" for purposes 
        of NSMIA, whether in all instances or due to the nature of the offering that is the subject of this Form D, States cannot
        routinely require offering materials under this undertaking or otherwise and can require offering materials only to the
        extent NSMIA permits them to do so under NSMIA's preservation of their anti-fraud authority.

If you need help or have a question for Customer Service, please visit the Help Section.Hobbies from Amazon.com
Coin collecting, model train building, slot car racing and rocket-launching can be very relaxing and rewarding hobbies. At Amazon.com, we carry all the supplies and kits you need to start a new and fulfilling pastime. Driving RC cars, planes and helicopters inspire hours of play outdoors, and the world of collecting is a great place to meet others who share your hobbies. 

For collectors of baseball cards, Magic the Gathering cards, paper money, vintage photographs, postcards and manuscript rejection slips, we carry every size of plastic binder slips you could need. They’re perfectly clear and sturdy so your treasures stay easy-to-see and protected.  Whether you’re just drawn to the esthetics of coins or you just plain love money, we also carry a variety of coin collecting supplies to make sure your Buffalo Nickel stays penned in and safe. 

Browse our die-cast vehicle collection and you’ll find aircrafts, excavators, military vehicles, Harley Davidson models and more. Or if you need a little more horse-power from your hobbies, check out our radio controlled vehicles. Our wide selection of RC vehicles includes helicopters, cars, planes, boats, motorcycles and more. Driving and flying RC vehicles are the perfect hobbies for young racing enthusiasts. Bring your vehicles to a skate park and see how many jumps and flips you can perform with them. 

But once you sign for all the supplies you need for your hobbies, what’s there to look forward to in the mail? Now you can replay the experience of receiving your Amazon.com packages again and again with our model UPS and USPS vehicles. Relive the excitement and anticipation whenever you need a pick-me-up with our highly detailed mail trucks.

Immersing yourself in your hobbies is a great way to unwind after a long work day. Hobbies can even open new worlds for you, like meeting fellow enthusiasts, developing common pastimes with loved ones, and even inspiring new careers.
