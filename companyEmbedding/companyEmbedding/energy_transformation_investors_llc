Introduction
Energy is the ability to do work. It is one of the basic human needs and is an essential component in any development programme. In this lesson, we are going to look at the forms that energy exists, namely: heat, light, sound, electrical, chemical, nuclear and mechanical. These forms of energy may be transformed from one form to the other, usually with losses.







Objectives

By the end of this lesson you should be able to:

 describe the various forms of energy namely,heat, light, sound, electrical, chemical, nuclear and mechanical

describe how energy may be transformed from one form to another






Lesson Content
<kaltura-widget kalturaid='292776' size='M' align='L'/>

Heat
Heat energy, also referred to as thermal energy, is really the effect of moving molecules. Matter is made up of molecules, which are in continual motion and in a solid, vibrate about a mean position. The motion of any molecule increases when the energy of the substance is increased. This may cause an increase in the temperature of the substance or lead to a change of state. The higher the temperature, the greater the internal energy of the substance.
Heat energy is the most easily lost or dissipated form of energy. It is also the form of energy into which other forms of energy can easily change. However, heat can be changed into other forms of energy with a lot of waste.also called Solar Energy


Light
 Sunset: Image provided by courtesy of Flickr- www.flickr.comLight energy is a type of wave motion. That is, light is a form of energy caused by light waves.  It enables us to see, as objects are only visible when they reflect light into our eyes.

Sound
Sound energy is also a type of wave motion. We are heard by others when we talk because of the sound energy we produce. It is due to the effect of the air molecules vibrating when we talk. The vibrating molecules hit our eardrums, which enable us to hear others talk.  Sound energy may be converted into electrical energy for transmission, and later the electrical energy can be converted back into sound energy at the receiving end. An example of such transformations could be seen in the microphone and the loudspeaker.
Sound, like heat energy is easily lost. The transformation of one form of energy into another may be accompanied by losses in the form of sound and/or heat that are often not desirable.


Electrical Energy
 Transmission of electrical energy: Image provided by courtesy of Flickr- www.flickr.comElectrical energy is really the effect of moving electrical charges from one point to another in a conductor. Electrical charges moving through a conductor is called electricity. Electrical energy may be easily changed into other forms of energy to suit our particular needs. Lightning is an example of electrical energy. Electric current is the means by which electrical energy is most easily transported to places where it is needed and converted into other forms.

Chemical Energy
This is the energy stored within chemical compounds. A chemical compound is formed by the rearrangement of atoms that is accompanied by energy loss or gain. This energy is the chemical energy gained or lost in the formation of the compound. 
Food, biomass, fuel and explosives have a store of chemical energy. The energy from food is released by chemical reactions in our bodies in the form of heat. Fuels like coal, oil and natural gas contain chemical energy that may be converted into other forms of energy like heat and light. The chemical energy present in a given fuel is determined by its calorific value – the heat liberated when 1 Kg of the fuel is burnt. Batteries and explosives also contain chemical energy that could be converted into other forms of energy, some beneficial, others harmful.


Nuclear Energy
Nuclear Energy, also known as atomic energy, is energy stored in the nucleus of an atom. It is this energy that holds the nucleus together and could be released when the nuclei are combined (fusion) or split (fission) apart. Nuclear energy can be used for peaceful purpose as well as destructive purposes (as in the atomic bomb). Considering peaceful purposes, nuclear energy is used to generate electricity in nuclear power plants, produce steam for driving machines, powering some submarines and spacecrafts. In these applications, the nuclei of uranium atoms are split in a process called fission. Nuclear energy is also the source of the sun’s energy. The sun combines the nuclei of hydrogen atoms into helium atoms in a process called fusion. 
Albert Einstein put forward the following equation that provides the basis for calculating the amount of energy released when the nucleus of an atom is split. 
	E = mc2
The equation means that when the nucleus of an atom is split, the amount of energy released, E, in joules, is equal to the loss of its mass, m, in kilograms, times the speed of light squared, c2, in m/s2. Because c2 is a very large figure (300,000,000  X 300,000,000   = 90,000.000,000,000,000  ), a small amount of mass can be converted into an enormous amount of energy. An atom of uranium splits into two smaller atoms and loses roughly 0.1 percent of its mass that is converted into a vast amount of energy. One-kilogram mass of any substance completely converted into energy equals 90,000,000,000,000,000 J or 25 billion kilowatt hours!! This is more than the electrical energy needs of the United States for two days!!

Mechanical Energy
Mechanical energy is the kind of energy that can do mechanical work directly. Naturally occurring sources of mechanical energy include winds, waterfalls and tides. 
There are two kinds of mechanical energy, namely kinetic energy and potential energy. Kinetic energy is the energy a body possesses by virtue of its motion. A moving body of mass, m Kg and velocity v m/s possesses kinetic energy of magnitudemv2 joules. Thus, the magnitude of the kinetic energy of an object depends both the mass and the velocity of the object. Flowing water and winds have kinetic energy. 
Potential energy is the energy of a body due to its position or shape. This form of energy could be considered as energy stored in a body to be released when it begins to move or change its position or shape. Quite often, potential energy changes to kinetic energy. A ball at the top of a slope, water behind a dam, a compressed spring and a stretched elastic band possess potential energy. For a body of mass, m Kg located at a height h metres above a particular chosen level such as ground level or sea level, its potential energy is mgh joules, where g = acceleration due to gravity, in m/s2. For an elastic spring stretched x m, its potential energy is  (1/2)kx2  joules, where k = spring constant, in N/m.

Energy Conversion
One important property of energy is its ability to change from one form to another form. For example, chemical energy from fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) can be converted into heat energy when burned. The heat energy may be converted into kinetic energy in a gas turbine and finally into electrical energy by a generator. The electric energy may subsequently be converted into light, sound or kinetic energy in our homes through various household appliances.
During any energy conversion, the amount of energy input is the same as the energy output. This concept is known as the law of conservation of energy and sometimes referred to as the First Law of Thermodynamics. This law states: energy cannot be created nor destroyed but can be transformed from one form to another. Thus, the total energy of an isolated system is always constant and when energy of one form is expended an equal amount of energy in another form is produced. In every energy conversion, some high-grade energy is converted into low-grade energy as heat. Thus, the total amount of low-grade energy in the universe is increasing while high-grade energy is decreasing. Even though energy is never destroyed, we usually complain that the world is suffering from an energy shortage. Indeed we are suffering from shortage of high-grade energy that has the potential of producing useful power! Energy may change form, but the total amount of energy in the universe stays the same. 







Reflection

Let us consider the following energy transformations that we encounter on daily basis in our everyday activities.

When we turn on our flashlight, chemical energy stored in the batteries is converted into light energy.

When we turn on the television, electrical energy changes into light and sound. Even though undesirable, some amount of heat is also produced.

When we move a vehicle, the engine converts the chemical energy stored in the fuel into heat, sound and kinetic energy. Note that the heat and the sound that are produced are not desirable.

When we talk on the telephone, the sound we produce is first transformed into electrical energy by the microphone that is transmitted along wires. In the case of cellular phones, the sound is converted into electromagnetic waves and transmitted through the air. The speaker of the phone on the other end changes the electrical energy/ electromagnetic waves back into sound energy.

An electric cooker in our homes changes electrical energy into heat and light. (As the hot plate gets hotter and hotter we see it glowing).














Summary

In this lesson, we looked at the various forms in which energy may exist, namely: heat, light, sound, electrical, chemical, nuclear and mechanical. We also learnt that these forms of energy may be transformed from one form to the other, usually with losses.

On Energy, Be Careful About Falling In Love

Forbes
	July 27, 2017



Renewable energy and fossil fuel advocates have one thing in common – an unhealthy tendency to fall in love with a particular energy technology. Each has a cadre of vocal advocates, but each are a bit myopic. The problem is that picking winners and losers based on such biases sells the U.S. short.

Data quoted is past performance and current performance may be lower or higher. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.Risk Factors: The value of the Fund's shares will change, and you could lose money on your investment. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Investing in companies involved in one specified sector may be more risky and volatile than an investment with greater diversification. Investing in the energy sector can be riskier than other types of investment activities because of a range of factors, including price fluctuation caused by real and perceived inflationary trends and political developments, and the cost assumed by energy companies in complying with environmental safety regulations. These and other risks are more fully describe in the fund's prospectus. Not all funds or fund classes may be offered at all broker/ dealers.Index Description: S&P 1500 Energy Sector is an unmanaged index comprised of securities that represent the energy sector of the stock market. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.Performance results for some funds may include the effect of expense reduction arrangements. If those arrangements had not been in place, the performance results would have been lower.High recent returns are attributable, in part, to unusually favorable market conditions and may not be repeated or consistently achieved in the future.Fee Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement: Through April 30, 2018, Ivy Investment Management Company (IICO), the Portfolio’s investment manager, Ivy Distributors, Inc. (IDI), the Portfolio’s distributor, and / or Waddell & Reed Services Company, doing business as WI Services Company (WISC), the Portfolio’s transfer agent, have contractually agreed to reimburse sufficient management fees, 12b-1 fees and / or shareholder servicing fees to cap the total annual ordinary portfolio operating expenses at 1.13%. Prior to that date, the expense limitation may not be terminated by WRIMCO, Waddell & Reed, WISC or the Board of Trustees.Pricing: All prices and year-to-date returns are based on closing quotes unless noted, as supplied to the NASDAQ by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. YTD Prices can be updated 3 to 4 hours after the Daily Pricing information which can result in mismatching data.Style Analysis: The Morningstar Style Box reveals a fund's investment style. For equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). For fixed-income funds, the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bond's effective duration. Morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis (e.g., quarterly). In compiling credit rating information, Morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs): Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones. If two NRSROs have rated a security, fund companies are to report the lowest rating; if three or more NRSROs have rated the same security differently, fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle. For example, if NRSRO X rates a security AA-, NRSRO Y rates the same security an A and NRSRO Z rates it a BBB+, the fund company should use the credit rating of 'A' in its reporting to Morningstar. PLEASE NOTE: Morningstar, Inc. is not itself an NRSRO nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund. An NRSRO rating on a fixed-income security can change from time-to-time. For credit quality, Morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weighted-average credit quality. The weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading NRSRO. Bond funds are assigned a style box placement of "low", "medium", or "high" based on their average credit quality. Funds with a low credit quality are those whose weighted-average credit quality is determined to be less than "BBB-"; medium are those less than "AA-", but greater or equal to "BBB-"; and high are those with a weighted-average credit quality of "AA-" or higher. When classifying a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates (as determined by Morningstar's analysis of actual historical default rates). Morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve. For interest-rate sensitivity, Morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBI), which is currently three years. The classification of Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between 25% to 75% of MCBI's average effective duration; funds whose average effective duration is between 75% to 125% of the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those that are at 125% or greater of the average effective duration of the MCBI will be classified as Extensive. For municipal bond funds, Morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. In these cases static breakpoints are utilized. These breakpoints are as follows: (i) Limited: 4.5 years or less; (ii) Moderate: more than 4.5 years but less than 7 years; and (iii) Extensive: more than 7 years. In addition, for non-US taxable and non-US domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used: (i) Limited: less than or equal to 3.5 years; (ii) Moderate: greater than 3.5 and less than equal to 6 years; (iii) Extensive: greater than 6 years.Unsubsidized yields reflect what the yield would have been without the effect of reimbursements and waivers. The adviser and its affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees (including, but not limited to, distribution and service (12b-1) fees) and reimburse certain expenses. There is no guarantee that the fund will avoid a negative yield. Such undertaking may be amended or withdrawn at any time. 12-Month Trailing Distribution Yield: at NAV refers to the 12-month historical cash flow paid over the past 12 months in dividends, divided by the past months ending NAV. Alpha, Beta, R-Squared, Standard Deviation, Sharpe Ratio and Capture Ratio are 5 year statistics. Alpha is a measure of a fund's actual returns and expected performance, given its level of risk (as measured by beta). Beta reflects the sensitivity of the fund's return to fluctuations in the market index. R-squared indicates how much of a fund's fluctuations were attributable to movements in the fund's benchmark. Standard deviation is a measure of how volatile a fund's returns are. Sharpe ratio is a measure of a fund's risk-adjusted performance. Capture ratio reflects the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance, and does not include the effects of sales charges. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.  © 2017 Morningstar, Inc.
