Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.

What does Fanhua do?


	Fanhua Inc. is a leading independent online-to-offline ("O2O") financial services provider. Through our online platforms and offline sales and service network, we offer a wide variety of financial products and services to individuals and businesses including property and casualty and life insurance products, wealth management products, and consumer finance services. We also provide insurance claims adjusting services, such as damage assessments, surveys, authentications and loss estimations, as well as value-added services, such as emergency assistance

	With 280,916 sales agents and representatives, 1,241 claims adjustors and 959 sales and service outlets operating in 29 provinces as of March 31, 2017, our distribution and service network reaches some of China's most economically developed regions and some of the most affluent cities in China, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen.




How and when was Fanhua established?


	In 1998, our founders, Mr. Yinan Hu, our current board chairman and Mr. Qiuping Lai, our current president, formed two PRC companies, Guangzhou Nanyun Car Rental Services Co., Ltd. and Guangdong Nanfeng Automobile Association Co., Ltd., initially to provide automobile-related services, such as car rental and emergency services. In 1999, we began distributing automobile insurance products on an ancillary basis. In 2001, our founders transferred their interests in the two PRC companies to China United Financial Services Holdings Ltd, or China United Financial Services, a British Virgin Islands company, as part of a series of transactions in which Cathay Capital Group, a private equity group, made an investment by subscribing for 40% of the equity interests in China United Financial Services.

	As part of its corporate restructuring to facilitate international fundraising, China United Financial Services incorporated CISG Holdings Ltd., or CISG Holdings, a British Virgin Islands company, in June 2004 to be the holding company for its insurance agency and brokerage businesses and transferred to CISG holdings all of its rights and interests in several PRC insurance intermediary companies it then controlled. In September 2004, Cathay Capital Group subscribed for approximately 27.8% of the equity interests in CISG Holdings.

	In December 2005, an entity affiliated with CDH, a private equity firm, subscribe for approximately 26.4% of the equity interests in CISG Holdings.

	In anticipation of our initial public offering, we incorporated CNinsure Inc. in the Cayman Islands in April 2007. In July 2007, CNinsure Inc., on a 10,000-for-one basis, issued its ordinary shares to then the existing shareholders of CISG in exchange for all of the outstanding CISG shares. After this restructuring transaction, CNinsure became our ultimate holding company. In Dec. 6th, 2016, the Company changed its name from “CNinsure Inc.” to “Fanhua Inc.” and its ticker symbol from “ CISG” to “FANH” effective from the opening of market in Dec. 7th, 2016, US eastern time.




What kind of products and services does Fanhua provide?


	We provide P&C agency and brokerage business, life agency business and insurance claims adjusting services. Commissions and fees from P&C agency and brokerage business, life agency business and insurance claims adjusting services each accounted for 53.8%, 41.8% and 4.4% of our total commission and fee revenue for the first quarter of 2017.




What type of property and casualty Insurance products does Fanhua offer?


	Our main P&C insurance products are automobile insurance. In addition, we also offer other kind of P&C insurance products. The P&C insurance products we offer can be classified into the following categories:

Automobile Insurance
	Automobile insurance is the largest segment of property and casualty insurance in the PRC in terms of gross written premiums. We distribute both standard automobile insurance policies and supplemental policies, which we refer to as riders.

Individual Accident Insurance
	The individual accident insurance products we distribute generally provide a guaranteed benefit in the event of death or disability of the insured as a result of an accident, or a reimbursement of medical expenses to the insured in connection with an accident, during the coverage period, which usually is one year or a shorter period.

Commercial Property Insurance
	The commercial property insurance products we distribute include basic, comprehensive and all risk policies. Basic commercial property insurance policies generally cover damage to the insured property caused by fire, explosion and thunder and lightning. Comprehensive commercial property insurance policies generally cover damage to the insured property caused by fire, explosion and certain natural disasters.

Homeowner Insurance
	The homeowner insurance products we distribute are primarily home mortgage-based insurance policies. Home mortgage-based policies cover damage to mortgaged property caused by a number of standard risks such as fire, flood and explosion.

Cargo Insurance
	The cargo insurance products we distribute cover damage to or loss of goods in transit by sea, land or air.

Hull Insurance
	The hull insurance products we distribute cover vessels against losses, liabilities and expenses caused by natural calamities, negligence of crew members and marine accidents, as well as collision liability.

Liability Insurance
	The liability insurance products we distribute are primarily product liability and employer's liability insurance products. These products generally cover losses to third parties due to the misconduct or negligence of the insured party but exclude losses due to fraud or the willful misconduct of the insured party.

Construction Insurance
	The construction insurance products we distribute cover property damages and personal injury losses caused by natural disasters and accidents in connection with construction projects in China.




What type of the life insurance products does Fanhua offer?


	Due to constant product innovation by insurance companies, some of the insurance products we distribute combine features of one or more of the categories listed below.

	                      

Individual Whole Life Insurance
	The individual whole life insurance products we distribute provide insurance for the insured person's entire life in exchange for the periodic payment of fixed premiums over a pre-determined period, generally ranging from five to 20 years, or until the insured reaches a certain age. The face amount of the policy or, for some policies, the face amount plus accumulated interests is paid upon the death of the insured.

Individual Term Life Insurance
	The individual term life insurance products we distribute provide insurance for the insured for a specified time period or until the attainment of a certain age, in return for the periodic payment of fixed premiums over a pre-determined period, generally ranging from five to 20 years. Term life insurance policies generally expire without value if the insured survives the coverage period.

Individual Endowment Life Insurance
	The individual endowment products we distribute generally provide maturity benefits if the insured reaches specified age, and provide to a beneficiary designated by the insured guaranteed benefits upon the death of the insured within the coverage period. In return, the insured makes periodic payment of premiums over a pre-determined period, generally ranging from five to 25 years.

Individual Education Annuity
	The individual annuity products we distribute are primarily education related products. They provide annual benefit payments after the insured attains a certain age, e.g., 18, for a fixed time period, e.g., four years, and a lump payment at the end of the coverage period.

Universal Insurance
	We distribute certain universal insurance products that provide not only insurance coverage but also a minimum guaranteed return on the amount the insured puts into an individual investment account. In return the insured makes periodic payment of premiums over a pre-determined period.

Individual Health Insurance
	The individual health insurance products we distribute primarily consist of dread disease insurance products, which provide guaranteed benefits for specified dread diseases during the coverage period. In return, the insured makes periodic payment of premiums over a pre-determined period.

Group Life Insurance
	We distribute several group life insurance products, including group health insurance. These group products generally have a policy period of one year and require a single premium payment.




What type of the claims adjusting services does Fanhua offer?


	Fanhua began providing insurance claims adjusting services in 2008.

	We are headquartered in Guangzhou, China (27/F, Pearl River Tower, No.15 West Zhujiang Road, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510623, P.R. China)




How does Fanhua generate revenues?


	We received commissions from insurance companies for the distribution of insurance products, which are generally calculated as a percentage of premiums paid by our customers to the insurance companies. We also collect services fees from insurance companies for the provision of claims adjusting services, which are calculated based on the types of insurance involved. For services provided in connection with property and casualty insurance (other than marine cargo insurance and automobile insurance), our fees are calculated as a percentage of the recovered amount from insurance companies plus travel expenses. For services provided in connection with marine cargo insurance, our fees are charged primarily on an hourly basis and, in some cases, as a percentage of the amount recovered from insurance companies. For automobile insurance, our fees are generally fixed and the amounts collected are based on the types of services provided.




Who are Fanhua's insurance company partners?


	We partner with over 90 insurance companies as of March 31, 2017.

	Our board of directors has discretion as to whether to distribute dividends, subject to certain restrictions under Cayman Islands law, namely that our company may only pay dividends out of profits or share premium account, and provided always that in no circumstances may a dividend be paid if this would result in our company being unable to pay its debts due in the ordinary course of business. In addition, our shareholders may by ordinary resolution declare a dividend, but no dividend may exceed the amount recommended by our directors.

Zacks Rank:



 




Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
