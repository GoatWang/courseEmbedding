(NYSE:NMM) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Navios Maritime Partners LP: 3 Positive Pieces Of NewsJul.17.17 | About: Navios Maritime (NMM) Morningsidepark Value, special situations, energy, commodities, shipping, long onlySummaryThe International Maritime Organization delayed the implementation of the Ballast Water Management Convention two years. This spares three 20-plus-year-old Panamax from the scrap heap for another two years.Yang Ming, the counter-party on two well over market containership TCs, announced a $164 million USD equity offering. The offering increases the probability that YM will honor the TCs.Panamax spot rates and FFAs have turned upwards recently, reflecting a similar pattern to 2016. Capesize spot rates, however, are lagging the Panamax bounce.Navios Maritime Partners is scheduled to close on the acquisition of two Panamax and three Capesize vessels during Q3, increasing its earnings base.Navios Maritime Partners LP (NMM), a publicly traded subsidiary of general partner Navios Maritime Holdings Inc (NYSE:NM) and an affiliate of Navios Maritime Acquisition Corporation (NYSE:NNA), received some good news over the last week as the International Maritime Organization delayed the implementation of the Ballast Water Management Convention and Yang Ming, the counter-party on two well over the market containership TCs announced a $164 million USD equity raise to shore up its balance sheet. Ballast Water Management Convention Per Compass Maritime, the International Maritime Organization delayed the implementation of its Ballast Water Management Convention by two years to 2019. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) announced this week that they would delay the deadline for the implementation of ballast water treatments systems on existing ships until the first statutory dry docking survey after 2019. Under the original version of the convention, owners of existing ships would be obligated to fit the equipment at the first special survey after September of 2017. New ships with keel laying after September this year, however, will have to be built with ballast water treatments systems. Owners of Vintage ships 15+years old have second thoughts about selling or scrapping their ships since the cost of dry docking will be considerably less without the requirement to install the ballast water treatment systems.
 NMM owns three Panamax vessels that range in age from 20 to 23 years. Due to their advanced age, these vessels were likely candidates for the scrap yard if the Convention went into force at the original September 7, 2017 date. With the postponement of the implementation of the Convention, NMM will likely keep the vessels in service for an additional two years if Panamax rates remain at or above current levels. Assuming 95% percent utilization rates (reflecting the vessels advanced age), $10k average TCE rates, and $6k/day OpEx (higher than NMM's average for Dry Bulk vessels but reasonable level for older vessels that may need to complete a Special Survey during the next two years), the Convention postponement results in approximately $4.15 million increase in cash flow from operations over what would have reasonably been expected. Not a game changer but definitely a piece of positive financial news for NMM. Yang Ming Equity Raise As discussed in this prior article, Yang Ming is the counter-party on two containership TCs with rates of $34,266/day (net of commissions) that have approximately 11 and 13 months remaining to expiration as of July 17th, 2017. The TCs are well over market and Yang Ming had suffered significant losses during 2016 as containership rates collapsed due to overbuilding. Aggressive scrapping during 2016 and early 2017 reduced the fleet growth rate below the growth in demand (read pages 21 - 23 of NMM's Q1 Presentation) and Containership rates recovered to levels at or slightly above operating expenses during 2017. The following financial tables are from the Financial Times website and provide Yang Ming's Cash Flow results for Q1 2017 and prior quarters for comparison purposes. The USD/Taiwanese Dollar exchange rate is 1/30.309 as of July 17th. As illustrated in the table, Yang Ming's Cash Flow From Operations improved dramatically during Q1. Yang Ming's Balance Sheet is still burdened with high debt levels relative to its fleet size, but the recently announced $164 million USD equity offering should provide sufficient liquidity during the next 13 months for Yang Ming to fulfill its obligations under its TCs with NMM (barring an worldwide economic event which results in a decline in containership demand).

The rate action is so far mirroring the pattern from the 2nd half of 2016 but at a higher starting point, which is good news. Capesize spot rates, however, are lagging behind Panamax and functioning as a drag on the BDI. If Capesize rates begin to track the increase in Panamax rates, it will act as a positive catalyst for NMM's stock price. NMM is due to take delivery on three secondhand Panamax and two secondhand Capesize vessels during Q3. The increase in fleet size will help NMM offset the decline in earnings power that will occur during 2018 as the Yang Ming contracts roll off.

Dark web markets AlphaBay & Hansa shut down in massive global operation
23 Июля 2017


We first caught wind of a potential AlphaBay shut down last week when dark web punters took to Twitter and Reddit to complain about their lack of access and in some cases about Bitcoins that they have been locked away from.It allowed users to purchase or sell drugs, guns, stolen user data, and other illegal goods.As part of the operation, Dutch police took control of Hansa after it was seized in June.Sessions added that USA security groups had attributed a number of drug-related deaths to substances sold via the sites."This is likely one of the most important criminal investigations of this entire year", Sessions said.AlphaBay was shut down following the arrest of its owner, Alexandre Cazes aka Alpha02 and Admin, a Canadian national who was living in Thailand.AlphaBay before and after the website shutdown after a law-enforcement crackdown.He also said that law enforcement was working with colleagues in the Netherlands who had taken down Hansa Market, another dark web marketplace.

The US Department of Justice announced on Thursday that AlphaBay, the world's largest online black market, was seized and shut down after its creator was arrested in Thailand on July 5.According to documents released by the DOJ, Cazes was using his computer and logged into AlphaBay under his administrator account at the time of his arrest.AlphaBay was considered to be the largest criminal marketplace on the Dark Web, with 200,000 users and 40,000 sellers at its height and an estimated $1bn in transactions going through the site - in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin - since it was set up in 2014.Sessions said the Justice Department has identified "several Americans" who died after overdosing on drugs bought on the AlphaBay marketplace.AlphaWeb operated much like any legitimate e-commerce site, including having a public relations manager, security administrator and "scam watchers", according to court documents.By comparison, the marketplace's scope dwarfed the former largest illegal dark web exchange called the Silk Road, which was taken down in 2013 and had about 14,000 listings.He was found to have possessed millions of dollars in cryptocurrency and luxury assets around the world, including expensive vehicles, residences and a hotel in Thailand. There were more than 250,000 listings for drugs and toxic chemicals, Sessions said.The operation to take down the marketplaces involved collaboration from Thailand, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Lithuania, Canada, the United Kingdom and Europol, which officials touched on as a positive sign for the future of worldwide cybercrime actions.
