Santa Teresa Village Shopping Center Acquired by Maryland-based REIT

Cassidy Turley, along with Kidder Matthews representatives, arranged the transaction on the buyer’s behalf, while the seller was advised by Prime Commercial. The per-square-foot rate that Retail Opportunity Corp. paid for the complex is approximately $250.

The Santa Teresa Village Shopping Center in San Jose recently traded hands in one of the largest transactions involving neighborhood shopping centers in the Bay Area this year. Maryland-based Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. was the buyer, while the former owner is Santa Teresa Village LLC—an entity created by local contractor Barry Swenson Builder. The value of the transaction was a reported $31.6 million, according to the San Jose Business Journal.
Santa Teresa Village Shopping Center is a 124,792-square-foot retail property currently anchored by a Nob Hill Foods and Ace Hardware. The shopping venue has a low vacancy rate of around five percent.
Cassidy Turley, along with Kidder Matthews representatives, arranged the transaction on the buyer’s behalf, while the seller was advised by Prime Commercial. The per-square-foot rate that Retail Opportunity Corp. paid for the complex is approximately $250. The Maryland REIT’s offer immediately convinced Barry Swenson Builder executives to finalize the sale.
The San Jose area is set to benefit from the housing market’s recovery, as this will have immediate effects in the demand for retail space. The deal in question is a perfect example of new investors being attracted to the commercial market in order to make sure that they can be part of the upward trend.
Retail Opportunity Investment Corp. chose the Santa Teresa Village Shopping Center in concordance with its criteria for new acquisitions. The REIT seeks properties mainly in large metro areas of the Western and Eastern U.S. that are mostly neighborhood and community shopping spots, anchored by a major grocer and located in areas where the average household income rests in the upper percentile of the market.

Holiday Village Shopping Center Remodel 
The smaller building currently in the Holiday Village Shopping Center parking lot will be remodeled to attract new businesses and enhance the curb appeal. This building will be revamped with more glazing, metal panels, and wood accents to go along with the revitalization of Brooks Street.
A proposed new entrance on the Bow Street side of the Holiday Village Shopping Center may follow the direction for the parking lot side. To attract new tenants and shoppers the improvements would be to the facade as well as wayfinding and creation of a more visible entrance.

Aurora-based Optimus One LLC has recently purchased the SouthPark Village shopping center in Holly Springs. According to the Triangle Business Journal, SouthPark Village Investments I of Atlanta, which is led by Philip E. Stephens, sold the property for $11 million. 
Newmark Grubb Knight Frank’s Southeast Capital Group, led by Whitney Knoll, Mark Hallis and Jason Archer of Atlanta, brokered the transaction on behalf of the seller.
Located at the intersection of the N.C. 55 Bypass and Avent Ferry Road, the approximately 82,000-square-foot retail center was 98 percent leased at the time of sale. Harris Teeter, the Fiesta Mexicana restaurant, Yopop, Great Clips, Curves, Carolina Family Vision, Go Realty and China Uno are among the property’s tenants. 
In other news, the same source reports that New York-based life insurance giant MetLife has leased the 116,300-square-foot Danbury Hall office building at the Imperial Center business park in Durham for two and a half years. The facility would house 250 information technology employees.
The company is also considering a deal with Highwoods Properties to build a new facility for its global technology and operations campus on Weston Parkway in Cary. In March, MetLife announced it would be opening two new hub campuses in Cary and Charlotte that would create a combined 2,600 jobs in North Carolina.
