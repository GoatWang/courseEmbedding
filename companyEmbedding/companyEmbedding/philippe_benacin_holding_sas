GENERAL
 
This proxy statement is furnished by the
board of directors of our company, Inter Parfums, Inc., a Delaware corporation, with offices located at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York,
New York 10176, in connection with the solicitation of proxies to be used at the annual meeting of our shareholders being held
on September 8, 2014 and at any adjournments of the annual meeting. For purposes of this proxy statement, unless the context otherwise
indicates, the terms the “company,” “us” or “our” refer to Inter Parfums, Inc.
 
This proxy statement will be mailed to shareholders
beginning approximately August 5, 2014. If a proxy in the accompanying form is properly executed and returned, then the shares
represented by the proxy will be voted as instructed on the proxy. Any shareholder giving a proxy may revoke it at any time before
it is voted by providing written notice of revocation to the company’s Secretary or by a shareholder voting in person at
the annual meeting.
 
All properly executed proxies received prior
to the annual meeting will be voted at the annual meeting in accordance with the instructions marked on the proxy or as otherwise
stated in the proxy. Unless instructions to the contrary are indicated, proxies will be voted
 

●FOR the election of the nine (9) directors referred to
in this proxy statement

 

●FOR the advisory resolution to approve executive compensation.
 
In addition, the persons holding the proxies
will consider and vote upon such other business as may properly come before the annual meeting or any adjournments of the annual
meeting.
 
A copy of the company’s annual report
for fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, which contains financial statements audited by the company’s independent registered
public accounting firm, is being mailed to the company’s shareholders along with this proxy statement.

We will bear the cost of preparing, assembling
and mailing this notice of meeting, proxy statement, proxy and the enclosed annual report, as well as maintaining our internet
website where you can obtain copies of this proxy statement and annual report to shareholders. In addition to solicitation of the
proxies by use of the mails, some of our officers and regular employees, without extra remuneration, may solicit proxies personally
or by telephone, telecopier or e-mail. We may also request brokerage houses, nominees, custodians and fiduciaries to forward soliciting
material to the beneficial owners of our common stock. We will reimburse these persons for their expenses in forwarding soliciting
material.
 
VOTING SECURITIES AND
PRINCIPAL HOLDERS THEREOF
 
Our board of directors fixed the close of
business on July 28, 2014 as the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the annual
meeting. Only holders of our common stock on the record date will be able to vote at the annual meeting.
 
As of July 8, 2014, 30,938,648 shares of
our common stock were outstanding. Each share of our common stock will entitle the holder of such share to one vote. None of the
company’s shareholders have cumulative voting rights. Holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to vote on all matters.
We also have 1,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock, $.001 par value per share, none of which are outstanding.
 
The holders of a majority of the total number
of outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote must be present in person or by proxy to constitute the necessary quorum
for any business to be transacted at the annual meeting. Properly executed proxies marked “abstain,” as well as proxies
held in street name by brokers that are not voted on all proposals to come before the annual meeting (“broker non-votes”),
will be considered “present” for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved at the annual meeting.
 
The nine (9) nominees to our board of directors
receiving the greatest number of votes cast at the annual meeting in person or by proxy shall be elected. Consequently, any shares
of our common stock present in person or by proxy at the annual meeting, but not voted for any reason will have no impact in the
election of our board of directors. With respect to the advisory proposal to approve the compensation of our named executive officers,
the favorable vote of a majority of the shares of our common stock present or represented at the annual meeting is required for
approval.
 
Other matters that may be submitted to our
shareholders for a vote at the annual meeting, if any, will require the favorable vote of a majority of the shares of our common
stock present or represented at the annual meeting for approval, unless we advise you otherwise. If any matter proposed at the
annual meeting must receive a specific percentage of favorable votes for approval, then abstentions in respect of such proposal
are treated as present and entitled to vote under Delaware, law and therefore such abstentions have the effect of a vote against
such proposal. Broker non-votes in respect of any proposal are not counted for purposes of determining whether such proposal has
received the requisite approval.

Members of our management have been informed that Messrs. Jean
Madar and Philippe Benacin, the beneficial owners of our two largest shareholders, have a verbal agreement or understanding to
vote their shares in a like manner, and intend to vote in favor of all of the nominees for directors. Therefore, all of the nominees
are all likely to be elected. Also, members of our management have been informed that Messrs. Jean Madar and Philippe Benacin intend
to vote in favor of the other proposal, and it is likely that such proposal will be passed as recommended by our management.
 
We know of no business other than the proposals
discussed above that will be presented for consideration at the annual meeting. If any other matter is properly presented, then
it is the intention of the persons named in the enclosed proxy to vote in accordance with their best judgment.
 
The following table sets forth information,
as of July 8, 2014 with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock by (a) each person we know to be the beneficial
owner of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, (b) our executive officers and directors and (c) all of our directors
and officers as a group. As of July 8, 2014 we had 30,938,648 shares of common stock outstanding.

PROPOSAL NO. 1:
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
 
General
 
The members of our board of directors are
each elected with a plurality of votes cast in favor of their election for a one-year term or until their successors are elected
and qualify. With the exception of Philippe Benacin, the officers are elected annually by the directors and serve at the discretion
of the board of directors. There are no family relationships between executive officers or directors of our company.
 
On January 8, 2014 our company was advised
that one of our directors, Serge Rosinoer, passed away, and on the same day we notified Nasdaq OMX of such event. Prior to the
death of Mr. Rosinoer, we had nine (9) directors, with a majority of independent directors. As the result of the death of Mr. Rosinoer,
our company was not  in compliance with the requirement of the majority of independent directors rule, Nasdaq Rule 5605(b)(1).
However, our company intends to comply with the cure period stated in Rule 5605(b)(1)(A), to have a majority of independent directors
at this annual meeting of stockholders. The board of directors has nominated Mr. Michel Dyens to become an independent member of
the board of directors, and if he is elected at this meeting, then our company would now be in compliance with which would comply
with the majority of independent directors requirement.
 
Unless authority is withheld, the proxies
in the accompanying form will be voted in favor of the election of the nominees named above as directors. Although all of the nominees
have indicated their willingness to serve if elected, if at the time of the meeting any nominee is unable to or unwilling to serve,
then the shares represented by properly executed proxies will be voted at the discretion of the person named in the proxies for
another person designated by our board of directors.
 
Board of Directors
 
Our board of directors has the responsibility
for establishing broad corporate policies and for the overall performance of our Company. Although certain directors are not involved
in day-to-day operating details, members of the board of directors are kept informed of our business by various reports and documents
made available to them. Our board of directors held 19 meetings (or executed consents in lieu thereof), including meetings of committees
of the full board of directors during 2013 (including the last regular board meeting of 2013 held during January 2014), and except
for Mr. Rosinoer, all of the directors attended at least 75% of the meetings (or executed consents in lieu thereof) of the full
board of directors and committees of which they were a member. Our board of directors presently consists of eight (8) directors.
 
 

shares held directly or indirectly, and
options to purchase 187,800 shares.

We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct
that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, as well
as other persons performing similar functions, and we agree to provide to any person without charge, upon request, a copy of our
Code of Business Conduct. Any person who requests a copy of our Code of Business Conduct should provide their name and address
in writing to: Inter Parfums, Inc., 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10176, Att.: Shareholder Relations. In addition, our Code of
Conduct is also maintained on our website, at www.interparfumsinc.com.
 
During 2013, our board of directors had
the following standing committees:
 

·Audit Committee – The Audit Committee has the sole authority and is directly responsible for, the appointment, compensation
and oversight of the work of the independent accountants employed by our company which prepare or issue an audit report for our
company. During 2013, the Audit Committee consisted of Messrs. Heilbronn, Levy and Choël.
 
The Company does not have an “audit
committee financial expert” within the definition of the applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules. First, finding
qualified nominees to serve as a director of a public company without substantial financial resources has been challenging. Second,
despite the applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rule which states that being named as the audit committee financial expert
does not impose any greater duty, obligation or liability, the Company has been met with resistance from both present and former
directors to being named as such primarily due to potential additional personal liability.
 
However, as the result of the background,
education and experience of the members of the Audit Committee, our board of directors believes that such committee members are
fully qualified to fulfill their obligations as members of the Audit Committee.
 

·Executive Compensation and Stock Option Committee – The Executive Compensation and Stock Option Committee oversees
                                                                                                             the compensation of our company’s executives and administers our company’s stock option plans. During 2013, the
                                                                                                             members of such committee consisted of Messrs. Heilbronn, Levy and Choël. The charter of the Executive Compensation
                                                                                                             and Stock Option Committee is
                                                                                                             posted on our company’s website.
 

·Nominating Committee – The members of such committee consist of Messrs. Heilbronn, Levy and Choël. The purpose of
the Nominating Committee is to determine and recommend qualified persons to the Board of Directors who will be put forth as management's
slate of directors for vote of the Corporation's stockholders, as well as to fill vacancies in the Board of Directors. The charter
of the Nominating Committee is posted on our company’s website.

Director Independence
 
The following are our existing directors
who are “independent directors” within the applicable rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market: Francois Heilbronn, Jean Levy.
Robert Bensoussan-Torres and Patrick Choël. In addition, Michel Dyens is also a nominee for director, and he is independent
within the applicable rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market.
 
We follow and comply with the independent
director definitions as provided by The Nasdaq Stock Market rules in determining the independence of our directors, which are posted
on our company’s website. In addition, such rules are also available on The Nasdaq Stock Market’s website. In addition,
The Nasdaq Stock Market maintains more stringent rules relating to director independence for the members of our Audit Committee,
and the members of our Audit Committee, Messrs. Heilbronn, Levy and Choël, are independent within the meaning of those rules.
 
On January 8, 2014 our company was advised
that one of our directors, Serge Rosinoer, passed away, and on the same day we notified Nasdaq OMX of such event. Prior to the
death of Mr. Rosinoer, we had nine (9) directors, with a majority of independent directors. As the result of the death of Mr. Rosinoer,
our company was not  in compliance with the requirement of the majority of independent directors rule, Nasdaq Rule 5605(b)(1).
However, our company intends to comply with the cure period stated in Rule 5605(b)(1)(A), to have a majority of independent directors
at this annual meeting of stockholders by the election of Michel Dyens to the board of directors.
 
Procedures for Approval of Related Person Transactions

 
Transactions between related persons, such
as between an executive officer or director and our company, or any company or person controlled by such officer or director, are
required to be approved by our Audit Committee of our board of directors. Our Audit Committee Charter contains such explicit authority,
as required by the applicable rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market.
 
Board Leadership Structure and Risk Management
 
For more than the past ten (10) years, Jean
Madar has held the positions of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of our company. Almost since inception,
Mr. Madar has been allocated the responsibility of overseeing our United States operations and the operation of Inter Parfums,
Inc., as a public company. Philippe Benacin, as Chief Executive Officer of Interparfums SA, has been allocated the responsibility
of overseeing our European operations and its operation as a public company in France. In addition, Mr. Benacin is also the Vice
Chairman of the Board of Directors of our company. Our board of directors is comfortable with this approach, as the two largest
stockholders of our company are also directly responsible for the operations of our company’s two operating segments. Accordingly,
our board of directors does not have a “Lead Director,” a non-management director who controls the meetings of our
board of directors.
 
Our board of directors manages risk by (i)
review of period operating reports and discussions with management; (ii) approval of executive compensation incentive plans through
its committee, the Executive Compensation and Stock Option Committee; (iii) approval of related party transactions through its
committee, the Audit Committee; and (iv) approval of material transactions not in the ordinary course of business. Since our inception,
we have never been the subject of any material product liability claims, and we have had no recent material property damage claims.

Further, we periodically enter into foreign
currency forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure related to receivables denominated in a foreign currency and to manage risks
related to future sales expected to be denominated in a foreign currency. We enter into these exchange contracts for periods consistent
with our identified exposures. The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements
on the receivables and cash flows of Interparfums SA, our French subsidiary, whose functional currency is the Euro. All foreign
currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial
institutions, which are rated as strong investment grade.
 
In addition, we mitigate interest rate risk
by continually monitoring interest rates, and then determining whether fixed interest rates should be swapped for floating rate
debt, or if floating rate debt should be swapped for fixed rate debt.
 
Business Experience 
 
The following sets forth biographical information
as to the business experience of each executive officer and director of our Company, as well as first time director nominee, Michel
Dyens, for at least the past five years.
 
Board of Directors
 
Jean Madar
 
Jean Madar, age 53, a Director, has been
the Chairman of the Board since our company’s inception, and is a co-founder of our company with Mr. Philippe Benacin. From
inception until December 1993 he was the President of our company; in January 1994 he became Director General of Interparfums SA,
our company’s subsidiary; and in January 1997 he became Chief Executive Officer of our company. Mr. Madar was previously
the managing director of Interparfums SA, from September 1983 until June 1985. At such subsidiary, he had the responsibility of
overseeing the marketing operations of its foreign distribution, including market research analysis and actual marketing campaigns.
Mr. Madar graduated from The French University for Economic and Commercial Sciences (ESSEC) in 1983. We believe that Mr. Madar’s
skills in guiding, leading and determining the strategic direction of our company since its inception together with Mr. Benacin,
in addition to his contacts in the fragrance and cosmetic industry, render him qualified to serve as a member of our board of directors.

Philippe Benacin
 
Mr. Benacin, age 55, a Director, is President
of our Company and the Chief Executive Officer of Interparfums SA, has been the Vice Chairman of the Board since September 1991,
and is a co-founder of our company with Mr. Madar. He was elected the Executive Vice President in September 1991, Senior Vice President
in April 1993, and President of the Company in January 1994. In addition, he has been the Chief Executive Officer of Interparfums
SA for more than the past five years. Mr. Benacin graduated from The French University for Economic and Commercial Sciences (ESSEC)
in 1983. In June 2014 Mr. Benacin was elected as a member of the Supervisory Board of Vivendi, and Chairman of its Corporate Governance,
Nominations and Remuneration Committee. We believe that Mr. Benacin’s skills in guiding, leading and determining the strategic
direction of our company since its inception together with Mr. Madar, in addition to his contacts in the fragrance and cosmetic
industry, render him qualified to serve as a member of our board of directors.  
 
Russell Greenberg
 
Mr. Greenberg, age 57, the Chief Financial
Officer, was Vice-President, Finance when he joined the Company in June 1992; became Executive Vice President in April 1993; and
was appointed to our board of directors in February 1995. He is a certified public accountant licensed in the State of New York,
and is a member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants.
After graduating from The Ohio State University in 1980, he was employed in public accounting until he joined our company in June
1992. We believe that Mr. Greenberg’s skills in accounting and tax, as well as his knowledge of the fragrance industry and
our Company’s operations, render him qualified to serve as a member of our board of directors.  
 
Philippe Santi
 
Philippe Santi, age 52 and a Director since
December 1999, is the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Interparfums SA. Mr. Santi, who is a Certified Accountant
and Statutory Auditor in France, has been the Chief Financial Officer of Interparfums SA since February 1995. Prior to February
1995, Mr. Santi was the Chief Financial Officer for Stryker France and an Audit Manager for Ernst and Young. We believe that Mr.
Santi’s skills in accounting and tax, as well as his knowledge of the fragrance industry and our Company’s European
operations, render him qualified to serve as a member of our board of directors.  
 
Francois Heilbronn
 
Mr. Heilbronn, age 53, a Director since
1988, an independent director and a member of the Audit Committee, Nominating Committee and the Executive Compensation and Stock
Option Committee, is a graduate of Harvard Business School with a Master of Business Administration degree and is currently the
managing partner of the consulting firm of M.M. Friedrich, Heilbronn & Fiszer. He was formerly employed by The Boston Consulting
Group, Inc. from 1988 through 1992 as a manager. Mr. Heilbronn graduated from Institut d' Etudes Politiques de Paris in June 1983.
From 1984 to 1986, he worked as a financial analyst for Lazard Freres & Co.
In addition, during 2009 Mr. Heilbronn became an Associate
Professor in Business Strategy at Sciences Po, Paris, France. As the result of his business and financial acumen, as well as his
experience as managing partner of a business consulting firm in the area of mergers and acquisitions of large international companies
in retail, consumer goods and consumer services throughout the world, we believe Mr. Heilbronn is qualified to serve as a member
of our board of directors.

Jean Levy
 
Jean Levy, age 81, a Director since August
1996, an independent director and a member of the Audit Committee, Nominating Committee and the Executive Compensation and Stock
Option Committee, worked for twenty-seven years at L'Oreal, and was the President and Chief Executive Officer of Cosmair, the exclusive
United States licensee of L'Oreal, from 1983 through June 1987. In addition, he is the former President and Chief Executive Officer
of Sanofi Beaute (France). For more than the past five years, Mr. Levy has been an independent advisor as well as a consultant
for economic development to local governments in France. A graduate of l'Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris, he also attended
Yale Graduate School and was a recipient of a Fulbright Scholarship. He was also a Professor at l'Institut d'Etudes Politiques
de Paris. He was formerly a director of Zannier Group and Escada Beaute Worldwide and Rallye, S.A. In addition, Mr. Levy was also
a director (Chairman of the Board until October 2001) of Financière d'Or, and its subsidiary, Histoire d'Or which is in
the retail jewelry business. Mr. Levy was formerly a consultant to Ernst & Young, Paris through 2004. He is currently a board
member of Price Minister, an internet based retailer located in Paris. Due to Mr. Levy having over thirty years’ experience
as an executive officer, including more than ten years as President and Chief Executive Officer of well-known cosmetic companies
such as Cosmair and Sanofi Beaute (France), we believe he is qualified to serve as a member of our board of directors.
 
Robert Bensoussan
 
Robert Bensoussan, age 56, has been a Director
since March 1997, and also is an independent director. Mr. Bensoussan is the co-founder of Sirius Equity, a retail and branded
luxury goods investment company. Since 2008, Sirius has invested in UK shoe and clothing retailer LK Bennett, Italian sportswear

Choo Ltd (from 2001 to 2011), a privately held luxury shoe wholesaler and retailer. We believe Mr. Bensoussan is qualified to serve
as a member of our board of directors due to his business and financial acumen, as well as his experience in the retail and branded
luxury goods market.

Patrick Choël
 
Mr. Choël, age 70, was appointed to
the board of directors in June 2006 as an independent director, and is a member of the Audit Committee, Nominating Committee and
the Executive Compensation and Stock Option Committee. Mr. Choël is a director of our majority-owned subsidiary, Interparfums
SA, and Modellabs, both publicly held companies, and Christian Dior and Guerlain, both privately held companies. He is also the

Guerlain, and Parfums Givenchy, among others. Prior to such time, for approximately 30 years, he worked at various executive positions
at Unilever, including President and CEO of Elida Fabergé France and President and CEO of Chesebrough Pond’s USA.
We believe that Mr. Choël, who has previously worked as President and Chief Executive Officer of two divisions of LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A., which included such well-known brands as Parfums Christian Dior, Guerlain, and Parfums Givenchy, is
qualified to serve as a member of our board of directors.

With headquarters in New York and Paris, Michel Dyens & Co. is a leading independent investment banking firm focused on mergers

believe Mr. Dyens is qualified to serve as a member of our board of directors due to his knowledge of our company’s luxury
business, his business and financial acumen, as well as his experience in the luxury goods market.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership
Reporting Compliance
 
Based solely upon a review of Forms 3, 4
and 5 and any amendments to such forms furnished to us, and written representations from various reporting persons furnished to
us, we are not aware of any reporting person who has failed to file the reports required to be filed under Section 16(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on a timely basis.
 
Executive Compensation
 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
 
General
 
The executive compensation and stock option
committee of our board of directors is comprised entirely of independent directors and oversees all elements of compensation (base
salary, annual bonus, long-term incentives and perquisites) of our company’s executive officers and administers our company’s
stock option plans, other than the non-employee directors stock option plan, which is self-executing.
 
The objectives of our compensation program
are designed to strike a balance between offering sufficient compensation to either retain existing or attract new executives on
the one hand, and maintaining compensation at reasonable levels on the other hand. We do not have the resources comparable to the
cosmetic giants in our industry, and, accordingly, cannot afford to pay excessive executive compensation. In furtherance of these
objectives, our executive compensation packages generally include a base salary, as well as annual incentives tied to individual
performance and long-term incentives tied to our operating performance.
 

12
 

 
Mr. Madar, the Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, takes the initiative after discussions with Mr. Russell Greenberg, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and
a Director, and recommends executive compensation levels for executives for United States operations. Mr. Benacin, the Chief Executive
Officer of Interparfums SA, takes the initiative after discussions with Philippe Santi, the Chief Financial Officer of Interparfums
SA, and recommends executive compensation levels for executives in European operations. The recommendations are presented to the
compensation committee for its consideration, and the compensation committee makes a final determination regarding salary adjustments
and annual award amounts to executives, including Jean Madar and Philippe Benacin. Mr. Madar the Chief Executive Officer is not
present during deliberations or determination of his executive compensation by the compensation committee. Further, Messrs. Madar
and Benacin, in addition to being executive officers and directors, are our largest beneficial shareholders, and therefore, their
interests are aligned with our shareholder base in keeping executive compensation at a reasonable level.
 
The compensation committee was pleased that
the most recent shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation held at our last annual meeting of shareholders in July 2013
overwhelmingly approved the compensation policies and decisions of the compensation committee. As such vote validated the compensation
policies and decisions of the compensation committee. The compensation committee has determined to continue its present compensation
policies in order to determine similar future decisions.
 
Our compensation committee believes that
individual executive compensation is at a level comparable with executives in other companies of similar size and stage of development
that operate in the fragrance industry and takes into account our company’s performance as well as our own strategic goals.
Further, the compensation committee believes that its present policies to date, with its emphasis on rewarding performance, has
served to focus the efforts of our executives, which in turn permitted our company to weather the storm of the recent recession
and put our company on track for a continued high rate of growth and profitability, which management believes will result in a
substantial increase in value to our shareholders.
 
Elements of Compensation
 
General
 
The compensation of our executive officers
is generally comprised of base salaries, annual cash bonuses and long-term equity incentive awards. In determining specific components
of compensation, the compensation committee considers individual performance, level of responsibility, skills and experience, other
compensation awards or arrangements and overall company performance. The compensation committee reviews and approves all elements
of compensation for all of our executive officers taking into consideration recommendations from the Chief Executive Officer of
our company and the Chief Executive Officer of Interparfums SA, as well as information regarding compensation levels at competitors
in our industry.
 
Our named executive officers have all been
with the company for more than the past ten (10) years, with Messrs. Madar and Benacin being founders of the company in 1985. As
Messrs. Madar and Greenberg for United States operations, and Benacin and Santi for European operations, are most familiar with
the individual performance, level of responsibility, skills and experience of each executive officer in their respective operating
segments, the compensation committee relies upon the information provided by such executive officers in determining individual
performance, level of responsibility, skills and experience of each executive officer.
 

13
 

 
The compensation committee views the competitive
market place very broadly, which would include executive officers from both public and privately held companies in general, including
fashion and beauty companies, but not limited to the “peer companies” contained in the corporate performance graph
contained in our annual report. Rather than tie the compensation committee’s determination of compensation proposals to any
specific peer companies, the members of our committee have used their business experience, judgment and knowledge to review the
executive compensation proposals recommended to them by Mr. Madar for United States operations and Benacin for European operations.
As such, compensation committee did not determine the need to “benchmark” of any material item of compensation or overall
compensation.
 
The members of the compensation committee
have extensive experience and business acumen and are well qualified in determining the appropriateness of executive compensation
levels. Mr. Heilbronn is a managing partner of a business consulting firm in the area of mergers and acquisitions of large international
companies in retail, consumer goods and consumer services throughout the world. Mr. Levy has over thirty years’ experience
as an executive officer, including more than ten years as President and Chief Executive Officer of well-known cosmetic companies
such as Cosmair and Sanofi Beaute (France). Mr. Choël, the final committee member, is presently a business consultant and
advisor, who previously worked as President and Chief Executive Officer of two divisions of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A.,
which included such well-known brands as Parfums Christian Dior, Guerlain, and Parfums Givenchy. Mr. Choël has also been President
and CEO of both Elida Fabergé France and Chesebrough Pond’s USA.
 
Base Salary
 
Base salaries for executive officers are
initially determined by evaluating the responsibilities of the position held and the experience of the individual, and by reference
to the competitive market place for executive talent. Base salaries for executive officers are reviewed on an annual basis, and
adjustments are determined by evaluating our operating performance, the performance of each executive officer, as well as whether
the nature of the responsibilities of the executive has changed.
 
As stated above, as Messrs. Madar and Greenberg
for United States operations, and Benacin and Santi for European operations, are most familiar with the individual performance,
level of responsibility, skills and experience of each executive officer in their respective segments, the committee relies upon
the information provided by such executive officers in determining individual performance, level of responsibility, skills and
experience of each executive officer.
 

14
 

 
For executive officers of United States
operations, the bulk of their annual compensation is in base salary. However, for executive officers of European operations base
salary comprises a smaller percentage of overall compensation. We have paid a lower percentage of overall compensation in the form
of base salary to executive officers of European operations for several years, principally because European operations historically
have had higher profitability than United States operations, and European operations are run differently from United States operations
by the Chief Executive Officer of European operations, Mr. Benacin. As the result of this historically higher profitability, European
operations have had the ability to pay higher bonus compensation in addition to base salary. As bonus compensation is and has historically
been discretionary, no targets were set in order to maintain flexibility. Further, if results of operations for European operations
were not satisfactory (again, no target amounts were set to maintain flexibility), then bonus compensation, as well as overall
compensation could be lowered without otherwise affecting base salary. Finally, by keeping annual bonus compensation at a higher
percentage of overall compensation and base salary at a lower percentage, our company benefits because the base amount for annual
salary adjustments would be smaller.
 
For 2013, each of Mr. Philippe Santi, the
Chief Financial Officer of Interparfums SA, and Mr. Frederic Garcia-Pelayo, Director of the Luxury and Fashion division, had their
based salaries increased upon the recommendation of Mr. Benacin, and received a base salary of €285,600, an increase (2.6%)
from €278,400 in 2012. These increases in base salary for 2013 were in line with the base salary increases also recommend
by Mr. Benacin for 2012 of 2.7% to €278,400. The Compensation Committee considered the recommendations of Mr. Benacin, as
well as the services performed for European operations by Messrs. Santi and Garcia-Pelayo.
 
With regard to Mr. Benacin, his base salary
remained constant for 2011, 2012 and 2013, at €391,200 per year. In view of the uncertainty of the status of the Burberry
license at the end of 2011 and beginning of 2012, which accounted for approximately 56% of net sales of Interparfums SA for 2011,
Mr. Benacin believed it to be prudent to recommend only a limited base salary increase to Messrs. Santi and Garcia-Pelayo and not
to increase his base salary. The compensation committee agreed with Mr. Benacin’s assessment of the uncertain business prospects
of Interparfums SA and his proposed disposition relating to base salary for Interparfums SA executive officers.
 
However, for 2014, in addition to his base
salary which was increased from €391,200 to €414,000, a 5.8% increase, Philippe Benacin Holding SAS, Mr. Benacin’s
personal holding company, will receive $250,000 for services rendered and to be rendered outside of the United States by Mr. Benacin
for the benefit of the Company’s United States operations, in his capacity as President of our company. Payment is being
made by the Company’s United States operations. A consulting agreement has been agreed in principle with Mr. Benacin’s
holding company, which provides for review on an annual basis of the amount of compensation payable to such company.
 
The compensation took into account the following
three salient factors in authorizing payment to Mr. Benacin’s holding company— services rendered to United States operations
for several years by Mr. Benacin in connection with licensing and distribution of international brands without any cash compensation
from United States operations, future international services to be performed by Mr. Benacin relating to licensing and distribution
of international brands for United States operations, as well as three years without any increase in his base salary.

A different approach is taken for United
States operations as that segment is smaller and less profitable. A more significant base salary is paid in order to attract and
retain employees with the skills and talents needed to run the operation with a lesser emphasis placed on bonuses. None of the
executive officers for United States operations have employment agreements, as we believe that having flexibility in structuring
annual base salary is a benefit, which permits us to act quickly to meet a changing economic environment.
 
For 2013, Andy Clarke, the President of
Inter Parfums USA, LLC, the largest subsidiary of the United States operations, did not have his base salary increased from the
$320,000 he received in 2012 and 2011. Beginning in 2012, in lieu of a base salary increase, Mr. Clarke was awarded a commission
on certain new sales that he was instrumental in bringing to our company. For 2013 and 2012, Mr. Clarke received commissions of
$306,200 and $248,224, respectively. For a detailed discussion of Mr. Clarke’s commission structure for both 2013 and 2012,
please see “Bonus Compensation/Annual Incentives”.
 
For 2013, Russell Greenberg, the Executive
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, received a $30,000 (6.25%) increase in his base salary, to $510,000, as compared to
the $23,000 (5%) increase in his base salary he received in 2012 from 2011. In connection with these increases in salary, the Compensation
Committee considered the following material factors in granting Mr. Greenberg his salary increase: his individual performance,
level of responsibility, skill and experience, as well as the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer.
 
For 2013, Mr. Madar, the Chief Executive
Officer, did not receive any increase in his base salary, which has remained at $380,000 since 2009. Mr. Madar also shared the
view of Mr. Benacin that in view of the uncertainty of the status of the Burberry license at the end of 2011 and beginning of 2012,
Mr. Madar determined not to recommend any increase in his base salary to the compensation committee. However, over the past 3 years,
net income of US operations has grown from a loss of ($200,000) in 2009 to a profit of $5.1 million in 2012. Accordingly, after
several years of no increase in his base salary, for 2013, in addition to his base salary which remained at $380,000, Jean Madar
Holding SAS, Mr. Madar’s personal holding company, received $250,000 for services rendered outside of the United States by
Mr. Madar in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer. A consulting agreement has been signed with Mr. Madar’s holding company,
which provides for review on an annual basis of the amount of compensation payable to such company. For 2014 both the base salary
of Mr. Madar as well as the consulting fee payable to his personal holding company will remain the same as they were for 2013.
In determining Mr. Madar’s base salary, as well as the consulting fee for 2014 being paid to Mr. Madar’s holding company,
the Committee took into account Mr. Madar’s leadership of our company in general, the increasing profitability of United
States operations over the past several years, and his services in assisting United States operations in acquiring three new fragrance
licenses during 2013.

Bonus Compensation/Annual Incentives
 
We have paid a higher percentage of overall
compensation in the form of bonus compensation to executive officers of European operations for several years, principally because
European operations historically have had higher profitability than United States operations. As the result of this historically
higher profitability, European operations have had the ability to pay higher bonus compensation in addition to base salary. As
bonus compensation is discretionary no targets were set in order to maintain flexibility. Further, if results of operations for
European operations were not satisfactory (again, no target amounts were set to maintain flexibility), then bonus compensation,
as well as overall compensation could be lowered without otherwise affecting base salary.
 
For 2013, Mr. Benacin, the chief decision
maker for European operations, proposed and the compensation committee concurred in the payment of bonus compensation of €78,000
to Mr. Benacin (approximately 20% of base salary), and €268,000 (approximately 96% of base salary) to each of Messrs. Santi
and Garcia- Pelayo. In addition to individual performance, level of responsibility, skill and experience other factors considered
by the Compensation Committee were the increased sales of European operation ongoing brands, Lavin, Montblanc and Jimmy Choo, as
well as the work with recently licensed European operation brands, Balmain, Repetto and Karl Lagerfeld. However, Mr. Benacin recommended
that his bonus compensation for 2013 be reduced to €78,000 (approximately 20% of base salary) from €254,500 which he
received for 2012 (approximately 65% of base salary), in order to offset in large part the new $250,000 in consulting fees he is
to receive in 2014 through his personal holding company, as discussed above. The difference in the bonus compensation from 2013
to 2012, €176,500, approximates $240,000 at current exchange rates. The Compensation Committee approved the bonus compensation
in tandem with the consulting agreement based upon services Mr. Benacin rendered to United States operations for several years
in connection with licensing and distribution of international brands without any cash compensation from United States operations,
future international services to be performed by Mr. Benacin relating to licensing and distribution of international brands for
United States operations, as well as three years without any increase in his base salary. The Compensation Committee also understands
that both Mr. Benacin and the Corporation will benefit from lower tax rates by having compensation taken in this form.
 
For 2012, Mr. Benacin, the chief decision
maker for European operations, proposed and the committee concurred in the payment of bonus compensation of € 254,500 to Mr.
Benacin (approximately 65% of base salary), and €258,000 (approximately 93% of base salary) to each of Messrs. Santi and Garcia-
Pelayo. Such bonus compensation exceeded prior bonus compensation as a percentage of base salary, and was given in recognition
of the services performed in connection with the resolution of the disposition of the Burberry license, as well as the record year
for sales and earnings of European operations. For 2011, bonus compensation was approximately equal to 72% of 2010 base salaries.
 
A different approach is taken for United
States operations as that segment is smaller and less profitable. A more significant base salary is paid in order to attract and
retain employees with the skills and talents needed to run the operation with a lesser emphasis placed on bonuses. Based upon the
recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer, for 2013, Mr. Greenberg received a discretionary cash bonus of $50,000, which was
the same amount he received in 2012. The Compensation Committee considered the following material factors in granting Mr. Greenberg
his 2013 bonus: his individual performance, level of responsibility, skill and experience, as well as the recommendation of the
Chief Executive Officer. The compensation committee authorized the bonus in 2012 in recognition for his services in connection
with the disposition of the Burberry license, as well as the record year for sales and earnings of our company.

For 2012, in lieu of a base salary increase,
Mr. Clarke was awarded a commission on certain new sales that he was instrumental in bringing to our company. The commission rate
was determined based on internal estimates of sales targets for the new business. For 2012, in determining the projected amount
of the commission portion of Mr. Clarke’s estimated compensation, the initial assumption was based upon internal net sales
projections of $30 million, which included $20 million for Anna Sui brand sales and $10 million for new secondary market distribution.
The commission rate of 0.8% of net sales would yield $240,000 based upon internal projections. However, net sales exceeded the
internal projections and his commission rate of 0.8% was based upon actual sales of $31.0 million, which yielded a total commission
of $248,224. As Mr. Clarke was instrumental in obtaining the Anna Sui license for the Company and obtaining this new secondary
market distribution, it was determined that such additional compensation was fair in view of his contribution to the Company’s
increase in sales.
 
For 2013, no changes were made to the commission
structure for Mr. Clarke. Actual net sales for both the Anna Sui brand and secondary market product sales aggregated approximately
$38.3 million, and therefore, based upon the commission rate discussed above, Mr. Clarke received a commission of $306,200 for
2013.
 
For 2013 and 2012, Mr. Clarke did not receive
a discretionary cash bonus. However, as discussed above, in lieu of an increase in base salary, Mr. Clarke received a commission
on sales of Anna Sui, in which he was instrumental in obtaining the business. The commission was based upon sales targets determined
after negotiation with the Chief Executive Officer. For 2012, the amount of Mr. Clarke’s commission under this plan was $248,224.
 
Mr. Madar, the Chief Executive Officer did
not receive any cash bonus for 2012, or for years 2011, 2010 and 2009. However, as discussed above under the heading “Base
Salary”, over the past 3 years, net income of US operations has grown from a loss of ($200,000) in 2009 to a profit of $5.1
million 2012. Accordingly, after several years with no increase in his base salary, for 2013, in addition to his base salary, Jean
Madar Holding SAS, his personal holding company, will receive $250,000 for services to be rendered outside of the United States
by Mr. Madar in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer. Also for 2013, any further bonus compensation for Mr. Madar would be at
the discretion of the compensation committee.
 
As required by French law, Interparfums
SA maintains its own profit sharing plan for all French employees who have completed three months of service, including executive
officers of our European operations other than Mr. Benacin, the Chief Executive Officer of Interparfums SA. Benefits are calculated
based upon a percentage of taxable income of Interparfums SA and allocated to employees based upon salary. The maximum amount payable
per year per employee is 25,000€, or approximately $34,000.
 

18
 

 
Calculation of the total annual benefits
contribution is made according to the following formula:
 
50% of (Interparfums SA net income, less 5% of shareholders’
equity without net income for the year) times a fraction, the numerator of which is wages, and the denominator of
which is net income before tax + wages + taxes (other than income tax) + valuation allowances + amortization expenses + interest
expenses.
 
Contribution to individual employees is
then made pro rata based upon their individual salaries for the year.
 
Long-Term Incentives
 
Stock Options. We link long-term
incentives with corporate performance through the grant of stock options. All options are granted with an exercise price equal
to the fair market value of the underlying shares of our common stock on the date of grant, and terminate on or shortly after severance
of the executive’s relationship with us. Unless the market price of our common stock increases, corporate executives will
have no tangible benefit. Thus, they are provided with the additional incentive to increase individual performance with the ultimate
goal of increasing our overall performance. We believe that enhanced executive incentives which result in increased corporate performance
tend to build company loyalty. As a general rule, the number of options granted is determined by several factors, but most importantly,
both individual and company operating results for the past year, as well as past option grants to such executives.
 
For executive officers of United States
operations and European operations, we typically grant nonqualified stock options with a term of 6 years that vest ratably of a
5-year period on a cumulative basis, so that the option will become fully exercisable at the beginning of the sixth year from the
date of grant. In addition, option grants to purchase shares of our majority-owned, French subsidiary, Interparfums SA have a term
of 6 years and vest 4 years after the date of grant. However, no options were granted by Interparfums SA to any executive officers
during 2012 and 2011.
 
We believe that the vesting period of these
options serve a dual purpose: 1. executives will not receive any benefit if they leave prior to such portion of the option vesting;
and 2. having a vesting period, matches the service period with the potential benefits of the option. Pursuant to our stock option
plan, non-qualified stock options granted to executives terminate immediately upon the executive’s termination of association
with our company. This termination provision coupled with a vesting period reduces benefits afforded to an executive when an executive
officer leaves our employ.
 
Over the past several years, as our company
has grown and the market price or our common stock has increased, Messrs. Madar and Benacin have realized substantial compensation
as the result of the exercise of their options. As the two executives most responsible for continued growth and success of our
company, the compensation committee believes the granting of options is an appropriate tool to tie a substantial portion of their
compensation to the success of our company and is completely warranted.
 

19
 

 
The actual compensation realized as the
result of the exercise of options in the past, as well as the future potential of such rewards, are powerful incentives for increased
individual performance and ultimately increased company performance. In view of the fact that the executive officers named above
contribute significantly to our profitable operations, the compensation committee believes the option grants are valid incentives
for these executive officers and are fair to our shareholders. Generally we grant options to executive officers in December of
each year.
 
In December for each of the years 2011-2013,
upon the recommendation of the company’s Chief Executive Officer, the compensation committee granted options to purchase
a total of 19,000 shares of our common stock to each of Jean Madar and Philippe Benacin at the fair market value on the date of
grant. Option grants to Messrs. Madar and Benacin were identical as each is the Chief Executive Officer of their respective operating
segments. Also in December for each of the years 2011-2013, the compensation committee granted options to purchase 25,000 shares
to Mr. Greenberg, the Chief Financial Officer, at the fair market value on the date of grant. The Compensation Committee determined
that the option grants for Messrs. Madar, Benacin and Greenberg, which have remained the same for years 2011-2012, were reasonable,
so based upon the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer, it determined to keep the option grants for such executive officers
at the same level for 2013.
 
In December 2013, options to purchase a
total of 5,000 shares were granted to Messrs. Santi and Garcia-Pelayo, which were the same amounts as the aggregate amount granted
in December 2012 and January 2013 to Messrs. Santi and Garcia-Pelayo. These amounts represent an increase as additional compensation
for their contribution to the efforts of the United States based operations, as compared with 2011, when options to purchase 3,000
shares were granted to Messrs. Santi and Garcia-Pelayo,.
 
Stock Appreciation Rights. Our 2004
stock option plan authorizes us to grant stock appreciation rights, or SARs. An SAR represents a right to receive the appreciation
in value, if any, of our common stock over the base value of the SAR. To date, we have not granted any SARs under the 2004 plan.
While the compensation committee currently does not plan to grant any SARs under our 2004 plan, it may choose to do so in the future
as part of a review of the executive compensation strategy. The Interparfums SA stock option plan does not have stock appreciate
rights.
 
Restricted Stock. We have not in
the past, and we do not have any future plans to grant restricted stock to our executive officers. However, while the compensation
committee currently does not plan to authorize any restricted stock plans, the compensation committee may choose to do so in the
future as part of a review of the executive compensation strategy.

Other Compensation
 
Mr. Benacin is the Chief Executive Officer
of Interparfums SA (European operations), as well as a founder of our company, and we believe we should recognize his responsibility,
skills and experience, as well as the results of the company. For 2013, Mr. Benacin received an automobile allowance of €10,800,
which is the same amount paid in 2012, 2011 and 2010.
 
No Stock Ownership Guidelines
 
We do not require any minimum level of stock
ownership by any of our executive officers. As stated above, Messrs. Madar and Benacin, are our largest beneficial shareholders,
which align their interests with our shareholder base in keeping executive compensation at a reasonable level.	
 
Retirement and Pension Plans 
 
We maintain a 401(k) plan for United States
operations. However, we do not match any contributions to such plan, as we have determined that base compensation together with
annual bonuses and stock option awards, are sufficient incentives to retain talented employees. Our European operations maintain
a pension plan for its employees as required by French law.
 
Compensation Committee Report
 
We have reviewed and discussed with management
the Compensation Discussion and Analysis provisions included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 31,
2013 and the proxy statement for the upcoming annual meeting of shareholders. Based on this review and discussion, we recommend
to the board of directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis referred to above be included in the Annual Report on Form
10-K as well as the proxy statement for the upcoming annual meeting of shareholders.

1 Amounts reflected under Option Awards represent the grant
date fair values in 2013, 2012 and 2011 based on the fair value of stock option awards using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The assumptions used in this model are detailed in Footnote 11 to the audited consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 and filed with the SEC.
 
2 As required by French law, Interparfums SA maintains its own
profit sharing plan for all French employees who have completed three months of service, including executive officers of our European
operations other than Mr. Benacin, the Chief Executive Officer of Interparfums SA Benefits are calculated based upon a percentage
of taxable income of Interparfums SA and are allocated to employees based upon salary. The maximum amount payable per year is 25,000
euro, or approximately $34,000.
 
Calculation of total annual benefits contribution is made according
to the following formula:
 
50% of (Interparfums SA net income, less 5% of shareholders’
equity without net income for the year) times a fraction, the numerator of which is wages, and the denominator of which is net
income before taxes, + wages + taxes (other than income tax) + valuation allowances + amortization expenses + interest expenses.
 
Contribution to individual employees is then made pro rata based
upon their individual salaries for the year.

Ratio of CEO’s Compensation to Median Compensation
of All Employees (Excluding CEO Compensation)
 
We have determined that for 2013, the median
total compensation for all of our employees, but excluding the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, was $117,434. The total
compensation for our Chief Executive Officer for 2013 as set forth in the Summary Compensation above was $808,790. Therefore, for
2013 the ratio of the total compensation for our Chief Executive Officer as compared to the median total compensation to all of
our employees excluding the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, is 6.9:1.

Options
 
As discussed above, we typically grant nonqualified
stock options with a term of 6 years that vest ratably of a 5-year period on a cumulative basis, so that the option will become
fully exercisable at the beginning of the sixth year from the date of grant.
 
We believe that the vesting period of these
options serves a dual purpose: 1. executives will not receive any benefit if they leave prior to such portion of the option vesting;
and 2. having a vesting period matches the service period with the potential benefits of the option.
 
Under our company’s stock option plans,
the exercise price is determined by the average of the high and low price on the date of grant, not the closing price as reported
by The Nasdaq Stock Market.
 
We also note that the Summary Compensation
Table does not include income realized by the named executive officers as the result of the exercise of stock options, but rather
reflects the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes for options granted in accordance with ASC topic
718-20. However, value realized as the result of stock option exercises is set forth in the table entitled “Option Exercises
and Stock Vested”.

Interparfums SA Profit Sharing Plan
 
As required by French law, Inter Parfums,
SA maintains its own profit sharing plan for all French employees who have completed three months of service, including executive
officers of our European operations other than Mr. Benacin, the Chief Executive Officer of Inter Parfums, SA. Benefits are calculated
based upon a percentage of taxable income of Interparfums SA and allocated to employees based upon salary. The maximum amount
payable per year per employee is 25,000 euros, or approximately $34,000.
 
Calculation of total
annual benefits contribution is made according to the following formula:
 
50% of (Interparfums SA net
income, less 5% of shareholders equity without net income for the year) times a fraction, the numerator of which is wages, and
the denominator of which is net income before tax + wages + taxes (other than income tax) + valuation allowances + amortization
expenses + interest expenses.
 
Contribution to individual employees is
then made pro rata based upon their individual salaries for the year.

Interparfums SA maintains a pension plan
for all of its employees, including all executive officers. The calculation of commitments for severance benefits involves estimating
the probable present value of projected benefit obligations. This projected benefit obligations is then prorated to take into
account seniority of the employees of Interparfums SA on the calculation date.
 
In calculating benefits, the following
assumptions were applied:
 
- voluntary retirement at age 65;
- a rate of 45% for employer payroll contributions for all
employees;
- a 5% average annual salary increase;
- an annual rate of turnover for all employees under 55 years
of age and nil above;
- the TH 00-02 mortality table for men and the TF 00-02 mortality
table for women;
- a discount rate of 3.96%.
 
The normal retirement age is 65 years,
but employees, including Messrs. Benacin, Santi and Garcia-Pelayo, can collect reduced benefits if they retire at age 60.
 
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
 
We do not maintain any nonqualified deferred
compensation plans.

Employment and Consulting
Agreements
 
As part of our acquisition in 1991 of the
controlling interest in Interparfums SA, now a subsidiary, we entered into an employment agreement with Philippe Benacin. The
agreement provides that Mr. Benacin will be employed as Vice Chairman of the Board and President and Chief Executive Officer of
Inter Parfums Holdings and its subsidiary, Interparfums SA. The initial term expired on September 2, 1992, and has subsequently
been automatically renewed for additional annual periods. The agreement provides for automatic annual renewal terms, unless either
party terminates the agreement upon 120 days’ notice. For 2014, Mr. Benacin presently receives an annual salary of €414,000
(approximately $571,000), and automobile expenses of €10,800 (approximately $15,000), which are subject to increase in the
discretion of the board of directors. The agreement also provides for indemnification and a covenant not to compete for one year
after termination of employment.
 
In 2014, in addition to his base salary
which remained at €414,000, Philippe Benacin Holding SAS, Mr. Benacin’s personal holding company, will receive $250,000
for services rendered and to be rendered outside of the United States by Mr. Benacin for United States operations, in his capacity
as President of our company. Payment is being made from United States operations. A consulting agreement has been signed with
Mr. Benacin’s holding company, which provides for review on an annual basis of the amount of compensation payable to such
company. The agreement also provides for indemnification for Mr. Benacin and his holding company, and a covenant not to compete
for one year after termination of the agreement. The agreement is to be for one year, with automatic one year renewals unless
either party terminates on 120 days’ notice or Mr. Benacin ceases to be the President of our company.
 
In 2013 we signed a consulting agreement
with Mr. Madar’s holding company, Jean Madar Holding SAS, which provides for review on an annual basis of the amount of
compensation payable to such company. The agreement also provides for indemnification for Mr. Madar and his holding company and
a covenant not to compete for one year after termination of the agreement. The agreement is for one year, with automatic one year
renewals unless either party terminates on 120 days’ notice or Mr. Madar ceases to be the Chief Executive Officer of our
company. For 2013 Mr. Madar’s personal holding company received $250,000 for services rendered outside of the United States
by Mr. Madar in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer. For 2014 both the $380,000 annual base salary of Mr. Madar as well as
the $250,000 consulting fee payable to his personal holding company will remain the same as they were for 2013.

1.As of the end of the last fiscal year, Mr. Heilbronn held options
                                         to purchase an aggregate of 3,500 shares of our common stock.

2.As of the end of the last fiscal year, Mr. Levy held options to
                                         purchase an aggregate of 2,500 shares of our common stock.

3.As of the end of the last fiscal year, Mr. Bensoussan-Torres held
                                         options to purchase an aggregate of 2,500 shares of our common stock.

4.As of the end of the last fiscal year, Mr. Choël held options
                                         to purchase an aggregate of 2,250 shares of our common stock
 
For 2013, all nonemployee directors received
$4,000 for each board meeting at which they participate in person, and $2,000 for each meeting held by conference telephone. In
addition, the annual fee for each member of the audit committee is $6,000.
 
We maintain stock option plans for our
nonemployee directors. The purpose of these plans is to assist us in attracting and retaining key directors who are responsible
for continuing the growth and success of our company. Under such plans, options to purchase 1,000 shares are granted on each February
1st to all nonemployee directors for as long as each is a nonemployee director on such date. However, if a nonemployee director
does not attend certain of the board meetings, then such option grants are reduced according to a schedule. In addition, options
to purchase 2,000 shares are granted to each nonemployee director upon his initial election or appointment to our board.
 
On February 1, 2014, options to purchase
1,000 shares were granted to each of Francois Heilbronn, Jean Levy and Robert Bensoussan-Torres, and options to purchase 500 shares
were granted to Patrick Choël, all at the exercise price of $32.12 per share under the 2004 plan. Such options vest ratably
over a 4 year period.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 
 
Transactions with European Subsidiaries
 
We have guaranteed the obligations of our
majority-owned, French subsidiary, Interparfums SA under our former Burberry license and our Paul Smith license agreement. We
also provide (or had provided on our behalf) certain financial, accounting and legal services for Interparfums SA, and during
2013 and 2012 fees for such services were $158,750 and $337,438, respectively. In January 2012, Inter Parfums USA, LLC, a United
States subsidiary, signed a five year license agreement with Interparfums Suisse (SARL), a Swiss subsidiary of Interparfums SA,
for the right to sell amenities under the Lanvin brand name to luxury hotels, cruise lines and airlines in return for royalty
payments as are customary in our industry. In 2013 and 2012, Inter Parfums USA, LLC, a United States subsidiary, paid Interparfums
Singapore Pte., Ltd., a subsidiary of Interparfums SA, approximately $114,000 and $110,000, respectively as reimbursement for
expenses for employees and use of their offices by Inter Parfums USA, LLC, including a reasonable allocation of overhead. We estimate
that future payments under this arrangement will be approximately $150,000 per year.

each exercised 13,875, 28,500 and 60,000 outstanding stock options of the Company’s common stock in 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively. The aggregate exercise prices of $0.3 million in 2014, $0.7 million in 2013 and $1.6 million in 2012 were paid by
them tendering to the Company in 2014, 2013 and 2012, an aggregate of 10,080, 18,880 and 82,322 shares, respectively, of the Company’s
common stock, previously owned by them, valued at fair market value on the dates of exercise. All shares issued pursuant to these
option exercises were issued from treasury stock of the Company. In addition, the Chief Executive Officer tendered in 2014, 2013
and 2012 an additional 1,193, 2,573 and 4,710 shares, respectively, for payment of certain withholding taxes resulting from his
option exercises.
 
Consulting Agreements
 
As discussed above in Executive Compensation,
in 2013 we signed a consulting agreement with Mr. Madar’s holding company, Jean Madar Holding SAS, which provides for review
on an annual basis of the amount of compensation payable to such company. The agreement also provides for indemnification for
Mr. Madar and his holding company and a covenant not to compete for one year after termination of the agreement. The agreement
is for one year, with automatic one year renewals unless either party terminates on 120 days’ notice or Mr. Madar ceases
to be the Chief Executive Officer of our company. For 2013 Mr. Madar’s personal holding company received $250,000 for services
rendered outside of the United States by Mr. Madar in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer. For 2014 both the $380,000 annual
base salary of Mr. Madar as well as the $250,000 consulting fee payable to his personal holding company will remain the same as
they were for 2013.
 

31
 

 
Also as discussed above in Executive Compensation,
in 2014, in addition to his base salary which remained at €414,000, Philippe Benacin Holding SAS, Mr. Benacin’s personal
holding company, will receive $250,000 for services rendered and to be rendered outside of the United States by Mr. Benacin for
United States operations, in his capacity as President of our company. Payment is being made from United States operations. A
consulting agreement has been agreed in principle with Mr. Benacin’s holding company, which provides for review on an annual
basis of the amount of compensation payable to such company. The agreement also is to provide for indemnification for Mr. Benacin
and his holding company, and a covenant not to compete for one year after termination of the agreement. The agreement is to be
for one year, with automatic one year renewals unless either party terminates on 120 days’ notice or Mr. Benacin ceases
to be the President of our company.
 
Distribution and Support Arrangements with Clarins
 
During 2010, we formed Interparfums Luxury
Brands, Inc., a Delaware corporation and subsidiary of our majority-owned French subsidiary Interparfums SA, for distribution
of prestige brands in the United States. Interparfums Luxury Brands has also entered into an agreement with Clarins Fragrance
Group US (a Division of Clarins Group) effective January 1, 2011, to share and manage an expanded sales force. Logistical and
administrative support is provided by Clarins Group USA from its Park Avenue offices in New York and its warehouse in Orangeburg,
New York. In addition, in 2011, our Spanish distribution subsidiary also entered into a similar service agreement with a Clarins
subsidiary relating to distribution of prestige fragrances in Spain. In November 2013, Interparfums Luxury Brands and Clarins
U.S.A., Inc. entered into an Extension Agreement, which extended the terms of the Clarins U.S. Services Agreement until June 30,
2015 on the same terms and conditions (the “Clarins Extension Agreement”). Mr. Serge Rosinoer, a former director of our Company
who passed away in January 2014, was the Vice Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Clarins SA, the parent company of both the
Clarins Fragrance Group US and the Clarins subsidiary.
 
Jimmy Choo
 
Interparfums SA and J Choo Limited entered
into an exclusive, worldwide license agreement commencing on January 1, 2010 and expiring on December 31, 2021, for the creation,
development and distribution of fragrances under the Jimmy Choo brand. Mr. Robert Bensoussan, a director of the Corporation, was
a director of J Choo Limited and had an indirect ownership interest in J Choo Limited until July 2011.

Yelo and Nickel USA
 
IP Beauty, Inc., formerly Nickel USA, Inc.,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of our company and Yelo, LLC, a related party by virtue of the 3% equity interest in Yelo owned by Mr.
Jean Madar, the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, have entered into an agreement to have Yelo perform management
services at the spa owned and operated by Nickel in New York City for a one (1) year period, subject to subsequent annual renewals
upon agreement of the parties, and Nickel paid Yelo a monthly base fee of $5,000, plus a monthly performance fee based upon a
percentage of increased monthly revenues above a baseline. In December 2013, we sold our Nickel brand and trademarks and the consulting
agreement with Yelo was terminated in January 2014.
 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
 
The Audit Committee has the sole authority
and is directly responsible for, the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of the independent accountants employed
by our company which prepare or issue an audit report for our company. During 2013 and for the past several years, the Audit Committee
consisted of Messrs. Heilbronn, Levy and Choël.
 
The Company does not have an “audit
committee financial expert” within the definition of the applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules. First, finding
qualified nominees to serve as a director of a public company without substantial financial resources has been challenging. Second,
despite the applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rule which states that being named as the audit committee financial
expert does not impose any greater duty, obligation or liability, the Company has been met with resistance from both present and
former directors to being named as such primarily due to potential additional personal liability.
 
However, as the result of the background,
education and experience of the members of the Audit Committee, our board of directors believes that such committee members are
fully qualified to fulfill their obligations as members of the Audit Committee.
 
Management is responsible for our company’s
internal controls and our financial reporting process. The independent registered public accounting firm we employ, WeiserMazars,
LLP, is responsible for performing an independent audit of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards and to issue a report thereon, as well as, issuing its report on its audit of our management’s
assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee’s responsibility is to monitor and oversee
these processes.
 
In this context, the Audit Committee has
met and held discussions with management and our independent registered public accounting firm. Management represented to the
Audit Committee that our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and the independent registered
public accounting firm. In addition, WeiserMazars LLP discussed with the Audit Committee the results of its audit on management’s
assessment of internal controls over financial reporting. The Audit Committee also discussed with WeiserMazars LLP matters required
to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 16 (Communications with Audit Committees).
 

33
 

 
WeiserMazars LLP also provided to the Audit
Committee the written disclosures required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding
the independent accountant’s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee discussed
with WeiserMazars LLP that firm’s independence.
 
Based upon the Audit
Committee’s discussions with management and WeiserMazars LLP and the Audit Committee’s review of the
representations of management and the report of WeiserMazars LLP to the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee recommended that
our board of directors include the audited consolidated financial statements and management’s report on internal
control over financial reporting, together with the attestation report of WeiserMazars LLP in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2013 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Audit Committee Pre Approval Policies and Procedures
 
The Audit Committee has the sole authority
for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of our independent accountants, who prepare or issue an audit report
for us.
 
During the first quarter of 2013, the audit
committee authorized the following non-audit services to be performed by WeiserMazars LLP.
 

·We authorized
                                         the engagement of WeiserMazars LLP if deemed necessary to provide tax consultation in
                                         the ordinary course of business for fiscal year ended December 31, 2013.
 

·We authorized
                                         the engagement of WeiserMazars LLP if deemed necessary to provide tax consultation as
                                         may be required on a project by project basis that would not be considered in the ordinary
                                         course of business, of up to a $5,000 fee limit per project, subject to an aggregate
                                         fee limit of $25,000 for fiscal year ending December 31, 2013. If we require further
                                         tax services from WeiserMazars LLP, then the approval of the audit committee must be
                                         obtained.
 

·If we require
                                         other services by WeiserMazars LLP on an expedited basis such that obtaining pre-approval
                                         of the audit committee is not practicable, then the Chairman of the Committee has authority
                                         to grant the required pre-approvals for all such services.
 

·We imposed a
                                         cap of $100,000 on the fees that WeiserMazars LLP can charge for services on an expedited
                                         basis that are approved by the Chairman without obtaining full audit committee approval.
 

·None of the non-audit
                                         services of either of the Company’s auditors had the pre-approval requirement waived
                                         in accordance with Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) of Regulation S-X.
 

35
 

  
In the first quarter of 2014, the audit
committee authorized the same non-audit services to be performed by WeiserMazars LLP during 2013 as disclosed above.
 
PROPOSAL NO. 2:
ADVISORY RESOLUTION TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE
COMPENSATION 
 
In accordance to the proxy rules under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to provide
our shareholders with an advisory resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in the Compensation
Discussion and Analysis and the accompanying compensation tables and narrative disclosure. This proposal, commonly known as a
“say-on-pay” proposal, gives shareholders the opportunity to endorse or not endorse our executive compensation as
described in this proxy statement. The Compensation Committee has developed an executive compensation program designed to pay
for performance and to align the long-term interests of our named executive officers with the long-term interests of our shareholders.
We are asking our shareholders to indicate their support for the compensation paid to our named executive officers by voting “FOR”
the following resolution:
 
“RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to Inter
Parfums, Inc.’s named executive officers, as disclosed in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities
and Exchange Commission, including the compensation discussion and analysis, the compensation tables and related narrative disclosure
included in this proxy statement, is hereby APPROVED.”
 
As provided by the Dodd-Frank Act, this
vote will not be binding on the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and may not be construed as overruling a decision
by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee nor imply any additional fiduciary duty on the Board of Directors. Further,
it will not affect any compensation paid or awarded to any executive officer. Our Board of Directors and Compensation Committee
will, however, take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. The purpose
of our compensation policies and procedures is to attract and retain experienced, highly qualified executives crucial to our long-term
success and enhancement of shareholder value.
 
Our Board of Directors recommends that shareholders
vote “for” the approval of the vote for the advisory resolution to
approve executive compensation as described in the compensation discussion and analysis and the accompanying compensation tables
and narrative disclosure in this proxy statement.
 
SHAREHOLDERS’ PROPOSALS
 
Proposals of shareholders intended to be
presented at the 2015 annual meeting of shareholders must be received in writing by the Secretary of our company at our principal
offices in New York City, by April 2, 2015, in order to be considered for inclusion in our proxy statement relating to that meeting.
 

36
 

 
If a shareholder intends to make a proposal
at the 2015 Annual Meeting, such shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of
our company, in compliance with Section 8 of Article II of our By-Laws. To be timely, a shareholder’s notice to the Secretary
must be delivered to or mailed and received at our principal executive office in New York, not less than sixty (60) days nor more
than ninety (90) days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders i.e., between
June 10, 2015, and July 10, 2015; however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within
thirty (30) days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder in order to be timely must be so received not
later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting
was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs.
 
To be in proper written form, a shareholder’s
notice to the Secretary must set forth as to each matter such shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (a) a brief
description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the
annual meeting, (b) the name and record address of such shareholder, (c) the class or series and number of shares of our capital
stock which are owned-beneficially or of record by such shareholder, (d) a description of all arrangements or understandings between
such shareholder and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the proposal of such business by such
shareholder and any material interest of such shareholder in such business and (e) a representation that such shareholder intends
to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such business before the meeting.
