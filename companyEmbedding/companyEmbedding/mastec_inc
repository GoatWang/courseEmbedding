We're always looking for ways to increase efficiency within the projects we take on and stay at the forefront of safety and environmentally responsible construction. MasTec assists clients in determining the optimal site, size, materials, construction methods, and design features to meet their needs, and we continually work to increase their return on investment, too. Over the course of our history, we have perfected our end-to-end approach to infrastructure projects – design, build, install, and maintain. 
We build oil and natural gas pipelines, renewable wind farms across the midwest, maintain electrical transmission and distribution systems that keep lights on across the country, connect communities to new sources of cleaner water, and splice together the fiber-optic networks across America's heartland that put rural towns in touch with distant cities. 
When our customers begin a project with us, they are receiving the depth and breadth of a large corporation, with the responsiveness of a small, local organization. We understand the fundamental building blocks of infrastructure, have the right tools set in place, and adapt to the ever-changing world by identifying, evaluating, and developing project opportunities that fit our customers' greatest needs.

History[edit]
Early 1900s: Beginning as Burnup & Sims[edit]
The company was formed by the merger of two separate companies: Burnup & Sims and Church & Tower. Burnup & Sims was the oldest of the two founding companies and was founded in 1929 by two unemployed carpenters, Russell Burnup and Riley V. Sims, to provide design, construction, and maintenance services to the telephone and utilities industries. During the years of the Great Depression, the two established an office in West Palm Beach, Florida, and by 1936 had a small fleet of trucks and staff. The company’s first telecommunications projects were undertaken the following year at Cape Canaveral, where it was responsible for burying 85 miles of cable.[5]
B&S contributed to national defense during World War II by building airfields and telephone systems. After the war, the company became involved in the laying of underwater cable from Florida to Puerto Rico, and from there to Barbados, for such companies as AT&T and General Telephone. Projects then took on a greater geographical scope, as B&S established underground telecommunications systems and built radio towers in Costa Rica, Barbados, Trinidad-Tobago, and Venezuela.[6]
1960s: Church & Tower is formed[edit]
Founded in Cuba, Church & Tower incorporated in Miami, Florida in 1968 to construct and service telephone networks in Puerto Rico and Miami. When it overextended itself in Puerto Rico and could not build the telephone-infrastructure networks needed in Miami, the company’s owner asked his friend, Cuban immigrant Jorge Mas Canosa, to help save the business. In exchange for half ownership of CTF, Mas Canosa began to manage the company in 1969. Eager to improve the business, Mas Canosa climbed down into ditches, manholes, and trenches to observe workers’ construction methods. He listened to advice from telephone-company and government inspectors; he studied books about the most efficient and newest construction methods. As a result of these learning experiences, he transformed CTF into a fast-track, cost-effective construction program that won recognition for consistent professionalism and commitment to excellence. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc. awarded Church & Tower a long-term contract for projects in the greater Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas. By 1971 Mas Canosa had turned the failing company around; he then borrowed $50,000 and bought the remaining shares of the firm.[6]
1990s: Founding of MasTec[edit]
On March 11, 1994, Church & Tower Group acquired 65 percent of the outstanding common stock of publicly traded Burnup & Sims, Inc. The name of Burnup & Sims was changed to MasTec, Inc., Jorge Mas Canosa became MasTec’s chairman and his son, Jorge Mas, was named president and chief executive officer. Mastec was now regarded as a “minority business enterprise,” publicly traded on NASDAQ under the symbol MASX.[7][8]
21st Century[edit]
In April 2007, Jose Mas became CEO of MasTec.[9] MasTec, Inc. earned total revenues of $3B in 2011[10] and, in addition to the MasTec brand, works under the following brand names: Wanzek, Power Partners, Precision Pipeline, Pumpco, nsoro, Advanced Technologies, ADVent, EC Source, Fabcor, Cam Communications, 3 PhaseLine, Optima Network Services and Globetec.[11]
Executives[edit]
Jorge Mas is the current Chairman of the Board for MasTec, and former CEO. He served as CEO from 1992-1997, and is the brother of current CEO, Jose Mas.
Jose Mas is the CEO of MasTec. He was appointed in 2007.[9]
Ray Harris is President of MasTec. He was appointed in January 1995; formerly, he was President and CEO of Mesa Power, which was formed by T. Boone Pickens, where he developed and financed wind and other renewable energy power projects.
Robert Apple has been COO since 2006. Formerly, he was Group President for MasTec's energy service operations.
C. Robert Campbell has been Executive Vice President and CFO since October 2004.
Alberto de Cardenas is Executive Vice President and General Counsel; he has been responsible for all of MasTec's corporate and operational legal matters and corporate secretary matters since 2005.[12]

History[edit]
Early 1900s: Beginning as Burnup & Sims[edit]
The company was formed by the merger of two separate companies: Burnup & Sims and Church & Tower. Burnup & Sims was the oldest of the two founding companies and was founded in 1929 by two unemployed carpenters, Russell Burnup and Riley V. Sims, to provide design, construction, and maintenance services to the telephone and utilities industries. During the years of the Great Depression, the two established an office in West Palm Beach, Florida, and by 1936 had a small fleet of trucks and staff. The company’s first telecommunications projects were undertaken the following year at Cape Canaveral, where it was responsible for burying 85 miles of cable.[5]
B&S contributed to national defense during World War II by building airfields and telephone systems. After the war, the company became involved in the laying of underwater cable from Florida to Puerto Rico, and from there to Barbados, for such companies as AT&T and General Telephone. Projects then took on a greater geographical scope, as B&S established underground telecommunications systems and built radio towers in Costa Rica, Barbados, Trinidad-Tobago, and Venezuela.[6]
1960s: Church & Tower is formed[edit]
Founded in Cuba, Church & Tower incorporated in Miami, Florida in 1968 to construct and service telephone networks in Puerto Rico and Miami. When it overextended itself in Puerto Rico and could not build the telephone-infrastructure networks needed in Miami, the company’s owner asked his friend, Cuban immigrant Jorge Mas Canosa, to help save the business. In exchange for half ownership of CTF, Mas Canosa began to manage the company in 1969. Eager to improve the business, Mas Canosa climbed down into ditches, manholes, and trenches to observe workers’ construction methods. He listened to advice from telephone-company and government inspectors; he studied books about the most efficient and newest construction methods. As a result of these learning experiences, he transformed CTF into a fast-track, cost-effective construction program that won recognition for consistent professionalism and commitment to excellence. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc. awarded Church & Tower a long-term contract for projects in the greater Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas. By 1971 Mas Canosa had turned the failing company around; he then borrowed $50,000 and bought the remaining shares of the firm.[6]
1990s: Founding of MasTec[edit]
On March 11, 1994, Church & Tower Group acquired 65 percent of the outstanding common stock of publicly traded Burnup & Sims, Inc. The name of Burnup & Sims was changed to MasTec, Inc., Jorge Mas Canosa became MasTec’s chairman and his son, Jorge Mas, was named president and chief executive officer. Mastec was now regarded as a “minority business enterprise,” publicly traded on NASDAQ under the symbol MASX.[7][8]
21st Century[edit]
In April 2007, Jose Mas became CEO of MasTec.[9] MasTec, Inc. earned total revenues of $3B in 2011[10] and, in addition to the MasTec brand, works under the following brand names: Wanzek, Power Partners, Precision Pipeline, Pumpco, nsoro, Advanced Technologies, ADVent, EC Source, Fabcor, Cam Communications, 3 PhaseLine, Optima Network Services and Globetec.[11]
Executives[edit]
Jorge Mas is the current Chairman of the Board for MasTec, and former CEO. He served as CEO from 1992-1997, and is the brother of current CEO, Jose Mas.
Jose Mas is the CEO of MasTec. He was appointed in 2007.[9]
Ray Harris is President of MasTec. He was appointed in January 1995; formerly, he was President and CEO of Mesa Power, which was formed by T. Boone Pickens, where he developed and financed wind and other renewable energy power projects.
Robert Apple has been COO since 2006. Formerly, he was Group President for MasTec's energy service operations.
C. Robert Campbell has been Executive Vice President and CFO since October 2004.

History[edit]
Early 1900s: Beginning as Burnup & Sims[edit]
The company was formed by the merger of two separate companies: Burnup & Sims and Church & Tower. Burnup & Sims was the oldest of the two founding companies and was founded in 1929 by two unemployed carpenters, Russell Burnup and Riley V. Sims, to provide design, construction, and maintenance services to the telephone and utilities industries. During the years of the Great Depression, the two established an office in West Palm Beach, Florida, and by 1936 had a small fleet of trucks and staff. The company’s first telecommunications projects were undertaken the following year at Cape Canaveral, where it was responsible for burying 85 miles of cable.[5]
B&S contributed to national defense during World War II by building airfields and telephone systems. After the war, the company became involved in the laying of underwater cable from Florida to Puerto Rico, and from there to Barbados, for such companies as AT&T and General Telephone. Projects then took on a greater geographical scope, as B&S established underground telecommunications systems and built radio towers in Costa Rica, Barbados, Trinidad-Tobago, and Venezuela.[6]
1960s: Church & Tower is formed[edit]
Founded in Cuba, Church & Tower incorporated in Miami, Florida in 1968 to construct and service telephone networks in Puerto Rico and Miami. When it overextended itself in Puerto Rico and could not build the telephone-infrastructure networks needed in Miami, the company’s owner asked his friend, Cuban immigrant Jorge Mas Canosa, to help save the business. In exchange for half ownership of CTF, Mas Canosa began to manage the company in 1969. Eager to improve the business, Mas Canosa climbed down into ditches, manholes, and trenches to observe workers’ construction methods. He listened to advice from telephone-company and government inspectors; he studied books about the most efficient and newest construction methods. As a result of these learning experiences, he transformed CTF into a fast-track, cost-effective construction program that won recognition for consistent professionalism and commitment to excellence. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc. awarded Church & Tower a long-term contract for projects in the greater Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas. By 1971 Mas Canosa had turned the failing company around; he then borrowed $50,000 and bought the remaining shares of the firm.[6]
1990s: Founding of MasTec[edit]
On March 11, 1994, Church & Tower Group acquired 65 percent of the outstanding common stock of publicly traded Burnup & Sims, Inc. The name of Burnup & Sims was changed to MasTec, Inc., Jorge Mas Canosa became MasTec’s chairman and his son, Jorge Mas, was named president and chief executive officer. Mastec was now regarded as a “minority business enterprise,” publicly traded on NASDAQ under the symbol MASX.[7][8]
21st Century[edit]
In April 2007, Jose Mas became CEO of MasTec.[9] MasTec, Inc. earned total revenues of $3B in 2011[10] and, in addition to the MasTec brand, works under the following brand names: Wanzek, Power Partners, Precision Pipeline, Pumpco, nsoro, Advanced Technologies, ADVent, EC Source, Fabcor, Cam Communications, 3 PhaseLine, Optima Network Services and Globetec.[11]

History[edit]
Early 1900s: Beginning as Burnup & Sims[edit]
The company was formed by the merger of two separate companies: Burnup & Sims and Church & Tower. Burnup & Sims was the oldest of the two founding companies and was founded in 1929 by two unemployed carpenters, Russell Burnup and Riley V. Sims, to provide design, construction, and maintenance services to the telephone and utilities industries. During the years of the Great Depression, the two established an office in West Palm Beach, Florida, and by 1936 had a small fleet of trucks and staff. The company’s first telecommunications projects were undertaken the following year at Cape Canaveral, where it was responsible for burying 85 miles of cable.[5]
B&S contributed to national defense during World War II by building airfields and telephone systems. After the war, the company became involved in the laying of underwater cable from Florida to Puerto Rico, and from there to Barbados, for such companies as AT&T and General Telephone. Projects then took on a greater geographical scope, as B&S established underground telecommunications systems and built radio towers in Costa Rica, Barbados, Trinidad-Tobago, and Venezuela.[6]
1960s: Church & Tower is formed[edit]
Founded in Cuba, Church & Tower incorporated in Miami, Florida in 1968 to construct and service telephone networks in Puerto Rico and Miami. When it overextended itself in Puerto Rico and could not build the telephone-infrastructure networks needed in Miami, the company’s owner asked his friend, Cuban immigrant Jorge Mas Canosa, to help save the business. In exchange for half ownership of CTF, Mas Canosa began to manage the company in 1969. Eager to improve the business, Mas Canosa climbed down into ditches, manholes, and trenches to observe workers’ construction methods. He listened to advice from telephone-company and government inspectors; he studied books about the most efficient and newest construction methods. As a result of these learning experiences, he transformed CTF into a fast-track, cost-effective construction program that won recognition for consistent professionalism and commitment to excellence. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc. awarded Church & Tower a long-term contract for projects in the greater Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas. By 1971 Mas Canosa had turned the failing company around; he then borrowed $50,000 and bought the remaining shares of the firm.[6]
1990s: Founding of MasTec[edit]
On March 11, 1994, Church & Tower Group acquired 65 percent of the outstanding common stock of publicly traded Burnup & Sims, Inc. The name of Burnup & Sims was changed to MasTec, Inc., Jorge Mas Canosa became MasTec’s chairman and his son, Jorge Mas, was named president and chief executive officer. Mastec was now regarded as a “minority business enterprise,” publicly traded on NASDAQ under the symbol MASX.[7][8]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.
