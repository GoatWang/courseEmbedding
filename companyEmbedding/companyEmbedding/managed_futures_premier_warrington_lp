  Managed Futures Funds :: New York City Funds Management Attorney Gana LLP                                Contact Us Now: 800-810-4262 Tap Here To Call Us          GANA LLP Home Contact GANA LLP    Home  About Us  Attorneys  Practice Areas  Blog  Case Results  Referrals  Contact Us                     Home  Practice Areas  Securities Arbitration & Litigation  Investment Products   Managed Futures Funds      Managed Futures Funds Managed futures funds constitute a $337 billion market and many large brokerage firms have setup their own managed futures funds and recommended thousands of investors place their assets in these funds. However, a Bloomberg article has raised questions concerning the suitability of managed futures funds. According to the article, from 2003 to 2012, 89% of the futures fund trading profits and interest for 63 SEC-registered funds were consumed by fees and commissions leaving investors with little profit for their investment. In the wake of the article’s revelations the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has opened an investigation into the high fees charged to investors.As a background, the expected gross return to a fully collateralized futures position equals the return to a cash investment plus compensation for the risk borne in the collateral investment. For stocks and stock index futures the compensation is the expected return on the stock market. For other underlying investments, the expected returns is often less. Thus, a managed futures fund investment with 7 to 9% annual expenses on average will earn much less than stocks and bonds over the same period of time due to the commissions and fees taken from the fund by the managers and the brokerage firm each year that would otherwise be available to the investors.The failure of managed futures funds is also backed up by empirical research. From January 2003 through the end of 2012, the Bloomberg article found that Morgan Stanley had 30,000 customers to invest $797 million into a managed-futures fund called Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Technical L.P. The prospectus for Spectrum Technical fund stated that the fund was potentially profitable “when traditional markets are experiencing losses” and recommended the fund as a way to diversify an investor’s holdings beyond traditional stocks and bonds. The prospectus also allegedly boasted that over a twenty-three year period investors who placed ten percent of their assets in managed futures outperformed portfolios comprised only of stocks and bonds.The Spectrum Technical fund earned $490.3 million in trading gains and income from 2003 through 2012 according to the article. Nonetheless, investors who remained in the fund during this period did not receive any of the returns because the manager’s and Morgan Stanley’s commissions, expenses, and fees paid totaled $498.7 million. Thus, Spectrum Technical investors lost $8.3 million for no other reason than the fees charged to the fund were greater than the gains.Below are some managed futures funds we are currently investigating:The Morgan Stanley/Ceres Managed-Futures Funds:Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Strategic L.P.Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Technical L.P.Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Currency and Commodity L.P.Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Global Balanced L.P.Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Strategic L.P.Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Select L.P.Polaris Futures Fund L.P.Meritage Futures Fund L.P.LV Futures Fund L.P.Managed Futures Premier BHM, L.P.Managed Futures Premier Graham L.P.Managed Futures Premier Aventis II L.P.Managed Futures Premier Warrington L.P.Merrill Lynch Managed-Futures Funds:ML Systematic Momentum FuturesAccess LLCMan AHL FuturesAccess LLCML Aspect FuturesAccess LLCML Winton FuturesAccess LLCML BlueTrend FuturesAccess LLCML Transtrend DTP Enhanced FuturesAccess LLCOther Managed-Futures Funds:Grant Park Futures Fund LPAltegris Winton Futures Fund LPCampbell Strategic Allocation Fund L.P.RJO Global Trust               Contact Us  Toll Free: 800-810-4262          Name (Required)      Email (Required)      Phone (Required)       Message         Enter text from the Image Above: Please enter the text from the image on the left.

Are Managed Futures a License to Steal?







By Geng Deng, PhD, CFA, FRM and Craig McCann, PhD, CFA

Bloomberg’s David Evans raised this question in his recent Fleeced by Fees. David found that 89% of the futures trading profits and interest on collateral in 63 SEC-registered managed futures funds from 2003 to 2012 were consumed by fees and commissions. David’s story shines a light on the abusive fees charged by the managed futures partnerships. His story quotes a spokesperson for the National Futures Association self-regulatory organization / trade group as saying that “We can’t just give investors all the answers.” Thankfully, his follow up story last week reports that the CFTC has opened an investigation into the high fees and so more useful information might be on the way to investors soon.

We’ve been working on this story ourselves for a while now and find substantially the same results as David. The table below lists the investment income (including futures profits and interest income) in 93 SEC-registered managed futures funds from 2003 to 2012. This sample is a little larger than David’s primarily because it includes some funds that didn’t survive to the end of 2012.

Our 93 filers reported $2.37 billion in interest income and $9.63 billion in futures trading profits for a total of $12.0 billion in investment returns from 2003 to 2012. The firms deducted $10.42 billion in fees and commissions (87% of the investment returns) and distributed only $1.59 billion (13%) to investors. As if that wasn’t evidence enough that the registered managed futures funds are robbing investors, consider this: the interest on the collateral was $2.37 billion. That is, the registered managed futures funds on average paid out none of the $9.63 billion in futures trading profits and only two-thirds of the interest earned on the low risk collateral purchased with investors' capital. Investors would be far better to have invested in a diversified bond portfolio than to invest in a managed futures partnership.

David’s story discusses at some length the Campbell Strategic Allocation Fund. Over the decade it had $2.5 billion in investment returns but deducted $2.34 billion in fees and commissions leaving investors with only 6% of the returns for bearing the risk of the futures trading on the collateral purchased. The Campbell Strategic Allocation Fund collateral alone earned $760 million and so investors received only about 20% of the returns on the fixed income collateral and none of the profits from the futures trading.

There are other great examples of what is a ubiquitous pattern of excessive fees. 

The 29 registered managed futures partnerships managed by Morgan Stanley’s affiliate, Ceres, had gross returns of $5.4 billion but net returns of only $1.3 billion after $4.1 billion in fees were deducted over the 10 years from 2003 to 2012. 

Annualized gross returns to the Ceres funds were 10.0%, expenses were 7.9% and net returns only 2.1%. 

During the same period, S&P stocks' annual return was 7.0%, beating the Ceres managed futures partnerships 9 out of 10 years.

Municipal bonds during the same period had an annual tax free return of 4.8%, and taxable bonds 5.1%.

Ceres Managed Futures Partnership Returns, 2003-2012 (in millions)

The expected gross return to a fully collateralized futures position is the return to a cash investment plus whatever compensation is required for the risk borne in the collateral investment. For stocks and stock index futures this is the expected return on the stock market. For other underlying investments, the expected returns are less. The expected gross return to actively managed futures is also equal to the expected returns to actively managed cash investments. Given this simple arithmetic, a managed futures investment with 7 to 9% annual expenses on average will earn much less than combinations of stocks and bonds over time because of the extraordinary withdrawals taken by the industry each year from investors’ capital.
The clear answer to the headline answer is, Yes.

 Managed Future Funds Fees & Expenses Class Action Lawsuit 

 
  

In November 2013, Bloomberg published a startling report about the fees and expenses some fund managers charge investors in “managed-futures” funds.  The conclusion was that in dozens and dozens of managed futures funds, the managers charged fees and expenses that totaled 89% of all the profit of that given fund.
A managed-futures fund  is an alternative investment, which is often defined as an investment other than cash, stocks, or bonds.  Typically these investments are sold to investors through brokers and many large brokerage houses have there own proprietary managed futures investments.  BarcalyHedge estimates that over $331 billion was invested in managed accounts in mid 2013.

SEC reporting requirements 
One difference between managed futures funds and say typical stocks and bonds is that in general managed futures funds are not required to file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The SEC does however require that all managed futures funds with more than 500 investors and more than $10 million in assets file financial reports within 120 days of their fiscal year’s end.  Bloomberg as part of its investigation concluded that there are currently 63 managed-futures funds that fit into this category. The vast majority of managed-futures funds, therefore, have no reporting requirement, as they are not subject to the 500 Investor Rule.

	Bloomberg’s big ciscovery regarding managed futures funds fees and expenses
Bloomberg concluded that managed-futures funds can charge clients 7% to 9% each year of the investment amount in the fund plus 20 percent of the funds’ profits.  (Hedge funds typically only charge a 2% management fee plus 20% of investor profits.)
Bloomberg next concluded that for the period from Jan. 1, 2003 to Dec. 31, 2012, a stunning 89% of the $11.51 billion of gains in these 63 managed-futures funds went to fees, commissions and expenses collected by the fund managers—not to investors. 

	One example: Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Technical L.P.
30,000 people invested approximately $797 million in Morgan Stanley's managed-futures fund called Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Technical L.P. From 2002 through 2012, the fund made approximately $490 million in trading gains and interest income. However, investors ended up losing money because those profits were depleted by over $498 million in commissions, expenses and fees paid to fund managers and Morgan Stanley. Despite the fund's value increase of approximately $490 million, investors ended up losing approximately $8 million over the course of those 10 years.

Morgan Stanley/Ceres Managed
Futures Funds
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC (MSSB) through Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and Ceres Managed Futures, LLC, which are both owned and controlled by MSSB, market and manage the sale of the Morgan Stanley Spectrum Series of Managed Futures Funds. Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and Ceres Managed Futures, LLC acting as sponsor, general partner, manager, investment manager and investment advisor to pooled investment vehicles with portfolios of managed futures funds are marketed and sold to institutional and high-net-worth (HNW) investors through the MSSB Spectrum Series of Managed Futures Funds.
The rationale provided by Morgan Stanley’s financial advisors used to support its recommendation that investors allocate a portion of their portfolio in managed futures contracts, is to generate portfolio returns with greater returns on a risk-adjusted basis. The purported low correlation of managed futures funds with the overall securities markets provides superior results for an investment portfolio during “down markets” which smooth portfolio returns over time. Morgan Stanley financial advisors caution investors that they cannot “market-time” when to invest in managed futures funds which they argue makes investments in managed futures funds a permanent part of a buy-hold asset allocation strategy.
The Morgan Stanley Spectrum Series of managed futures funds invest in asset classes that include trading futures contracts in equity indices (i.e. developed and emerging markets), interest rates (i.e. U.S. Bonds, Eurodollar Bonds, Euro-Bund), commodities (i.e. energy, agriculture and metals) and currencies (i.e. Dollar, Euro, Pound, Yen). Through investments in managed futures funds, investors are allegedly able to access invests in non-traditional asset classes that have a low correlation with traditional equity and fixed income securities markets resulting an overall increase in investment returns on a risk-adjusted basis.
At issue for investors is the performance of Morgan Stanley’s managed futures funds after the management fees have been deducted from the account. In most instances, investment advisors are compensated by a flat management fee based on assets under management. Additionally, an “incentive-based” fee is deducted based on profits in “up” years. This “performance-based” fee is usually paid net of all fees. In addition to management and performance fees, a managed futures account has deducted from the balance expenses for transactions costs and commissions. The net result for investors has been the loss of trading profits from a poorly-explained regime of excessive fees and conflicts of interest designed to enrich Morgan Stanley.
The Morgan Stanley Spectrum Series of managed futures funds are privately-placed and are sold to institutions and high-net-worth investors. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management offers various managed futures funds, including:

Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Strategic L.P.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Technical L.P.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Currency and Commodity L.P.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Global Balanced L.P.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Strategic L.P.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Select L.P.
Polaris Futures Fund L.P.
Meritage Futures Fund L.P.
LV Futures Fund L.P.
Managed Futures Premier BHM, L.P.
Managed Futures Premier Graham L.P.
Managed Futures Premier Aventis II L.P.
Managed Futures Premier Warrington L.P.

Silver Law Group is currently investigating whether Morgan Stanley Spectrum Series of managed futures funds managed by Ceres Managed Futures, LLC are in compliance with the securities industry’s rules and regulations concerning the suitability and disclosure requirements related to the risks, fees and terms associated with the management of their managed futures funds. The focus of the investigation includes whether the fees and terms were adequately disclosed to investors for potential FINRA sales practice violations of misrepresentation or omission of material facts, and excessive markups and markdowns, and whether the recommendations made to investors resulted in unsuitable investment advice based on client investment ability to understand and assume the risks associated with managed futures funds.
