FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

SunOpta Inc. Announces Exit from Flexible Re-Sealable Pouch 
      Products and Sale of Its Allentown Pouch Equipment






                    	July 27, 2017 07:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time 
                    	



TORONTO--(EON: Enhanced Online News)--SunOpta Inc. (Nasdaq:STKL) (TSX:SOY), a leading global company focused 
      on organic, non-genetically modified and specialty foods, announced 
      today that it has signed a definitive agreement to sell equipment used 
      in the production of flexible, re-sealable pouches from its Allentown, 
      PA facility to Skjodt-Barrett for $2.0 million. The asset sale is in 
      conjunction with the Company’s decision to discontinue flexible, 
      re-sealable pouch products as part of its ongoing portfolio optimization 
      strategy and Value Creation Plan.
    
“Each employee has contributed to our goal of bringing well-being 
      to life in their own way and has had a meaningful impact at SunOpta.”

      “This asset sale, and discontinuation of the flexible re-sealable pouch 
      business aligns with our stated portfolio optimization strategy of 
      exiting product lines where the Company is not effectively positioned,” 
      said Dave Colo, CEO of SunOpta. “We anticipate the discontinuation of 
      contract manufacturing pouched baby food products to be profit neutral 
      and allow for the redeployment of capital and resources for investment 
      in more profitable segments of our business where we have enhanced 
      strategic positioning.”
    

      Flexible re-sealable pouch products accounted for $46 million of 
      revenues in fiscal 2016, and $10 million of revenues in the first 
      quarter of 2017, and were part of the healthy snacks platform within the 
      consumer products segment. SunOpta will continue to produce aseptic 
      beverages from its Allentown, PA facility, which were not part of the 
      sale. The sale of equipment is expected to close during the fourth 
      quarter of 2017.
    

      “I want to thank all of our employees involved in the flexible 
      re-sealable pouch operations for their hard work and dedication," Colo 
      said. “Each employee has contributed to our goal of bringing well-being 
      to life in their own way and has had a meaningful impact at SunOpta.”

Forward-Looking Statements


      Certain statements included in this press release may be considered 
      "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the United States 
      Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and applicable Canadian 
      securities legislation, which are based on information available to us 
      on the date of this release. These forward-looking statements include, 
      but are not limited to, the anticipated impact of our exit from flexible 
      re-sealable pouch products on profits, the expected time to close the 
      sale of equipment, and anticipated benefits from the sale of the pouch 
      equipment. Terms and phrases such as "expect", "anticipate", "will", 
      "continue", and other similar terms and phrases are intended to identify 
      these forward-looking statements. Forward looking statements are based 
      on information available to us on the date of this release and are based 
      on estimates and assumptions made by the Company in light of its 
      experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions 
      and expected future developments as well as other factors the Company 
      believes are appropriate in the circumstances including the relatively 
      modest contribution from flexible re-sealable pouch products to our 
      consolidated revenues and profits historically. The Company makes no 
      representation that reasonable business people in possession of the same 
      information would reach the same conclusions. Whether actual timing and 
      results will agree with expectations and predications of the Company is 
      subject to many risks and uncertainties including that all conditions of 
      closing the sale of the pouch equipment are satisfied, the inability or 
      failure of the purchaser to satisfy the purchase price for the pouch 
      equipment, changes in the level of capital investment and various other 
      risks and uncertainties as described from time to time under "Risk 
      Factors" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and its Quarterly 
      Reports on Form 10-Q (available at www.sec.gov). 
      Consequently, all forward-looking statements made herein are qualified 
      by these cautionary statements and there can be no assurance that the 
      actual results or developments anticipated by the Company will be 
      realized.
