William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is a co-founder of Microsoft and is an American business magnate, investor, author and philanthropist.[2][3]
In 1975, Gates and Paul Allen launched Microsoft, which became the world's largest PC software company. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, CEO and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014.[4][a] Gates stepped down as chief executive officer of Microsoft in January 2000, but he remained as chairman and created the position of chief software architect for himself.[7] In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning from full-time work at Microsoft to part-time work and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.[8] He gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig Mundie.[9] He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.[10]
Gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution. He has been criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings.[11] Later in his career, Gates pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors. He donated large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was established in 2000.
Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people.[12] As of May 2017[update], he is the richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$88.5 billion.[1] In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.[13]

Early life
Gates was born in Seattle, Washington on October 28, 1955. He is the son of William H. Gates Sr.[b] (born 1925) and Mary Maxwell Gates (1929–1994). His ancestry includes English, German, Irish, and Scots-Irish.[14][15] His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way. Gates' maternal grandfather was JW Maxwell, a national bank president. Gates has one elder sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and one younger sister, Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family, but is known as William Gates III or "Trey" because his father had the "II" suffix.[16] Early on in his life, Gates' parents had a law career in mind for him.[17] When Gates was young, his family regularly attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination.[18][19][20] The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that "it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock ... there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing".[21]




The Poker Room in Currier House at Harvard College


At 13, he enrolled in the Lakeside School, a private preparatory school.[22] When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the school's students.[23] Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. When he reflected back on that moment, he said, "There was just something neat about the machine."[24] After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside students –  Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Kent Evans –  for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.[25][26]
At the end of the ban, the four students offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for computer time. Rather than use the system via Teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system, including programs in Fortran, Lisp, and machine language. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when the company went out of business. The following year, Information Sciences, Inc. hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in COBOL, providing them computer time and royalties. After his administrators became aware of his programming abilities, Gates wrote the school's computer program to schedule students in classes. He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with "a disproportionate number of interesting girls."[27] He later stated that "it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success."[24] At age 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen, called Traf-O-Data, to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor.[28] In early 1973, Bill Gates served as a congressional page in the U.S. House of Representatives.[29]
Gates graduated from Lakeside School in 1973 and was a National Merit Scholar.[30] He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests[31] and enrolled at Harvard College in the autumn of 1973.[32] He chose a pre-law major but took mathematics and graduate level computer science courses.[33] While at Harvard, he met fellow student Steve Ballmer. Gates left Harvard after two years while Ballmer would stay and graduate magna cum laude. Years later, Ballmer succeeded Gates as CEO of Microsoft before resigning from the company in 2014.[34]
In his second year, Gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems[35] presented in a combinatorics class by Harry Lewis, one of his professors. Gates' solution held the record as the fastest version for over thirty years;[35][36] its successor is faster by only one percent.[35] His solution was later formalized in a published paper in collaboration with Harvard computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou.[37]
Gates did not have a definite study plan while he was a student at Harvard[38] and spent a lot of time using the school's computers. Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen, and he joined him at Honeywell during the summer of 1974.[39] The following year saw the release of the MITS Altair 8800 based on the Intel 8080 CPU, and Gates and Allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company.[40] Gates dropped out of Harvard at this time. He had talked this decision over with his parents, who were supportive of him after seeing how much Gates wanted to start his own company.[38] Gates explained his official status with Harvard that, "...if things [Microsoft] hadn't worked out, I could always go back to school. I was officially on [a] leave [of absence]."[41]

MITS Altair 8800 Computer with 8-inch (200 mm) floppy disk system


After reading the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics that demonstrated the Altair 8800, Gates contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), the creators of the new microcomputer, to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform.[42] In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demo, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration, held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. Paul Allen was hired into MITS,[43] and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with Allen at MITS in Albuquerque in November 1975. They named their partnership "Micro-Soft" and had their first office located in Albuquerque.[43] Within a year, the hyphen was dropped, and on November 26, 1976, the trade name "Microsoft" was registered with the Office of the Secretary of the State of New Mexico.[43] Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.
Microsoft's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, Gates wrote an Open Letter to Hobbyists in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90% of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and by doing so the Altair "hobby market" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software.[44] This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.[43] The company moved from Albuquerque to its new home in Bellevue, Washington, on January 1, 1979.[42]
During Microsoft's early years, all employees had broad responsibility for the company's business. Gates oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well. In the first five years, Gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit.[45][unreliable source?]
IBM partnership
IBM approached Microsoft in July 1980 in reference to an operating systen for its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC.[46] Big Blue first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter. When IBM's representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system, Gates referred them to Digital Research (DRI), makers of the widely used CP/M operating system.[47] IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system. A few weeks later, Gates proposed using 86-DOS (QDOS), an operating system similar to CP/M that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC. Microsoft made a deal with SCP to become the exclusive licensing agent, and later the full owner, of 86-DOS. After adapting the operating system for the PC, Microsoft delivered it to IBM as PC DOS in exchange for a one-time fee of $50,000.[48]
Gates did not offer to transfer the copyright on the operating system, because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone IBM's system.[48] They did, and the sales of MS-DOS made Microsoft a major player in the industry.[49] Despite IBM's name on the operating system, the press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the new computer. PC Magazine asked if Gates were "the man behind the machine?",[46] and InfoWorld quoted an expert as stating "it's Gates' computer".[50] Gates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates the president of Microsoft and its board chairman.[42]
Windows
Microsoft launched its first retail version of Microsoft Windows on November 20, 1985, and in August, the company struck a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating system called OS/2. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, mounting creative differences caused the partnership to deteriorate.[51]
Management style




Bill Gates in January 2008


From Microsoft's founding in 1975 until 2006, Gates had primary responsibility for the company's product strategy. He gained a reputation for being distant from others; as early as 1981 an industry executive complained in public that "Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls."[52] Another executive recalled that after he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times, when they met again a month later Gates "won or tied every game. He had studied the game until he solved it. That is a competitor."[53]
Gates was an executve who met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers. In firsthand accounts of these meetings, he was described as being verbally combative. He also berated managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk.[54][55] He interrupted presentations with such comments "That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!"[56] and "Why don't you just give up your options and join the Peace Corps?"[57] The target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until, hopefully, Gates was fully convinced.[56] When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark sarcastically, "I'll do it over the weekend."[58][59][60]
Gates was an active software developer in Microsoft's early history, particularly on the company's programming language products, but his basic role in most of the company's history was primarily as a manager and executive. Gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the TRS-80 Model 100,[61] but as late as 1989 he wrote code that shipped with the company's products.[59] He remained interested in technical details; in 1985, Jerry Pournelle wrote that when he watched Gates announce Microsoft Excel, "Something else impressed me. Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although I'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat hack."[62] On June 15, 2006, Gates announced that he would transition out of his day-to-day role over the next two years to dedicate more time to philanthropy. He divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed Ray Ozzie in charge of day-to-day management and Craig Mundie in charge of long-term product strategy.[63]
Antitrust litigation

Gates giving his deposition at Microsoft on August 27, 1998


Many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over Microsoft's business practices have had Gates' approval. In the 1998 United States v. Microsoft case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner David Boies over the contextual meaning of words such as, "compete", "concerned", and "we". The judge and other observers in the court room were seen laughing at various points during the deposition.[64] BusinessWeek reported:

Early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying 'I don't recall,' so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle. Worse, many of the technology chief's denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail that Gates both sent and received.[65]

Gates later said he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. As to his demeanor during the deposition, he said, "Did I fence with Boies? ... I plead guilty. Whatever that penalty is should be levied against me: rudeness to Boies in the first degree."[66] Despite Gates' denials, the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed monopolization and tying, and blocking competition, both in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.[66]
Appearance in ads




Mugshots of Gates following his 1977 arrest for a traffic violation in Albuquerque, New Mexico


In 2008, Gates appeared in a series of ads to promote Microsoft. The first commercial, co-starring Jerry Seinfeld, is a 90-second talk between strangers as Seinfeld walks up on a discount shoe store (Shoe Circus) in a mall and notices Gates buying shoes inside. The salesman is trying to sell Mr. Gates shoes that are a size too big. As Gates is buying the shoes, he holds up his discount card, which uses a slightly altered version of his own mugshot of his arrest in New Mexico in 1977, for a traffic violation.[67] As they are walking out of the mall, Seinfeld asks Gates if he has melded his mind to other developers, after getting a "Yes", he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible, again getting a "Yes". Some say that this is an homage to Seinfeld's own show about "nothing" (Seinfeld).[68] In a second commercial in the series, Gates and Seinfeld are at the home of an average family trying to fit in with normal people.[69]
Post-Microsoft




Gates meeting with U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis in February 2017


Since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft, Gates has continued his philanthropy and works on other projects.
According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Gates was the world's highest-earning billionaire in 2013, as his net worth increased by US$15.8 billion to US$78.5 billion. As of January 2014, most of Gates' assets are held in Cascade Investment LLC, an entity through which he owns stakes in numerous businesses, including Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, and Corbis Corp.[70] On February 4, 2014, Gates stepped down as chairman of Microsoft to become Technology Advisor alongside new CEO Satya Nadella.[10][71]
Gates provided his perspective on a range of issues in a substantial interview that was published in the March 27, 2014 issue of Rolling Stone magazine. In the interview, Gates provided his perspective on climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: "... there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism." Gates also identified innovation as the "real driver of progress" and pronounced that "America's way better today than it's ever been."[72] Gates' days are planned for him, similar to the US President's schedule, on a minute-by-minute basis.[73]
Personal life




Bill and Melinda Gates in June 2009


Gates married Melinda French in Hawaii on January 1, 1994; he was 38 and she was 29. They have three children: Jennifer Katharine (b. 1996), Rory John (b. 1999), and Phoebe Adele (b. 2002). The family resides in a modern design mansion, which is an earth-sheltered house in the side of a hill overlooking Lake Washington in Medina near Seattle in the state of Washington, United States. According to 2007 King County public records, the total assessed value of the property (land and house) is $125 million, and the annual property taxes are $991,000. The 66,000 sq ft (6,100 m2) estate has a 60-foot (18 m) swimming pool with an underwater music system, as well as a 2,500 sq ft (230 m2) gym and a 1,000 sq ft (93 m2) dining room.[74]
In an interview with Rolling Stone, Gates stated in regard to his faith:

The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.[75]

In the same interview, Gates said: "I agree with people like Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm – not all – that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [laughs]. I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know."[75]
One of Gates' private acquisitions is the Codex Leicester, which is a collection of writings by Leonardo da Vinci that Gates bought for $30.8 million at an auction in 1994.[76] Gates is also known as an avid reader, and the ceiling of his large home library is engraved with a quotation from The Great Gatsby.[77] He also enjoys playing bridge, tennis, and golf.[78][79]
In 1999, his wealth briefly surpassed $101 billion, which caused the media to call Gates a "centibillionaire".[80] Despite his wealth and extensive business travel, Gates usually flew coach until 1997, when he bought a private jet.[81] Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the dot-com bubble burst and the multibillion-dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In a May 2006 interview, Gates commented that he wished that he were not the richest man in the world because he disliked the attention it brought.[82] In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person behind Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List.[83][84] Carlos Slim retook the position again in June 2014[85][86] (but then lost the top position back to Gates). Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from US$40 billion to more than US$82 billion.[87]
Gates has several investments outside Microsoft, which in 2006 paid him a salary of $616,667 and $350,000 bonus totalling $966,667.[88] In 1989, he founded Corbis, a digital imaging company. In 2004, he became a director of Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company headed by long-time friend Warren Buffett.[89] In 2016, he revealed that he was color-blind when discussing his gaming habits.[90]
Philanthropy

In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.[13]
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
Main article: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
Gates studied the work of Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, and in 1994, sold some of his Microsoft stock to create the "William H. Gates Foundation." In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations to create the charitable Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world's wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6 billion.[91][92] The Foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the Wellcome Trust.[93][94]
The foundation is organized into four program areas: Global Development Division, Global Health Division, United States Division, and Global Policy & Advocacy Division.[95]
Gates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of David Rockefeller as a major influence. Gates and his father met with Rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly modeled on the Rockefeller family's philanthropic focus, whereby they are interested in tackling the global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations.[96] As of 2007, Bill and Melinda Gates were the second-most generous philanthropists in America, having given over $28 billion to charity;[97] the couple plan to eventually donate 95 percent of their wealth to charity.[98]
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supports the use of genetically modified organisms in agricultural development. Specifically, the foundation is supporting the International Rice Research Institute in developing Golden Rice, a genetically modified rice variant used to combat Vitamin A deficiency.[99]
Personal
Melinda Gates suggested that people should emulate the philanthropic efforts of the Salwen family, which had sold its home and given away half of its value, as detailed in The Power of Half.[100] Gates and his wife invited Joan Salwen to Seattle to speak about what the family had done, and on December 9, 2010, Gates, investor Warren Buffett, and Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg signed a commitment they called the "Gates-Buffet Giving Pledge." The pledge is a commitment by all three to donate at least half of their wealth over the course of time to charity.[101][102][103]
Gates has recently expressed concern about the existential threats of superintelligence; in a Reddit "ask me anything", he stated that

First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned.[104][105][106][107]

In a March 2015 interview, with Baidu's CEO, Robin Li, Gates claimed he would "highly recommend" Nick Bostrom's recent work, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies.[108]
Gates has also provided personal donations to educational institutions. In 1999, Gates donated $20 million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for the construction of a computer laboratory named the "William H. Gates Building" that was designed by architect Frank Gehry. While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates.[109]
The Maxwell Dworkin Laboratory of the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences is named after the mothers of both Gates and Microsoft President Steven A. Ballmer, both of whom were students (Ballmer was a member of the School's graduating class of 1977, while Gates left his studies for Microsoft), and donated funds for the laboratory's construction.[110] Gates also donated $6 million to the construction of the Gates Computer Science Building, completed in January 1996, on the campus of Stanford University. The building contains the Computer Science Department (CSD) and the Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) of Stanford's Engineering department.[111]
On August 15, 2014, Bill Gates posted a video of himself on Facebook in which he is seen dumping a bucket of ice water on his head. Gates posted the video after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg challenged him to do so in order to raise awareness for the disease ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).[112]
Since about 2005, Bill Gates and his foundation have taken an interest in solving global sanitation problems. For example, they announced the "Reinvent the Toilet Challenge", which has received considerable media interest.[113] To raise awareness for the topic of sanitation and possible solutions, Gates drank water that was "produced from human feces" in 2014 – in fact it was produced from a sewage sludge treatment process called the Omni-processor.[114][115] In early 2015, he also appeared with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show and challenged him to see if he could taste the difference between this reclaimed water or bottled water.[116]
Bill and Melinda Gates have said that they intend to leave their three children $10 million each as their inheritance. With only $30 million kept in the family, they appear to be on a course to give away about 99.96 percent of their wealth.[117]
Criticism
In 2007, the Los Angeles Times criticized the foundation for investing its assets in companies that have been accused of worsening poverty, polluting heavily, and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell to the developing world.[118] In response to press criticism, the foundation announced a review of its investments to assess social responsibility.[119] It subsequently canceled the review and stood by its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices.[120] The Gates Millennium Scholars program has been criticized by Ernest W. Lefever for its exclusion of Caucasian students.[121] The scholarship program is administered by the United Negro College Fund.[122] In 2014, Bill Gates sparked a protest in Vancouver when he decided to donate 50 million dollars to UNAIDS through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for the purpose of mass circumcision in Zambia and Swaziland.[123][124]
Charity Sports Events
On April 29, 2017, Bill Gates partnered with Swiss Tennis legend Roger Federer in playing a non competitive tennis match to a packed house at Key Arena in Seattle. The event was in support of Roger Federer Foundation's charity efforts in Africa.[125] Federer and Gates played against John Isner and Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McReady. Gates and Federer won the game 6-4.
Recognition

In 1987, Gates was listed as a billionaire in Forbes magazine's 400 Richest People in America issue, just days before his 32nd birthday. As the world's youngest self-made billionaire, he was worth $1.25 billion, over $900 million more than he'd been worth the year before, when he'd debuted on the list.[12] Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes The World's Billionaires list and was the wealthiest from 1995 to 1996,[126] 1998 to 2007, 2009, and has been since 2014.[1] Gates was number one on Forbes' 400 Richest Americans list from 1993 through to 2007.[127][needs update]

Gates was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005.[141] In November 2006, he was awarded the Placard of the Order of the Aztec Eagle, together with his wife Melinda who was awarded the Insignia of the same order, both for their philanthropic work around the world in the areas of health and education, particularly in Mexico, and specifically in the program "Un país de lectores".[142] Gates received the 2010 Bower Award for Business Leadership from The Franklin Institute for his achievements at Microsoft and his philanthropic work.[143] Also in 2010, he was honored with the Silver Buffalo Award by the Boy Scouts of America, its highest award for adults, for his service to youth.[144]

William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is a co-founder of Microsoft and is an American business magnate, investor, author and philanthropist.[2][3]
In 1975, Gates and Paul Allen launched Microsoft, which became the world's largest PC software company. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, CEO and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014.[4][a] Gates stepped down as chief executive officer of Microsoft in January 2000, but he remained as chairman and created the position of chief software architect for himself.[7] In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning from full-time work at Microsoft to part-time work and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.[8] He gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig Mundie.[9] He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.[10]
Gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution. He has been criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings.[11] Later in his career, Gates pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors. He donated large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was established in 2000.
Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people.[12] As of May 2017[update], he is the richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$88.5 billion.[1] In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.[13]

Early life
Gates was born in Seattle, Washington on October 28, 1955. He is the son of William H. Gates Sr.[b] (born 1925) and Mary Maxwell Gates (1929–1994). His ancestry includes English, German, Irish, and Scots-Irish.[14][15] His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way. Gates' maternal grandfather was JW Maxwell, a national bank president. Gates has one elder sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and one younger sister, Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family, but is known as William Gates III or "Trey" because his father had the "II" suffix.[16] Early on in his life, Gates' parents had a law career in mind for him.[17] When Gates was young, his family regularly attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination.[18][19][20] The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that "it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock ... there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing".[21]




The Poker Room in Currier House at Harvard College


At 13, he enrolled in the Lakeside School, a private preparatory school.[22] When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the school's students.[23] Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. When he reflected back on that moment, he said, "There was just something neat about the machine."[24] After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside students –  Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Kent Evans –  for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.[25][26]
At the end of the ban, the four students offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for computer time. Rather than use the system via Teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system, including programs in Fortran, Lisp, and machine language. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when the company went out of business. The following year, Information Sciences, Inc. hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in COBOL, providing them computer time and royalties. After his administrators became aware of his programming abilities, Gates wrote the school's computer program to schedule students in classes. He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with "a disproportionate number of interesting girls."[27] He later stated that "it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success."[24] At age 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen, called Traf-O-Data, to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor.[28] In early 1973, Bill Gates served as a congressional page in the U.S. House of Representatives.[29]
Gates graduated from Lakeside School in 1973 and was a National Merit Scholar.[30] He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests[31] and enrolled at Harvard College in the autumn of 1973.[32] He chose a pre-law major but took mathematics and graduate level computer science courses.[33] While at Harvard, he met fellow student Steve Ballmer. Gates left Harvard after two years while Ballmer would stay and graduate magna cum laude. Years later, Ballmer succeeded Gates as CEO of Microsoft before resigning from the company in 2014.[34]
In his second year, Gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems[35] presented in a combinatorics class by Harry Lewis, one of his professors. Gates' solution held the record as the fastest version for over thirty years;[35][36] its successor is faster by only one percent.[35] His solution was later formalized in a published paper in collaboration with Harvard computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou.[37]
Gates did not have a definite study plan while he was a student at Harvard[38] and spent a lot of time using the school's computers. Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen, and he joined him at Honeywell during the summer of 1974.[39] The following year saw the release of the MITS Altair 8800 based on the Intel 8080 CPU, and Gates and Allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company.[40] Gates dropped out of Harvard at this time. He had talked this decision over with his parents, who were supportive of him after seeing how much Gates wanted to start his own company.[38] Gates explained his official status with Harvard that, "...if things [Microsoft] hadn't worked out, I could always go back to school. I was officially on [a] leave [of absence]."[41]

BASIC




MITS Altair 8800 Computer with 8-inch (200 mm) floppy disk system


After reading the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics that demonstrated the Altair 8800, Gates contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), the creators of the new microcomputer, to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform.[42] In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demo, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration, held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. Paul Allen was hired into MITS,[43] and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with Allen at MITS in Albuquerque in November 1975. They named their partnership "Micro-Soft" and had their first office located in Albuquerque.[43] Within a year, the hyphen was dropped, and on November 26, 1976, the trade name "Microsoft" was registered with the Office of the Secretary of the State of New Mexico.[43] Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.
Microsoft's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, Gates wrote an Open Letter to Hobbyists in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90% of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and by doing so the Altair "hobby market" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software.[44] This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.[43] The company moved from Albuquerque to its new home in Bellevue, Washington, on January 1, 1979.[42]
During Microsoft's early years, all employees had broad responsibility for the company's business. Gates oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well. In the first five years, Gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit.[45][unreliable source?]
IBM partnership
IBM approached Microsoft in July 1980 in reference to an operating systen for its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC.[46] Big Blue first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter. When IBM's representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system, Gates referred them to Digital Research (DRI), makers of the widely used CP/M operating system.[47] IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system. A few weeks later, Gates proposed using 86-DOS (QDOS), an operating system similar to CP/M that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC. Microsoft made a deal with SCP to become the exclusive licensing agent, and later the full owner, of 86-DOS. After adapting the operating system for the PC, Microsoft delivered it to IBM as PC DOS in exchange for a one-time fee of $50,000.[48]
Gates did not offer to transfer the copyright on the operating system, because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone IBM's system.[48] They did, and the sales of MS-DOS made Microsoft a major player in the industry.[49] Despite IBM's name on the operating system, the press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the new computer. PC Magazine asked if Gates were "the man behind the machine?",[46] and InfoWorld quoted an expert as stating "it's Gates' computer".[50] Gates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates the president of Microsoft and its board chairman.[42]
Windows
Microsoft launched its first retail version of Microsoft Windows on November 20, 1985, and in August, the company struck a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating system called OS/2. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, mounting creative differences caused the partnership to deteriorate.[51]
Management style




Bill Gates in January 2008


From Microsoft's founding in 1975 until 2006, Gates had primary responsibility for the company's product strategy. He gained a reputation for being distant from others; as early as 1981 an industry executive complained in public that "Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls."[52] Another executive recalled that after he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times, when they met again a month later Gates "won or tied every game. He had studied the game until he solved it. That is a competitor."[53]
Gates was an executve who met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers. In firsthand accounts of these meetings, he was described as being verbally combative. He also berated managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk.[54][55] He interrupted presentations with such comments "That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!"[56] and "Why don't you just give up your options and join the Peace Corps?"[57] The target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until, hopefully, Gates was fully convinced.[56] When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark sarcastically, "I'll do it over the weekend."[58][59][60]
Gates was an active software developer in Microsoft's early history, particularly on the company's programming language products, but his basic role in most of the company's history was primarily as a manager and executive. Gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the TRS-80 Model 100,[61] but as late as 1989 he wrote code that shipped with the company's products.[59] He remained interested in technical details; in 1985, Jerry Pournelle wrote that when he watched Gates announce Microsoft Excel, "Something else impressed me. Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although I'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat hack."[62] On June 15, 2006, Gates announced that he would transition out of his day-to-day role over the next two years to dedicate more time to philanthropy. He divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed Ray Ozzie in charge of day-to-day management and Craig Mundie in charge of long-term product strategy.[63]
Antitrust litigation

Gates giving his deposition at Microsoft on August 27, 1998


Many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over Microsoft's business practices have had Gates' approval. In the 1998 United States v. Microsoft case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner David Boies over the contextual meaning of words such as, "compete", "concerned", and "we". The judge and other observers in the court room were seen laughing at various points during the deposition.[64] BusinessWeek reported:

Early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying 'I don't recall,' so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle. Worse, many of the technology chief's denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail that Gates both sent and received.[65]

Gates later said he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. As to his demeanor during the deposition, he said, "Did I fence with Boies? ... I plead guilty. Whatever that penalty is should be levied against me: rudeness to Boies in the first degree."[66] Despite Gates' denials, the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed monopolization and tying, and blocking competition, both in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.[66]
Appearance in ads




Mugshots of Gates following his 1977 arrest for a traffic violation in Albuquerque, New Mexico


In 2008, Gates appeared in a series of ads to promote Microsoft. The first commercial, co-starring Jerry Seinfeld, is a 90-second talk between strangers as Seinfeld walks up on a discount shoe store (Shoe Circus) in a mall and notices Gates buying shoes inside. The salesman is trying to sell Mr. Gates shoes that are a size too big. As Gates is buying the shoes, he holds up his discount card, which uses a slightly altered version of his own mugshot of his arrest in New Mexico in 1977, for a traffic violation.[67] As they are walking out of the mall, Seinfeld asks Gates if he has melded his mind to other developers, after getting a "Yes", he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible, again getting a "Yes". Some say that this is an homage to Seinfeld's own show about "nothing" (Seinfeld).[68] In a second commercial in the series, Gates and Seinfeld are at the home of an average family trying to fit in with normal people.[69]
Post-Microsoft




Gates meeting with U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis in February 2017


Since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft, Gates has continued his philanthropy and works on other projects.
According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Gates was the world's highest-earning billionaire in 2013, as his net worth increased by US$15.8 billion to US$78.5 billion. As of January 2014, most of Gates' assets are held in Cascade Investment LLC, an entity through which he owns stakes in numerous businesses, including Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, and Corbis Corp.[70] On February 4, 2014, Gates stepped down as chairman of Microsoft to become Technology Advisor alongside new CEO Satya Nadella.[10][71]
Gates provided his perspective on a range of issues in a substantial interview that was published in the March 27, 2014 issue of Rolling Stone magazine. In the interview, Gates provided his perspective on climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: "... there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism." Gates also identified innovation as the "real driver of progress" and pronounced that "America's way better today than it's ever been."[72] Gates' days are planned for him, similar to the US President's schedule, on a minute-by-minute basis.[73]
Personal life




Bill and Melinda Gates in June 2009


Gates married Melinda French in Hawaii on January 1, 1994; he was 38 and she was 29. They have three children: Jennifer Katharine (b. 1996), Rory John (b. 1999), and Phoebe Adele (b. 2002). The family resides in a modern design mansion, which is an earth-sheltered house in the side of a hill overlooking Lake Washington in Medina near Seattle in the state of Washington, United States. According to 2007 King County public records, the total assessed value of the property (land and house) is $125 million, and the annual property taxes are $991,000. The 66,000 sq ft (6,100 m2) estate has a 60-foot (18 m) swimming pool with an underwater music system, as well as a 2,500 sq ft (230 m2) gym and a 1,000 sq ft (93 m2) dining room.[74]
In an interview with Rolling Stone, Gates stated in regard to his faith:

The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.[75]

In the same interview, Gates said: "I agree with people like Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm – not all – that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [laughs]. I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know."[75]
One of Gates' private acquisitions is the Codex Leicester, which is a collection of writings by Leonardo da Vinci that Gates bought for $30.8 million at an auction in 1994.[76] Gates is also known as an avid reader, and the ceiling of his large home library is engraved with a quotation from The Great Gatsby.[77] He also enjoys playing bridge, tennis, and golf.[78][79]
In 1999, his wealth briefly surpassed $101 billion, which caused the media to call Gates a "centibillionaire".[80] Despite his wealth and extensive business travel, Gates usually flew coach until 1997, when he bought a private jet.[81] Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the dot-com bubble burst and the multibillion-dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In a May 2006 interview, Gates commented that he wished that he were not the richest man in the world because he disliked the attention it brought.[82] In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person behind Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List.[83][84] Carlos Slim retook the position again in June 2014[85][86] (but then lost the top position back to Gates). Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from US$40 billion to more than US$82 billion.[87]
Gates has several investments outside Microsoft, which in 2006 paid him a salary of $616,667 and $350,000 bonus totalling $966,667.[88] In 1989, he founded Corbis, a digital imaging company. In 2004, he became a director of Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company headed by long-time friend Warren Buffett.[89] In 2016, he revealed that he was color-blind when discussing his gaming habits.[90]
Philanthropy

In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.[13]
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
Main article: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
Gates studied the work of Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, and in 1994, sold some of his Microsoft stock to create the "William H. Gates Foundation." In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations to create the charitable Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world's wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6 billion.[91][92] The Foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the Wellcome Trust.[93][94]
The foundation is organized into four program areas: Global Development Division, Global Health Division, United States Division, and Global Policy & Advocacy Division.[95]
Gates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of David Rockefeller as a major influence. Gates and his father met with Rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly modeled on the Rockefeller family's philanthropic focus, whereby they are interested in tackling the global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations.[96] As of 2007, Bill and Melinda Gates were the second-most generous philanthropists in America, having given over $28 billion to charity;[97] the couple plan to eventually donate 95 percent of their wealth to charity.[98]
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supports the use of genetically modified organisms in agricultural development. Specifically, the foundation is supporting the International Rice Research Institute in developing Golden Rice, a genetically modified rice variant used to combat Vitamin A deficiency.[99]
Personal
Melinda Gates suggested that people should emulate the philanthropic efforts of the Salwen family, which had sold its home and given away half of its value, as detailed in The Power of Half.[100] Gates and his wife invited Joan Salwen to Seattle to speak about what the family had done, and on December 9, 2010, Gates, investor Warren Buffett, and Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg signed a commitment they called the "Gates-Buffet Giving Pledge." The pledge is a commitment by all three to donate at least half of their wealth over the course of time to charity.[101][102][103]
Gates has recently expressed concern about the existential threats of superintelligence; in a Reddit "ask me anything", he stated that

First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned.[104][105][106][107]

In a March 2015 interview, with Baidu's CEO, Robin Li, Gates claimed he would "highly recommend" Nick Bostrom's recent work, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies.[108]
Gates has also provided personal donations to educational institutions. In 1999, Gates donated $20 million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for the construction of a computer laboratory named the "William H. Gates Building" that was designed by architect Frank Gehry. While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates.[109]
The Maxwell Dworkin Laboratory of the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences is named after the mothers of both Gates and Microsoft President Steven A. Ballmer, both of whom were students (Ballmer was a member of the School's graduating class of 1977, while Gates left his studies for Microsoft), and donated funds for the laboratory's construction.[110] Gates also donated $6 million to the construction of the Gates Computer Science Building, completed in January 1996, on the campus of Stanford University. The building contains the Computer Science Department (CSD) and the Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) of Stanford's Engineering department.[111]
On August 15, 2014, Bill Gates posted a video of himself on Facebook in which he is seen dumping a bucket of ice water on his head. Gates posted the video after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg challenged him to do so in order to raise awareness for the disease ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).[112]
Since about 2005, Bill Gates and his foundation have taken an interest in solving global sanitation problems. For example, they announced the "Reinvent the Toilet Challenge", which has received considerable media interest.[113] To raise awareness for the topic of sanitation and possible solutions, Gates drank water that was "produced from human feces" in 2014 – in fact it was produced from a sewage sludge treatment process called the Omni-processor.[114][115] In early 2015, he also appeared with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show and challenged him to see if he could taste the difference between this reclaimed water or bottled water.[116]
Bill and Melinda Gates have said that they intend to leave their three children $10 million each as their inheritance. With only $30 million kept in the family, they appear to be on a course to give away about 99.96 percent of their wealth.[117]
Criticism
In 2007, the Los Angeles Times criticized the foundation for investing its assets in companies that have been accused of worsening poverty, polluting heavily, and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell to the developing world.[118] In response to press criticism, the foundation announced a review of its investments to assess social responsibility.[119] It subsequently canceled the review and stood by its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices.[120] The Gates Millennium Scholars program has been criticized by Ernest W. Lefever for its exclusion of Caucasian students.[121] The scholarship program is administered by the United Negro College Fund.[122] In 2014, Bill Gates sparked a protest in Vancouver when he decided to donate 50 million dollars to UNAIDS through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for the purpose of mass circumcision in Zambia and Swaziland.[123][124]
Charity Sports Events
On April 29, 2017, Bill Gates partnered with Swiss Tennis legend Roger Federer in playing a non competitive tennis match to a packed house at Key Arena in Seattle. The event was in support of Roger Federer Foundation's charity efforts in Africa.[125] Federer and Gates played against John Isner and Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McReady. Gates and Federer won the game 6-4.

Gates was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005.[141] In November 2006, he was awarded the Placard of the Order of the Aztec Eagle, together with his wife Melinda who was awarded the Insignia of the same order, both for their philanthropic work around the world in the areas of health and education, particularly in Mexico, and specifically in the program "Un país de lectores".[142] Gates received the 2010 Bower Award for Business Leadership from The Franklin Institute for his achievements at Microsoft and his philanthropic work.[143] Also in 2010, he was honored with the Silver Buffalo Award by the Boy Scouts of America, its highest award for adults, for his service to youth.[144]

William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is a co-founder of Microsoft and is an American business magnate, investor, author and philanthropist.[2][3]
In 1975, Gates and Paul Allen launched Microsoft, which became the world's largest PC software company. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, CEO and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014.[4][a] Gates stepped down as chief executive officer of Microsoft in January 2000, but he remained as chairman and created the position of chief software architect for himself.[7] In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning from full-time work at Microsoft to part-time work and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.[8] He gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig Mundie.[9] He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.[10]
Gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution. He has been criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings.[11] Later in his career, Gates pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors. He donated large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was established in 2000.
Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people.[12] As of May 2017[update], he is the richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$88.5 billion.[1] In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.[13]

Early life
Gates was born in Seattle, Washington on October 28, 1955. He is the son of William H. Gates Sr.[b] (born 1925) and Mary Maxwell Gates (1929–1994). His ancestry includes English, German, Irish, and Scots-Irish.[14][15] His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way. Gates' maternal grandfather was JW Maxwell, a national bank president. Gates has one elder sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and one younger sister, Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family, but is known as William Gates III or "Trey" because his father had the "II" suffix.[16] Early on in his life, Gates' parents had a law career in mind for him.[17] When Gates was young, his family regularly attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination.[18][19][20] The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that "it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock ... there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing".[21]




The Poker Room in Currier House at Harvard College


At 13, he enrolled in the Lakeside School, a private preparatory school.[22] When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the school's students.[23] Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. When he reflected back on that moment, he said, "There was just something neat about the machine."[24] After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside students –  Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Kent Evans –  for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.[25][26]
At the end of the ban, the four students offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for computer time. Rather than use the system via Teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system, including programs in Fortran, Lisp, and machine language. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when the company went out of business. The following year, Information Sciences, Inc. hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in COBOL, providing them computer time and royalties. After his administrators became aware of his programming abilities, Gates wrote the school's computer program to schedule students in classes. He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with "a disproportionate number of interesting girls."[27] He later stated that "it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success."[24] At age 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen, called Traf-O-Data, to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor.[28] In early 1973, Bill Gates served as a congressional page in the U.S. House of Representatives.[29]
Gates graduated from Lakeside School in 1973 and was a National Merit Scholar.[30] He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests[31] and enrolled at Harvard College in the autumn of 1973.[32] He chose a pre-law major but took mathematics and graduate level computer science courses.[33] While at Harvard, he met fellow student Steve Ballmer. Gates left Harvard after two years while Ballmer would stay and graduate magna cum laude. Years later, Ballmer succeeded Gates as CEO of Microsoft before resigning from the company in 2014.[34]
In his second year, Gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems[35] presented in a combinatorics class by Harry Lewis, one of his professors. Gates' solution held the record as the fastest version for over thirty years;[35][36] its successor is faster by only one percent.[35] His solution was later formalized in a published paper in collaboration with Harvard computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou.[37]
Gates did not have a definite study plan while he was a student at Harvard[38] and spent a lot of time using the school's computers. Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen, and he joined him at Honeywell during the summer of 1974.[39] The following year saw the release of the MITS Altair 8800 based on the Intel 8080 CPU, and Gates and Allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company.[40] Gates dropped out of Harvard at this time. He had talked this decision over with his parents, who were supportive of him after seeing how much Gates wanted to start his own company.[38] Gates explained his official status with Harvard that, "...if things [Microsoft] hadn't worked out, I could always go back to school. I was officially on [a] leave [of absence]."[41]

BASIC




MITS Altair 8800 Computer with 8-inch (200 mm) floppy disk system


After reading the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics that demonstrated the Altair 8800, Gates contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), the creators of the new microcomputer, to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform.[42] In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demo, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration, held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. Paul Allen was hired into MITS,[43] and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with Allen at MITS in Albuquerque in November 1975. They named their partnership "Micro-Soft" and had their first office located in Albuquerque.[43] Within a year, the hyphen was dropped, and on November 26, 1976, the trade name "Microsoft" was registered with the Office of the Secretary of the State of New Mexico.[43] Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.
Microsoft's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, Gates wrote an Open Letter to Hobbyists in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90% of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and by doing so the Altair "hobby market" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software.[44] This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.[43] The company moved from Albuquerque to its new home in Bellevue, Washington, on January 1, 1979.[42]
During Microsoft's early years, all employees had broad responsibility for the company's business. Gates oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well. In the first five years, Gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit.[45][unreliable source?]
IBM partnership
IBM approached Microsoft in July 1980 in reference to an operating systen for its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC.[46] Big Blue first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter. When IBM's representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system, Gates referred them to Digital Research (DRI), makers of the widely used CP/M operating system.[47] IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system. A few weeks later, Gates proposed using 86-DOS (QDOS), an operating system similar to CP/M that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC. Microsoft made a deal with SCP to become the exclusive licensing agent, and later the full owner, of 86-DOS. After adapting the operating system for the PC, Microsoft delivered it to IBM as PC DOS in exchange for a one-time fee of $50,000.[48]
Gates did not offer to transfer the copyright on the operating system, because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone IBM's system.[48] They did, and the sales of MS-DOS made Microsoft a major player in the industry.[49] Despite IBM's name on the operating system, the press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the new computer. PC Magazine asked if Gates were "the man behind the machine?",[46] and InfoWorld quoted an expert as stating "it's Gates' computer".[50] Gates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates the president of Microsoft and its board chairman.[42]
Windows
Microsoft launched its first retail version of Microsoft Windows on November 20, 1985, and in August, the company struck a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating system called OS/2. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, mounting creative differences caused the partnership to deteriorate.[51]
Management style




Bill Gates in January 2008


From Microsoft's founding in 1975 until 2006, Gates had primary responsibility for the company's product strategy. He gained a reputation for being distant from others; as early as 1981 an industry executive complained in public that "Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls."[52] Another executive recalled that after he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times, when they met again a month later Gates "won or tied every game. He had studied the game until he solved it. That is a competitor."[53]
Gates was an executve who met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers. In firsthand accounts of these meetings, he was described as being verbally combative. He also berated managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk.[54][55] He interrupted presentations with such comments "That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!"[56] and "Why don't you just give up your options and join the Peace Corps?"[57] The target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until, hopefully, Gates was fully convinced.[56] When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark sarcastically, "I'll do it over the weekend."[58][59][60]
Gates was an active software developer in Microsoft's early history, particularly on the company's programming language products, but his basic role in most of the company's history was primarily as a manager and executive. Gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the TRS-80 Model 100,[61] but as late as 1989 he wrote code that shipped with the company's products.[59] He remained interested in technical details; in 1985, Jerry Pournelle wrote that when he watched Gates announce Microsoft Excel, "Something else impressed me. Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although I'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat hack."[62] On June 15, 2006, Gates announced that he would transition out of his day-to-day role over the next two years to dedicate more time to philanthropy. He divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed Ray Ozzie in charge of day-to-day management and Craig Mundie in charge of long-term product strategy.[63]
Antitrust litigation
Further information: United States Microsoft antitrust case and European Union Microsoft competition case




Gates giving his deposition at Microsoft on August 27, 1998


Many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over Microsoft's business practices have had Gates' approval. In the 1998 United States v. Microsoft case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner David Boies over the contextual meaning of words such as, "compete", "concerned", and "we". The judge and other observers in the court room were seen laughing at various points during the deposition.[64] BusinessWeek reported:

Early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying 'I don't recall,' so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle. Worse, many of the technology chief's denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail that Gates both sent and received.[65]

Gates later said he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. As to his demeanor during the deposition, he said, "Did I fence with Boies? ... I plead guilty. Whatever that penalty is should be levied against me: rudeness to Boies in the first degree."[66] Despite Gates' denials, the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed monopolization and tying, and blocking competition, both in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.[66]
Appearance in ads




Mugshots of Gates following his 1977 arrest for a traffic violation in Albuquerque, New Mexico


In 2008, Gates appeared in a series of ads to promote Microsoft. The first commercial, co-starring Jerry Seinfeld, is a 90-second talk between strangers as Seinfeld walks up on a discount shoe store (Shoe Circus) in a mall and notices Gates buying shoes inside. The salesman is trying to sell Mr. Gates shoes that are a size too big. As Gates is buying the shoes, he holds up his discount card, which uses a slightly altered version of his own mugshot of his arrest in New Mexico in 1977, for a traffic violation.[67] As they are walking out of the mall, Seinfeld asks Gates if he has melded his mind to other developers, after getting a "Yes", he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible, again getting a "Yes". Some say that this is an homage to Seinfeld's own show about "nothing" (Seinfeld).[68] In a second commercial in the series, Gates and Seinfeld are at the home of an average family trying to fit in with normal people.[69]
Post-Microsoft




Gates meeting with U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis in February 2017


Since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft, Gates has continued his philanthropy and works on other projects.
According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Gates was the world's highest-earning billionaire in 2013, as his net worth increased by US$15.8 billion to US$78.5 billion. As of January 2014, most of Gates' assets are held in Cascade Investment LLC, an entity through which he owns stakes in numerous businesses, including Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, and Corbis Corp.[70] On February 4, 2014, Gates stepped down as chairman of Microsoft to become Technology Advisor alongside new CEO Satya Nadella.[10][71]
Gates provided his perspective on a range of issues in a substantial interview that was published in the March 27, 2014 issue of Rolling Stone magazine. In the interview, Gates provided his perspective on climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: "... there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism." Gates also identified innovation as the "real driver of progress" and pronounced that "America's way better today than it's ever been."[72] Gates' days are planned for him, similar to the US President's schedule, on a minute-by-minute basis.[73]
Personal life




Bill and Melinda Gates in June 2009


Gates married Melinda French in Hawaii on January 1, 1994; he was 38 and she was 29. They have three children: Jennifer Katharine (b. 1996), Rory John (b. 1999), and Phoebe Adele (b. 2002). The family resides in a modern design mansion, which is an earth-sheltered house in the side of a hill overlooking Lake Washington in Medina near Seattle in the state of Washington, United States. According to 2007 King County public records, the total assessed value of the property (land and house) is $125 million, and the annual property taxes are $991,000. The 66,000 sq ft (6,100 m2) estate has a 60-foot (18 m) swimming pool with an underwater music system, as well as a 2,500 sq ft (230 m2) gym and a 1,000 sq ft (93 m2) dining room.[74]
In an interview with Rolling Stone, Gates stated in regard to his faith:

The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.[75]

In the same interview, Gates said: "I agree with people like Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm – not all – that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [laughs]. I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know."[75]
One of Gates' private acquisitions is the Codex Leicester, which is a collection of writings by Leonardo da Vinci that Gates bought for $30.8 million at an auction in 1994.[76] Gates is also known as an avid reader, and the ceiling of his large home library is engraved with a quotation from The Great Gatsby.[77] He also enjoys playing bridge, tennis, and golf.[78][79]
In 1999, his wealth briefly surpassed $101 billion, which caused the media to call Gates a "centibillionaire".[80] Despite his wealth and extensive business travel, Gates usually flew coach until 1997, when he bought a private jet.[81] Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the dot-com bubble burst and the multibillion-dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In a May 2006 interview, Gates commented that he wished that he were not the richest man in the world because he disliked the attention it brought.[82] In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person behind Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List.[83][84] Carlos Slim retook the position again in June 2014[85][86] (but then lost the top position back to Gates). Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from US$40 billion to more than US$82 billion.[87]
Gates has several investments outside Microsoft, which in 2006 paid him a salary of $616,667 and $350,000 bonus totalling $966,667.[88] In 1989, he founded Corbis, a digital imaging company. In 2004, he became a director of Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company headed by long-time friend Warren Buffett.[89] In 2016, he revealed that he was color-blind when discussing his gaming habits.[90]
Philanthropy

In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.[13]
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
Main article: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
Gates studied the work of Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, and in 1994, sold some of his Microsoft stock to create the "William H. Gates Foundation." In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations to create the charitable Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world's wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6 billion.[91][92] The Foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the Wellcome Trust.[93][94]
The foundation is organized into four program areas: Global Development Division, Global Health Division, United States Division, and Global Policy & Advocacy Division.[95]
Gates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of David Rockefeller as a major influence. Gates and his father met with Rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly modeled on the Rockefeller family's philanthropic focus, whereby they are interested in tackling the global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations.[96] As of 2007, Bill and Melinda Gates were the second-most generous philanthropists in America, having given over $28 billion to charity;[97] the couple plan to eventually donate 95 percent of their wealth to charity.[98]
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supports the use of genetically modified organisms in agricultural development. Specifically, the foundation is supporting the International Rice Research Institute in developing Golden Rice, a genetically modified rice variant used to combat Vitamin A deficiency.[99]
Personal
Melinda Gates suggested that people should emulate the philanthropic efforts of the Salwen family, which had sold its home and given away half of its value, as detailed in The Power of Half.[100] Gates and his wife invited Joan Salwen to Seattle to speak about what the family had done, and on December 9, 2010, Gates, investor Warren Buffett, and Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg signed a commitment they called the "Gates-Buffet Giving Pledge." The pledge is a commitment by all three to donate at least half of their wealth over the course of time to charity.[101][102][103]
Gates has recently expressed concern about the existential threats of superintelligence; in a Reddit "ask me anything", he stated that

First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned.[104][105][106][107]

In a March 2015 interview, with Baidu's CEO, Robin Li, Gates claimed he would "highly recommend" Nick Bostrom's recent work, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies.[108]
Gates has also provided personal donations to educational institutions. In 1999, Gates donated $20 million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for the construction of a computer laboratory named the "William H. Gates Building" that was designed by architect Frank Gehry. While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates.[109]
The Maxwell Dworkin Laboratory of the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences is named after the mothers of both Gates and Microsoft President Steven A. Ballmer, both of whom were students (Ballmer was a member of the School's graduating class of 1977, while Gates left his studies for Microsoft), and donated funds for the laboratory's construction.[110] Gates also donated $6 million to the construction of the Gates Computer Science Building, completed in January 1996, on the campus of Stanford University. The building contains the Computer Science Department (CSD) and the Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) of Stanford's Engineering department.[111]
On August 15, 2014, Bill Gates posted a video of himself on Facebook in which he is seen dumping a bucket of ice water on his head. Gates posted the video after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg challenged him to do so in order to raise awareness for the disease ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).[112]
Since about 2005, Bill Gates and his foundation have taken an interest in solving global sanitation problems. For example, they announced the "Reinvent the Toilet Challenge", which has received considerable media interest.[113] To raise awareness for the topic of sanitation and possible solutions, Gates drank water that was "produced from human feces" in 2014 – in fact it was produced from a sewage sludge treatment process called the Omni-processor.[114][115] In early 2015, he also appeared with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show and challenged him to see if he could taste the difference between this reclaimed water or bottled water.[116]
Bill and Melinda Gates have said that they intend to leave their three children $10 million each as their inheritance. With only $30 million kept in the family, they appear to be on a course to give away about 99.96 percent of their wealth.[117]
Criticism
In 2007, the Los Angeles Times criticized the foundation for investing its assets in companies that have been accused of worsening poverty, polluting heavily, and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell to the developing world.[118] In response to press criticism, the foundation announced a review of its investments to assess social responsibility.[119] It subsequently canceled the review and stood by its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices.[120] The Gates Millennium Scholars program has been criticized by Ernest W. Lefever for its exclusion of Caucasian students.[121] The scholarship program is administered by the United Negro College Fund.[122] In 2014, Bill Gates sparked a protest in Vancouver when he decided to donate 50 million dollars to UNAIDS through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for the purpose of mass circumcision in Zambia and Swaziland.[123][124]
Charity Sports Events
On April 29, 2017, Bill Gates partnered with Swiss Tennis legend Roger Federer in playing a non competitive tennis match to a packed house at Key Arena in Seattle. The event was in support of Roger Federer Foundation's charity efforts in Africa.[125] Federer and Gates played against John Isner and Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McReady. Gates and Federer won the game 6-4.

Gates was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005.[141] In November 2006, he was awarded the Placard of the Order of the Aztec Eagle, together with his wife Melinda who was awarded the Insignia of the same order, both for their philanthropic work around the world in the areas of health and education, particularly in Mexico, and specifically in the program "Un país de lectores".[142] Gates received the 2010 Bower Award for Business Leadership from The Franklin Institute for his achievements at Microsoft and his philanthropic work.[143] Also in 2010, he was honored with the Silver Buffalo Award by the Boy Scouts of America, its highest award for adults, for his service to youth.[144]

William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is a co-founder of Microsoft and is an American business magnate, investor, author and philanthropist.[2][3]
In 1975, Gates and Paul Allen launched Microsoft, which became the world's largest PC software company. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, CEO and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014.[4][a] Gates stepped down as chief executive officer of Microsoft in January 2000, but he remained as chairman and created the position of chief software architect for himself.[7] In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning from full-time work at Microsoft to part-time work and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.[8] He gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig Mundie.[9] He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.[10]
Gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution. He has been criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings.[11] Later in his career, Gates pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors. He donated large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was established in 2000.
Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people.[12] As of May 2017[update], he is the richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$88.5 billion.[1] In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.[13]

Early life
Gates was born in Seattle, Washington on October 28, 1955. He is the son of William H. Gates Sr.[b] (born 1925) and Mary Maxwell Gates (1929–1994). His ancestry includes English, German, Irish, and Scots-Irish.[14][15] His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way. Gates' maternal grandfather was JW Maxwell, a national bank president. Gates has one elder sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and one younger sister, Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family, but is known as William Gates III or "Trey" because his father had the "II" suffix.[16] Early on in his life, Gates' parents had a law career in mind for him.[17] When Gates was young, his family regularly attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination.[18][19][20] The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that "it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock ... there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing".[21]




The Poker Room in Currier House at Harvard College


At 13, he enrolled in the Lakeside School, a private preparatory school.[22] When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the school's students.[23] Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. When he reflected back on that moment, he said, "There was just something neat about the machine."[24] After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside students –  Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Kent Evans –  for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.[25][26]
At the end of the ban, the four students offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for computer time. Rather than use the system via Teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system, including programs in Fortran, Lisp, and machine language. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when the company went out of business. The following year, Information Sciences, Inc. hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in COBOL, providing them computer time and royalties. After his administrators became aware of his programming abilities, Gates wrote the school's computer program to schedule students in classes. He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with "a disproportionate number of interesting girls."[27] He later stated that "it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success."[24] At age 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen, called Traf-O-Data, to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor.[28] In early 1973, Bill Gates served as a congressional page in the U.S. House of Representatives.[29]
Gates graduated from Lakeside School in 1973 and was a National Merit Scholar.[30] He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests[31] and enrolled at Harvard College in the autumn of 1973.[32] He chose a pre-law major but took mathematics and graduate level computer science courses.[33] While at Harvard, he met fellow student Steve Ballmer. Gates left Harvard after two years while Ballmer would stay and graduate magna cum laude. Years later, Ballmer succeeded Gates as CEO of Microsoft before resigning from the company in 2014.[34]
In his second year, Gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems[35] presented in a combinatorics class by Harry Lewis, one of his professors. Gates' solution held the record as the fastest version for over thirty years;[35][36] its successor is faster by only one percent.[35] His solution was later formalized in a published paper in collaboration with Harvard computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou.[37]
Gates did not have a definite study plan while he was a student at Harvard[38] and spent a lot of time using the school's computers. Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen, and he joined him at Honeywell during the summer of 1974.[39] The following year saw the release of the MITS Altair 8800 based on the Intel 8080 CPU, and Gates and Allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company.[40] Gates dropped out of Harvard at this time. He had talked this decision over with his parents, who were supportive of him after seeing how much Gates wanted to start his own company.[38] Gates explained his official status with Harvard that, "...if things [Microsoft] hadn't worked out, I could always go back to school. I was officially on [a] leave [of absence]."[41]

BASIC




MITS Altair 8800 Computer with 8-inch (200 mm) floppy disk system


After reading the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics that demonstrated the Altair 8800, Gates contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), the creators of the new microcomputer, to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform.[42] In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demo, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration, held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. Paul Allen was hired into MITS,[43] and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with Allen at MITS in Albuquerque in November 1975. They named their partnership "Micro-Soft" and had their first office located in Albuquerque.[43] Within a year, the hyphen was dropped, and on November 26, 1976, the trade name "Microsoft" was registered with the Office of the Secretary of the State of New Mexico.[43] Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.
Microsoft's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, Gates wrote an Open Letter to Hobbyists in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90% of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and by doing so the Altair "hobby market" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software.[44] This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.[43] The company moved from Albuquerque to its new home in Bellevue, Washington, on January 1, 1979.[42]
During Microsoft's early years, all employees had broad responsibility for the company's business. Gates oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well. In the first five years, Gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit.[45][unreliable source?]
IBM partnership
IBM approached Microsoft in July 1980 in reference to an operating systen for its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC.[46] Big Blue first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter. When IBM's representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system, Gates referred them to Digital Research (DRI), makers of the widely used CP/M operating system.[47] IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system. A few weeks later, Gates proposed using 86-DOS (QDOS), an operating system similar to CP/M that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC. Microsoft made a deal with SCP to become the exclusive licensing agent, and later the full owner, of 86-DOS. After adapting the operating system for the PC, Microsoft delivered it to IBM as PC DOS in exchange for a one-time fee of $50,000.[48]
Gates did not offer to transfer the copyright on the operating system, because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone IBM's system.[48] They did, and the sales of MS-DOS made Microsoft a major player in the industry.[49] Despite IBM's name on the operating system, the press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the new computer. PC Magazine asked if Gates were "the man behind the machine?",[46] and InfoWorld quoted an expert as stating "it's Gates' computer".[50] Gates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates the president of Microsoft and its board chairman.[42]
Windows
Microsoft launched its first retail version of Microsoft Windows on November 20, 1985, and in August, the company struck a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating system called OS/2. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, mounting creative differences caused the partnership to deteriorate.[51]
Management style




Bill Gates in January 2008


From Microsoft's founding in 1975 until 2006, Gates had primary responsibility for the company's product strategy. He gained a reputation for being distant from others; as early as 1981 an industry executive complained in public that "Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls."[52] Another executive recalled that after he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times, when they met again a month later Gates "won or tied every game. He had studied the game until he solved it. That is a competitor."[53]
Gates was an executve who met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers. In firsthand accounts of these meetings, he was described as being verbally combative. He also berated managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk.[54][55] He interrupted presentations with such comments "That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!"[56] and "Why don't you just give up your options and join the Peace Corps?"[57] The target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until, hopefully, Gates was fully convinced.[56] When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark sarcastically, "I'll do it over the weekend."[58][59][60]
Gates was an active software developer in Microsoft's early history, particularly on the company's programming language products, but his basic role in most of the company's history was primarily as a manager and executive. Gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the TRS-80 Model 100,[61] but as late as 1989 he wrote code that shipped with the company's products.[59] He remained interested in technical details; in 1985, Jerry Pournelle wrote that when he watched Gates announce Microsoft Excel, "Something else impressed me. Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although I'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat hack."[62] On June 15, 2006, Gates announced that he would transition out of his day-to-day role over the next two years to dedicate more time to philanthropy. He divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed Ray Ozzie in charge of day-to-day management and Craig Mundie in charge of long-term product strategy.[63]
Antitrust litigation
Further information: United States Microsoft antitrust case and European Union Microsoft competition case




Gates giving his deposition at Microsoft on August 27, 1998


Many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over Microsoft's business practices have had Gates' approval. In the 1998 United States v. Microsoft case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner David Boies over the contextual meaning of words such as, "compete", "concerned", and "we". The judge and other observers in the court room were seen laughing at various points during the deposition.[64] BusinessWeek reported:

Early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying 'I don't recall,' so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle. Worse, many of the technology chief's denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail that Gates both sent and received.[65]

Gates later said he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. As to his demeanor during the deposition, he said, "Did I fence with Boies? ... I plead guilty. Whatever that penalty is should be levied against me: rudeness to Boies in the first degree."[66] Despite Gates' denials, the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed monopolization and tying, and blocking competition, both in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.[66]
Appearance in ads




Mugshots of Gates following his 1977 arrest for a traffic violation in Albuquerque, New Mexico


In 2008, Gates appeared in a series of ads to promote Microsoft. The first commercial, co-starring Jerry Seinfeld, is a 90-second talk between strangers as Seinfeld walks up on a discount shoe store (Shoe Circus) in a mall and notices Gates buying shoes inside. The salesman is trying to sell Mr. Gates shoes that are a size too big. As Gates is buying the shoes, he holds up his discount card, which uses a slightly altered version of his own mugshot of his arrest in New Mexico in 1977, for a traffic violation.[67] As they are walking out of the mall, Seinfeld asks Gates if he has melded his mind to other developers, after getting a "Yes", he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible, again getting a "Yes". Some say that this is an homage to Seinfeld's own show about "nothing" (Seinfeld).[68] In a second commercial in the series, Gates and Seinfeld are at the home of an average family trying to fit in with normal people.[69]
Post-Microsoft




Gates meeting with U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis in February 2017


Since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft, Gates has continued his philanthropy and works on other projects.
According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Gates was the world's highest-earning billionaire in 2013, as his net worth increased by US$15.8 billion to US$78.5 billion. As of January 2014, most of Gates' assets are held in Cascade Investment LLC, an entity through which he owns stakes in numerous businesses, including Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, and Corbis Corp.[70] On February 4, 2014, Gates stepped down as chairman of Microsoft to become Technology Advisor alongside new CEO Satya Nadella.[10][71]
Gates provided his perspective on a range of issues in a substantial interview that was published in the March 27, 2014 issue of Rolling Stone magazine. In the interview, Gates provided his perspective on climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: "... there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism." Gates also identified innovation as the "real driver of progress" and pronounced that "America's way better today than it's ever been."[72] Gates' days are planned for him, similar to the US President's schedule, on a minute-by-minute basis.[73]
Personal life




Bill and Melinda Gates in June 2009


Gates married Melinda French in Hawaii on January 1, 1994; he was 38 and she was 29. They have three children: Jennifer Katharine (b. 1996), Rory John (b. 1999), and Phoebe Adele (b. 2002). The family resides in a modern design mansion, which is an earth-sheltered house in the side of a hill overlooking Lake Washington in Medina near Seattle in the state of Washington, United States. According to 2007 King County public records, the total assessed value of the property (land and house) is $125 million, and the annual property taxes are $991,000. The 66,000 sq ft (6,100 m2) estate has a 60-foot (18 m) swimming pool with an underwater music system, as well as a 2,500 sq ft (230 m2) gym and a 1,000 sq ft (93 m2) dining room.[74]
In an interview with Rolling Stone, Gates stated in regard to his faith:

The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.[75]

In the same interview, Gates said: "I agree with people like Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm – not all – that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [laughs]. I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know."[75]
One of Gates' private acquisitions is the Codex Leicester, which is a collection of writings by Leonardo da Vinci that Gates bought for $30.8 million at an auction in 1994.[76] Gates is also known as an avid reader, and the ceiling of his large home library is engraved with a quotation from The Great Gatsby.[77] He also enjoys playing bridge, tennis, and golf.[78][79]
In 1999, his wealth briefly surpassed $101 billion, which caused the media to call Gates a "centibillionaire".[80] Despite his wealth and extensive business travel, Gates usually flew coach until 1997, when he bought a private jet.[81] Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the dot-com bubble burst and the multibillion-dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In a May 2006 interview, Gates commented that he wished that he were not the richest man in the world because he disliked the attention it brought.[82] In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person behind Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List.[83][84] Carlos Slim retook the position again in June 2014[85][86] (but then lost the top position back to Gates). Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from US$40 billion to more than US$82 billion.[87]
Gates has several investments outside Microsoft, which in 2006 paid him a salary of $616,667 and $350,000 bonus totalling $966,667.[88] In 1989, he founded Corbis, a digital imaging company. In 2004, he became a director of Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company headed by long-time friend Warren Buffett.[89] In 2016, he revealed that he was color-blind when discussing his gaming habits.[90]
Philanthropy

In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.[13]
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
Main article: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
Gates studied the work of Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, and in 1994, sold some of his Microsoft stock to create the "William H. Gates Foundation." In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations to create the charitable Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world's wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6 billion.[91][92] The Foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the Wellcome Trust.[93][94]
The foundation is organized into four program areas: Global Development Division, Global Health Division, United States Division, and Global Policy & Advocacy Division.[95]
Gates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of David Rockefeller as a major influence. Gates and his father met with Rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly modeled on the Rockefeller family's philanthropic focus, whereby they are interested in tackling the global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations.[96] As of 2007, Bill and Melinda Gates were the second-most generous philanthropists in America, having given over $28 billion to charity;[97] the couple plan to eventually donate 95 percent of their wealth to charity.[98]
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supports the use of genetically modified organisms in agricultural development. Specifically, the foundation is supporting the International Rice Research Institute in developing Golden Rice, a genetically modified rice variant used to combat Vitamin A deficiency.[99]
Personal
Melinda Gates suggested that people should emulate the philanthropic efforts of the Salwen family, which had sold its home and given away half of its value, as detailed in The Power of Half.[100] Gates and his wife invited Joan Salwen to Seattle to speak about what the family had done, and on December 9, 2010, Gates, investor Warren Buffett, and Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg signed a commitment they called the "Gates-Buffet Giving Pledge." The pledge is a commitment by all three to donate at least half of their wealth over the course of time to charity.[101][102][103]
Gates has recently expressed concern about the existential threats of superintelligence; in a Reddit "ask me anything", he stated that

First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned.[104][105][106][107]

In a March 2015 interview, with Baidu's CEO, Robin Li, Gates claimed he would "highly recommend" Nick Bostrom's recent work, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies.[108]
Gates has also provided personal donations to educational institutions. In 1999, Gates donated $20 million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for the construction of a computer laboratory named the "William H. Gates Building" that was designed by architect Frank Gehry. While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates.[109]
The Maxwell Dworkin Laboratory of the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences is named after the mothers of both Gates and Microsoft President Steven A. Ballmer, both of whom were students (Ballmer was a member of the School's graduating class of 1977, while Gates left his studies for Microsoft), and donated funds for the laboratory's construction.[110] Gates also donated $6 million to the construction of the Gates Computer Science Building, completed in January 1996, on the campus of Stanford University. The building contains the Computer Science Department (CSD) and the Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) of Stanford's Engineering department.[111]
On August 15, 2014, Bill Gates posted a video of himself on Facebook in which he is seen dumping a bucket of ice water on his head. Gates posted the video after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg challenged him to do so in order to raise awareness for the disease ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).[112]
Since about 2005, Bill Gates and his foundation have taken an interest in solving global sanitation problems. For example, they announced the "Reinvent the Toilet Challenge", which has received considerable media interest.[113] To raise awareness for the topic of sanitation and possible solutions, Gates drank water that was "produced from human feces" in 2014 – in fact it was produced from a sewage sludge treatment process called the Omni-processor.[114][115] In early 2015, he also appeared with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show and challenged him to see if he could taste the difference between this reclaimed water or bottled water.[116]
Bill and Melinda Gates have said that they intend to leave their three children $10 million each as their inheritance. With only $30 million kept in the family, they appear to be on a course to give away about 99.96 percent of their wealth.[117]
Criticism
In 2007, the Los Angeles Times criticized the foundation for investing its assets in companies that have been accused of worsening poverty, polluting heavily, and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell to the developing world.[118] In response to press criticism, the foundation announced a review of its investments to assess social responsibility.[119] It subsequently canceled the review and stood by its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices.[120] The Gates Millennium Scholars program has been criticized by Ernest W. Lefever for its exclusion of Caucasian students.[121] The scholarship program is administered by the United Negro College Fund.[122] In 2014, Bill Gates sparked a protest in Vancouver when he decided to donate 50 million dollars to UNAIDS through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for the purpose of mass circumcision in Zambia and Swaziland.[123][124]
Charity Sports Events
On April 29, 2017, Bill Gates partnered with Swiss Tennis legend Roger Federer in playing a non competitive tennis match to a packed house at Key Arena in Seattle. The event was in support of Roger Federer Foundation's charity efforts in Africa.[125] Federer and Gates played against John Isner and Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McReady. Gates and Federer won the game 6-4.

Bill and Melinda Gates
William Henry Gates III (1955- ) earned his tremendous wealth as software engineer, co-founder (with friend Paul Allen) and chief executive officer of Microsoft (one of the largest technology corporations). Making a tremendous impact on philanthropy, Gates and his wife have given $24 billion to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The foundation's focus includes global health and population control programs, increased library technology, minority scholarships, and education reform. It has had tremendous impact on AIDS in Africa, and health care and immunizations in developing countries.Authored by Crystal Jones
Biographical Highlights 
Bill and Melinda Gates are co-chairs and trustees of the largest independent charitable foundation in the world. The foundation, currently endowed at $39.6 billion, gave grants totaling $3.9 billion to various projects throughout the world in 2015. They intend to give away the vast majority of their accumulated wealth (Becraft, 2014). It states on their website that Bill and Melinda are "impatient optimists working to reduce inequity." Prior to their status as philanthropists they both enjoyed lucrative and fulfilling careers at Microsoft, the company founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975 that made the computer something every person is able to use. Melinda French Gates was the general manager of information products at Microsoft and oversaw 300 employees before she met and married Bill Gates (Sellars, 2016). 

Historic Roots
William Henry Gates III, or Bill Gates, was born in 1955. His father, William Henry Gates II (1925-present) made his living as an attorney, and Mary Maxwell Gates (1929-1994), was a schoolteacher. When his father's practice became very successful, Mary left the classroom and became engaged in civic work in and around Seattle, Washington. While growing up Gates' parents exposed him and his two sisters to a wide variety of activities related to their volunteer activities and engaged them, at a very young age, in discussions about how decisions were made at these organizations (Becraft 2014).
In 1968, Gates had his first programming experience at Lakeside High School in Seattle, Washington (a private school in Bellevue, Seattle). Gates and his friend, Paul Allen had access to a computer that had recently been invented and the teachers let the students take the lead in learning to use this new technology. Gates and Allen mastered this technology and started making money writing computer code for the school and companies in the Pacific Northwest (Becraft 2014). As a senior, Gates applied to three colleges: Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. He was accepted to all three, and chose Harvard. It is said that Allen warned him, "there are going to be some guys at Harvard who are smarter than you, " and Gates replied, "'No way! No way!'"(Isaacson 2013).
Allen dropped out of college and moved to Cambridge during Gates' time at Harvard. With access to a computer created for use by the U.S. government that was housed at Harvard, they set out to write software that would make it possible for hobbyists to create their own programs on a computer called Altair. After two years at Harvard, Gates dropped out to continue his partnership with Allen. They wrote an interpreter for the programming language known as BASIC that would run on Altair’s Intel 8080 microprocessor. It would become the first commercial native high-level programming language for a microprocessor. In other words, it would launch the personal computer software industry (Isaacson 2013).
Melinda French was born in 1964. Her father was an aerospace engineer and her mother was a stay-at-home mom who regretted the fact that she was not able to attend college. French attended Ursuline Academy, an all-girls Catholic high school in Dallas. Her math and computer science teacher, Susan Bauer, recalls that every day French had a new goal ranging from running a mile to learning a new word. Her senior year in high school, 1982, she was chosen to be the Valedictorian and her philanthropic roots were expressed in her speech: "If you are successful, it is because somewhere, sometime, someone gave you a life or an idea that started you in the right direction. Remember also that you are indebted to life until you help some less fortunate person, just as you were helped"(Sellars 2016).
French was accepted at Notre Dame but decided to attend Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, earning her Bachelor's of Arts degree in business, computer science and engineering (McGoey, 2015, p 116). She later earned a Master's in Business Administration from Duke's Fuqua School of Business in 1987. After graduate school, she began her career as a marketing manager for Microsoft working with the product we now know as Microsoft Word (Sellars 2016).
In 1993 Gates and French had been dating for over 5 years when they decided to get married. They started talking about giving Gates' money away by creating a foundation because his worth had reach $7.3 billion at this time, but he was not interested in another "entity." Gates' mother, Mary, was fighting breast cancer prior to their marriage and she wrote a letter to French with advice about marriage and life that said, "From those to whom much is given, much is expected." Bill Gates and Melinda French were married in 1994. Soon after the wedding, Mary Gates died and the Gates's endowed a $10 million scholarship at the University of Washington in her name (Sellars 2016). Twelve months after the wedding , Bill and Melinda established the William H. Gates Foundation, financed through a gift of $94 million. Run by Gates' father, William, this foundation had two main priorities: community development in the Pacific Northwest and improving global health. In 1997, the Gates's expanded into education. Through a gift of $200 million, they established a second fund, the Gates Library Foundation built on an earlier program initiated at Microsoft-donating personal computer software to libraries. In 2000, with the help of his father, chief executive officer of the William H. Gates Foundation, and Patty Stonesifer, chief executive officer of the Gates Library Foundation, Bill and Melinda merged these two foundations into one entity, named it the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and committed $16 billion making it one of the largest foundations in the world (McGoey 2015).

Importance
Bill Gates will go down in history as one of the most innovative and important businessmen in the technology industry because he revolutionized the way we use computers for business and personal use. In addition to creating many of the office products we use to write papers and create spreadsheets, Microsoft, under Bill Gates' leadership, created the first gaming consuls, the X-Box and X-Box 360 that are enjoyed by families throughout the world (Bill Gates 2013).
Forbes argues that Melinda Gates has become the most powerful person on the planet whose singular focus is women and girls. She believes that the most pressing issue of our time is ending poverty in the world and we must put women and girls at the center because poverty is sexist (Howard 2015).
Through the foundation, Melinda, a Duke University Trustee, has been very generous to her alma mater by giving over $105 million for grants and endowment support. From 2002 through 2015 the foundation has provided key support to help the Duke Global Health institute; DukeEngage, a summer civic engagement program that pairs students with American and foreign nonprofits or non-government organization; and they have donated several million for financial aid to undergraduates and business school students. They also established the French Family Science Center, a 280,000-square-foot-building that is home to state-of-the-art research laboratories for chemistry and biology and it is named for Melinda Gates' family (Duke Forward 2015).
A recent report released by a U.K. based organization Global Justice Now, closely examines BMGF operations and reveals that the foundation’s influence on global health initiatives is greater than any other donor country including Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Ireland and Italy (Parpia 2016). By providing nearly 44 percent of international grant dollars, BMGF is shifting the global discourse on philanthropy (Moran 2014). In 2003, the foundation started the Grand Challenges for Global Health (GCGH), an initiative that was greatly influenced by the UN Millennium Development Goals created in 2000. The National Institute of Health, supplemented the GCGH with increased funding of approximately $1 billion for global health issues, evidence of the effect of BMGF on the U.S. Federal Government's funding priorities (Matthews 2008). The foundation has been praised for directing massive amounts of money into public health policy initiatives and scientific research on issues that forward the personal vision and social reform goals of Bill and Melinda Gates. The Gates's have become dominant figures in international giving influencing the philanthropic priorities and behaviors of national and international institutions (Moran 2014).
They have also influenced other private philanthropists. In 2010, the Gates's teamed with Warren Buffett and challenged the wealthiest people in the world to commit at least half of their accumulated wealth toward philanthropic initiatives creating the Giving Pledge (link to briefing paper) (McGoey 2015).

Ties to the Philanthropic Sector
Having created the "nation's largest philanthropic trust," Bill Gates continually strives to donate money and time for some of the world's most urgent issues (Gates & Gates 2003). His focus on education, health care, and access to information and technology are driven not only by his own interests but also by the needs of the international community.
Gates created multiple foundations to deal with and address these needs. Early in his career, he founded the William H. Gates Foundation. Soon after, an initiative within the Microsoft Corporation was created to connect libraries to the Internet and other resources, an initiative called "library online." The Gates Library Foundation was soon created to advance the library systems across the world. The last foundation created was the Gates Learning Foundation. This foundation sought to advance learning for people of all ages.
With the help of his father, chief executive officer of the William H. Gates Foundation, and Patty Stonesifer, chief executive officer of the Gates Library Foundation, Bill and Melinda Gates consolidated these foundations. With the formation of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, as it is called today, Gates displayed an understanding that structural changes must be made to efficiently address the changing needs of the community. His interest in helping the global community through time and money, have made him an undying philanthropist.
Modeled on the early twentieth-century independent foundations established by Carnegie, Rockefeller, Sage and later Ford, BMGF is one of a few large-scale foundations today, such as the Andrew Mellon Foundation, MacArthur Foundation and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, that are characterized by perpetual endowments, a large bureaucratic organizational structure and an emphasis on diverse programs. Similar to BMGF, these foundations have internationally based regional offices, which contribute to their tremendous influence on private philanthropy in global governance (Moran 2014).

Key Related Ideas
Since 2006 the foundation has been organized around three principal areas: the United States Program, the "priority areas" of which are education, U.S. libraries, the Pacific Northwest; the Global Development Program, which incorporates "financial services for the poor," "policy and advocacy" and "agricultural development"; and the Global Health Program, which has been the most active distributing some $13 billion in grants since 1994 (Moran 2014).
Melinda and Bill Gates, along with Bono, were named persons of the year by Time magazine in 2015 because they offered a new way of looking at poverty in the world. Some consider them philanthrocapitalists because they apply business management efficiency to philanthropy by leveraging their money to address as many people as possible (Bill Gates 2013).

Important People Related to the Topic
Paul Allen: co-founder of Microsoft, has been Bill Gates' friend since middle school. Together, the men's work shaped the early technology industry and became partners in the largest corporation in the world. Years ago, Allen left Microsoft to begin business and technology ventures of his own. In his own right, Allen has also become a leading philanthropist. He began a set of charitable organizations in the early 1990s to make grants to "innovative arts, medical and charitable groups in the Pacific Northwest whose work created positive change in their communities" (PGA Foundations 2003). Recently, added foundations focused on forest protection, music and virtual education, thus bringing its number to six foundations in the PGA (Paul G. Allen) Foundations group.
Warren Buffett: Warren Buffett is one of the biggest contributors to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Since joining the Giving Pledge in 2006, he has promised to give away at least 99%of his fortune during his lifetime, and has already donated an estimated $31 billion to the foundation (Morell 2014). Along with Bill and Melinda Gates, Buffett is a foundation trustee. As the chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Buffett's wealth is built from investing in a broad range of companies, from See's Candies to Geico Insurance to Fruit of the Loom. He attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and received his bachelor's degree from the University of Nebraska. In 1951, he earned a master's degree in economics from Columbia University (BMGF).
Susan Desmond-Hellmann: As Chief executive officer of the BMGF since 2014, Dr. Desmond-Hellmann leads the organization’s vision for "a world where every person has the opportunity to live a healthy, productive life"(BMGF). Prior to joining the Gates Foundation, Dr. Desmond-Hellmann was the first female Chancellor at the University of California at San Francisco and before that she spent the majority of her career as an oncologist, researching and creating anti-AIDS therapies for pharmaceutical companies Genentech and Bristol-Myers Squibb. She grew up in Reno, Nevada and received her medical training at the University of Nevada (Holmes 2014).
William H. Gates II: Bill Gates' father, has been an influential person in his life. He instilled public values and commitment to community in Bill from his childhood. A long-time supporter of the United Way as an efficient vehicle for philanthropic giving, Gates passed on this belief to his son whose contributions to the organization have been large and consistent. The senior Gates also continues his own philanthropic mission as chief executive officer of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Through this work he directs the foundation while keeping his son's vision for the future intact.
The "Microsoft Millionaires" have also benefited from Gates' creativity and innovation. There were hundreds of individuals who cashed in their stock options to become millionaires. Mike Harrington and Gabe Newell are two of the individuals who cashed in their stock. Instead of retiring (or buying farms and restaurants like some of their cohorts), these twenty-five year-old software developers created a company to produce action games for computers (GameSpot 2003). Many of the millionaires could not stand to retire at such a young age, so they are still working hard at things they love to do.
Patty Stonesifer: Patty Stonesifer, Melinda Gates' boss while at Microsoft, joined Bill and Melinda in 1997 to launch the Gates Library Foundation which, in 2000, merged with the William H. Gates Foundation to create the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Stonesifer served as volunteer Chief Executive Officer for over 10 years and oversaw a $38.7 billion endowment fund, distributing over $2 billion a year to support vulnerable populations in the United States and globally. Under her direction, the foundation led the way in building and backing public-private partnerships to achieve a wide range of goals, from research and development for new malaria vaccines to improving both the measurement and visibility of high school graduation rates in the United States. In 2009, she left BMGF and today, she serves as a volunteer in the role of President and Chief Executive Officer of Martha’s Table a nonprofit organization created to provide a safe place for children to eat and read after school and receive family support services. Among her many leadership roles in the corporate and nonprofit sector, Stonesifer was appointed in 2010 by President Obama to serve as the Chair of the White House Council for Community Solutions and she served as a member of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS. Prior to joining the Gates Foundation, she spent two decades working in technology, with her final role as Senior Vice President at Microsoft Corporation, leading the Consumer and Interactive Products Division. Stonesifer is a graduate of Indiana University, and has received honorary doctorate degrees from Indiana University, Tufts University, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (Martha's Table).

The Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation: http://broadfoundation.org/
This foundation was started by the personal wealth of Eli and Edythe Broad. The website outlines three investment areas: The Broad Center, which develops leaders to help transform America’s urban public schools; The Broad Institute, a global leader in genomics; and The Broad, a museum in downtown Los Angeles devoted to showcasing great contemporary art. The Broads have invested more than $4.1 billion in these causes (The Broad Foundation). Their backing lends a measure of clout, political credibility, and favorable media attention to any program or strategy they anoint as a "model." (Klonsky, 2011)
GAVI Alliance: http://www.gavi.org/ 
Formerly called the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, the Gates's helped start this organization in 2000 with donations of $1.5 billion. GAVI has 17 government partnerships and the European Union and has distributed vaccines to 138 million children in 70 of the world's poorest countries (Sellars 2016). Widely seen as the most successful and effective global health public-private partnerships, which provides greater access to immunizations in low- and lower middle-income countries. GAVI has received commitments totaling $2.5 billion from BMGF and is an ambitious effort to disseminate and "improve access to new and underused vaccines to children in low-income countries"(Moran 2014).
Walton Family Foundation: http://www.waltonfamilyfoundation.org
Started by Walmart Founders, Sam and Helen Walton, the Walton Family Foundation has over $2 billion in assets. Forbes has pegged the Waltons as the world’s richest clan, having amassed their wealth from a very successful retail enterprise. They are reported to have a combined net worth of  $138.6 billion (Walton Family Foundation). Second only to BMGF they are the largest philanthropic supporter of primary and secondary education in the United States, the third is the Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation (McGoey 2015). The Walton Family Foundation is committed to investing in programs that will make a positive, long-term difference in three main areas of focus: K-12 Education: Empowering parents with quality school choices; Environment: Protecting natural resources and building economies; Home Region: Measurably improving the quality of life in their home region of Arkansas and the Mississippi Delta. As Sam and Helen Walton’s grandchildren seek to make their philanthropic mark, the foundation will spend $2.2 billion in those areas over the next five years, or an average of $440 million a year (Walton Family Foundation).
 
Reflection Questions:
Why do you think Bill and Melinda Gates decided to give so much of their money away instead of leaving it to their children?
How do you think Bill and Melinda each influence the foundation? How might they differ in their priorities?

William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is a co-founder of Microsoft and is an American business magnate, investor, author and philanthropist.[2][3]
In 1975, Gates and Paul Allen launched Microsoft, which became the world's largest PC software company. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, CEO and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014.[4][a] Gates stepped down as chief executive officer of Microsoft in January 2000, but he remained as chairman and created the position of chief software architect for himself.[7] In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning from full-time work at Microsoft to part-time work and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.[8] He gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig Mundie.[9] He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.[10]
Gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution. He has been criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings.[11] Later in his career, Gates pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors. He donated large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was established in 2000.
Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people.[12] As of May 2017[update], he is the richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$88.5 billion.[1] In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.[13]

Early life
Gates was born in Seattle, Washington on October 28, 1955. He is the son of William H. Gates Sr.[b] (born 1925) and Mary Maxwell Gates (1929–1994). His ancestry includes English, German, Irish, and Scots-Irish.[14][15] His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way. Gates' maternal grandfather was JW Maxwell, a national bank president. Gates has one elder sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and one younger sister, Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family, but is known as William Gates III or "Trey" because his father had the "II" suffix.[16] Early on in his life, Gates' parents had a law career in mind for him.[17] When Gates was young, his family regularly attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination.[18][19][20] The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that "it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock ... there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing".[21]




The Poker Room in Currier House at Harvard College


At 13, he enrolled in the Lakeside School, a private preparatory school.[22] When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the school's students.[23] Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. When he reflected back on that moment, he said, "There was just something neat about the machine."[24] After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside students –  Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Kent Evans –  for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.[25][26]
At the end of the ban, the four students offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for computer time. Rather than use the system via Teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system, including programs in Fortran, Lisp, and machine language. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when the company went out of business. The following year, Information Sciences, Inc. hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in COBOL, providing them computer time and royalties. After his administrators became aware of his programming abilities, Gates wrote the school's computer program to schedule students in classes. He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with "a disproportionate number of interesting girls."[27] He later stated that "it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success."[24] At age 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen, called Traf-O-Data, to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor.[28] In early 1973, Bill Gates served as a congressional page in the U.S. House of Representatives.[29]
Gates graduated from Lakeside School in 1973 and was a National Merit Scholar.[30] He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests[31] and enrolled at Harvard College in the autumn of 1973.[32] He chose a pre-law major but took mathematics and graduate level computer science courses.[33] While at Harvard, he met fellow student Steve Ballmer. Gates left Harvard after two years while Ballmer would stay and graduate magna cum laude. Years later, Ballmer succeeded Gates as CEO of Microsoft before resigning from the company in 2014.[34]
In his second year, Gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems[35] presented in a combinatorics class by Harry Lewis, one of his professors. Gates' solution held the record as the fastest version for over thirty years;[35][36] its successor is faster by only one percent.[35] His solution was later formalized in a published paper in collaboration with Harvard computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou.[37]
Gates did not have a definite study plan while he was a student at Harvard[38] and spent a lot of time using the school's computers. Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen, and he joined him at Honeywell during the summer of 1974.[39] The following year saw the release of the MITS Altair 8800 based on the Intel 8080 CPU, and Gates and Allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company.[40] Gates dropped out of Harvard at this time. He had talked this decision over with his parents, who were supportive of him after seeing how much Gates wanted to start his own company.[38] Gates explained his official status with Harvard that, "...if things [Microsoft] hadn't worked out, I could always go back to school. I was officially on [a] leave [of absence]."[41]

BASIC




MITS Altair 8800 Computer with 8-inch (200 mm) floppy disk system


After reading the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics that demonstrated the Altair 8800, Gates contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), the creators of the new microcomputer, to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform.[42] In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demo, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration, held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. Paul Allen was hired into MITS,[43] and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with Allen at MITS in Albuquerque in November 1975. They named their partnership "Micro-Soft" and had their first office located in Albuquerque.[43] Within a year, the hyphen was dropped, and on November 26, 1976, the trade name "Microsoft" was registered with the Office of the Secretary of the State of New Mexico.[43] Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.
Microsoft's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, Gates wrote an Open Letter to Hobbyists in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90% of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and by doing so the Altair "hobby market" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software.[44] This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.[43] The company moved from Albuquerque to its new home in Bellevue, Washington, on January 1, 1979.[42]
During Microsoft's early years, all employees had broad responsibility for the company's business. Gates oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well. In the first five years, Gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit.[45][unreliable source?]
IBM partnership
IBM approached Microsoft in July 1980 in reference to an operating systen for its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC.[46] Big Blue first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter. When IBM's representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system, Gates referred them to Digital Research (DRI), makers of the widely used CP/M operating system.[47] IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system. A few weeks later, Gates proposed using 86-DOS (QDOS), an operating system similar to CP/M that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC. Microsoft made a deal with SCP to become the exclusive licensing agent, and later the full owner, of 86-DOS. After adapting the operating system for the PC, Microsoft delivered it to IBM as PC DOS in exchange for a one-time fee of $50,000.[48]
Gates did not offer to transfer the copyright on the operating system, because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone IBM's system.[48] They did, and the sales of MS-DOS made Microsoft a major player in the industry.[49] Despite IBM's name on the operating system, the press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the new computer. PC Magazine asked if Gates were "the man behind the machine?",[46] and InfoWorld quoted an expert as stating "it's Gates' computer".[50] Gates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates the president of Microsoft and its board chairman.[42]
Windows
Microsoft launched its first retail version of Microsoft Windows on November 20, 1985, and in August, the company struck a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating system called OS/2. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, mounting creative differences caused the partnership to deteriorate.[51]
Management style




Bill Gates in January 2008


From Microsoft's founding in 1975 until 2006, Gates had primary responsibility for the company's product strategy. He gained a reputation for being distant from others; as early as 1981 an industry executive complained in public that "Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls."[52] Another executive recalled that after he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times, when they met again a month later Gates "won or tied every game. He had studied the game until he solved it. That is a competitor."[53]
Gates was an executve who met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers. In firsthand accounts of these meetings, he was described as being verbally combative. He also berated managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk.[54][55] He interrupted presentations with such comments "That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!"[56] and "Why don't you just give up your options and join the Peace Corps?"[57] The target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until, hopefully, Gates was fully convinced.[56] When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark sarcastically, "I'll do it over the weekend."[58][59][60]
Gates was an active software developer in Microsoft's early history, particularly on the company's programming language products, but his basic role in most of the company's history was primarily as a manager and executive. Gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the TRS-80 Model 100,[61] but as late as 1989 he wrote code that shipped with the company's products.[59] He remained interested in technical details; in 1985, Jerry Pournelle wrote that when he watched Gates announce Microsoft Excel, "Something else impressed me. Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although I'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat hack."[62] On June 15, 2006, Gates announced that he would transition out of his day-to-day role over the next two years to dedicate more time to philanthropy. He divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed Ray Ozzie in charge of day-to-day management and Craig Mundie in charge of long-term product strategy.[63]
Antitrust litigation
Further information: United States Microsoft antitrust case and European Union Microsoft competition case




Gates giving his deposition at Microsoft on August 27, 1998


Many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over Microsoft's business practices have had Gates' approval. In the 1998 United States v. Microsoft case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner David Boies over the contextual meaning of words such as, "compete", "concerned", and "we". The judge and other observers in the court room were seen laughing at various points during the deposition.[64] BusinessWeek reported:

Early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying 'I don't recall,' so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle. Worse, many of the technology chief's denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail that Gates both sent and received.[65]

Gates later said he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. As to his demeanor during the deposition, he said, "Did I fence with Boies? ... I plead guilty. Whatever that penalty is should be levied against me: rudeness to Boies in the first degree."[66] Despite Gates' denials, the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed monopolization and tying, and blocking competition, both in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.[66]
Appearance in ads




Mugshots of Gates following his 1977 arrest for a traffic violation in Albuquerque, New Mexico


In 2008, Gates appeared in a series of ads to promote Microsoft. The first commercial, co-starring Jerry Seinfeld, is a 90-second talk between strangers as Seinfeld walks up on a discount shoe store (Shoe Circus) in a mall and notices Gates buying shoes inside. The salesman is trying to sell Mr. Gates shoes that are a size too big. As Gates is buying the shoes, he holds up his discount card, which uses a slightly altered version of his own mugshot of his arrest in New Mexico in 1977, for a traffic violation.[67] As they are walking out of the mall, Seinfeld asks Gates if he has melded his mind to other developers, after getting a "Yes", he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible, again getting a "Yes". Some say that this is an homage to Seinfeld's own show about "nothing" (Seinfeld).[68] In a second commercial in the series, Gates and Seinfeld are at the home of an average family trying to fit in with normal people.[69]
Post-Microsoft




Gates meeting with U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis in February 2017


Since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft, Gates has continued his philanthropy and works on other projects.
According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Gates was the world's highest-earning billionaire in 2013, as his net worth increased by US$15.8 billion to US$78.5 billion. As of January 2014, most of Gates' assets are held in Cascade Investment LLC, an entity through which he owns stakes in numerous businesses, including Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, and Corbis Corp.[70] On February 4, 2014, Gates stepped down as chairman of Microsoft to become Technology Advisor alongside new CEO Satya Nadella.[10][71]
Gates provided his perspective on a range of issues in a substantial interview that was published in the March 27, 2014 issue of Rolling Stone magazine. In the interview, Gates provided his perspective on climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: "... there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism." Gates also identified innovation as the "real driver of progress" and pronounced that "America's way better today than it's ever been."[72] Gates' days are planned for him, similar to the US President's schedule, on a minute-by-minute basis.[73]
Personal life




Bill and Melinda Gates in June 2009


Gates married Melinda French in Hawaii on January 1, 1994; he was 38 and she was 29. They have three children: Jennifer Katharine (b. 1996), Rory John (b. 1999), and Phoebe Adele (b. 2002). The family resides in a modern design mansion, which is an earth-sheltered house in the side of a hill overlooking Lake Washington in Medina near Seattle in the state of Washington, United States. According to 2007 King County public records, the total assessed value of the property (land and house) is $125 million, and the annual property taxes are $991,000. The 66,000 sq ft (6,100 m2) estate has a 60-foot (18 m) swimming pool with an underwater music system, as well as a 2,500 sq ft (230 m2) gym and a 1,000 sq ft (93 m2) dining room.[74]
In an interview with Rolling Stone, Gates stated in regard to his faith:

The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.[75]

In the same interview, Gates said: "I agree with people like Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm – not all – that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [laughs]. I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know."[75]
One of Gates' private acquisitions is the Codex Leicester, which is a collection of writings by Leonardo da Vinci that Gates bought for $30.8 million at an auction in 1994.[76] Gates is also known as an avid reader, and the ceiling of his large home library is engraved with a quotation from The Great Gatsby.[77] He also enjoys playing bridge, tennis, and golf.[78][79]
In 1999, his wealth briefly surpassed $101 billion, which caused the media to call Gates a "centibillionaire".[80] Despite his wealth and extensive business travel, Gates usually flew coach until 1997, when he bought a private jet.[81] Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the dot-com bubble burst and the multibillion-dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In a May 2006 interview, Gates commented that he wished that he were not the richest man in the world because he disliked the attention it brought.[82] In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person behind Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List.[83][84] Carlos Slim retook the position again in June 2014[85][86] (but then lost the top position back to Gates). Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from US$40 billion to more than US$82 billion.[87]
Gates has several investments outside Microsoft, which in 2006 paid him a salary of $616,667 and $350,000 bonus totalling $966,667.[88] In 1989, he founded Corbis, a digital imaging company. In 2004, he became a director of Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company headed by long-time friend Warren Buffett.[89] In 2016, he revealed that he was color-blind when discussing his gaming habits.[90]
Philanthropy

In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.[13]
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
Main article: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
Gates studied the work of Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, and in 1994, sold some of his Microsoft stock to create the "William H. Gates Foundation." In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations to create the charitable Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world's wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6 billion.[91][92] The Foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the Wellcome Trust.[93][94]
The foundation is organized into four program areas: Global Development Division, Global Health Division, United States Division, and Global Policy & Advocacy Division.[95]
Gates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of David Rockefeller as a major influence. Gates and his father met with Rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly modeled on the Rockefeller family's philanthropic focus, whereby they are interested in tackling the global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations.[96] As of 2007, Bill and Melinda Gates were the second-most generous philanthropists in America, having given over $28 billion to charity;[97] the couple plan to eventually donate 95 percent of their wealth to charity.[98]
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supports the use of genetically modified organisms in agricultural development. Specifically, the foundation is supporting the International Rice Research Institute in developing Golden Rice, a genetically modified rice variant used to combat Vitamin A deficiency.[99]
Personal
Melinda Gates suggested that people should emulate the philanthropic efforts of the Salwen family, which had sold its home and given away half of its value, as detailed in The Power of Half.[100] Gates and his wife invited Joan Salwen to Seattle to speak about what the family had done, and on December 9, 2010, Gates, investor Warren Buffett, and Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg signed a commitment they called the "Gates-Buffet Giving Pledge." The pledge is a commitment by all three to donate at least half of their wealth over the course of time to charity.[101][102][103]
Gates has recently expressed concern about the existential threats of superintelligence; in a Reddit "ask me anything", he stated that

First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned.[104][105][106][107]

In a March 2015 interview, with Baidu's CEO, Robin Li, Gates claimed he would "highly recommend" Nick Bostrom's recent work, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies.[108]
Gates has also provided personal donations to educational institutions. In 1999, Gates donated $20 million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for the construction of a computer laboratory named the "William H. Gates Building" that was designed by architect Frank Gehry. While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates.[109]
The Maxwell Dworkin Laboratory of the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences is named after the mothers of both Gates and Microsoft President Steven A. Ballmer, both of whom were students (Ballmer was a member of the School's graduating class of 1977, while Gates left his studies for Microsoft), and donated funds for the laboratory's construction.[110] Gates also donated $6 million to the construction of the Gates Computer Science Building, completed in January 1996, on the campus of Stanford University. The building contains the Computer Science Department (CSD) and the Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) of Stanford's Engineering department.[111]
On August 15, 2014, Bill Gates posted a video of himself on Facebook in which he is seen dumping a bucket of ice water on his head. Gates posted the video after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg challenged him to do so in order to raise awareness for the disease ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).[112]
Since about 2005, Bill Gates and his foundation have taken an interest in solving global sanitation problems. For example, they announced the "Reinvent the Toilet Challenge", which has received considerable media interest.[113] To raise awareness for the topic of sanitation and possible solutions, Gates drank water that was "produced from human feces" in 2014 – in fact it was produced from a sewage sludge treatment process called the Omni-processor.[114][115] In early 2015, he also appeared with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show and challenged him to see if he could taste the difference between this reclaimed water or bottled water.[116]
Bill and Melinda Gates have said that they intend to leave their three children $10 million each as their inheritance. With only $30 million kept in the family, they appear to be on a course to give away about 99.96 percent of their wealth.[117]
Criticism
In 2007, the Los Angeles Times criticized the foundation for investing its assets in companies that have been accused of worsening poverty, polluting heavily, and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell to the developing world.[118] In response to press criticism, the foundation announced a review of its investments to assess social responsibility.[119] It subsequently canceled the review and stood by its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices.[120] The Gates Millennium Scholars program has been criticized by Ernest W. Lefever for its exclusion of Caucasian students.[121] The scholarship program is administered by the United Negro College Fund.[122] In 2014, Bill Gates sparked a protest in Vancouver when he decided to donate 50 million dollars to UNAIDS through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for the purpose of mass circumcision in Zambia and Swaziland.[123][124]
Charity Sports Events
On April 29, 2017, Bill Gates partnered with Swiss Tennis legend Roger Federer in playing a non competitive tennis match to a packed house at Key Arena in Seattle. The event was in support of Roger Federer Foundation's charity efforts in Africa.[125] Federer and Gates played against John Isner and Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McReady. Gates and Federer won the game 6-4.
Recognition




Gates and Steve Jobs at the fifth D: All Things Digital conference (D5) in 2007


In 1987, Gates was listed as a billionaire in Forbes magazine's 400 Richest People in America issue, just days before his 32nd birthday. As the world's youngest self-made billionaire, he was worth $1.25 billion, over $900 million more than he'd been worth the year before, when he'd debuted on the list.[12] Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes The World's Billionaires list and was the wealthiest from 1995 to 1996,[126] 1998 to 2007, 2009, and has been since 2014.[1] Gates was number one on Forbes' 400 Richest Americans list from 1993 through to 2007.[127][needs update]
Time magazine named Gates one of the 100 people who most influenced the 20th century, as well as one of the 100 most influential people of 2004, 2005, and 2006. Time also collectively named Gates, his wife Melinda and U2's lead singer Bono as the 2005 Persons of the Year for their humanitarian efforts.[128] In 2006, he was voted eighth in the list of "Heroes of our time".[129] Gates was listed in the Sunday Times power list in 1999, named CEO of the year by Chief Executive Officers magazine in 1994, ranked number one in the "Top 50 Cyber Elite" by Time in 1998, ranked number two in the Upside Elite 100 in 1999, and was included in The Guardian as one of the "Top 100 influential people in media" in 2001.[130]

#1 William Henry Gates III
Net Worth: $51.0 billion 
Source: Software, Microsoft
Self made
Age: 49
Marital Status: Married, 3 children
Hometown: Medina, WA
Education: Harvard University, Drop Out

Microsoft's chief visionary moving further away from day-to-day corporate work. For the first time did not offer a strategy outlook at this year's financial analyst meeting. Instead, prefers to dive into innovative projects, foster collaboration among Microsoft's many divisions. Microsoft aims to be omnipotent, selling software for PCs, servers, cell phones, television set-top boxes, gaming consoles, the Web. Fifteen product launches slated for the next year and a half, including new version of Windows, called Vista, and gaming console Xbox 360. At the ripe (tech sector) age of 30, Gates' company impressively beats rivals in profit margins, market capitalization and R&D budget, but its sales growth is slowing to a (recently) single-digit percentage pace. Like elder statesman of computing, IBM, has been investing heavily in its own stock ($8 billion worth so far). Diversifies methodically, selling 20 million shares every quarter, reinvesting through Cascade Investment. Big stakes in Canadian National Railway, Republic Services, Berkshire Hathaway. Philanthropy, via $29 billion Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, aimed at fighting infectious disease (hepatitis B, AIDS, malaria) and improving high schools.

William H. Gates III
Co-founder, Microsoft Corporation


















There was a magical breakthrough when the computer became cheap and we could see that everyone could afford a computer.




Personal Computer Revolution

Date of Birth

                    October 28, 1955                  




Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, 1983. (© Doug Wilson/CORBIS)William H. Gates III was born in Seattle, Washington, the second of three children, in between an older and a younger sister. His father was a successful attorney, and it was expected that young Bill would follow in his father’s footsteps. He was a notably gifted student who did well in all subjects but showed a special aptitude for mathematics. When he was 13, his parents believed he was not being challenged in his public school and enrolled him in the private and highly demanding Lakeside School. The school acquired a computer terminal, and young Bill Gates was immediately fascinated. He and a small group of friends, including his future business partner Paul Allen, took every opportunity to explore the possibilities of the new technology, teaching themselves the basics of computer programming.
Soon Gates and his friends were working part-time and summers, writing computer programs for large businesses around the Seattle area. Although they were all precociously gifted programmers, it became clear that Gates had a unique talent for business as well, and he quickly emerged as the leader of the group. Gates and Paul Allen closely followed events in the computer industry and foresaw that the development of microprocessors would lead to the creation of compact affordable, personal computer that would someday supplant the bulky mainframe systems used in business and industry.
The January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics featured the new Altair 8800, and alerted Bill Gates and Paul Allen that the era of the personal computer was beginning.Meanwhile, Gates continued to excel in his studies and followed his parents’ wishes by going to Harvard. Paul Allen soon moved to Boston to work for Honeywell and continue their collaboration. The pair were galvanized by a cover story in Popular Electronics, promoting the Altair 8800, an inexpensive microcomputer produced by a company called MITS in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Gates and Allen saw this as the beginning of a new industry. No one had yet developed software for the Altair, and the young programmers saw a unique opportunity. They adapted the computer language BASIC to run on the new device, although they had never actually seen one. On the strength of this programming feat, they secured a software development contract with MITS. With irresistible business opportunities beckoning, Gates left Harvard at the beginning of his junior year to make the leap into the world of business. Along with Paul Allen, he moved to New Mexico at the end of 1975 to produce software for MITS. The following year, they started their own company, Microsoft.
1980s: Bill Gates and Microsoft created software for every personal computer on the market, including Apple II.After MITS was sold, Gates moved Microsoft to Bellevue, Washington, near his hometown of Seattle, a choice that would make the Pacific Northwest a center of the computer software industry. The Altair, along with personal computers produced by Atari, Commodore, and other industry pioneers, enjoyed popularity with hobbyists and computer aficionados, but had not achieved a comparable success with business or the general public, a vast untapped market. The dominant player in the computer industry, IBM, had long resisted the concept of the personal computer, because mainframe systems were the heart of its business. When IBM finally decided to make the move into manufacturing personal computers in 1980, it turned to Gates and Microsoft to produce an operating system.

He named his program Microsoft Disk Operating System, or MS-DOS. In his agreement with IBM, Gates was careful to retain the right to license MS-DOS to other hardware manufacturers as well. This may have been the single most momentous decision in business history. When the IBM PC became a success, other manufacturers rushed to create less expensive DOS-based personal computers. Microsoft’s operating system became the universal standard as personal computer use exploded around the world. The only noteworthy competitor in personal computer operating systems, Apple, had made the opposite decision; the Macintosh operating system could only run on Apple Macintosh computers, and Apple never gained more than a fraction of the worldwide desktop computer market.

With most of the world’s personal computers running MS-DOS and Windows, Gates had a perfect market for compatible software applications. Within a few years the applications in Microsoft’s office suite had become the leaders in their respective categories: Microsoft Word for word processing, Excel for creating spreadsheets, PowerPoint for slideshow-style graphic presentation, and Internet Explorer for browsing the increasingly popular World Wide Web.

Microsoft became an enormous international corporation, and by 1995, its Chairman, CEO and largest shareholder, Bill Gates, was the world’s richest man, a title he has retained almost every year since. By 2017, Bill Gates had amassed a personal fortune of $90.7 billion.

In the last decades of the 20th century, a revolution in information technology transformed commerce and consciousness, just as the printing press transformed civilization 500 years before. These advances in computer technology and communications would have remained the province of professional scientists and mega-business if not for the introduction of the personal computer, and no person played a greater role in bringing the computer into homes and offices all over the world than William H. Gates, III.
Bill Gates was a teenage computer whiz when he dropped out of Harvard to start his own company, Microsoft. Through a brilliant combination of technical prowess and business insight, Gates made Microsoft the indispensable supplier of operating systems and office software to computer users around the world. If you use a computer to write a letter, compose an email or visit a website, chances are you’re using Microsoft software.
Microsoft’s uncontested dominance of the personal computer software market made Bill Gates the richest man in the world. He has used his personal wealth to attack the most intractable global problems of disease and poverty through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Personal Computer Revolution
Seattle, Washington
March 17, 2010





You dropped out of Harvard in your junior year to start Microsoft with your friend Paul Allen. What was your original business plan?















Bill Gates: Microsoft was the first software company where we wrote software for personal computers. And we believed that we could hire the best engineers. There was an unbelievable amount of software to be written, and we could do it well and we could do it on a global basis. The original customer base was the hardware manufacturers. We sold to literally hundreds and hundreds, you know, over 100 companies in Japan, over 100 companies doing word processors and industrial control type things. We knew in the long run we wanted to sell software directly to users, but we actually didn’t get around to that until 1980, when we had our first sort of games and productivity software that people would go to a computer store and actually buy the software package.








When did you first have the vision of a computer on every desk at work and in every home?
Bill Gates: Paul Allen and I had used that phrase even before we wrote the BASIC for Microsoft.













Keys to success —
Vision




We actually talked about it in an article in — I think 1977 was the first time it appears in print — where we say, “a computer on every desk and in every home…” and actually we said, “…running Microsoft software.” If we were just talking about the vision, we’d leave those last three words out. If we were talking an internal company discussion, we’d put those words in. It’s very hard to recall how crazy and wild that was, you know, “on every desk and in every home.” At the time, you have people who are very smart saying, “Why would somebody need a computer?” Even Ken Olsen, who had run this company Digital Equipment, who made the computer I grew up with, and that we admired both him and his company immensely, was saying that this seemed kind of a silly idea that people would want to have a computer.









Altair 8800 computer with 8-inch floppy disk system, circa 1975. (Computer History Museum, November 2004)When Microsoft was starting out, you guys made a deal with Apple Computer for a flat fee of $21,000 or something. What did you learn from that experience?
Bill Gates: Microsoft did the software for all the personal computers that came out. There was the Apple II that we did a BASIC for, which was called Apple Soft BASIC. There was a Commodore PET that we did a BASIC for. There was a Radio Shack TRS 80 that we did a BASIC for. Even Atari, who initially had their own mini-BASIC, ended up using our BASIC. So our BASIC was running on every single machine, including that Apple machine. We later did a BASIC for the Macintosh. We didn’t mind doing low priced contracts at the time, because we always knew that there would be new versions and more software that we would do. So it worked out well. As part of that Apple deal, I got to know Steve Wozniak, who is actually the engineer and did software programming, and Steve Jobs, who later I would do a lot of work with, because he was deeply involved in the Macintosh work.
Apple sold a lot of those computers — the Apple II. Wouldn’t you have made a lot more money at that time if you had royalties?
Bill Gates: Well, we had plenty of ways to do new versions and add-ons and things. So no, the whole structure of the way we licensed things was that we knew we could write software more efficiently than if they hired the engineers themselves. So we always were able to say, “Hey, you would have spent a half a million developing that yourself. We’ll license it to you for an inexpensive price.” We probably could have had higher prices, but we were doing fine. In fact, that 6502 BASIC that Mark Chamberlain and I wrote, we licensed to about 12 different people. So our profitability was huge, even though it was a great deal for Apple. Per machine they paid almost nothing.
By the 1990s, Microsoft was the world’s dominant provider of consumer software, and Bill Gates had become the richest man in the world. By 2016, he had amassed a personal fortune of $90 billion. In addition, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation had an endowment of $44 billion and emerged as a leader in venture philanthropy.You came out very early against illegal copying of software. You wrote a piece for Computer Notes, warning that piracy could create serious obstacles for your industry.
Bill Gates: Yeah. The MITS Altair people agreed to pay us a royalty for each copy that was sold. So if people paid MITS we got a royalty, and if they just copied the program — which was at the time on paper tape — we didn’t get paid. There was a lot of this going on, and the amount of piracy was going to determine whether Microsoft could hire more people or not. So I wrote — it wasn’t mean — what was called “An Open Letter to Hobbyists,” that said, “By the way, this is copyrighted material, and the more we sell, the more software we’ll be able to write.” And that started a debate that rages to this day, it will rage for decades to come. Should creative people who do music or books or software be able to get a royalty for their stuff, or should people pirate it? There’s a lot of complicated issues in intellectual property, but it started early in the computer industry. A lot of people did actually respond to the letter by coming back and paying the license fee, which was very low. I mean, everything was very, very cheap.
When IBM first came to you for an operating system, you sent them to another company, Digital Research, first. Why did you do that?
Bill Gates:I had been talking about our BASIC, and running that on a computer. There’s two ways you could run BASIC. You can run it where the BASIC is right on the hardware and the only thing you’re running is BASIC, or you can put another layer of software in between, called an operating system, and it can take over some of the work, like managing the printers and things, and you can have many programs, BASIC or a spreadsheet or a word processor, running on top of that. And as we got disks on these computers, it made more sense to have that flexibility. The early computers don’t have disks; they have cassette tapes and paper tapes and things like that. But by 1979, ’80, we’re starting to get these big, expensive — actually, initially eight-inch — floppy disks, then five-and-a-quarter inch, finally three-and-a-half inch. Now, when’s the last time you saw a floppy disk? But they were very important. We still have a hard disk, the disk built into the computer.















So you needed an operating system. When IBM saw that we had written the software for all the personal computers, they came to us, sought our advice on the design, but we said, “You should put a disk in,” and since they wanted to ship very quickly, another company called Digital Research had done that work for the 8-bit machines, and they were starting to do a version for these new 16-bit machines. We convinced IBM to do a 16-bit machine using this 8086, 8088 processor. Well, Digital Research really hadn’t finished the work, and then IBM was getting frustrated because Digital Research wouldn’t sign even the non-disclosure agreement, and then some of us, particularly Paul and a key person named Kazi Konishi, who was from Japan and worked with us, said, “No, no, no, we should just do that ourselves.” And because of the quick timing, we ended up licensing the original code from another company and turned that into MS-DOS. So then subsequently, MS-DOS competed with this Digital Research CPM. After about two or three years, MS-DOS became far, far more popular than CPM, and then eventually we would take and add graphics capability on top of MS-DOS, and then integrate the two together. And so today when we talk about Windows, it actually includes all those MS-DOS things in it, that’s the full operating system. Although mostly you think of the graphics and the windows and stuff, there’s a lot of more classic operating system capability that’s built in there.









Microsoft founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1983 just after completing MS-DOS for the Tandy laptop and signing a contract to write MS-DOS for IBM. Microsoft Company had 100 employees in an office in Bellevue, Washington.Did you get a royalty from IBM for each computer they sold with MS-DOS?
Bill Gates: Actually, no.















The IBM initial deal is a flat fee deal, another flat fee deal. It had certain restrictions that prevented IBM from selling to other hardware makers. So if people did IBM PC compatible machines, we would get the revenue by doing business directly with those people. And the deal was very complicated, but it was a deal that Steve Ballmer — who’s a key person with the company by that time — and I thought a lot about. It was a fairly junior team from IBM, so we tried to make sure that — given our belief that personal computers would be hyper-popular — that Microsoft would get a lot of that upside.








So they felt they got a very good deal, which they did, but as the industry expanded, we — for new versions and for different machines — we got that opportunity, even though they did not pay us a royalty.
When did you realize just how wildly successful this business would be?















Bill Gates: Even in the early days, if you set a computer on every desk in every home, and you’d say, “Okay, how many homes are there in the world? How many desks are there in the world? Can I make $20 for every home, $20 for every desk?” you could get these big numbers. But part of the beauty of the whole thing was we were very focused on the here and now. Should we hire one more person? If our customers didn’t pay us, would we have enough cash to meet the payroll? We really were very practical about that next thing, and so involved in the deep engineering that we didn’t get ahead of ourselves. We never thought how big we’d be. I remember when one of the early lists of wealthy people came out and one of the Intel founders was there, the guy that ran Wang computers actually was still — Wang was still doing well — and we thought, “Hmm. Boy, if the software business does well, the value of Microsoft could be similar to that.” But it wasn’t a real focus. The everyday activity of just doing great software drew us in. And some decisions we made — like the quality of the people, the way we were very global, the vision of how we thought about software — that was very long term. But other than those things, we just came into work every day and wrote more code and hired more people. It wasn’t really until the IBM PC succeeded, and perhaps even until Windows succeeded, that there was a broad awareness that Microsoft was very unique as a software company, and that these other companies had been one-product companies, hadn’t hired people, couldn’t do a broad set of things, didn’t renew their excellence, didn’t do research. So we thought we were doing something very unique, but it was easily not until 1995, or even 1997, that there was this wide recognition that we were the company that had revolutionized software.











When you were growing up, did you have any vision of what you wanted to accomplish?
Bill Gates: When I was very young I hadn’t been exposed to computers so I was mostly just reading, doing math, learning about science, and I wasn’t sure what my career would be. I knew I loved learning about things. I was an avid reader, but it was when I was 12 years old that I first got to use a computer, actually a very limited machine by today’s standards. But that definitely fascinated me when I was first exposed.
Love at first sight?
Bill Gates: I was intrigued by figuring out what it could do and what it couldn’t do. And some friends and I spent lots of time. The teachers got intimidated so we were on our own trying to figure it out. Actually, we gave a course on computers to the other students, and it became a fascination, where we got paid for doing computer work and talked about forming a company. But there was kind of a magical breakthrough when the computer became cheap, and we could see that everyone could afford a computer. That was much later, but that’s what got us to really get together and create a company for software.
Tell us more about your childhood. What books were important to you as a kid?
Bill Gates: Well, I read a lot. There were always contests at the library, in the summer, where if you read ten books you got a little gold star, if you read 20 you got two. And there were five or six girls and I that would always read like 35 books, and we’d see who could do the most. It was a broad set of things. Eventually a fair bit of science fiction, because that intrigued me. Some biographies, understanding what different leaders had done and how they’d picked what they wanted to do. So I’d say science fiction and biographies were the categories that had the most impact.
Weren’t you a Tarzan fan?
Bill Gates: Yeah. Among the science fiction things, William Rice Burroughs wrote a Martian series, and I read that. And then he also had the Tarzan books, and there’s an unbelievable number of them, like 40 of them. I eventually decided to read those as well.
Was Catcher in the Rye a favorite later on?
Bill Gates: That’s right. I didn’t actually read Catcher in the Rye until I was 13, and ever since then I’ve said that’s my favorite book. It’s very clever. It acknowledges that young people are a little confused, but can be smart about things and see things that adults don’t really see. So I’ve always loved it.
We’ve read that A Separate Peace is another book that was important to you.
Bill Gates: Yes, my second favorite book is the book by John Knowles called A Separate Peace. And that’s a phenomenal book. I’ve been reading it to my son recently. There is actually a movie made of it that’s fairly good, but I’d say the book is incredibly good.
What did you like about it?
Bill Gates: Well, it’s two young boys growing up: one who is sort of intentionally trying to be good at things, and the other is just kind of naturally great at sports and has this wonderful energy and they have this great friendship. And it happens to be at a time where the older boys are going off to war, and they’re trying go figure out what does that mean to them. And the author talks about this period of his life as really defining the rest of his life, how he sees everything sort of in comparison to this period where he didn’t really know where he fit in. He thought of himself as maybe too calculating. The end of the book, which I won’t spoil, is a bit of a tragedy with this friend of his, but it really talks a lot about what is our bargain with the world. How do we grow up? What are we worried about, and how do we take that into adulthood?
What about school in general? You were a great reader. Otherwise, what kind of a student were you?
Bill Gates: Well, through eighth grade I was sort of enjoying the fact that I could do reasonably well without any effort. They had this thing where you’d get an “effort: which would be one, two or three, and then a grade. And so the ideal I always wanted was an A3, where you had the least effort, but the greatest grade. So my grades weren’t all that great. And then in eighth grade I had been at a private school for a couple of years and decided that I better start getting good grades, both in terms of having some freedom, the way I’d be treated, and thinking about college. So from ninth grade on, I had a reasonably spotless grade record. I got quite serious about grades at that point.
Were you always good at math?
Bill Gates: Math was the thing that came most natural to me. And you know you’d take these exams, some of which were sort of nationwide exams, and I did quite well on those. That gave me some confidence, and I had some teachers who were very encouraging. They let me read textbooks, they encouraged me to take a college course on symbolic math, which is actually called algebra. So I felt pretty confident in my math skills, which is a nice thing, because not only the sciences, but economics, a lot of things if you’re comfortable with math and statistics and ways of looking at cause and effect, that’s extremely helpful.
Do any particular math teachers come to mind from that era?
Bill Gates: I had one named Paul Stockland at the school who challenged me. Later one named Fred Wright who challenged me. I actually majored in math for the time I was at college, because it’s a very interesting topic. But it was kind of a strange topic, because there’s not a direct career for most people in terms of being a full time mathematician. So for all but a very few people, it’s a tool that you use, but probably not what you’re going to spend your life working on.
Your parents took you out of public school to send you to the Lakeside School. Apparently that school had a big impact on you. Why did they make that move?
Bill Gates: My parents had this notion that I had this high potential somehow and that I was not taking advantage of it. The environment that I had been in, sort of being a goof-off was more socially rewarding than being that serious. It was public school, so they weren’t pushing people all that hard. You could read the textbook in the first week and there wasn’t anything interesting going to happen the rest of the school year. So they had me take an exam to go to a private school. And I thought, “Well, should I pass this exam or not? You could fail it and you wouldn’t have to go.” But that sort of violated my sense of integrity. “Hey, I’m good at taking tests. I don’t want to get confused about that.” So I was admitted and they encouraged me to go. It was a boys’ school, reasonably strict. During the time I was there it actually transitioned, merged with a girls’ school and stopped having uniforms, stopped calling the teachers “Master.” So it became pretty normal, but it was a change at first. And the idea of just being kind of a goof-off wasn’t the sort of high reward position like it had been in public schools. So my parents were right, it had the intended effect of creating a more challenging environment. And some teachers who were nice about saying that I should try harder, and exposing me to a lot of math and science, and eventually that’s where I got to use the computer.
We’ve read that at first you weren’t thrilled about the transfer to Lakeside.
Bill Gates: Lakeside was a longer school day, and it’s a change. I had gotten super comfortable at public school, kind of being goofy, and here people were studying, and at first, because I didn’t get great grades, they had me in a study hall, and a few people who got really good grades didn’t have to go to the study hall. Nobody knew that I was actually clever, so they were actually treating me like some average student. Anyway, it was an adjustment. All the other kids there were making the adjustment as well. So it took a couple of years to get my grounding. I’m super glad that I went to that school. It is a fantastic school. I’ll probably send my kids to that school.
Could you tell us about the role of the Lakeside School Mother’s Club in introducing you to computers?
Bill Gates: The Lakeside’s Mother’s Club had a rummage sale every year to raise money for the school. And instead of just funding the budget, they always would fund something kind of new and interesting in addition. And without too much understanding, they decided having a computer terminal at the school would be a novel thing. It was a teletype — upper case only, ten characters a second — and you had to share a phone line to call into a big time-sharing computer that was very expensive. When you were connected up it would charge, and then when you actually had a program running it would charge a lot more. So they set up this teletype, and some of the math and science teachers played around with it. One of them accidentally spent a lot of money with an infinite loop program. They spent like $200 by surprise. So they were a bit intimidated, and a bunch of us kind of hung out there and tried out different things. The programming language was BASIC, which was quite novel at the time. It had been invented by some Dartmouth professors. So that was the first computer language I learned, and I wrote increasingly complex programs. So that eighth grade exposure was a pretty neat thing, even though the machine we were working on was quite limited.
Even most colleges didn’t have one of those at that time.
Bill Gates: No, the idea of students playing around with a computer was very unusual at the time. In fact, that computer — eventually the costs were high enough they took it away. But then some other computer companies had come around, including one in Seattle, that a bunch of us went down and volunteered to help out and do some work for. So from that point on we always managed — although it was dicey at times — to find access to computers. That was very unusual in high school. But it took a lot of initiative on our part to get those experiences, but we wouldn’t have done it if we hadn’t had that early eighth grade exposure.
For people who don’t remember those early computers, could you explain why time-sharing was so important?
Bill Gates: Computers were immensely expensive and cost millions of dollars — a machine that was far less powerful than what you have on a cell phone today. So either you would have a very important application or you just shared the machine with other people, and still you had to pay quite a bit of money. So time-sharing is where you’re connected up and sharing the machine. It’s a lot better than sending your programs in, because you can see when you make a mistake pretty quickly. Even so, because they charged us so much, we actually typed the programs off-line on a paper tape, so that we didn’t have any delay for typing. Then, when we got onto the computer, we’d feed in that tape, so that it was less time online. But it gave you a sense of, “Okay, what you got right and wrong…” and you could try and correct things. We also — because at that time, the dominant form of computing was using punch cards — we actually did that quite a bit. We were down at the University of Washington and used some of those punch card systems. As computers became less expensive — so called mini-computers — then more people had access, mostly scientists and business people, but also we managed to find machines that weren’t being used at night. The idea of a machine as something that an individual would use and that it would just sit there idle when they weren’t using it — that only made sense about a decade later, when the work that we and others had done had gotten the price down so dramatically that the idea of a computer sitting idle doesn’t feel like some huge waste of resources, like it did when they were so expensive and rare.
To someone who’s never done any programming, can you describe what made it so exciting to you at the beginning?
Bill Gates: Well, programming is where you’re describing to the machine how to do something– telling it how to play tic-tac-toe, telling it how to play the board game Monopoly, telling it how to convert numbers from one base to another. There are these simple instructions, but if you put them together you can synthesize something quite complex. It’s a fascinating kind of mathematical thing. How can you make it fast? How can you make it small?
I went through several phases of doing more complex programs where people who were great programmers would look at my work, give me feedback on it, and you get so you can be quite a good programmer. It was kind such an intense activity, between the age of 13 and 17, that we learned a lot. Eventually one of the programs we took on was the idea of the scheduling of our school. When should the classes meet? Who should be in what section? You have all these requests for people who want different classes, and keeping them small, and not having the teachers teach too many classes in a row — very complex kind of software problem. And actually, when the school first asked me to do it when I was 15, I said that I didn’t know how and they asked some adults to do it, and that didn’t work. Then, about a year later, I’d figured out how to do it, and so my friends and I actually did the software that did all this high school scheduling. It had some fantastic benefits to us, and we got paid for doing it. It was exactly the kind of complex problem that developed my skills very well. And we got some degree of control over who was in our classes, so it combined the best of everything!
We’ve read that at one point your fellow members of the computer club at Lakeside kicked you out. Is that true?
Bill Gates: Yeah. Initially, when that teletype showed up, there were probably 20 kids who showed an interest. It was confusing enough that it got whittled down to about eight or nine fairly quickly who were quite serious about it. Then there were about four of us who were hyper-serious, doing it day and night. Two of them were two years older than I was, and one was my same age. Now in a high school, people that are two years ahead of you, they don’t socialize with the young kids all that much. So the idea that we had this group, the four of us, was kind of unusual. We called it the Lakeside Programming Group. One of the companies we had been doing work for went bankrupt, the one in Seattle, and so we went to one in Portland, Oregon.
Was that C Cubed?
Bill Gates: Yes, Computer Center Corporation — C Cubed — which had been in the University District in Seattle. We’d spent a lot of time there, and they were wonderful to us, but they weren’t a well run business, so they went bankrupt.
This company down in Portland, Oregon said, “Hey, we’re not just going to give you computer time, you have to do something.” So we agreed to write this payroll program. And a payroll program is surprisingly complicated. There’s all these taxes and reports and things at the state level and federal level. Anyway, they said, “Well, if you could write one of those, we’d at least give you free computer time.” So I negotiated that deal, and the two older members — Paul Allen and Rick — said, “There’s not enough work to go around, so we’re going to take charge of this.” And I said, “Okay, I’m not that interested,” because I had in mind how I wanted to do the payroll program. So they messed around for about three months, didn’t get much done, and then said, “Will you join back up?” And I said, “Okay, but if so, I’m in charge of this,” and it’s going to kind of set a precedent for future activities. But they said, “No, no. That’s fine.” And so we worked. We actually finished this payroll program. It was a lot of work. The friend who was my age, Kent Evans, and I ended up doing the lion’s share of the work. Now tragically, right as he and I finished that he was killed in a mountain climbing accident. So then there were just three of us left who’d been extremely involved, including Paul Allen, who was the one who was reading the magazines even more than I was. He was the one who actually saw this computer on a chip — a so-called “microprocessor” — in a very small obscure article. He saw that it would be deeply important and brought that to me in 1971. So we were still 15 — I was 15, and he was 17 at the time.
Was it during your work with C Cubed that you got into some trouble for hacking into a system?
Bill Gates: These C Cubed people have this computer, which is a time-sharing computer, and they’re letting us come in at night. And they had this deal with the company who made the computer, Digital Equipment Corporation, that they had this acceptance period. If they could find problems with it, they could delay their rental payments. So they thought of us as kind of monkeys that might find some problems and help them delay their rental payments. Well, that was a fair analysis, because at first we were just completely goofing around. Like, we’d try to run hundreds of jobs at the same time, or have all the jobs try and grab the same resources, to see if we could get the system to fail. And we did, in kind of this brute force approach. So they would report that as a problem and delay their rental payment. Well, a few months went by, actually about four months by the end of it. We had gotten very sophisticated. In fact, we’d gotten the source code of the operating system out of the garbage can, and were reading it, and the kind of problems we were finding were far more subtle. In fact, we would not only find the problem, we’d look and we’d suggest how they might fix it. Anyway, Digital Equipment got so tired of this they said, “Look, you’ve got to pay. You’re going to be able to find these kinds of problems forever, but we need to get paid.” So then there was a question whether they would let us stay there or not, and it was pretty tenuous. So Paul and I, we understood the system well enough that we could look at all the passwords of the various accounts, so we would use literally any account. And then, people — when they found out we had done that, they got kind of mad about that. They weren’t sure how mad they should be about it, because we hadn’t really caused any damage, but it wasn’t a good thing. Computer hacking was literally just being invented at the time, and so fortunately we got off with a bit of a warning. But there actually was a period that, because of that, they said we weren’t supposed to use the computer. It was over a summer, and Paul actually went up to the University of Washington and found ways to use the computer and get connected up. He took a while before he told me and then eventually he told me about that and we got back on.
After you got kicked off the C Cubed system, was that tough, spending the summer without a computer?
Bill Gates: Yeah, well no. I had many things that were interesting. I was really quite serious about math at the time and various science things. Paul had actually read more science fiction that I had, by a lot, so he and I would talk about that. But I had plenty of things, it wasn’t some great tragedy. But then we got pulled back in, and then that company went bankrupt, and then we had the work for this Portland company on the payroll program, and then we had the scheduling program.
We were lucky. There were always kinds of things that not only gave us an opportunity, but exposed us to that next level. After the payroll program, then there was a computer project to use computers to control all the electricity grid in the dams of the Pacific Northwest. A government agency called Bonneville Power had done a contract with a company called TRW to use computers to do all this control. And TRW had committed to do all this really high-reliability great software work. Well, they found it more difficult than they expected, so they were looking for people who understood these kinds of computers, which Paul Allen and I had done a lot of work on. These were the same computers that were at Computer Center Corporation and at this Portland company, Information Sciences. Anyway, we were kind of famous — but nobody had met us — because we had filed these problem reports. And by the end of these problem reports — they were so sophisticated — it was like, “Who are these guys out in Seattle telling us how to fix all this stuff?” So when TRW was saying, “Hey, we’re desperate. Find us…” they’re telling Digital Equipment, who makes these things, “Find us the best programmers,” and somebody says, “Well, there’s Gates and Allen…” and somebody says, “Nobody’s really met them, but yeah, they’re really good, we ought to be able to track them down.” So they find us, this one guy, and we go for an interview. And these two kids show up and — what was I when I was interviewed? I was 16 when they interviewed me. So they were like, “We can’t hire you.” But then they talked to us about software and we clearly know a lot. And when you’re young and you know a lot, people don’t have any kind of intermediate thing. You’re either what you’re supposed to be, which is a kid that doesn’t know that much, or they think, “Whoa, this guy is the limit!” We were pretty good programmers. But anyway, so we got jobs at this TRW and that exposed me to some programmers, who were way better than I was, who critiqued my work. I could look at their work. And this one guy was really a phenomenal programmer.
Was that John Norton?
Bill Gates: Yeah. He would just take my stuff and rip it apart, you know, in this super constructive way. Anyway, it was a brilliant thing. So part of my senior year, and the summer before and after the senior year, Paul and I were down in Vancouver, Washington. So it kind of took our understanding to a whole new level, and it exposed us to a bunch of people there. And Paul, the whole time — ever since he’d seen that microprocessor article — was saying, “You know, there’s an opportunity here. This is going to be big. We ought to think what we’re going to do about this.” So we kept talking about that.
So Paul Allen showed you the article about the microprocessor first, and then wasn’t there a cover story in Popular Electronics about the Altair 8800?
Bill Gates: In 1971, there’s this obscure article on the microprocessor that Intel has done — what was called the 4004 — that Paul said, “Look, this thing’s going to keep getting better and it’s going to be better than these mini-computers.” Mini-computers were like $10,000 to $200,000. Paul and I had borrowed some of those and messed around with those. And Paul said, “No, no. They’re going to have something better than the mini-computer that costs like $1,000.” So we kept watching those chips get better, and we did the scheduling program, then, my senior year, we’re down at TRW, they’re getting better. And in fact, in 1973, the 8080 chip comes out, and Paul shows that to me and I say, “Okay, this is better than most of these mini-computers.” And so we think, “Wow, somebody’s going to take that chip and do something wild.”
In the meantime I start at Harvard University back in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Paul’s at Washington State, another place, so I help him get a job out there in the Boston area, and we’re just brainstorming, you know, “What’s going to happen with the microprocessor?” I’m playing poker, signing up for lots and lots of classes, undergraduate classes, graduate classes, but then…
Finally, somebody takes the 8080 chip and creates a kit computer, and that’s on the cover of the January 1975 Popular Electronics that comes out in December 1974. So we get that, and that’s both exciting — because finally this thing that we’ve expected has happened — but the question is, “Is it happening without us?” And so this company, which is in Albuquerque, New Mexico, we call them up and say, “Hey, we can do software for this machine.” And they say, “Oh yeah, sure.” So we very quickly work on a BASIC for this computer, which I’m well equipped to do, and Paul had some brilliant ideas about how we’d simulate this machine, because we didn’t have one, and that was amazing. So we write this thing and we call them up and we say, “Hey, when you connect a teletype up, what’s the software programming to get the characters in to print them? How do you do that?” The so-called “input output.” And they thought, “Well, that’s interesting. You guys may not be flaky, because actually you’re the first one who asked that question,” which is, if you’re going to really write the software, you eventually have to ask that question. So they give us the answer and Paul flies out with this paper tape of the software.
You did this while you were still at Harvard?
Bill Gates: Right. So I’m a student at Harvard, Paul’s working at Honeywell, but we spend — what was it? — six weeks, and really write this thing, which — you know, my whole career has sort of been building after this thing. It’s one of the most — probably the most fun piece of software I ever wrote. I mean, it’s unbelievable, because it has to be very small — there’s only 4K bytes of memory — and we don’t have the real machine, so you have to be very careful you get everything right. Anyway, so Paul takes it out, and these guys mostly sell kit computers, they’d only assembled a few of them, and so they got it connected up and Paul puts it in and it runs the first time!
But you didn’t even have the machine, did you?
Bill Gates: Yeah, that’s a complication. When you turn a computer on, there’s nothing in it. It doesn’t even know how to go out to the teletype and read this paper tape that has all these funny numbers on it that are this program. So you have to put in — using the switches — a little program, that’s the program called the bootstrap loader that is the instructions to say, “Hey, go read a bunch of numbers off of this paper tape, put those into the memory and then go run that program.” So he wrote a bootstrap loader, literally on the plane flying there, he wrote a nice bootstrap loader. It worked just fine. Later I wrote a really, really small one, because it’s a pain to have to — every time the computer is turned back on you have to reenter the thing, so the less of these funny little instructions, the better. Anyway, so he wrote that, and everybody was amazed because we had to do everything totally right, how we read this instruction set manual and they were selling these kit computers, but they had never really seen it do anything real. And so Paul would type in ‘Print 2 plus 2.’ Print…” and he ran programs and it worked.
And this was a machine that you had never actually seen.
Bill Gates: That’s right. The chip itself was fairly expensive. Paul and I had bought a previous chip to do a very specialized machine. We had bought an 8008 to do a little funny program that did traffic volume printouts, but this 8080 was much better. And we had never had one of those, so we just read the book that described how it worked. And then we made the big computer that we’d been using all those years — and we’re quite expert in — Paul had a really breakthrough idea of how to do the simulation thing. So that gave us the full power of that computer to edit and debug and those things. But if we had any mistake in how we read this thing, that paper tape wasn’t going to work at all. Anyway, so that was very exciting, and we signed a deal with them. That was called MITS, and their computer was called the Altair. And then I left Harvard University and we started Microsoft. So Microsoft was initially based down in Albuquerque, New Mexico. And this is 1973 when we get going.
How did the name Microsoft come about? Do you remember?
Bill Gates: You know, we had been talking about that actually back at Harvard, microcomputer software, and nobody else had done a company doing software for these things, and we thought it was a cool term, “Microsoft.” When we had been kids and sending our names in for mailing lists we’d played around with a lot of company names, including “Allen & Gates” or things like that, but we decided no, it would be better not to have our names in it, because it wasn’t like a law firm that was always kind of a small thing. We thought, “Hey, we’re going to have a big company, so we’ll have a company name.” So “Microsoft” was a very natural choice.
When Ed Roberts of MITS agreed to buy your program, you included a “best efforts” clause requiring him to try to sublicense and promote your software. How did that turn out?
Bill Gates: Microsoft was only a few people and we’d written this BASIC, and the idea was to license it to lots of companies and then to write other software. So the head of MITS said he could help us market it to other people and take a sales commission for that, and I wrote the contract so that if they weren’t serious about promoting it and putting a lot of investment into that, they would lose that right. That was the “best efforts” clause, a very strong requirement. They never got serious about that, and yet they kind of liked the idea of them having the BASIC and other people not. So we were discussing that, how we were going to resolve this problem, because we needed to license it to other people, and we were doing all the work to license it to other people even though they were getting this commission. And right at that time, another company, Pertec, bought MITS, and then those people got confused about the contract and so they weren’t even paying us the money they owed us. They were essentially trying to starve us, so we terminated the contract. It had an arbitration clause. The arbitrator found that we were right. Five out of five reasons to terminate the contract, we were only right about five of them! So that contract was terminated. And then we had to — like, we ended up having to do — built our sales and marketing activities. And by then we started to have some other programs as well. So we started to hire more people and things really got going. The big thing though, was that because Pertec moved that company out to California, we no longer had a reason to be in Albuquerque, because you couldn’t recruit people there as easily as you could to other locations. So we talked about where to move, and eventually, in 1979, we move up to Seattle.
When you decided to leave Harvard to just concentrate on business, what was your parents’ reaction?
Bill Gates: My parents had been fantastic throughout my whole student career. I mean, getting me to go to Lakeside, that my senior year at Lakeside, where I had wanted to take time off and do this job at TRW, they’d been very supportive of that, letting me live down in Vancouver, Washington. I challenged them a little bit when some of my coworkers at TRW said I should skip undergraduate and just go to graduate school, and they were not enthused about that. It looked like I would have an opportunity to do that, but I didn’t, I just went to Harvard. And that was another case where they were right that, socially, being with other undergraduates was good. I got to take graduate courses up at MIT, and I did that to a limited degree. So I kind of had the best of both worlds. Anyway, when it came time to go on leave from Harvard, the policies of the school about — if you’re gone — letting you come back are incredibly generous. So if the enterprise had failed, then I would have been back. So my parents were a little surprised, and kind of wondering what it meant, but they were pretty supportive. And in fact, when we got into this legal dispute with Pertec, my dad gave me good advice. He was very supportive on that, and so we saw that through. And then, as the company became successful, I hope they felt better about it. The only really bad case was if I stayed and the company was kind of mediocre-ally successful. If it failed it would be okay, if it was a big success it would be okay, and they could see I was very energized. And I thought we needed to get in at the very beginning and not waste a year or two, which is what I had left of my undergraduate course requirements.
But if kids wanted to follow in your footsteps today, wouldn’t you advise them to stay in college?
Bill Gates: Well, college is amazing. There are all these smart kids sitting around, you can talk about anything, there are courses you can go to, there’s tests to see if you know what you’re talking about. There is nothing better than a great college for your experience. I would have stayed until the end if it hadn’t been for the urgency. I watch lots of college lectures online now because I enjoy that so much. So unless you have something that’s really uniquely, amazingly time dependent, it’s a great thing to finish the degree.
Do you ever wonder what would have happened if the BASIC program for MITS had not worked?
Bill Gates: Oh, I don’t think it would have been a dramatic setback. We would have figured out what mistake we’d made and eventually gotten the thing running. It turns out, even though we were in this big rush, there weren’t many other people doing serious work at the time. It was another couple of years before other software companies showed up. And even then, they weren’t that serious about hiring people. They didn’t have people who really understood about writing software, and how you created a company around writing software. They didn’t figure out the global nature of the market. So we would have been fine. But it was certainly exciting that there was no mistake at all.
What are you most proud of achieving? We know you’re not done achieving yet, you’re amazingly involved in global health and philanthropy, but if you had to look back now, what would you say you’re most proud of?
Bill Gates: Microsoft was at the center of the personal computer revolution, and particularly the creation of a software market where you went out to lots of companies, and encouraged them to write software for different applications, mundane applications, wild applications. That idea that you would encourage people to be creative, and build software, and there would be a whole industry around that. Microsoft believed in that, and no one else did, and so we got that going. And that’s led now to where you have all these great choices, and it just keeps getting better and better. And it’s because of the volume of machines out there, it can be sold very, very inexpensively. So that whole bootstrap, getting the industry going, making it personal, making there be lots of software, that’s what we are the most proud of.
What does the American Dream mean to you? Do those words have resonance in your own life?
Bill Gates: I think the American Dream is kind of a global dream now, that young people can come up with new ideas and create companies that make a contribution, not just jobs, but whatever their innovations that they bring about. Capitalism is this unbelievable open system that if you combine it with good infrastructure, good education, the creativity that we find for people who have had those chances is always going to surprise us. It’s always going to come up with new seeds, new medicines, new software, new movies, things that make the world a better place.
Could you briefly talk about your vision for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation? Early on you gave a great deal to libraries and schools; now global health seems to be a larger focus.
Bill Gates: The Foundation got started in the late ’90s, with my dad — encouraging me — an executive named Patty Stonesifer, who’d left Microsoft, were helping out. I was still very busy, our kids were very young, but we got going. We put computers in libraries in many different countries, including the United States. We did some scholarship things. We were learning about reproductive health and population issues. And that kept growing, and we met people who knew about vaccines. So it was a part-time thing. Global health was a bit over half; the U.S.-focused libraries, scholarship education work was over a quarter; and it was a final piece that relates to other things to help the poorest, other than just health things, things like finance and savings. And you know, it grew. And then I saw that I could make a unique contribution there, and created a transition plan that was four years in the making. So now I’m full time at the Foundation and playing a role of being the Chairman and traveling a lot. So it’s equally challenging, it’s very fulfilling. It’s taking these resources that I’m lucky enough to have, because of the success of Microsoft, and giving those back to the society in a way that can have the biggest impact.
In your priorities for the Foundation, discovery is one of the first. That’s interesting, because it is kind of a parallel to Microsoft. So even in the area of medicine, and vaccines fighting malaria and so forth, you’re still focused on discovery.
Bill Gates: Absolutely. We need new vaccines, we need cheap vaccines, we need vaccines that are easy to deliver, even in the poorest places, where something like having refrigerators is tough to do. And it does connect to my experience at Microsoft of finding great scientists, making sure they understand the problems that are important, getting them focused on those things, having milestones, even if there are setbacks, and making sure that — if the possibility is still there — that they get the proper backing. This is something that governments don’t do much of. They fund a lot of the great delivery — the foreign aid is very, very important — but on the discovery side there’s been a deep under-investment. Whether it’s a malaria vaccine, tuberculosis vaccine, about 20 different diseases that — if things go well — we’ll have vaccines for most of those within the next decade. So the Foundation is really taking the lead, financing that scientific work, and already some have been discovered. Some are getting out there, but there’s a lot more still to be done.
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us today.
Bill Gates: Yeah. It was fun to talk about it.
