(TMM.TO)(NYSE MKT:TGD) ("Timmins Gold" or the "Company") is pleased to report preliminary production results from its 100% owned San Francisco Mine in Sonora, Mexico for the Company's first quarter ("Q1") ended March 31, 2017. All results are presented in United States dollars ("US Dollars") unless otherwise stated.Commenting on the quarterly performance, Chief Executive Officer, Greg McCunn, said, "The San Francisco mine had a very strong first quarter of the year with gold production ahead of guidance due to operational improvements made in the crushing and leaching circuit resulting in better gold recovery and the initiation of a project to recover gold from a previously closed leach pad. While these improvements are expected to allow us to achieve the upper end of our annual guidance of 70,000 to 75,000 ounces for 2017, we are continuing to re-engineer our life-of-mine plan for San Francisco and expect to publish the updated plan this quarter. We are excited about the potential to improve upon the existing plan for 2018 to 2022.Our balance sheet continued to strengthen with cash increasing by $5 million across the quarter to approximately $39 million at March 31st. We continue to invest the bulk of the cash flow from operations into advancing our high-grade, low cost Ana Paula Project in Guerrero, Mexico. With infill drilling and metallurgical testing largely complete, we anticipate a Pre-Feasibility Study with an updated Mineral Resource Estimate to be published this quarter."Mining and Processing (Three Months Ended March 31st)  Category   Units   Q1 2017   Q1 2016   Ore Processed   000 t   1,963,307   2,003,712   Average Grade Processed   g/t   0.48   0.62   Waste Mined   000 t   3,241,871   4,708,661   Total Mined   000 t   5,183,988   6,707,981   Strip Ratio   W:O   1.67   2.36   Gold Produced   oz   26,048   25,120   Silver Produced   oz   11,899   14,671  The mining operations at San Francisco continued to source ore from all three operating pits: San Francisco Main, La Chicharra and Las Barajitas. The final benches of Phase 4 of the San Francisco pit were being mined at the end of Q1 and increasing amounts of ore were mined from La Chicharra and Las Barajitas. Ore is expected to be fully sourced from these pits during the second and third quarters as waste stripping to prepare Phase 5 of the San Francisco pit takes place.Crushing and heap leaching operations performed well during the quarter, with an average of 21,815 tonnes per day crushed and stacked. A new operating philosophy was implemented in the heap leaching circuit targeting increasing the tenor of the pregnant leach solution ahead of the ADR plant. As well, improvements in the crushing circuit resulted in a finer crush size reporting to the heap leach pads. While final metallurgical balances are still being compiled, these modifications resulted in improved recovery of gold and increased gold production as a result.During the quarter an old heap leach pad (Pad #2) which had an inter-stage liner placed on it during its prior operating life was re-leached, resulting in approximately 1,500 ounces of previously isolated gold being recovered from the pad. The re-leaching is continuing in the second quarter and is expected to offset some of the production decline anticipated due to lack of ore availability in the San Francisco Main pit while Phase 5 pre-stripping takes place.Sales and RevenueAll of the gold produced during the quarter had been sold by quarter end resulting in 26,048 ounces of sales. The average selling price realized was $1,232/oz resulting in $32.3 million in metal revenues. The Company had approximately $39 million in cash as at March 31, 2017, up from $33.9 million at December 31, 2016.Three Months Ended March 31st  Category   Units   Q1 2017   Q1 2016   Gold Sold   oz   26,048   24,667   Realized Gold Price   $/oz   $1,232   $1,160  Technical Information & Qualified Person Notes:This news release was reviewed and approved by Taj Singh, M.Eng, P.Eng, Vice-President of Engineering and Project Development of the Company, who is recognized as a Qualified Person under the guidelines of National Instrument 43-101.About Timmins GoldTimmins Gold is a Canadian gold mining company engaged in exploration, development and production exclusively in Mexico.

("Timmins Gold" or the "Company") (TSX: TMM.TO - News) is pleased to announce an updated reserve and resource estimate for the San Francisco Gold Project in the state of Sonora, Mexico that was previously updated on November 30, 2010. The National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101") Technical Reports describing the details of the updated reserve and resource estimates will be filed on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) within 45 days from the date of this press release.The Mineral Reserve and Resource estimate was prepared by MICON International Ltd. of Toronto. Ontario, using the Canadian Institute of Mining ("CIM") definitions for Mineral Reserves as required by NI 43-101. The updated mineral reserve and resource for the San Francisco Project which includes the nearby La Chicharra open pit is derived from information obtained from a drill program of 700 holes of core and reverse circulation drilling totaling 94,193 meters completed between July, 2010 and June, 2011. The past producing La Chicharra open pit is located 2 kilometres west of the San Francisco open pit. The updated proven and probable reserves for the San Francisco open pit have been estimated at 1,214,000 ounces of gold, represented by 64,245,000 tonnes at 0.588 g/t gold. The updated proven and probable reserves for the La Chicharra open pit have been estimated at 116,000 ounces of gold represented by 8,146,000 tonnes at 0.445 g/t gold. This is a 104% increase over the proven and probable reserves of 780,000 ounces (34,932,000 tonnes at 0.695 grams per tonne), net of production depletion of 129,000 gold ounces. Table 1Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves within the San Francisco and LaChicharra pits with Topography at June 30, 2011, Gold price US $1,100per ounce---------------------------------------------------------------------------PIT                 Ore              Metric tonnes      Gold      Contained                    Type                     (1000)      g/t    Gold Ounces---------------------------------------------------------------------------San Francisco Pit   Proven                  42,850     0.604        831,000                    Probable                21,395     0.556        383,000                    -------------------------------------------------------                    Total                   64,245     0.588      1,214,000---------------------------------------------------------------------------La Chicharra Pit    Proven                   6,180     0.447         89,000                    Probable                 1,966     0.439         27,000                    -------------------------------------------------------                    Total                    8,146     0.445        116,000---------------------------------------------------------------------------Total               Proven                  49,030     0.584        920,000                    Probable                23,361     0.546        410,000                    -------------------------------------------------------                    Total                   72,391     0.572      1,330,000---------------------------------------------------------------------------1.  Mineral reserves are based on a gold price of $1,100 per ounce2.  Reserve includes a dilution factor of 8.3%3.  An internal cutoff grade of 0.14 g/t gold was used for proven and    probable reservesTable 2Mineral Resource Estimate with Drill Data as of the end of June, 2011(Inclusive of Mineral Reserve)---------------------------------------------------------------------------PIT                 Ore              Metric tonnes     Gold      Contained                    Type                     (1000)      g/t    Gold Ounces---------------------------------------------------------------------------San Francisco Pit   Measured                42,546     0.640        876,000                    Indicated               22,698     0.595        434,000                    -------------------------------------------------------                    Total Measured                    & Indicated             65,244     0.625      1,310,000                    -------------------------------------------------------                    Inferred                66,483     0.420        898,000---------------------------------------------------------------------------La Chicharra Pit    Measured                 6,158     0.488         96,000                    Indicated                2,222     0.488         35,000                    -------------------------------------------------------                    Total Measured                    & Indicated              8,380     0.488        131,000                    -------------------------------------------------------                    Inferred                 7,197     0.465        107,000---------------------------------------------------------------------------Total               Measured                48,704     0.621        972,000                    Indicated               24,920     0.586        469,000                    -------------------------------------------------------                    Total Measured                    & Indicated             73,624     0.609      1,441,000                    -------------------------------------------------------                    Total Inferred          73,680     0.424      1,005,000---------------------------------------------------------------------------1.  Mineral resources are based on a gold price of $1,200 per ounce2.  An internal cutoff grade of 0.128 g/t gold was used for measured &    indicated and inferred ounces3.  The inferred resources include material outside of the pit shell. It has    the potential to become additional reserves of the San Francisco mine at    a future stage.The Mineral Reserves are based on a gold price of US$1,100 per ounce.
