Zymeworks Inc. Key Developments

Zymeworks and Daiichi Sankyo Announce Successful Achievement of a Research Milestone in Bispecific Antibody Collaboration
Jul 18 17
Zymeworks Inc. and Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited announced the successful achievement of a research milestone for an immuno-oncology bispecific antibody therapeutic candidate in their collaboration. In conjunction with this achievement, Zymeworks is to receive a payment of one million dollars from Daiichi Sankyo. Under the terms of their existing agreement signed on September 26, 2016, Zymeworks granted Daiichi Sankyo a license to Zymeworks' Azymetric and EFECT platforms to develop a bispecific antibody therapeutic for which Zymeworks is eligible to receive preclinical, clinical and commercial milestone payments, as well as up to double-digit tiered royalties on global product sales. Additionally, Zymeworks obtained a license to certain immuno-oncology antibodies from Daiichi Sankyo, with the right to research, develop and commercialize multiple bispecific products globally in exchange for royalties on global product sales.


Zymeworks Inc. Presents Safety and Anti-Tumor Activity Data from the Ongoing Phase 1 Study of ZW25
Jun 4 17
Zymeworks Inc. announced results from the dose escalation portion of the first-in-human study of ZW25, a novel Azymetric™ bispecific antibody targeting two distinct domains of the HER2 receptor. ZW25 was well-tolerated at all dose levels evaluated with single agent anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced HER2-expressing cancers that had progressed after multiple lines of therapy, including HER2-targeted agents. These results provide the framework for further advancement of ZW25 across multiple cancer indications. A total of 16 patients were enrolled in the study, including 8 with breast cancer, 6 with gastric, gastroesophageal junction, or esophageal (GE) cancer, and 2 with other HER2-expressing cancers. All patients were heavily pretreated having received a median of 4 prior systemic regimens for metastatic disease, which included trastuzumab. Breast cancer patients were also treated with T-DM1 (n=8); pertuzumab (n=6), and lapatinib (n=6) and had a median of 6 prior HER2-targeted regimens for metastatic disease. Patients were treated with weekly ZW25 at 5 mg/kg (n=3), 10 mg/kg (n=6), or 15 mg/kg (n=7) in cycles of 4 weeks each. ZW25 was well-tolerated at all dose levels, with no dose-limiting toxicities. The majority of adverse events (AEs) were Grade 1 or 2, with no treatment-related serious AEs and no changes in cardiac function. The most common AEs were diarrhea and infusion reactions, reported in 7/16 patients each. Treatment-related Grade 3 AEs occurred in a single patient and included hypophosphatemia, fatigue, and arthralgia. Eight patients had anti-drug antibodies (ADA) prior to initiating treatment with ZW25; there was no evidence of increases from baseline levels and no patients developed new ADA. Durable single-agent anti-tumor activity was seen with patients having received up to 8 cycles of treatment at the time of data cut-off. In 14 response-evaluable patients (defined as undergoing at least one tumor restaging), best overall response (BOR) was 2 partial response (PR), 4 stable disease (SD), and 8 progressive disease (PD). The majority of patients with measurable disease had a decrease in the size of target lesions. BOR in 8 breast cancer patients was 2 PR, 3 SD (> 6 months in one patient), and 3 PD, for an overall disease control rate (CR, PR, or SD) of 63%. Three of the breast cancer patients developed PD due to brain metastases but maintained systemic disease control at the time of progression. BOR in 4 response-evaluable patients with GE cancers included SD > 4 cycles in 1 patient, and 3 PD. Four patients remain active on study.


Zymeworks Inc. to Present its Phase 1 Clinical Trial Dose Escalation Data at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting
May 18 17
Zymeworks Inc. announced that it will be presenting Phase 1 clinical trial dose escalation data at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, being held from June 2-6, 2017 in Chicago, Illinois. The presentation will include detailed safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity data for the dose escalation stage of Zymeworks' Phase 1 clinical trial of ZW25, Zymeworks' lead product candidate. Presenting on behalf of Zymeworks will be lead investigator, Dr. Funda Meric-Bernstam, MD. Dr. Meric-Bernstam is Chair, Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics; Medical Director, Khalifa Institute for Personalized Cancer Therapy; Nellie B.  Connally Chair in Breast Cancer Research; and Professor, Divisions of Cancer Medicine and Surgury at, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and The University of Texas. ZW25 is Zymeworks' lead product candidate currently being evaluated in an adaptive Phase 1 clinical trial in the United States, based on Zymeworks' Azymetric platform. It is a bispecific antibody that can simultaneously bind two non-overlapping epitopes, known as biparatopic binding, of HER2 resulting in dual HER2 signal blockade, increased binding and removal of HER2 protein from the cell surface, and enhanced effector function.  These combined mechanisms of action have led to significant anti-tumor activity in preclinical models of breast cancer. Zymeworks is developing ZW25 as a best-in-class HER2-targeting antibody intended as a treatment option for patients with any solid tumor that expresses HER2.
