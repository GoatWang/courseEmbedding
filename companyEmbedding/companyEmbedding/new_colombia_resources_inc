Focused on the acquisition and development of high-quality metallurgical coal producers

















About US
New Colombia Resources Inc. (“New Colombia” or the “Company”) is a publicly traded metallurgical coal company listed on the OTC under the symbol “NEWC”. The Company is focused on the acquisition and development of high quality metallurgical coal producers in Colombia, considered one of the most attractive emerging markets. With an estimated US$378 billion in gross domestic product in 2013, it became the third largest economy in Latin America and is growing 4% to 6% per year. Colombia has the largest coal reserves in Latin America and is the fourth largest coal producer in the world. Total coal production decreased by 4% in 2013 to 85.5 million tonnes. Coal producers aim to increase coal output in 2015. Colombia privatized its coal sector in 2004 and is committed to investing in infrastructure to support increased mining.
We are focusing on our La Tabaquera coal and rock project (the “Project”) located in the Municipality of Guaduas, approximately 100 kilometers northwest of Bogota. This Project’s haul roads are easily accessible either by National Highway I-50 or the new Ruta del Sol. The property is within 50kM of the Magdalena River, providing easy transport to terminals in Barranquilla, Santa Marta or Cartagena for export. The Magdalena River is being dredged to allow cargo from La Dorada which in close proximity to their mine.
Recently we purchased a rock crushing plant with processing capacity of over 100 m3/hour of aggregates which is expected to be operating in by August 2015. Demand is strong for building material in Colombia since many illegal mines have been closed as new construction and infrastructure projects come online. Construction of the final sector of the Ruta del Sol road project was approved to begin.  It will consist of tunnels and bridges within 5 kilometers or our coal and rock mine.  This allows us to supply road builders with aggregates, and then use these roads to move our coal to export terminals.  We intend to fund our coal operations with the cash flow generated from the sale of processed aggregates.
An “Estimate of Probable Reserves and Grantable Potential of Coal at La Tabaquera Mine” report was prepared on behalf of New Colombia in September 2011. The report estimated reserves for La Tabaquera Project of 13,073,935 cubic meters for a total of 16,996,116 tonnes of bituminous coal (non JORC compliant), with 70% being metallurgical hard coking coal and 30% thermal coal.
Based on the high quality of our coal, we expect to sell at a premium to other domestic coals.  We believe our mines have Blue Gem coal, only found along the Kentucky Tennessee border in the U.S. and Colombia.  This coal is unique because of its low ash and high carbon content.  It is in high demand for the silicon and silicon based alloy market.  Beginning in 2015, New Colombia will concentrate tunnel mining its hard coking coal seams first. The Company expects to mine 20,000 tonnes of hard coking coal per month.
We own the mining title and land where we will commence operations.  Our Mining Plan of Operations (PTO) was approved in December 2013 by the Agencia Nacional de Mineria (ANM).  In April 2013 we applied for an environmental license which we expect to be issued soon.
New Colombia also has renewable resource projects in Colombia they are developing and plan to spin off as a dividend to shareholders.

Change Coming to Columbia: Medical Marijuana Legalization
Late in May, the Colombian Congress approved medical marijuana legislation. The law was approved with 83 votes in favor, and only three against. The law does not approve the use of marijuana for recreational use. The new law is guided by principals of access and quality -- all Colombians will have equal access to the medication.

New Colombia Resources, Inc. (OTC Pink: NEWC) is engaged as a metallurgical coal mining and cannabis extract business. Shares of the multi-sector business are soaring 39%, through early trading on Wednesday, January 25, 2017. Overall, the stock has seen average daily volume of 12.01 million shares exchange hands over the past month. However, volume of 21.98 million shares or dollar volume of $437,600, has already exchanged hands, during early trading today.
Shares of New Colombia Resources, Inc. are rallying Wednesday, after the company announced that its Sannabis Indica essential oil and pure extract product was able to shrink a cancerous tumor by 50%. The patient is a 81-year-old female with late-stage stomach cancer, which includes a 8 cm tumor. The trial began back in June 2016 and by December 2016, the patient was able to celebrate her 82nd birthday, which was not expected given the state of the cancer. Management says more diagnostics are still needed, but the findings are very encouraging. Here is the full press release detailing of the tumor reduction:
New Colombia Resources, Inc. Press Release:
CALI, COLOMBIA–(Marketwired – Jan 25, 2017) – New Colombia Resources, Inc. (“the Company”) ( OTC PINK : NEWC ), a Colombian natural resource company listed in the U.S., with premium metallurgical coal and medical marijuana assets, is pleased to announce their medical marijuana joint venture, Sannabis SAS, believes their Cannabis Indica Essential Oil, administered along with their Cannabis Indica Pure Extract, significantly reduced a cancerous tumor in an 81-year-old patient.
The patient, an 81-year-old female, had late stage stomach cancer with an 8-cm tumor at the mouth of her stomach. After taking (2) 5 ml syringes of Sannabis’ Pure Indica Extract and (2) 5 ml bottles of their Cannabis Indica Essential oil called SANNAYAH over three months, the patients cancerous tumor shrunk from 8 cm down to less than 4 cm. Although further studies need to be done, both Sannabis and the patient’s caregiver are convinced this combination of products caused this reduction and pain relief.
Originally the patient was scheduled to have an operation last year to remove the tumor. During the operation, once they saw the tumor, doctors decided it was best not to remove it giving the patient a terminal diagnosis and a box of morphine patches. The patient’s daughter then contacted Sannabis and began treating her mother with the essential oil and pure Indica extract. Not only did her tumor shrink, but she didn’t need the morphine patches for pain, and she also stopped taking her blood pressure medication. For before and after diagnostic images of the tumor taken on June 28 and December 7, 2016, visit https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxSKP5j2FlseSFdiRjlGUjBpRkE
The patient’s daughter/caregiver will be filming a testimonial this week to be posted on Sannabis’ website. “This case and others like it is why we’ve worked so hard promote the benefits of medical marijuana in Colombia. This patient’s family did not expect to celebrate their mother’s 82nd birthday last month. We will work even harder to promote the benefits of Colombian medical marijuana essential oils and extracts legally in the U.S.,” stated John Campo, President of New Colombia Resources, Inc.
Sannabis believes the essential oil polarizes the effect or their Pure Cannabis Indica Extract. To view their SANNAYAH essential oil product, visit http://www.sannabis.co/_p/prd2/4584850781/product/sannayah
To view their Cannabis Indica Pure Extract, visit http://www.sannabis.co/_p/prd2/3503865421/product/extracto-puro-de-cannabis-indica
Sannabis’ SANNAYAH is the most exclusive product they manufacture. One pound of medical marijuana flower, leaves, and stems is used to produce 5 ml of essential oil using steam extraction. A similar product made in the U.S., at current prices in states where legal, would be very costly to produce and deprive many patients of the benefits of Cannabis Indica essential oil.
A production company from San Francisco is in Colombia producing a documentary, for U.S. distribution, about medical marijuana and is filming promotional footage and testimonials for Sannabis. Today they will be visiting Corinto, Colombia’s top marijuana growing region to interview the Mayor, police, and others promoting a new medical marijuana industry.
To view a nationally televised documentary about medical marijuana in Colombia featuring Sannabis growers, patients, and management, visit the first video on http://www.sannabis.co/video. This documentary interviewed Sannabis patients and their loved ones around the country using Sannabis products.

New Colombia Resources Announces Sannabis has been Granted Colombia’s First Health Registry Approval for Cannabis based Products

BUZ INVESTORS  PRESS RELEASE  New Colombia Resources, Inc. (“the Company”) ( OTC : NEWC ), a Colombian natural resource company listed in the U.S., with premium metallurgical coal and medical marijuana assets, announces their joint venture in Colombia, Sannabis, has received a “Registro Sanitario” from Colombia’s Ministry of Health’s INVIMA (National Institute for Food and Drug Monitoring).
The Registro Sanitario number is NSOC78859-17CO, this can also be accessed directly on INVIMA’s website by inputing Expediente number 20127339, http://farmacovigilancia.invima.gov.co:8082/Consultas/consultas/consreg_encabcum.jsp
Their registry number is for 10 brands, but only four were registered; Sannaxhol (pain relief, anti-inflammatory), Sannaderm (for skin abrasion and post tattoo care), Sannalip (lip balm), and a product soon to be announced. The Company plans to register an additional six products possibly through joint ventures for worldwide distribution. These products are manufactured by an INVIMA certified manufacturing facility with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). Potential joint venture partners or licensees are welcome to contact New Colombia Resources at jcampo@newcolombiaresources.com.

New Colombia Resources will begin marketing Sannaxhol in the U.S. with retired Colombian Major League Baseball World Series MVP, Edgar Renteria, also a shareholder of New Colombia Resources, Inc. Mr. Renteria’s was chosen by MLB to manage the World Team during this year’s All Star Week in Miami. This platform will be used by New Colombia Resources to launch Sannaxhol, an effective anti-inflammatory pain product, in the U.S.
Sannabis has first mover advantage while others try to position themselves as Colombia’s new medical marijuana regulations are implemented. New Colombia Resource’s joint venture in Colombia, Sannabis SAS, has been legally producing non-smoked medical marijuana products since 2014, their in-house doctor and others prescribe these products to patients. Sannabis supports small producers legally on an Indian reservation creating opportunity for local farmers to grow medical marijuana legally verses initiating illegal crops. Sannabis supports indigenous farmers that are small producers taking pride in their medicines that provide relief and potentially save lives.
Sannabis is carefully monitoring the issuance of the resolution to regulate medical marijuana to apply for the appropriate licenses that will continue to help small producers. To see the Sannabis catalog with technical specifications of their products visit, http://www.sannabis.co/ver-catalogo
New Colombia Resources is working with a partner to submit an application for an orphan drug designation for a pharmaceutical product that will be announced upon submission. In the meantime, the Company will file the health registries of the four products approved by INVIMA with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), INVIMA’s registry is recognized by the U.S. FDA and most health departments around the world. These products are derived from hemp seed oil which can legally be imported into the United States with a THC level under .3%.
“Most hemp seed products are imported to the United States from Canada. Needless to say, Colombia has more ideal growing conditions than Canada, evidenced by the Canadian medical marijuana companies down here trying to set up shop. We’re positioning ourselves as a leading distributor of high quality ‘Made in Colombia’ medical marijuana and hemp products around the world,” stated John Campo, President of New Colombia Resources, Inc.
New Colombia Resources would also like to announce their auditors have informed them to expect their first SEC filings to be ready this week, if all goes well. The Company is very committed to being SEC compliant.
New Colombia’s President, John Campo, was recently interviewed by S&P Global Market Intelligence, for a copy of that report visit, http://www.snl.com/web/client?auth=inherit – news/article?id=40765771&cdid=A-40765771-10290

New Colombia Resources, Inc. (NEWC) has been Granted Colombia’s First Health Registry Approval for Cannabis based Products

New Colombia Resources Announces Sannabis has been Granted Colombia’s First Health Registry Approval for Cannabis based Products









New Colombia Resources, Inc. (“the Company”) ( OTC : NEWC ), a Colombian natural resource company listed in the U.S., with premium metallurgical coal and medical marijuana assets, announces their joint venture in Colombia, Sannabis, has received a “Registro Sanitario” from Colombia’s Ministry of Health’s INVIMA (National Institute for Food and Drug Monitoring).





















The Registro Sanitario number is NSOC78859-17CO, this can also be accessed directly on INVIMA’s website by inputing Expediente number 20127339, http://farmacovigilancia.invima.gov.co:8082/Consultas/consultas/consreg_encabcum.jsp
Their registry number is for 10 brands, but only four were registered; Sannaxhol (pain relief, anti-inflammatory), Sannaderm (for skin abrasion and post tattoo care), Sannalip (lip balm), and a product soon to be announced. The Company plans to register an additional six products possibly through joint ventures for worldwide distribution. These products are manufactured by an INVIMA certified manufacturing facility with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). Potential joint venture partners or licensees are welcome to contact New Colombia Resources at jcampo@newcolombiaresources.com.
New Colombia Resources will begin marketing Sannaxhol in the U.S. with retired Colombian Major League Baseball World Series MVP, Edgar Renteria, also a shareholder of New Colombia Resources, Inc. Mr. Renteria’s was chosen by MLB to manage the World Team during this year’s All Star Week in Miami. This platform will be used by New Colombia Resources to launch Sannaxhol, an effective anti-inflammatory pain product, in the U.S.
Sannabis has first mover advantage while others try to position themselves as Colombia’s new medical marijuana regulations are implemented. New Colombia Resource’s joint venture in Colombia, Sannabis SAS, has been legally producing non-smoked medical marijuana products since 2014, their in-house doctor and others prescribe these products to patients. Sannabis supports small producers legally on an Indian reservation creating opportunity for local farmers to grow medical marijuana legally verses initiating illegal crops. Sannabis supports indigenous farmers that are small producers taking pride in their medicines that provide relief and potentially save lives.
Sannabis is carefully monitoring the issuance of the resolution to regulate medical marijuana to apply for the appropriate licenses that will continue to help small producers. To see the Sannabis catalog with technical specifications of their products visit, http://www.sannabis.co/ver-catalogo
New Colombia Resources is working with a partner to submit an application for an orphan drug designation for a pharmaceutical product that will be announced upon submission. In the meantime, the Company will file the health registries of the four products approved by INVIMA with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), INVIMA’s registry is recognized by the U.S. FDA and most health departments around the world. These products are derived from hemp seed oil which can legally be imported into the United States with a THC level under .3%.
“Most hemp seed products are imported to the United States from Canada. Needless to say, Colombia has more ideal growing conditions than Canada, evidenced by the Canadian medical marijuana companies down here trying to set up shop. We’re positioning ourselves as a leading distributor of high quality ‘Made in Colombia’ medical marijuana and hemp products around the world,” stated John Campo, President of New Colombia Resources, Inc.
New Colombia Resources would also like to announce their auditors have informed them to expect their first SEC filings to be ready this week, if all goes well. The Company is very committed to being SEC compliant.
New Colombia’s President, John Campo, was recently interviewed by S&P Global Market Intelligence, for a copy of that report visit, http://www.snl.com/web/client?auth=inherit – news/article?id=40765771&cdid=A-40765771-10290
Sannabis products made headlines recently in Colombia when their Cannabis Exhibition in the halls of Congress was abruptly cancelled by the President of the Senate for political reasons, to view the news clip visit, https://www.facebook.com/sannabis.oficial/videos/vb.1064330270249615/1763729956976306/?type=2&theater

						 from   New Colombia Resources, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


BOGOTA, Colombia, April 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --
New Colombia Resources, Inc. (OTC: NEWC), a U.S. company with natural resource assets in Colombia is pleased to post this letter to shareholders…
Dear Shareholders: 
I'm happy to report that we are finally on the path to significant cash flow.  We realize the extreme importance of being current with our SEC filings and are taking steps to do so. Our limited cash resources were used to build two businesses, aggregate and coal mining and Medical Marijuana products in Colombia. Company current assets, most liabilities, subsidiary ownerships, business plans, etc. are all in the 2014 audited 10K Annual Report filed last year.
To our service providers and debt holders we appreciate your patience and belief in us. We are making every effort to prepare our 2015 10K Annual Report and subsequent Q1'2016 quarterly report. Our accounting firm should be able to move quickly once they receive payment. Before last year New Colombia Resources had never been not current and always filed on a timely manner. Going forward we don't anticipate this happening again as we aim to trade on a higher exchange.  
Medical Marijuana 
Our Sannabis subsidiary is a medical marijuana pioneer in Colombia operating in an area notorious for growing high quality marijuana all year round. Our partner, Juan Pablo Guzman, began spearheading a legal hemp and cannabis industry in this region 20 years ago. A recent article labeled this area as the "Lost City of Marijuana." Click here for photos http://qz.com/652788/the-biggest-losers-from-colombias-historic-peace-deal-poor-marijuana-farmers/
Our aim is to change from "lost city" to "burgeoning city" by socializing our project to indigenous families to grow for us on the reservation using our strict organic and security protocols.  Many have embraced us and are now proud to be involved in this legal industry providing their native medicine to the ill while providing for their families. Most indigenous families strongly oppose illegal drug trafficking and are anxious to not only grow quality organic medicine but create ancillary businesses that will provide value added jobs and products. They have used the cannabis plant to cure for generations and can't comprehend the fuss it causes around the world.  We're committed to dominating the domestic medical cannabis market in Colombia, however, I'm focusing heavily on the international market to sustain our region.
Late last month we hosted a representative of the Ministry of Justice's Drug Policy Council that was responsible to drafting the presidential decree legalizing medical marijuana last year. He was impressed with the protocols we use for organic growing and processing, and security.  We use strict measures to guarantee no illicit marijuana will leave our facility.  The transparency with them since our beginning in 2014 has paid off greatly.
This past Saturday mayors of the municipalities mentioned in this article visited our medical marijuana fields and laboratory on the Nasa Indian Reservation.  We hosted a 3-hour discussion and education seminar on this new industry using Sannabis as a model of how a legal medical cannabis business should operate.  We expect joint ventures with these municipalities and will announce them one at a time.  We operate in a conflict zone that will benefit from Colombia's pending peace deal.  Many organizations are looking for projects to fund that will put people to work in this region, several international organizations are interested in what we're doing.
We'll announce significant sales, joint ventures, and associations as they happen.
Mining 
Yesterday the Vice President of Colombia inaugurated the construction of the San Miguel Interchange of the Ruta del Sol road project, part of Section 1 of the 1000 km mega project.  Section 1 is all complete except 23 km that runs through our property. We will supply the material for this road then use it to move coal to the ports. Click here to read about the inauguration http://www.radiosantafe.com/2016/04/21/con-intercambiador-vial-san-miguel-avanza-comunicacion-de-villeta-con-guaduas-y-la-ruta-del-sol-1/    
New Colombia Resources owns Concession Contract # ILE-09551 for coal and other minable resources. Our Blue Gem Coal is used to make silicon metals for solar panels, electric car batteries, and portable electronics.  Although we have exceptional quality coal and our work permit was approved in late 2013, the coal industry collapsed so we turned our attention to aggregates to supply the many local road projects in Colombia. In 2014 we purchased a rock crushing plant capable of processing 1000 m3/day. This past January South American Explorations completed a comprehensive Work Plan for extraction of building materials that we submitted to the Agencia Nacional de Mineria (ANM) in February. 
We received notice this week that the mining agency will perform a site visit on April 27, this is the final step to approvals. The submitted work plan is for one work shift of 225,000 m3/year of processed aggregates, our breakeven point is 135,000 m3. Anticipated sales for the first year of operation will exceed $ 3,000,000, the cash flow will be used to begin extracting metallurgical coal. I'm in discussions with Kentucky metallurgical coal miners that sold out in Kentucky but still have huge equipment, experience, and customers we can use. I expect coal from Colombia to replace the metallurgical not being mined in the U.S. but has increasing demand. Colombia is the largest importer of coal into the U.S.
We are setting up a meeting with the road contractor this week to enter into a purchase contract. We are in Guaduas, to see the road project click http://www.consorciovialhelios.com/proyectos.php?seccion=3

Some of you have been here to see our operations, I invite all of you to do the same. Please email me for documentation of any item mentioned is this letter.  I look forward to keeping you current on all developments.  
Sincerely yours, 
John Campo

 “I share my shareholder’s frustration,  but at this point I have to let the auditors do their job.  All I can do is give them what they ask for, which I have.  I was told for the past two weeks we would be done the following week.”  John Campo CEO - March 9, 2017 https://insiderfinancial.com/heres-what-really-matters-about-the-latest-new-colombia-resources-inc-otcmktsnewc-release/120027/                             NEWC IS DELIQUENT IN IT'S SEC FILINGS    +   Corporate Profile New Colombia Resources, Inc. is focused on the acquisition and development of high-quality metallurgical coal properties in the Republic of Colombia.

(“New Colombia” or the “Company”) is a publicly traded resource company listed on the OTC under the symbol “NEWC”. The Company is focused on the acquisition and development of high quality metallurgical coal properties in Colombia, considered one of the most attractive emerging markets. With an estimated US$378 billion in gross domestic product in 2013, it became the third largest economy in Latin America and is growing 4% to 6% per year. Colombia has the largest coal reserves in Latin America and is the fourth largest coal producer in the world. Total coal production decreased by 4% in 2013 to 85.5 million tonnes. Coal producers aim to increase coal output in 2015. Colombia privatized its coal sector in 2004 and is committed to investing in infrastructure to support increased mining. We are focusing on our La Tabaquera coal and rock project (the “Project”) located in the Municipality of Guaduas, approximately 100 kilometers northwest of Bogota. This Project’s haul roads are easily accessible either by National Highway I-50 or the new Ruta del Sol. The property is within 50kM of the Magdalena River, providing easy transport to terminals in Barranquilla, Santa Marta or Cartagena for export. The Magdalena River is being dredged to allow cargo from La Dorada which in close proximity to their mine. Recently we purchased a rock crushing plant with processing capacity of over 100 m3/hour of aggregates which is expected to be operating in by August 2015. Demand is strong for building material in Colombia since many illegal mines have been closed as new construction and infrastructure projects come online. Construction of the final sector of the Ruta del Sol road project was approved to begin. It will consist of tunnels and bridges within 5 kilometers or our coal and rock mine. This allows us to supply road builders with aggregates, and then use these roads to move our coal to export terminals. We intend to fund our coal operations with the cash flow generated from the sale of processed aggregates. An “Estimate of Probable Reserves and Grantable Potential of Coal at La Tabaquera Mine” report was prepared on behalf of New Colombia in September 2011. The report estimated reserves for La Tabaquera Project of 13,073,935 cubic meters for a total of 16,996,116 tonnes of bituminous coal (non JORC compliant), with 70% being metallurgical hard coking coal and 30% thermal coal. Based on the high quality of our coal, we expect to sell at a premium to other domestic coals. We believe our mines have Blue Gem coal, only found along the Kentucky Tennessee border in the U.S. and Colombia. This coal is unique because of its low ash and high carbon content. It is in high demand for the silicon and silicon based alloy market. Beginning in 2015, New Colombia will concentrate tunnel mining its hard coking coal seams first. The Company expects to mine 20,000 tonnes of hard coking coal per month. We own the mining title and land where we will commence operations. Our Mining Plan of Operations (PTO) was approved in December 2013 by the Agencia Nacional de Mineria (ANM). In April 2013 we applied for an environmental license which we expect to be issued soon.   https://finance.yahoo.com/news/colombia-resources-announces-sannabis-subsidiary-123000253.htm  New Colombia Resources Announces Sannabis Subsidiary Receives Multi-million Peso Purchase Order of their Medical Marijuana Products From Doctors of a 100-year-old Hospital Foundation in Colombia Sannabis receives second bulk order from distributor to Private Label their Climax Product CALI, Colombia, April 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- New Colombia Resources, Inc. (NEWC), a U.S. company with natural resource assets in Colombia is pleased to announce that its subsidiary, Sannabis SAS, has received a multi-million-peso purchase order from doctors of a well-known hospital foundation in Medellin, Colombia.  This 100-year-old foundation has a University Hospital, Children's hospital, and an Institute of Medical Technology.   These doctors will offer medical service visits introducing Sannabis products direct to patient's homes.  Medellin's urban area is Colombia's second largest with a population of over 3.5 Million people. Sannabis products are well accepted in Medellin therefore the company is focusing a strong sales effort in this region and plans to open addition distribution points. Sannabis is very pleased with the testimonials for their Climax female lubricant product which they private labeled for a distributor in Colombia.  We congratulate the distributor with the success they've had in creating a niche market for this lubricant made with our 100% organic cannabis sativa extract and coconut oil. According to this article in Colombia's leading newspaper, El Pais, the distributor surveyed 50 women that used the product with favorable results, which is evidenced by their re-order. Sannabis has received a second bulk order from this distributor.http://www.elpais.com.co/elpais/cali/noticias/spray-sube-deseo-sexual In addition to their original Sannabis brand products, and due to Sannabis' position as the only legal mass producer of medical cannabis based products in Colombia, the company is working with entrepreneurs that want to develop brands and market medical cannabis products.  This is in line with their plan of being mass producers of high quality 100% organic cannabis extract, while maintaining the top brand in the industry, Sannabis.  Although the media gives the distributor credit for developing the product, it was developed, produced, and bottled by Sannabis. Sannabis is working with an in-house distributor that will mass market the Sannabis Climax brand female lubricant spray to a different demographic with different price points and presentation so as to not directly compete with private label partners.     https://finance.yahoo.com/news/colombia-resources-announces-sannabis-subsidiary-124200931.html New Colombia Resources Announces Sannabis Subsidiary Receives Purchase Order for their Medical Marijuana Products from a Pharmacy Chain Company Scientific Advisor, Dr. Robert Melamede Ph.D. now in Dubai introducing Sannabis products to Middle Eastern Countries CALI, Colombia, April 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --      New Colombia Resources, Inc.

Dr. Robert Melamede Ph.D., scientific advisor to Sannabis and New Colombia Resources, is now in Dubai as a guest speaker at the World Congress on Oncology and Radiology held from April 18-20.

The truth can no longer be suppressed by ignorance," stated Dr. Robert Melamede, Scientific Advisor to Sannabis and New Colombia Resources.

Announces Results of Coal Surface Samples Showing High Grade Anthracite Qualities in Colombia The Company works closer to getting an N.I. 43-101 The results are available on the Coal Specifications page of the company's new website, http://www.newcolombiaresources.com. The samples taken by SGS in June were analyzed by SGS Minerals Services in Barranquilla, Colombia on July 11, 2013.  Of the 9 samples analyzed, 7 were very high quality coal and 2 were lower quality coal.  The Company is extremely pleased with the first two samples which showed High Grade (HG) anthracite values with an 80% fixed carbon content, .64% sulfur, and 9.5% ash.  The company is not satisfied with the lower quality results of 2 samples and is waiting for a formal report from SGS to determine the locations and extraction method of these samples. New Colombia Resources believes the majority of their coal has a coking coal to semi-anthracite rank.  A paper titled Coal Resources of the Americas published by the American Geological Society stated "middle Guaduas is characterized by thick beds of shale that are subdivided by sandstone and good concentrations of mineable coal beds which make this unit the best coal producer."  The paper goes on to say that "thermo metamorphic action changed the rank of the coal beds in Guaduas from bituminous to meta-anthracite."    About SGS    SGS is the world's leading inspection, verification, testing and certification company. They are recognized as the global benchmark for quality and integrity. With more than 75,000 employees, they operate a network of more than 1,500 offices and laboratories around the world. Their core services can be divided into four categories: inspection, testing, certification, and verification.
