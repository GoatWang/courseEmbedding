 John B. Hess 1954— Biography



      John B. Hess
      
      1954–
    











        Chairman and chief executive officer, Amerada Hess
      


      Nationality: American.
    

      Born: April 5, 1954.
    

      Education: Harvard College, BA, 1975; Harvard University, MBA, 1977.
    

      Family: Son of Leon Hess (business executive) and Norma (maiden name
      unknown); married Susan Elizabeth Kessler.
    

      Career: Amerada Hess, 1976–1986, graduate trainee, senior vice
      president; 1986–1995, senior executive vice president;
      1995–, chairman and chief executive officer.
    

      Address: Amerada Hess, 1185 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York
      10036; http://www.hess.com.
    

      ■ Amerada Hess, also known simply as Hess, is a family business.
      With 2003 sales of about $14.3 billion, Amerada (an acronym of
      "America" and "Canada") Hess is an integrated
      oil and gas company that conducts exploration and production globally. As
      of 2004 the company's proven reserves totaled 646 million barrels
      of oil and 2.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas. Hess owns 50 percent of
      a refinery it operates in the U.S. Virgin Islands and owns a smaller one
      in New Jersey; it sells gasoline through more than one thousand gas
      stations, primarily in the eastern United States. A third-generation oil
      and gas businessman, John Hess took over the company in 1995 from his
      father, Leon Hess. Following his father's death, John Hess found
      himself walking in the footsteps of a giant.
    

      A PATRIARCH'S AMERICAN DREAM
    

      Mores Hess, Leon's father, was a Lithuanian immigrant trained to be
      a kosher butcher who also ran a fuel-delivery business, coal yard, and gas
      station. His business faltered during the Depression. Leon Hess was a
      delivery boy for his father when he took over the bankrupt company in
      1933. He began building the company with a product for which other oil
      companies had little use: no. 6 residual fuel oil, a black, tarry
      sub-stance left over after refining. Hess saw that utilities and other big
      users were switching from coal to no. 6 when they could get it, and he
      built a fleet of trucks capable of keeping the fuel oil warm until
      delivery, gradually expanding his reach far beyond New Jersey and New
      York.
    

      By 1938 Leon Hess had 12 trucks and was able to build his first oil
      terminal at Perth Amboy, New Jersey. The oil terminal expanded during
      World War II while Leon Hess served in the U.S. Army under General George
      Patton. Ultimately Hess landed at Normandy just after D-Day and was
      wounded. Following the war Hess returned to work and by 1950 had bought an
      oil terminal in Houston. By 1958 the company started crude oil exploration
      and production in Mississippi, buying both a pipeline and petroleum
      reserves. In 1963 Hess acquired a refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas, and
      then built the biggest project of his life, the Virgin Islands Refinery.
      In 1969 the company merged with Amerada Petroleum to create Amerada Hess.
      By the time of his death in 1999, Leon Hess's personal stock
      holdings were worth more than $700 million. Leon Hess granted only one
      interview over his 60-year career, during which he said: "My
      parents always told me to guard my reputation. I was brought up all my
      life to stay out of the limelight and I'm never going to
      change" (
      
        Newsday
      
      , January 25, 1995).
    

      A PRIVILEGED CHILDHOOD
    

      While John Hess grew up with many of the trappings of wealth, he still
      pumped gas for the family Hess stations. The only son among three
      siblings, he joined his father on foreign oil fields at age seven and
      began working for the family business in 1976, as a graduate trainee. As a
      Harvard undergraduate he studied in Beirut, became fluent in Arabic and
      Farsi, and later befriended Middle Eastern oil ministers. By 1984 he was a
      senior vice president, managing exploration and production operations and
      contributing to the development of fields in Canada and the Gulf of
      Mexico. At a 1987 event bringing together various leaders in the oil
      industry, he introduced Abu Dhabi's oil minister, Mana Said
      al-Otaiba, in faultless Arab dialect. By 1991 he was earning $700,000 a
      year and being groomed to succeed his father. William P. Tavoulareas,
      retired president of Mobil Corporation, said he had confidence in his
       abilities, but added: "How can any son follow an act like
      that?" (
      
        BusinessWeek
      
      , June 29, 1987).
    

      A FATHER PASSES THE REINS
    

      From 1990 to 1995 Amerada Hess struggled with erratic performance that
      seemed attributable to Leon Hess's advancing age. The firm had a
      $268.2 million loss in 1993 as sales dropped to $5.9 billion. A rebound in
      1994 was modest: a $73.7 million net on $6.7 billion in sales. In
      1995's opening quarter Hess earned just $25.2 million on $1.98
      billion in sales, down from the previous year.
    

      Like his father before him, Leon Hess worked well past 80. At a press
      conference during which he passed the torch to his son, Leon Hess wept and
      said, "You have a good young management team in place" (
      
        Platt's Oilgram News
      
      , May 4, 1995).
    

      Oil analysts noted that a change of management was long overdue at the
      company: Lehman Brothers oil analyst Bernard Picchi stated,
      "it's fair to say that the company has been a little out of
      step with the rest of the industry." He noted the company's
      "parochial" and "inward looking" way of
      operating and how this extended even to its representation in trade
      associations (
      
        Platt's Oilgram News
      
      , May 4, 1995).
    

      John Hess was cut from a different cloth than his father. He had an Ivy
      League education, while his father never went to college. He also had a
      lot in common with his predecessor, including a competitive spirit and
      fierce work ethic. Said Nicholas Brady, a board member of Amerada Hess and
      a former Treasury secretary: "Like his father, John is tireless.
      They're the same in their preoccupation with business. It's
      a way of life for John" (
      
        New York Times
      
      , May 21, 1999). Another trait that Hess shared with his father was an
      aversion to the media. Both routinely turned down requests for interviews.
      John Hess quickly and quietly emerged as the antithesis to the modern,
      high-profile CEO of a leading publicly traded company.
    

      Although John Hess was thought to be very close to his father, who was the
      best man at his wedding, the relationship had a drawback: Hess may have
      had the title and control of the firm, but from 1994 to 1999 he was still
      symbolically under the shadow of his father, who controlled 12.9 percent
      of Hess stock, compared with his son's 1.7 percent. Said Eugene L.
      Nowak, oil analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds: "Leon is not going to
      fade away" (
      
        BusinessWeek
      
      , May 22, 1995). The shadow receded when Leon Hess died on May 7, 1999, of
      complications from blood disease, at the age of 85.
    

      A CHANGE IN COURSE
    

      After taking over the day-to-day responsibilities of the company, John
      Hess crafted a plan to put a new face on the company, moving away from the
      less profitable business of refining and marketing and shifting more
      business into oil production. The company was in dire need of a new
      direction: In 1998 it lost $458.9 million on revenues of $6.6 billion.
    

      In 2000 Hess attempted to seize a piece of the international oil arena
      with a takeover bid for U.K.-based independent oil company Lasmo but
      failed after losing out to a competitor. It was a major setback for Hess.
      He seemed to recover in 2001 with the company's agreement to buy
      the exploration and production company Triton Energy and its stakes in
      Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Hess bought Triton Energy for
      $2.7 billion in cash and about $500 million in assumed debt. Said Gene
      Nowak, analyst with ABN Amro: "Initially, investors were concerned
      John Hess was going to continue to tilt the company into refining and
      marketing which is traditionally a low-return business. But he has
      strongly tilted the company to exploration and production. This deal puts
      over 75 percent of its assets into that sector" (
      
        Lloyd's List
      
      , July 13, 2001).
    

      In 2003, however, elements of the Triton deal came back to haunt John
      Hess. The company announced a $530 million after-tax impairment charge
      related to the Triton acquisition. UBS Warburg analyst Matthew Warburton
      placed part of the blame on Triton, which he said made poor decisions
      regarding reservoir mechanics and field management. Moreover, War-burton
      also cited Hess's failure to do its homework in evaluating
      Triton's value, noting that Hess had written off 25 percent of the
      value of the total price paid for Triton.

Hess Oil
Does Hess Oil not buy product from Middle Eastern countries because it is 'owned by a Jewish family'?







            11        












  

Claim:   Hess Oil does not buy product from Middle Eastern countries because it is “owned by a Jewish family.”

FALSE

Example:   [Collected on the Internet, 2002]

THERE IS DOCUMENTED EVIDENCE THAT COMPANIES LIKE EXXON, MOBIL, SHELL AND MANY OTHERS BUY THEIR OIL FROM THE ARAB COUNTRIES THAT SUPPORT TERRORISM LIKE IRAQ AND SAUDI ARABIA.
B U T…..THERE IS A COMPANY CALLED HESS GAS. NOT ONLY HAVE I CHECKED THEM OUT WITH A CHEMICAL ENGINEER I MET ON A PLANE BUT HE TOLD ME HESS PRODUCES A QUALITY PRODUCT BASED ON THE CALIBER OF OIL HESS BUYS.
NOW THE “PUNCHLINE” YOU ARE SAYING WHY WOULDN’T HESS BUY FROM THOSE COMPANIES. B E C A U S E…………. HESS GAS IS OWNED BY HESS OIL COMPANY AND HESS OIL COMPANY IS OWNED BY A JEWISH FAMILY THAT SUPPORTS ISRAEL AND ITS BATTLE FOR SURVIVAL. TELL YOUR FRIENDS TO CHECK OUT THE CLOSEST HESS STATION TO THEIR RESIDENCE OR BUSINESS AND PATRONIZE THEM. SEND THIS MESSAGE ON TO YOUR FRIENDS THAT SYMPATHIZE WITH ISRAEL AND OPPOSE TERRORISM.

   
Origins:   Hess Oil (technically known as the Amerada Hess Corporation since a 1971 merger between Hess Oil & Chemical Corp. and Amerada Petroleum) was founded by Leon Hess, the son of a Jewish Hungarian immigrant.  In 1933, Hess sold a tow truck given to him by his father, bought a 615-gallon Chevrolet truck, and began selling heating oil in Asbury Park, New Jersey.  From those humble beginnings, Hess and his father established the Hess Oil & Chemical Corp., which by 1999 had become a $6.6 billion corporation and the 12th-largest U.S. oil company and now includes among its operations about 1,000 retail gasoline stations, primarily in New York, New Jersey, and Florida.  Leon Hess (who was also the sole owner of the New York Jets football team) died in 1999 at age 85, and his son, John B. Hess, now serves as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Amerada 
Hess.
It is true that Hess has little or no dealings with Middle Eastern countries, as their exploration and production activities take place primarily in the United States, the United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Algeria, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Azerbaijan, Brazil and Colombia.  However, it is not quite accurate to claim that Hess “doesn’t buy” from Middle Eastern companies because it is “owned by a Jewish family.”  Although John Hess serves as chairman and CEO of Amerada Hess, the company is publicly traded and therefore is “owned” by a variety of stockholders, not a single family.  Moreover, Amerada Hess  does not have a policy of not dealing with Middle Eastern companies as a show of support or sympathy for Israel, but simply because they have no established exploration  or production facilities in that part of the world.  (The same is true of some other large oil companies, such as Sinclair and Sunoco).
Consumers wishing to purchase gasoline from retailers whose product does not originate in Middle Eastern countries can accomplish their goal by patronizing Hess service stations, of course, but not because Hess has a corporate policy of supporting Israel.

Hess Corp., the oil company that's in a proxy battle with billionaire Paul Singer's Elliott Management Corp., said it will strip Chief Executive Officer John B. Hess of the chairmanship after its annual meeting next week.John Krenicki, a company nominee and former CEO of General Electric Co.'s energy unit, will become chairman if he's elected to the board at the May 16 meeting, New York-based Hess said in a statement today. The separation of the CEO and chairman roles will occur even if shareholders vote in favor of Elliott's board nominees, Jon Pepper, a Hess spokesman, said today in an e-mail.Elliott, the second-largest Hess shareholder, has accused John Hess of poor management and proposed five new board members to increase accountability. The company, which is seeking shareholder support for its own board-member changes, has announced asset sales this year that will yield $3.4 billion as it exits refining, gasoline retail and other units to become a pure oil exploration and production business.

Shareholders are "expressing a desire for better accountability, increased board oversight, and the adoption of best-in-class corporate governance practices," John H. Mullin, Hess's lead director, said in the statement. "We understand our shareholders' views, and recognize that our corporate governance structure should have been improved sooner."Hess declined 1.3% to $70.03 at 9:36 a.m. in New York. The shares have gained 32% this year.Hess's actions are the latest attempt to placate increasingly active energy industry shareholders. Occidental Petroleum Corp. Chairman Ray Irani was forced to step down last week after almost three decades at the company as investors voted against him. Transocean Ltd., owner of offshore oil rigs, is fighting board nominees from billionaire investor Carl Icahn and SandRidge Energy Inc. agreed to board changes after being challenged by shareholder TPG-Axon Capital Management."I don't know how far reaching the effect is, so close to the date," Phil Weiss, an analyst at Argus Research in New York who rates the shares hold and owns none, said in a phone interview. "If they were very confident, they might not do this."Splitting the chairman and CEO roles at Hess is one of several items on the agenda for a vote next week."Hess's announcement today is not a concession or step on the part of the company, rather it is a reaction to the shareholder vote currently under way," Elliot Sloane, a spokesman for New York-based Elliott Management, said in an e- mailed statement. "It is significant to note that Hess's board recommended against this split only a few weeks ago."John Hess, 59, has been chairman and CEO of the company since his father, Leon Hess, retired in 1995. Leon Hess, a former owner of the New York Jets football team, formed the company in 1933 to deliver oil to residential customers near his home in Asbury Park, New Jersey, according to Hess's website."They want to show they're not as entrenched as Elliott made them out to be and will do whatever shareholders would prefer," Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York, said in a phone interview. He rates the shares at outperform, the equivalent of a buy, and owns none."Even if you have the lead, you still play to protect the lead."

Hess, John B. 1954–
International Directory of Business Biographies 
COPYRIGHT 2005 Thomson Gale





John B. Hess1954–
Chairman and chief executive officer, Amerada Hess 
Nationality: American.
Born: April 5, 1954.
Education: Harvard College, BA, 1975; Harvard University, MBA, 1977.
Family: Son of Leon Hess (business executive) and Norma (maiden name unknown); married Susan Elizabeth Kessler.
Career: Amerada Hess, 1976–1986, graduate trainee, senior vice president; 1986–1995, senior executive vice president; 1995–, chairman and chief executive officer.
Address: Amerada Hess, 1185 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10036; http://www.hess.com.
■ Amerada Hess, also known simply as Hess, is a family business. With 2003 sales of about $14.3 billion, Amerada (an acronym of "America" and "Canada") Hess is an integrated oil and gas company that conducts exploration and production globally. As of 2004 the company's proven reserves totaled 646 million barrels of oil and 2.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas. Hess owns 50 percent of a refinery it operates in the U.S. Virgin Islands and owns a smaller one in New Jersey; it sells gasoline through more than one thousand gas stations, primarily in the eastern United States. A third-generation oil and gas businessman, John Hess took over the company in 1995 from his father, Leon Hess. Following his father's death, John Hess found himself walking in the footsteps of a giant.
A PATRIARCH'S AMERICAN DREAM
Mores Hess, Leon's father, was a Lithuanian immigrant trained to be a kosher butcher who also ran a fuel-delivery business, coal yard, and gas station. His business faltered during the Depression. Leon Hess was a delivery boy for his father when he took over the bankrupt company in 1933. He began building the company with a product for which other oil companies had little use: no. 6 residual fuel oil, a black, tarry sub-stance left over after refining. Hess saw that utilities and other big users were switching from coal to no. 6 when they could get it, and he built a fleet of trucks capable of keeping the fuel oil warm until delivery, gradually expanding his reach far beyond New Jersey and New York.


By 1938 Leon Hess had 12 trucks and was able to build his first oil terminal at Perth Amboy, New Jersey. The oil terminal expanded during World War II while Leon Hess served in the U.S. Army under General George Patton. Ultimately Hess landed at Normandy just after D-Day and was wounded. Following the war Hess returned to work and by 1950 had bought an oil terminal in Houston. By 1958 the company started crude oil exploration and production in Mississippi, buying both a pipeline and petroleum reserves. In 1963 Hess acquired a refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas, and then built the biggest project of his life, the Virgin Islands Refinery. In 1969 the company merged with Amerada Petroleum to create Amerada Hess. By the time of his death in 1999, Leon Hess's personal stock holdings were worth more than $700 million. Leon Hess granted only one interview over his 60-year career, during which he said: "My parents always told me to guard my reputation. I was brought up all my life to stay out of the limelight and I'm never going to change" (Newsday, January 25, 1995).
A PRIVILEGED CHILDHOOD
While John Hess grew up with many of the trappings of wealth, he still pumped gas for the family Hess stations. The only son among three siblings, he joined his father on foreign oil fields at age seven and began working for the family business in 1976, as a graduate trainee. As a Harvard undergraduate he studied in Beirut, became fluent in Arabic and Farsi, and later befriended Middle Eastern oil ministers. By 1984 he was a senior vice president, managing exploration and production operations and contributing to the development of fields in Canada and the Gulf of Mexico. At a 1987 event bringing together various leaders in the oil industry, he introduced Abu Dhabi's oil minister, Mana Said al-Otaiba, in faultless Arab dialect. By 1991 he was earning $700,000 a year and being groomed to succeed his father. William P. Tavoulareas, retired president of Mobil Corporation, said he had confidence in his abilities, but added: "How can any son follow an act like that?" (BusinessWeek, June 29, 1987).
A FATHER PASSES THE REINS
From 1990 to 1995 Amerada Hess struggled with erratic performance that seemed attributable to Leon Hess's advancing age. The firm had a $268.2 million loss in 1993 as sales dropped to $5.9 billion. A rebound in 1994 was modest: a $73.7 million net on $6.7 billion in sales. In 1995's opening quarter Hess earned just $25.2 million on $1.98 billion in sales, down from the previous year.
Like his father before him, Leon Hess worked well past 80. At a press conference during which he passed the torch to his son, Leon Hess wept and said, "You have a good young management team in place" (Platt's Oilgram News, May 4, 1995).
Oil analysts noted that a change of management was long overdue at the company: Lehman Brothers oil analyst Bernard Picchi stated, "it's fair to say that the company has been a little out of step with the rest of the industry." He noted the company's "parochial" and "inward looking" way of operating and how this extended even to its representation in trade associations (Platt's Oilgram News, May 4, 1995).
John Hess was cut from a different cloth than his father. He had an Ivy League education, while his father never went to college. He also had a lot in common with his predecessor, including a competitive spirit and fierce work ethic. Said Nicholas Brady, a board member of Amerada Hess and a former Treasury secretary: "Like his father, John is tireless. They're the same in their preoccupation with business. It's a way of life for John" (New York Times, May 21, 1999). Another trait that Hess shared with his father was an aversion to the media. Both routinely turned down requests for interviews. John Hess quickly and quietly emerged as the antithesis to the modern, high-profile CEO of a leading publicly traded company.
Although John Hess was thought to be very close to his father, who was the best man at his wedding, the relationship had a drawback: Hess may have had the title and control of the firm, but from 1994 to 1999 he was still symbolically under the shadow of his father, who controlled 12.9 percent of Hess stock, compared with his son's 1.7 percent. Said Eugene L. Nowak, oil analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds: "Leon is not going to fade away" (BusinessWeek, May 22, 1995). The shadow receded when Leon Hess died on May 7, 1999, of complications from blood disease, at the age of 85.
A CHANGE IN COURSE
After taking over the day-to-day responsibilities of the company, John Hess crafted a plan to put a new face on the company, moving away from the less profitable business of refining and marketing and shifting more business into oil production. The company was in dire need of a new direction: In 1998 it lost $458.9 million on revenues of $6.6 billion.
In 2000 Hess attempted to seize a piece of the international oil arena with a takeover bid for U.K.-based independent oil company Lasmo but failed after losing out to a competitor. It was a major setback for Hess. He seemed to recover in 2001 with the company's agreement to buy the exploration and production company Triton Energy and its stakes in Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Hess bought Triton Energy for $2.7 billion in cash and about $500 million in assumed debt. Said Gene Nowak, analyst with ABN Amro: "Initially, investors were concerned John Hess was going to continue to tilt the company into refining and marketing which is traditionally a low-return business. But he has strongly tilted the company to exploration and production. This deal puts over 75 percent of its assets into that sector" (Lloyd's List, July 13, 2001).


In 2003, however, elements of the Triton deal came back to haunt John Hess. The company announced a $530 million after-tax impairment charge related to the Triton acquisition. UBS Warburg analyst Matthew Warburton placed part of the blame on Triton, which he said made poor decisions regarding reservoir mechanics and field management. Moreover, War-burton also cited Hess's failure to do its homework in evaluating Triton's value, noting that Hess had written off 25 percent of the value of the total price paid for Triton.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
