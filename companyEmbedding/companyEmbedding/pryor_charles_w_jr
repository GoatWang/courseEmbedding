Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Academy of Distinguished Alumni

Charles W. Pryor, Jr., Academy of Distinguished Alumni Award 1998B.S. 1966, M.S. 1968, Ph.D. 1970; Academy Class of 1998President and CEO,
Westinghouse Electric Company
 
Charles W. Pryor, Jr., President and CEO of Westinghouse Electric Company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, graduated from Virginia Tech with a B.S. in civil engineering in 1966 and an M.S. in 1968 and Ph.D. in 1970 in structural engineering. 

Dr. Pryor began his industrial career with McDonnell Douglas Corporation in St. Louis, Missouri, as a senior engineer involved in the development of several advanced technologies, including a boron-epoxy wing structure for the F-15 Air Superiority Fighter. 

The majority of his career, however, was spent with the nuclear power operations of Babock & Wilcox (B&W) in his native city of Lynchburg, Virginia. During his 23 years with the company, he performed a number of technical and managerial assignments for the design and manufacture of nuclear plant systems, equipment, components and fuel. He has been President and CEO of the B&W Nuclear Service Company and Chairman of the Board of B&W Nuclear Fuel Company. After B&W was acquired by Framatome, S.A., of France, he served as President and CEO of B&W Nuclear Technologies from 1991 through 1995.

In 1991, President Francois Mitterand of France presented Dr. Pryor with the prestigious Chevalier de l'Ordre National du Merite for developing cooperative business relationships between the United States and France. He was named Virginia's Outstanding Industrialist of the Year in 1993 by Governor Douglas Wilder and the Science Museum of Virginia in recognition of his work at B&W and his leadership in promoting cooperative programs between private enterprise and academia.

Before joining Westinghouse, Dr. Pryor owned and operated a successful management consulting firm in Lynchburg. In March 1997, he became President of Westinghouse's Energy Systems Business unit. In November of that year, he was named President and CEO of the Westinghouse Electric Company. In this position, he is responsible for all of the company's industrial businesses, including Energy Systems, Government and Environmental Services, Process Control, and the Science and Technology Center.

An active participant in community affairs, Dr. Pryor is a Trustee of Lynchburg College, past President of the Greater Lynchburg Chamber of Commerce, and past Chairman of the Board of Centra Health, Inc.

Throughout his career, Dr. Pryor also has been an active supporter of his alma mater. He currently is a member of the Via Department of Civil Engineering Advisory Board, the College of Engineering Committee of 100, the Virginia Tech Corporation & Foundation Major Gifts Committee, and the Ut Prosim Society. In the past he has served as Chairman of the President's Council Membership Committee for Lynchburg and as a member of the Lynchburg-Amherst-Nelson Regional Campaign Committee.

In 1993, Dr. Pryor established two scholarship funds at Virginia Tech—the Charles W. Pryor, Jr. Endowed Scholarship in Engineering and the Charles W. Pryor, Jr. Endowed Scholarship in Athletics.

Dr. Pryor and his wife, Mary Jane, reside in Fox Chapel, a Pittsburgh suburb. They are the parents of four grown children.

Mega-engineering Initiatives & the Grand Challenges for Engineering

It is my privilege to welcome all our members, foreign members, and friends to this year’s annual meeting of the National Academy of Engineering. I extend an especially warm welcome to our newly elected members and foreign members and can assure you that this induction day, just like last evening’s dinner, will be one you will remember. And I would be remiss for not extending a special welcome to all the spouses who so graciously support our service to the academy.
