The Ramsey Carpet story began in 1956 when Don Ramsey went to work as an apprentice for Spelman's Carpet in Los Angeles, CA. Don learned professional flooring installation by working alongside the best west coast flooring installers during the day and attending classes in the evening.  

After serving several years with the military in Germany, Don returned to Minnesota to go into business for himself. In the early years Don partnered with his father, Melvin Ramsey, in home building. Using Don's skills, they were able to offer their new home clients custom flooring installation as well.

As the word spread about Don's skill as a flooring installer, area stores began to call on him to install carpet for their customers. He soon was the flooring installer for several Detroit Lakes stores and, as well, stores in area towns including Mahnomen, Frazee and Park Rapids.

Don's dad continued to work with him until his retirement. Don also trained his brother Dave Ramsey and they worked together for many years. For several years Don owned the Ramsey Carpet Store on Washington Avenue in Detroit Lakes in part of what is now the downtown mall. 

The Vocational Training Center in Fargo, ND hired Don for several years to train their students in his flooring installation methods. 

Don's sons, Steve Ramsey and Brian Ramsey, continue to uphold the family tradition of providing the highest quality flooring and flooring installation across Minnesota and Alaska.

Ramsey Flooring is Busy by Nathan Bowe

Ramsey Flooring is a growing presence in Detroit Lakes, where its owners have history going back to the 1950s. Steve Ramsey is currently the sole owner, though he said he is working towards joint ownership with his brother Brian, who works with him in sales and installation.

From its 8,000-square-foot showroom and warehouse in the original Detroit Lakes industrial park, Ramsey Flooring handles sales and installation of “anything to do with floor covering,” Steve said. “Carpet, ceramic tile, laminate, hardwood floors…”

Caress by Shaw 



Ramsey Flooring in Detroit Lakes: 218- 847-9999





Ramsey Carpet in Anchorage: 907-349-5223 or 907-223-3909




Caress by Shaw Carpet offers softness and color
inspired by nature. Luxuriate with the softest natural fibers from around the
world.







Add
the softness and sophistication you love with
flooring inspired by nature’s flawless color pallet. 
Mother Nature has showered the earth with brilliant
colors in a myriad of tones, tints and hues. The beauty of her color palette is
all around us, from the Amalfi coast and Mediterranean waterscapes to the
landscapes of the Swiss Alps and Western Painted Desert. Her paintbrush has
dressed the stage for our memories since the dawn of time. 
50 Colors From Nature's Most Treasured Color Palettes 
Designers for
centuries have long been stirred to create spaces that feel natural and evoke
emotion based on colorations found in nature from all over the world. Timeless,
and always beautiful, nature's palette has inspired our Caress color line.
You'll find a rich variety of 50 shades offering essential neutrals,
atmospheric blues, verdant greens, quiet grays and earthly browns. Mimicking
nature's flawless palette, the color line is as enchanting as it is striking. 



Traveling
the world for inspiration, the Shaw team has noted a trend in homes and
interior design where mainstays like bedding, rugs and furniture are all going
"soft," using natural resources as materials. This inspired a
different way of thinking about flooring, resulting in the creation of ultra-soft Caress products. 
This Unique Collection will Forever Alter Your Perception of Softness Underfoot



Desire for softness, comfort and warmth is not new but is instead timeless. Our ancestors have looked to natural fleeces  and furs as a standard for softness. Likewise we searched for the softest natural fibers around the world as inspiration for Caress, reflecting on images of sheep, alpacas, rabbits and other furry creatures to help create the colors and textures of the collection.﻿
