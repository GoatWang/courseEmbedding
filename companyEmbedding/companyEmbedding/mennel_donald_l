FOSTORIA, OHIO — D. Ford Mennel has been named president of The Mennel Milling Co. at the company’s annual meeting held Aug. 27. He succeeds his father, Donald L. Mennel, who has been president since 1980. Donald was elected chairman of the board. 
Ford represents the fifth generation of the Mennel family to lead the company. He has served as plant manager of Mennel’s flour mills in Dowagiac, Mich., and Roanoke, Va., as well as assistant to the president prior to his election. Prior to Mennel, he worked in the hotel industry. 
Ford received a bachelor’s degree in hotel and restaurant management from Mercyhurst College in Erie, Pa., and a master’s degree in business administration from Averett University. 
Mennel Milling Co., which in 2011 celebrated its 125th year in business, operates five wheat flour mills with an overall daily milling capacity of 40,900 cwts. It ranks seventh in capacity in the U.S., according to Sosland Publishing’s 2013 Grain & Milling Annual. 
The company was founded in 1886 by a banking family, the Harters, from Mansfield, Ohio, and a Hungarian flour milling family, the Browns, from Canton, Ohio, and became known as Harter Milling Co.

Our HistoryThe  Mennel Milling Co. was founded in 1886 in Fostoria, Ohio. Today, Donald L.  Mennel represents the fourth generation of Mennel leadership.  The company  currently has five flour mills producing a full range of hard and soft wheat  flours, six country grain elevators handling wheat, corn, soybeans and barley,  two trucking companies, and a truck repair garage. The Mennel Milling  Company and many of its branch locations have several second and third  generation employees among our work force.      One of the six grain elevators The Mennel Milling Co. purchased was the Mexico Elevator in 1981. Mexico  Elevator was a Farmer owned cooperative serving the needs of farmers in Mexico  and surrounding communities  by providing complete feed, fertilizer and  grain merchandising services.       Following the purchase of the elevator, it was  renamed, The Mennel Milling Co. of Indiana, Inc.  Many improvements were made for the storage of grain.   We are continually finding ways to improve the elevator facility for receiving,  shipping and storing wheat, corn and soybeans along with complete merchandising  services to local and state-wide  producers.   	Our Mission Statement  Our mission is to earn every day our reputation as a producer  of quality  products and a provider of superior service, while providing our  customers with fair value and our shareholders with fair returns.   We will  do this through the pursuit of excellence in: The Quality of our  People The Quality of our  Products and Services The Quality of our  Facilities And through diligent efforts to know and understand our customers  and  suppliers and their products so that we can best serve their needs.   We are  committed to maintaining the most efficient operating facilities  possible  through application of total quality management principles  and planned strategic  growth.

Donald M. Mennel


1918 - 2012
Obituary
Condolences



























						(News article) FOSTORIA - A leader in his community, his industry, and the law - his late-in-life profession - who was the third generation to head the family flour milling business, Donald M. Mennel died Monday in the Good Shepherd Home. He was 94.The family did not report a cause of death.On Tuesday, Fostoria City Council approved a resolution honoring him.In 1993, he became chairman emeritus of Mennel Milling Co., which was founded in 1886 as Harter Milling Co. His grandfather Alphonse; his father, Louis, and his uncle Mark bought control of the company in 1917.The family firm became a leader in the milling of soft wheat for baked goods, although its mills produce all types of flour. He retired as president in 1983, and his son Donald L. Mennel took that role.Mr. Mennel was a former president of the Toledo Board of Trade. He was active in grain industry groups and was a former chairman of the Millers' National Federation. In 1981, then-Agriculture Secretary John Block named him to an advisory committee on the U.S. Grain Standards Act.When he first joined the board of The Andersons, the Maumee-based agricultural firm, he was only the third director from outside the family."Don was a brilliant man, and a wonderful man with real high ethics," said Richard Anderson, chairman emeritus. "I was CEO when he responded positively to our request to come on the board. Boy, it was a relief because we needed someone who understood the vicissitudes of the grain business" - as what happens to prices and supply after a drought. "Don was a wonderful addition and served us well for many years."The firm has had a mill in Fostoria since its founding, but for 65 years, corporate offices were in Toledo. Mr. Mennel announced in 1959 that headquarters would move to Fostoria. He was on the boards of the local chamber of commerce, what is now ProMedica Fostoria Community Hospital, and the local YMCA. He also had been a national YMCA trustee.Mr. Mennel was "one of the quiet leaders in the community," said Mike Corcoran, a former executive director of the chamber of commerce.At age 65, Mr. Mennel went to Ohio Northern University law school. He was admitted to the bar in 1986. His specialty was closely held corporations and commodities futures trading, but he also served as a court-appointed receiver in grain elevator bankruptcies and became a speaker on commodities and agriculture law.He was born May 18, 1918, to Ethyl and Louis Mennel. He grew up in Toledo's Old West End and was a 1940 graduate of Yale University. He was an Army Air Corps veteran of World War II, serving in West African and on the Aleutian Islands.He married the former Patsy Lewis on May 17, 1945. She died Oct. 11, 2010.Surviving are his sons, Donald L., James R., and John W. Mennel; eight grandchildren, and 17 great-grandchildren.Memorial services will be in First Presbyterian Church, Fostoria, where he was a member. Arrangements are by the Harrold-Floriana Funeral Home.The family suggests tributes to the church; the Fostoria Community Hospital Foundation; the Geary Family YMCA endowment fund; or the Good Shepherd Home's capital campaign.Contact Blade staff writer Mark Zaborney at:mzaborney@theblade.com">mzaborney@theblade.com">mzaborney@theblade.com">mzaborney@theblade.com or 419-724-6182.
