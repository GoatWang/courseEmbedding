Fitch to Rate JPMBB 2015-C32 Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust; Presale Issued | Business Wire


























































      Fitch to Rate JPMBB 2015-C32 Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust; 
      Presale Issued
    





October 07, 2015 06:25 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on JPMBB Commercial Mortgage 
      Securities Trust 2015-C32 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$80,813,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$244,690,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$28,747,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$100,000,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$855,381,000b class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$57,408,000b class X-B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$51,667,000 class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$57,408,000 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      The following classes are not expected to be rated:
    

      --$99,029,000 class C;
    

      --$208,104,000 class EC;
    

      --$50,232,000 class D;
    

      --$99,029,000ab class X-C;
    

      --$50,232,000ab class X-D;
    

      --$28,705,000a class E;
    

      --$11,481,000a class F;
    

      --$11,482,000a class G;
    

      --$34,444,648a class NR.
    

      a Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      b Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Oct. 1, 2015.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 89 loans secured by 273 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.15 
      billion as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Barclays Bank plc, Starwood Mortgage 
      Funding II, LLC, MC-Five Mile Commercial Mortgage Finance LLC, Redwood 
      Commercial Mortgage Corporation, and RAIT Funding, LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 70.5% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 77.7%, and asset summary reviews on 88.9% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch Leverage: The transaction has higher leverage than other recent 
      Fitch-rated fixed-rate multiborrower transactions. The pool's Fitch debt 
      service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.11x is lower than both the 
      year-to-date (YTD) 2015 average of 1.20x and the 2014 average of 1.19x, 
      and the pool's Fitch loan to value (LTV) of 112.4% is higher than both 
      the YTD 2015 average of 109.1% and the 2014 average of 106.2%.
    

      High Geographic Correlation: The largest three loans by loan balance - 
      Hilton Suites Chicago Magnificent Mile, Civic Opera Building, and Palmer 
      House Retail Shops - account for 18.66% of the pool balance and are 
      located in Chicago, IL. In total, 19.51% of the pool is securitized by 
      14 assets that are located in the Chicago-Naperville-Joliet metropolitan 
      statistical area (MSA). The Pittsburgh MSA represents the second largest 
      geographic concentration with 10 assets that comprise 6.43% of the pool 
      balance.
    

      Strong Amortization: The pool is scheduled to amortize by 17.5% of the 
      initial pool balance prior to maturity, which is greater than the 2014 
      average of 12.0%. Only one loan (0.3%) is full-term interest-only and 27 
      loans (43.5%) are partial interest-only. One loan (4.3%) is fully 
      amortizing. The remaining 60 loans (51.9%) are amortizing balloon loans 
      with loan terms of five to 10 years.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 10.77% below the 
      most recent net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a recent 
      NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this 
      period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could 
      result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans, and 
      could result in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to JPMBB 
      2015-C32 certificates and found that the transaction displays slightly 
      average sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which 
      NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the senior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. In a more severe 
      scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a 
      downgrade of the senior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. 
      The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional 
      stresses and sensitivities on pages 10 - 11.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

You
  should carefully consider the risk factors beginning on page S-61 of this free writing
  prospectus and page 9 of the prospectus.
 
Neither
  the certificates nor the underlying mortgage loans are insured or guaranteed by any governmental agency, instrumentality
  or private issuer or any other person or entity.
 
The
  certificates will represent interests in the issuing entity only. They will not represent interests in or obligations
  of the sponsors, depositor, any of their affiliates or any other entity.
 
The
  United States Securities and Exchange Commission and state regulators have not approved
  or disapproved of the offered certificates or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of
  this free writing prospectus or the accompanying prospectus. Any representation to the
  contrary is a criminal offense. J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities
  Corp. will not list the offered certificates on any securities exchange or on any automated
  quotation system of any securities association.
 
The
  issuing entity will be relying on an exclusion or exemption from the definition of “investment company” under
  the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, contained in Section 3(c)(5) of the Investment Company Act or Rule 3a-7
  under the Investment Company Act, although there may be additional exclusions or exemptions available to the issuing entity.
  The issuing entity is being structured so as not to constitute a “covered fund” for purposes of the Volcker
  Rule under the Dodd-Frank Act (both as defined in this free writing prospectus).
 
The
  underwriters, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Barclays Capital Inc. and Drexel Hamilton, LLC, will purchase the offered
  certificates from J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. and will offer them to the public at negotiated
  prices, plus, in certain cases, accrued interest, determined at the time of sale. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Barclays
  Capital Inc. are acting as co-lead managers and joint bookrunners in the following manner: J.P. Morgan Securities LLC
  is acting as sole bookrunning manager with respect to approximately 58.2% of each class of offered certificates and Barclays
  Capital Inc. is acting as sole bookrunning manager with respect to approximately 41.8% of each class of offered certificates.
  Drexel Hamilton, LLC is acting as co-manager.
 
The
  underwriters expect to deliver the offered certificates to purchasers in book-entry form only through the facilities of
  The Depository Trust Company in the United States and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme and Euroclear
  Bank, as operator of the Euroclear System, in Europe, against payment in New York, New York on or about October 29, 2015.

(1)Approximate,
  subject to a permitted variance of plus or minus 5%.
 

(2)The
  initial credit support percentages set forth for the certificates are approximate and,
  for the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5
  and Class A-SB certificates, are represented in the aggregate.
 

(3)The
  assumed final distribution dates set forth in this free writing prospectus have been
  determined on the basis of the assumptions described in “Description of the
  Certificates—Assumed Final Distribution Date; Rated Final Distribution Date”
  in this free writing prospectus. The rated final distribution date for each class of
  offered certificates is the distribution date in November 2048. See “Description
  of the Certificates—Assumed Final Distribution Date; Rated Final Distribution Date”
  in this free writing prospectus.
 

(4)The
  weighted average life and period during which distributions of principal would be received
  as set forth in the foregoing table with respect to each class of certificates (other
  than the Class X-A, Class X-B, Class X-C and Class X-D certificates) are based
  on the assumptions set forth under “Yield and Maturity Considerations—Weighted
  Average Life” in this free writing prospectus and on the assumptions that there
  are no prepayments, modifications or losses in respect of the mortgage loans and that
  there are no extensions or forbearances of maturity dates or anticipated repayment dates
  of the mortgage loans.
 

(5)Ratings
  shown are those of Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”),
  Fitch Ratings, Inc. (“Fitch”), DBRS, Inc. (“DBRS”),
  and Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Inc. (“KBRA”) (each a “Rating
  Agency” and collectively, the “Rating Agencies”). Certain
  nationally recognized statistical rating organizations that were not hired by the depositor
  may use information they receive pursuant to Rule 17g-5 under the Securities Exchange
  Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise to rate the offered certificates and any of Moody’s,
  Fitch, DBRS and KBRA may issue unsolicited credit ratings on one or more classes of offered
  certificates that it ultimately does not rate. We cannot assure you as to whether such
  rating agencies will rate each class of offered certificates or, if they were to rate
  only certain classes of offered certificates, what rating would be assigned to the other
  classes of offered certificates. Additionally, we cannot assure you as to what ratings
  a non-hired nationally recognized statistical rating organization would assign. See “Risk
  Factors—Ratings of the Certificates” and “Ratings”
  in this free writing prospectus. Moody’s, Fitch, DBRS and KBRA have informed us
  that the “sf” designation in their ratings represents an identifier for structured
  finance product ratings. For additional information about this identifier, prospective
  investors can go to the related rating agency’s website. The depositor and the
  underwriters have not verified, do not adopt and do not accept responsibility for any
  statements made by the Rating Agencies on their internet websites. Important disclaimer:
  Credit ratings referenced throughout this material are forward-looking opinions about
  credit risk and express an agency’s opinion about the ability of and willingness
  of an issuer of securities to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Ratings
  are not indications of investment merit and are not buy, sell or hold recommendations,
  a measure of asset value, or an indication of the suitability of an investment.
 

(6)The
  pass-through rate applicable to the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4,
  Class A-5, Class A-SB, Class A-S, Class B, Class C, Class D,
  Class E, Class F, Class G and Class NR certificates on each distribution
  date will be a per annum rate equal to one of (i) a fixed rate, (ii) the
  weighted average of the net mortgage rates on the mortgage loans (in each case adjusted,
  if necessary, to accrue on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months),
  (iii) the lesser of a specified fixed pass-through rate and the rate described in
  clause (ii) above or (iv) the rate described in clause (ii) above less a specified
  percentage.
 

(7)The
  notional amount of the Class X-A certificates will be equal to the aggregate of
  the certificate balances of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4,
  Class A-5, Class A-SB and Class A-S certificates (determined without giving
  effect to any exchange and conversion of any Class A-S certificates for Class EC
  certificates). The notional amount of the Class X-B certificates will be equal to
  the certificate balance of the Class B certificates (determined without giving effect
  to any exchange and conversion of any Class B certificates for Class EC certificates).
  The Class X-A and Class X-B certificates will not be entitled to distributions
  of principal.
 

(8)The
pass-through rate for the Class X-A certificates for any distribution date will equal the excess, if any, of (a) the
weighted average of the net mortgage rates on the mortgage loans (in each case adjusted, if necessary, to accrue on the basis
of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), over (b) the weighted average of the pass-through rates on the Class A-1,
Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5, Class A-SB and Class A-S certificates, weighted on the
basis of their respective certificate balances immediately prior to that
  

S-3
 

 

distribution
  date and calculated without giving effect to any exchange and conversion of any Class A-S
  certificates for Class EC certificates. The pass-through rate for the Class X-B
  certificates for any distribution date will equal the excess, if any, of (a) the
  weighted average of the net mortgage rates on the mortgage loans (in each case adjusted,
  if necessary, to accrue on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months),
  over (b) the pass-through rate of the Class B certificates for that distribution
  date. See “Description of the Certificates—Distributions” in
  this free writing prospectus.

 

(9)A
  holder of Class A-S, Class B and Class C certificates may exchange and
  convert such classes of certificates (on an aggregate basis) for a related amount of
  Class EC certificates, and a holder of Class EC certificates may exchange and
  convert that Class for a ratable portion of each class of Class A-S, Class B
  and Class C certificates.
 

(10)The
  initial certificate balance of any of the Class A-S, Class B or Class C
  certificates represents the principal balance of such class without giving effect
  to any exchange and conversion for Class EC certificates. The initial certificate
  balance of the Class EC certificates is equal to the aggregate of the initial certificate
  balances of the Class A-S, Class B and Class C certificates and represents
  the maximum principal balance of such class that could be issued in an exchange
  and conversion. In the event that none of the Class A-S, Class B and Class C
  certificates are converted to Class EC certificates, the Class EC certificate
  balance would be equal to zero. Other than for federal income tax purposes, any exchange
  of (i) a portion of the Class A-S, Class B or Class C certificates will
  result in a conversion and reduction, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, of a proportionate
  share of each related component class of Class A-S, Class B and Class C
  certificates for, and an increase, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, of the certificate balance
  of the Class EC certificates, and (ii) any amount of the Class EC certificates
  will result in a conversion and reduction, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, of the certificate
  balance of the Class EC certificates converted and an increase, on a dollar-for-dollar
  basis, of a proportionate share of the related certificate balances of each class of
  Class A-S, Class B and Class C certificates.
 

(11)Although
  the Class EC certificates are listed below the Class C certificates in the
  chart, the Class EC certificates’ payment entitlements and subordination priority
  will be a result of the payment entitlements and subordination priority at each level
  of the related component classes of Class A-S, Class B and Class C certificates.
  For purposes of determining the approximate initial credit support for Class EC
  certificates, the calculation is based on the aggregate initial class certificate
  balance of the Class A-S, Class B and Class C certificates as if they
  were a single class.
 

(12)The
  Class EC certificates will not have a pass-through rate, but will be entitled to
  receive the sum of the interest that would otherwise be distributable on the Class A-S,
  Class B and Class C certificates that are converted in an exchange for such
  Class EC certificates. The effective pass-through rate applicable to the Class EC
  certificates for the initial distribution date is approximately ●%
  per annum.
 

(13)The
  Class R and Class Z certificates are not represented in the above table.
 

(14)The
  notional amount of the Class X-C certificates will be equal to the certificate balance
  of the Class C certificates (determined without giving effect to any exchange and
  conversion of any Class C certificates for Class EC certificates). The Class X-C
  certificates will not be entitled to distributions of principal.
 

(15)The
  pass-through rate for the Class X-C certificates for any distribution date will
  equal the excess, if any, of (a) the weighted average of the net mortgage rates
  on the mortgage loans (in each case adjusted, if necessary, to accrue on the basis of
  a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), over (b) the pass-through rate
  of the Class C certificates for that distribution date. See “Description
  of the Certificates—Distributions” in this free writing prospectus.
 

(16)The
notional amount of the Class X-D certificates will be equal to the certificate balance of the Class D certificates.
The Class X-D certificates will not be entitled to distributions of principal.


  


(17)The
  pass-through rate for the Class X-D certificates for any distribution date will
  equal the excess, if any, of (a) the weighted average of the net mortgage rates
  on the mortgage loans (in each case adjusted, if necessary, to accrue on the basis of
  a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months), over (b) the pass-through rate
  of the Class D certificates for that distribution date. See “Description
  of the Certificates—Distributions” in this free writing prospectus.
 

The
Class X-C, Class X-D, Class E, Class F, Class G, Class NR, Class R and Class Z certificates are not offered
by this free writing prospectus. Any information in this free writing prospectus concerning certificates other than the offered
certificates is presented solely to enhance your understanding of the offered certificates.

Senior Trust Advisor
 
Pentalpha Surveillance LLC, a Delaware
  limited liability company, will be the senior trust advisor. During such time as the Class E certificates have a
  certificate balance (taking into account the application of appraisal reductions to notionally reduce the certificate balance
  of such class of certificates) of less than 25% of the initial certificate balance of the Class E certificates, the senior
  trust advisor will generally be required to review the special servicer’s operational practices in respect of

 
 
 




S-20
 
 



 
 
 

 
 
specially serviced mortgage loans to formulate
  an opinion as to whether or not those operational practices generally satisfy the servicing standard with respect to the resolution
  and/or liquidation of specially serviced mortgage loans. In addition, during such time, the senior trust advisor will consult
  on a non-binding basis with the special servicer with regard to certain matters with respect to the servicing of specially
  serviced mortgage loans to the extent set forth in the pooling and servicing agreement and described in this free writing
  prospectus. See “Transaction Parties—The Senior Trust Advisor” in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 

 
 
From time to time and under certain circumstances, the senior trust
  advisor, in order to maintain its familiarity with the mortgage loans, is required to review promptly certain information
  available to privileged persons regarding the mortgage loans and certain asset status reports; however, prior to the
  occurrence of a control event, the senior trust advisor generally will not be involved in any assessment of specific actions
  of the special servicer or be obligated to deliver any reports or otherwise provide feedback to investors as to any specific
  actions of the special servicer and, in any event, will be subject to limitations set forth in the pooling and servicing agreement
  and described in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 

 
 
After the occurrence and continuance of a control event, the senior
  trust advisor will prepare an annual report to be provided to the certificate administrator for the benefit of the certificateholders
  setting forth its assessment of the special servicer’s performance of its duties under the pooling and servicing agreement
  on a “platform-level basis” with respect to the resolution and liquidation of specially serviced mortgage loans
  that the special servicer is responsible for servicing under the pooling and servicing agreement; provided, however,
  that in the event the special servicer is replaced, the senior trust advisor’s annual report will only relate to the
  entity that was acting as special servicer as of December 31 in the prior calendar year and is continuing in such capacity
  through the date of such annual report. Only as used in connection with the senior trust advisor’s annual report, the
  term “platform-level basis” refers to the special servicer’s performance of its duties as they relate to
  the resolution and liquidation of specially serviced mortgage loans, taking into account the special servicer’s specific
  duties under the pooling and servicing agreement as well as the extent to which those duties were performed in accordance
  with the servicing standard, with reasonable consideration by the senior trust advisor of any assessment of compliance report,
  attestation report, asset status report and other information delivered to the senior trust advisor by the special servicer
  (other than any communications between the directing certificateholder and the special servicer that would be privileged information)
  pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement for this transaction.

 
 
 

 
 
After the occurrence of a consultation termination event, if the
  senior trust advisor determines the special servicer is not

 
 
 




S-21
 




 
 
 

 
 
performing its duties as required under the pooling
  and servicing agreement or is otherwise not acting in accordance with the servicing standard, the senior trust advisor may
  recommend the replacement of the special servicer as described under “Transaction Parties—Replacement of the
  Special Servicer” in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 

 
 
For additional information regarding the responsibilities of the
  senior trust advisor, see “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—The Senior Trust Advisor” in this free
  writing prospectus.

 
 
 

 
 
The senior trust advisor will be entitled to a fee payable on each
  distribution date calculated on the outstanding principal amount of each mortgage loan in the trust fund and the senior trust
  advisor fee rate, and will have certain rights to indemnification for certain expenses by the trust fund. The senior trust
  advisor will also be entitled under certain circumstances to a consulting fee. See “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—The
  Senior Trust Advisor” in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 

 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the senior trust advisor will generally
  have no obligations or consultation rights under the pooling and servicing agreement for this transaction with respect to
  the Civic Opera Building whole loan, the U-Haul Portfolio whole loan, the One Shell Square whole loan or the Brunswick Portfolio
  whole loan or, in each case, any related REO property.

 
 
 

 
 
However, Pentalpha Surveillance LLC is the senior trust advisor
  under the JPMBB 2015-C31 pooling and servicing agreement, and, in such capacity, has certain obligations and consultation
  rights with respect to the Civic Opera Building whole loan that are substantially similar to those of the senior trust advisor
  under the pooling and servicing agreement for this transaction. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—The
  Whole Loans—The Civic Opera Building Whole Loan” in this free writing prospectus. Pentalpha Surveillance LLC
  is also the senior trust advisor under the JPMBB 2015-C30 pooling and servicing agreement, and, in such capacity, has certain
  obligations and consultation rights with respect to the One Shell Square whole loan and the Brunswick Portfolio whole loan
  that are substantially similar to those of the senior trust advisor under the pooling and servicing agreement for this transaction.
  See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—The Whole Loans—The One Shell Square Whole Loan”
  and “—The Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan” in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 

 
 
There will be no senior trust advisor under the trust and servicing
  agreement entered into in connection with the private CMBS securitization that is expected to govern the servicing and administration
  of the U-Haul Portfolio whole loan.

 
 
 

 
 
In addition, in the event that the only mortgage loan (or REO loan)
  that remains in the trust is the mortgage loan identified as “U-Haul Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing
  prospectus, representing 4.3% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date, the
  senior trust advisor

 
 
 




S-22
 
 



 
 
 

 
 
may resign as senior trust advisor and no replacement senior trust
  advisor will be engaged.

 
 
 

Directing Certificateholder
 
With respect to each mortgage loan (other than the non-serviced
  mortgage loans), the directing certificateholder will be the controlling class certificateholder (or its representative) selected
  by more than 50% of the controlling class certificateholders (by certificate balance, as certified by the certificate registrar
  from time to time as provided for in the pooling and servicing agreement); provided, however, that (1) absent
  that selection, or (2) until a directing certificateholder is so selected or (3) upon receipt of a notice from a
  majority of the controlling class certificateholders, by certificate balance, that a directing certificateholder is no
  longer designated, the controlling class certificateholder that owns the largest aggregate certificate balance of the
  controlling class (or its representative) will, upon certification of the same to the certificate administrator and the special
  servicer, be the directing certificateholder; provided, however, that in the case of this clause (3), then (A) (i)
  the holder of the largest percentage in excess of 25% that sends notice of the election of a directing certificateholder will
  be entitled to so appoint a directing certificateholder or (ii) if no such holder sends notice pursuant to clause (i) then
  (1) the certificate administrator will provide notice thereof to LNR Securities Holdings, LLC, each party to the pooling and
  servicing agreement and each controlling class certificateholder substantially in the form provided in the pooling and servicing
  agreement, requesting a certification from an authorized representative of LNR Securities Holdings, LLC that LNR Securities
  Holdings, LLC or its affiliate owns at least 25% of the certificate balance of the controlling class and (2) for as long as
  LNR Securities Holdings, LLC or its affiliate owns at least 25% of such class of certificates as confirmed to the certificate
  administrator in such certification then such entity will be the directing certificateholder or (B) in the event no one holder
  owns the largest aggregate certificate balance of the controlling class and a directing certificateholder is not determined
  through the operation of clause (A) above, then there will be no directing certificateholder until appointed in accordance
  with the terms of the pooling and servicing agreement.

 
 
 

 
 
The controlling class will be the most subordinate class of the
  Class E, Class F, Class G and Class NR certificates then outstanding that has an aggregate certificate balance,
  as notionally reduced by any appraisal reductions allocable to such class, at least equal to 25% of the initial certificate
  balance of that class. No class of certificates, other than as described above, will be eligible to act as the controlling
  class or appoint a directing certificateholder.

 
 
 

 
 
The directing certificateholder will have certain consent and consultation
  rights under the pooling and servicing agreement in certain circumstances with respect to the mortgage loans (other than the
  non-serviced mortgage loans and any excluded loan); provided that, after and during such time as the Class E certificates
  have a certificate balance (taking into account the

 
 
 




S-23
 

 



 
 
 

 
 
application of appraisal reductions to notionally reduce the certificate
  balance of such class of certificates) of less than 25% of the initial certificate balance, the consent rights will terminate.
  After such time that none of the Class E, Class F, Class G and Class NR certificates has a then-outstanding
  certificate balance at least equal to 25% of the initial certificate balance of that class without regard to the application
  of any appraisal reductions, the consultation rights of the directing certificateholder will terminate.

 
 
 

 
 
In addition, with respect to any excluded special servicer loan
  (that is not also an excluded loan), if any, the directing certificateholder (prior to the occurrence and continuance of a
  control event) will be required to select the excluded special servicer with respect to such excluded special servicer loan.
  It will be a condition to any such appointment that (i) each of the four NRSROs engaged by the depositor to rate the
  offered certificates confirm that the appointment would not result in a qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of any of their
  then-current ratings of the certificates issued pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement and the equivalent from each
  NRSRO hired to provide ratings with respect to any class of securities backed, wholly or partially, by any serviced pari
  passu companion loan, (ii) any such successor special servicer satisfies the requirements of a qualified replacement
  special servicer as further described in “Transaction Parties—Replacement of the Special Servicer”
  in this free writing prospectus and (iii) the successor special servicer delivers to the depositor and any applicable
  depositor of any other securitization, if applicable, that contains a serviced pari passu companion loan, the information,
  if any, required pursuant to Item 6.02 of the Form 8-K current report regarding itself in its role as excluded special servicer.  After
  the occurrence and during the continuance of a control event or if at any time the applicable excluded special servicer loan
  is also an excluded loan, the directing certificateholder will not have the right to appoint such excluded special servicer
  and such excluded special servicer will be appointed by the resigning special servicer as described in “Transaction
  Parties—Replacement of the Special Servicer” in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 

 
 
An “excluded loan” is a mortgage loan or whole loan
  with respect to which the directing certificateholder or the holder of the majority of the controlling class certificates
  (by certificate principal balance), is a borrower, a mortgagor, a manager of a mortgaged property, the holder of a mezzanine
  loan that has accelerated the related mezzanine loan (unless (i) acceleration was automatic under such mezzanine loan, (ii)
  the event directly giving rise to the automatic acceleration under such mezzanine loan was not initiated by such mezzanine
  lender or an affiliate of such mezzanine lender, and (iii) such mezzanine lender is stayed from exercising and has not commenced
  the exercise of remedies associated with foreclosure of the equity collateral under such mezzanine loan) or commenced foreclosure
  or enforcement proceedings against the equity collateral pledged to secure the related mezzanine loan, or any borrower party
  affiliate thereof.

It is anticipated that LNR Securities Holdings, LLC (or its affiliate)
  will purchase the Class E, Class F, Class G, Class NR and Class Z certificates (and may purchase certain other classes of
  certificates), and, on the closing date, is expected to be the initial directing certificateholder with respect to each mortgage
  loan (other than the non-serviced mortgage loans); however, we cannot assure you that arrangement will continue. See “Risk
  Factors—Potential Conflicts of Interest—Potential Conflicts of Interest of the Directing Certificateholder”
  in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 

 
 
KKR Real Estate Finance Manager, LLC, the directing certificateholder
  under the JPMBB 2015-C31 pooling and servicing agreement, will have certain consent and consultation rights with respect to

  certificateholder under the pooling and servicing agreement for this securitization, subject to similar appraisal mechanics.

  agreement entered into in connection with a private CMBS securitization that is expected to govern the servicing and administration
  of the U-Haul Portfolio whole loan will have certain consent and consultation rights with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio
  whole loan, which rights are substantially similar, but not identical, to those of the directing certificateholder under the
  pooling and servicing agreement for this securitization, subject to similar appraisal mechanics. See “Description

Transaction
  Overview

 

On the closing date, each sponsor will
  sell its respective mortgage loans to the depositor, which will in turn deposit the mortgage loans into the issuing entity,
  a common law trust created on the closing date. The trust, which will be the issuing entity, will be formed by a pooling and
  servicing agreement, to be entered into among the depositor, the master servicer, the special servicer, the certificate administrator,
  the trustee and the senior trust advisor. The master servicer will service the mortgage loans (other than the specially serviced
  mortgage loans and the non-serviced mortgage loans) in accordance with the pooling and servicing agreement and provide the
  information to the certificate administrator necessary for the certificate administrator to calculate distributions and other
  information regarding the certificates.

 

The transfers of the mortgage loans
  from the sponsors to the depositor and from the depositor to the issuing entity in exchange for the offered certificates are
  illustrated below:

The certificates will consist of the above classes and
  the following classes that are not being offered by this free writing prospectus and the accompanying prospectus: Class X-C,
  Class X-D, Class E, Class F, Class G, Class NR, Class R and Class Z.  

 
 
 

 
 
The certificates will collectively represent beneficial
  ownership in the issuing entity, a trust created by J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. The trust’s
  assets will primarily be eighty-nine (89) fixed rate commercial mortgage loans secured by first mortgage liens on two hundred
  and seventy-three (273) mortgaged properties. The mortgage loans are comprised of (i) eighty-one (81) mortgage loans
  (which have no related pari passu or subordinate interest secured by the related mortgaged property or properties),
  (ii) seven (7) mortgage loans, each represented by a pari passu portion of a split whole loan (each of which has
  one or more related pari passu interests secured by the related mortgaged property or properties) and (iii) one (1)
  mortgage loan represented by a pari passu portion of a split whole loan (which has two related pari passu interests
  and a related subordinate companion interest secured by the related mortgaged properties).

 
 
 

 
 
For purposes of the mortgage loan and pool composition
  data and other information contained in this free writing prospectus (including the annexes and statistical information),
  the above described pari passu or subordinate companion loans
are not reflected in this free writing prospectus, and the term “mortgage loan” does not include any pari
  passu or subordinate
  companion loan, unless otherwise expressly stated in this free writing prospectus. However, with respect to each of the mortgage
  loans that is part of a whole loan, we generally present the loan-to-value ratio, debt service coverage ratio, debt yield
  and

 
 
 
 
 




S-31
 
 



 
 
 

 
 
cut-off date balance per net rentable square foot, pad, room or
  unit, as applicable, in this free writing prospectus (including any tables, charts and information set forth on Annexes A-1,
  A-2 and A-3) in a manner that takes account of that mortgage loan and its related pari passu companion loan(s), but
  not the related subordinate companion loan.  Other than as specifically noted, the loan-to-value ratio, the debt
  service coverage ratio, debt yield and mortgage loan rate information for each mortgage loan is presented in this free writing
  prospectus without regard to any other indebtedness (whether or not secured by the related mortgaged property, ownership interests
  in the related borrower or otherwise) that currently exists or that may be incurred by the related borrower or its owners
  in the future, in order to present statistics for the related mortgage loan without combination with the other indebtedness.  Whenever
  percentages and other information in this free writing prospectus are presented on the mortgaged property level rather than
  the mortgage loan level, the information for mortgage loans secured by more than one mortgaged property (or within a group
  of cross-collateralized mortgage loans) is based on allocated loan amounts as stated in Annex A-1 to this free writing
  prospectus.

The initial certificate balance
  of any of the Class A-S, Class B or Class C certificates represents the principal balance of such class without
  giving effect to any exchange and conversion for Class EC certificates. The initial certificate balance of the Class EC
  certificates is equal to the aggregate of the initial certificate balances of the Class A-S, Class B and Class C
  certificates and represents the maximum principal balance of such class that could be issued in an exchange and conversion.
  In the event that none of the Class A-S, Class B and Class C certificates are converted to Class EC certificates,
  the Class EC certificate balance would be equal to zero. Other than for federal income tax purposes, any exchange of
  (i) a portion of the Class A-S, Class B or Class C certificates will result in a conversion and reduction,
  on a dollar-for-dollar basis, of a proportionate share of each related component class of Class A-S, Class B and
  Class C certificates for, and an increase, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, of the certificate balance of the Class EC
  certificates, and (ii) any amount of the Class EC certificates will result in a conversion and reduction, on a dollar-for-dollar
  basis, of the certificate balance of the Class EC certificates converted and an increase, on a dollar-for-dollar basis,
  of a proportionate share of the related certificate balances of each class of Class A-S, Class B and Class C
  certificates.

The interest accrual amount
  on the Class X-A certificates will be calculated by reference to a notional amount equal to the aggregate of the certificate
  balances of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5, Class A-SB and Class A-S
  certificates (calculated without giving effect to any exchange and conversion of any Class A-S certificates for Class EC
  certificates). The pass-through rate for the Class X-A certificates for any distribution date will equal the excess,
  if any, of (a) the weighted average of the net mortgage rates on the mortgage loans (in each case adjusted, if necessary,
  to accrue on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) for the related distribution date, over (b) the
  weighted average of the pass-through rates on the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5,
  Class A-SB and Class A-S certificates weighted on the basis of their respective certificate balances immediately
  prior to that distribution date (calculated without giving effect to any exchange and conversion of any Class A-S certificates
  for Class EC certificates) as described under “Description of the Certificates—Distributions”
  in this free writing prospectus.

The interest accrual amount
  on the Class X-B certificates will be calculated by reference to a notional amount equal to the certificate balance of
  the Class B certificates (calculated without giving effect to any exchange and conversion of any Class B certificates
  for Class EC certificates).  The pass-through rate for the Class X-B certificates for any distribution
  date will equal the excess, if any, of (a) the weighted average of the net mortgage rates on the mortgage loans (in each
  case, adjusted, if necessary, to accrue on the basis of a 360 day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) for the related
  distribution date, over (b) the pass-through rate of the Class B certificates for the distribution date, as described
  under “Description of the Certificates—Distributions” in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 
 

 
 
(3)
The Class EC certificates
  will not have a pass-through rate, but will be entitled to receive the sum of the interest that would otherwise be distributable
  on the Class A-S, Class B and Class C certificates that are converted in an exchange for such Class EC
  certificates.  The effective pass-through rate applicable to the Class EC certificates for the initial distribution
  date is approximately __% per annum.

Exchangeable
  Certificates
 
Exchangeable
  certificates (the Class A-S, Class B and Class C certificates), in the exchange proportion described in this
  free writing prospectus, may be converted in an exchange for Class EC certificates. Conversely, Class EC certificates
  may be converted in an exchange for a proportionate interest in the exchangeable certificates (in the exchange proportion
  described in this free writing prospectus). The Class EC certificates will

 
 
 




S-33
 
 



 
 
 

 
 
receive principal and interest that would otherwise have been payable on the portion of the exchangeable certificates that have been exchanged for such Class EC certificates. Any such allocations of principal and interest as between Class EC certificates, on the one hand, and exchangeable certificates, on the other hand, will have no effect on the principal or interest entitlements of any other class of certificates. Exchanges will be subject to various conditions that we describe in this free writing prospectus. See “Description of the Certificates—Exchanges of Exchangeable Certificates and Class EC Certificates” in this free writing prospectus for a description of the conversion and exchange procedures relating to the Class EC certificates and the exchangeable certificates. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Exchangeable Certificates and Class EC Certificates” in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 

C. Interest Rate Calculation
 
 

Convention
 
Interest on the offered certificates will be calculated based on a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, or a “30/360 basis”.

 
 
 

 
 
For purposes of calculating the pass-through rates on the offered certificates (other than the Class EC certificates), the interest rate for each mortgage loan that accrues interest based on the actual number of days in each month and assuming a 360-day year, or an “actual/360 basis”, will be recalculated, if necessary, so that the amount of interest that would accrue at that recalculated rate in the applicable month, calculated on a 30/360 basis, will equal the amount of interest that is required to be paid on that mortgage loan in that month, subject to certain adjustments as described in “Description of the Certificates—Distributions—Pass-Through Rates” and “—Interest Distribution Amount” in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 

D. Servicing and
 
 

Administration Fees
 
The master servicer and the special servicer are entitled to a master servicing fee and a special servicing fee, respectively, from the interest payments on each mortgage loan (other than the non-serviced mortgage loans with respect to the special servicing fee only), each REO loan, each serviced companion loan and, with respect to special servicing fees, if the related loan interest payments (or other collections in respect of the related loan or property) are insufficient, then from general collections on all mortgage loans. The servicing fee for each distribution date pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement, which includes the master servicing fee and the portion of the servicing fee payable to any primary servicer, is calculated on the outstanding principal amount of each mortgage loan (including any REO loan and the non-serviced mortgage loans) and the serviced companion loans at the servicing fee rate equal to a per
annum rate ranging from 0.00500% to 0.08250%. The special servicing fee for each distribution date is calculated based on the outstanding principal amount of each mortgage loan (other than any non-serviced mortgage loan) and any related serviced companion loan that is a specially serviced mortgage loan or REO loan, on a loan-by-loan basis at the 

 
 
 

 


S-34
 
 



 
 
 

 
 
special servicing fee rate equal to the greater of a per annum rate of 0.25000% and the per annum rate that would result in a special servicing fee of $3,500 for the related month; provided, that the special servicer will not be entitled to a special servicing fee with respect to the Civic Opera Building mortgage loan, but the special servicer under the JPMBB 2015-C31 pooling and servicing agreement will be entitled to a special servicing fee at a rate equal to a per annum rate of 0.25000%; provided, further, that the special servicer will not be entitled to a special servicing fee with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio mortgage loan, but the special servicer under the U-Haul Portfolio trust and servicing agreement will be entitled to a special servicing fee at a rate equal to a per annum rate of 0.25000%; provided, further, that the special servicer will not be entitled to a special servicing
fee with respect to the One Shell Square mortgage loan or the Brunswick Portfolio mortgage loan, but the special servicer under the JPMBB 2015-C30 pooling and servicing agreement will be entitled to a special servicing fee at a rate equal to the greater of a per annum rate of 0.25000% and the per annum rate that would result in a special servicing fee of $3,500 for the related month. Any primary servicing fees or sub-servicing fees will be paid by the master servicer or special servicer, respectively, out of the fees described above. The master servicer and the special servicer are also entitled to additional fees and amounts, including income on the amounts held in certain accounts and certain permitted investments, liquidation fees and workout fees. See “Transaction Parties—Servicing and Other Compensation and Payment of Expenses” in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 

 
 
The certificate administrator fee for each distribution date is calculated on the outstanding principal amount of each mortgage loan (including any non-serviced mortgage loan) and any REO loan (other than the portion of an REO loan related to any serviced companion loan) in the trust fund at the certificate administrator fee rate equal to a per annum rate of 0.00420%. The trustee fee is payable by the certificate administrator from the certificate administrator fee. The senior trust advisor will be entitled to a fee on each distribution date calculated on the outstanding principal amount of each mortgage loan (including any non-serviced mortgage loan) and any REO loan (other than the portion of an REO loan related to any serviced companion loan) in the trust fund and at the senior trust advisor fee rate, which will be a per annum rate of 0.00250%. The senior trust advisor will also be entitled under certain circumstances to a consulting
fee. Fees payable by the trust to the master servicer, special servicer and senior trust advisor are generally payable prior to any distributions to certificateholders. See “Transaction Parties—Servicing and Other Compensation and Payment of Expenses” and “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—The Senior Trust Advisor” in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 

 
 
Additionally, with respect to each distribution date, an amount equal to the product of 0.00050% per annum multiplied by the outstanding principal amount of each mortgage loan and any REO loan (but not any companion loan) in the trust will be 

 
 
 

 


S-35
 
 



 
 
 

 
 
payable to the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council as a license fee for use of their names and trademarks, including an investor reporting package. This fee will be payable prior to any distributions to certificateholders.

 
 
 

Distributions
 
 

 
 
 

A. Amount and Order of
 
 

Distributions
 
On each distribution date, funds available for distribution from the mortgage loans (net of specified trust fees, reimbursements, expenses and yield maintenance charges or other prepayment premiums and excess interest) will be distributed to the certificates in the following amounts and order of priority:

 
 
 

 
 
First, Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5, Class A-SB, Class X-A, Class X-B, Class X-C and Class X-D certificates: To pay interest on the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5, Class A-SB, Class X-A, Class X-B, Class X-C and Class X-D certificates, pro rata, in each case in accordance with their interest entitlements.

 
 
 

 
 
Second, Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5 and Class A-SB certificates: To the extent of funds allocated to principal and available for distribution: (a) first, to principal on the Class A-SB certificates, until the certificate balance of the Class A-SB certificates is reduced to the planned principal balance for the related distribution date set forth in Annex E to this free writing prospectus, (b) second, to principal on the Class A-1 certificates, until the certificate balance of the Class A-1 certificates has been reduced to zero, (c) third, to principal on the Class A-2 certificates, until the certificate balance of the Class A-2 certificates has been reduced to zero, (d) fourth, to principal on the Class A-3 certificates, until the certificate balance of the Class A-3 certificates has been reduced to zero, (e) fifth, to principal on the Class A-4 certificates until the certificate
balance of the Class A-4 certificates has been reduced to zero, (f) sixth, to principal on the Class A-5 certificates, until the certificate balance of the Class A-5 certificates has been reduced to zero and (g) seventh, to principal on the Class A-SB certificates, until the certificate balance of the Class A-SB certificates has been reduced to zero. If the certificate balance of each class of certificates other than the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5 and Class A-SB certificates has been reduced to zero as a result of the allocation of mortgage loan losses to those certificates, funds available for distributions of principal will be distributed to the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5 and Class A-SB certificates, pro rata, without regard to the distribution priorities described above or the planned principal balance of the Class A-SB certificates.

 
 
 

 
 
Third, Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5 and Class A-SB certificates: To reimburse the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5 and Class A-SB certificates, pro rata, for any previously unreimbursed losses on the mortgage loans allocable to principal that were previously borne by those classes.

On each distribution date, the Class EC certificates will receive, in the aggregate, the sum of the principal and interest and other amounts otherwise distributable to the Class A-S, Class B and Class C certificates that are converted in an exchange for such Class EC certificates and will similarly be allocated the realized losses and other shortfalls otherwise allocable to the Class A-S, Class B and Class C certificates that are converted in an exchange for such Class EC certificates.

 
 
 

B. Interest and Principal
 
 

Entitlements
 
A description of the interest entitlement of each class of certificates (other than the Class R and Class Z certificates) can be found in “Description of the Certificates—Distributions—Interest Distribution Amount” in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 

 
 
A description of the amount of principal required to be distributed to each class of certificates entitled to principal on a particular distribution date can be found in “Description of the Certificates—Distributions—Principal Distribution Amount” in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 

C. Yield Maintenance Charges,
 
 

Prepayment Premiums
 
 

and Excess Interest
 
Yield maintenance charges and prepayment premiums with respect to the mortgage loans will be allocated to the certificates as described in “Description of the Certificates—Allocation of 

 
 
 

 


S-37
 
 



 
 
 
 
 

 
 
Yield Maintenance Charges and Prepayment Premiums” in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 

 
 
For an explanation of the calculation of yield maintenance charges, see “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Certain Terms and Conditions of the Mortgage Loans” in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 

 
 
On each distribution date, any excess interest collected in respect of a mortgage loan in the trust fund with an anticipated repayment date during the related collection period will be distributed to the holders of the Class Z certificates. This interest will not be available to provide credit support for other classes of certificates or offset any interest shortfalls.

 
 
 

D. General
 
The chart below describes the manner in which the payment rights of certain classes of certificates will be senior or subordinate, as the case may be, to the payment rights of other classes of certificates. The chart shows the entitlement to receive principal and/or interest of certain classes of certificates (other than excess interest that accrues on each mortgage loan that has an anticipated repayment date) on any distribution date in descending order. It also shows the manner in which mortgage loan losses are allocated to certain classes of the certificates in ascending order (beginning with the non-offered certificates, other than the Class X-C, Class X-D, Class R and Class Z certificates); provided that no principal payments or mortgage loan losses will be allocated to the Class X-A, Class X-B, Class X-C, Class X-D, Class R or Class Z certificates, although principal payments and mortgage loan losses may reduce
the notional amounts of the Class X-A, Class X-B, Class X-C or Class X-D certificates and, therefore, the amount of interest they accrue.

 
 
 

 
 


 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
(1)
The Class X-A, Class X-B, Class X-C and
  Class X-D certificates are interest-only certificates and the Class X-C and Class X-D certificates are not offered by this
  free writing prospectus.

 
 
 
 

 
 
(2)
The Class A-S, Class B and Class C certificates
  may be exchanged for Class EC certificates in the manner described under “Description of the Certificates—Exchanges
  of Exchangeable Certificates and Class EC Certificates” in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 
 

 
 
(3)
Other than the Class X-C, Class X-D, Class
  R and Class Z certificates.

 
 
 
 

 
 
Other than the subordination of certain classes of certificates, as described above, no other form of credit enhancement will be available for the benefit of the holders of the offered certificates.

 
 
 

 
 
On each distribution date, the Class EC certificates will receive, in the aggregate, the sum of the principal and interest and other

 
 
 
 

 


S-38
 
 



 
 
 

 
 
amounts otherwise distributable to the Class A-S, Class B and Class C certificates that are converted in an exchange for such Class EC certificates and will similarly be allocated any realized losses and other shortfalls otherwise allocable to the Class A-S, Class B and Class C certificates that are converted in an exchange for such Class EC certificates.

 
 
 

 
 
Principal losses and principal payments, if any, on mortgage loans that are allocated to a class of certificates (other than the Class X-A, Class X-B, Class X-C, Class X-D, Class R or Class Z certificates) will reduce the certificate balance of that class of certificates.

 
 
 

 
 
The notional amount of the Class X-A certificates will be reduced by the amount of principal losses or principal payments, if any, allocated to the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5, Class A-SB and Class A-S certificates (determined without giving effect to any exchange and conversion of any Class A-S certificates for Class EC certificates). The notional amount of the Class X-B certificates will be reduced by the amount of principal losses or principal payments, if any, allocated to the Class B certificates (determined without giving effect to any exchange and conversion of any Class B certificates for Class EC certificates). The notional amount of the Class X-C certificates will be reduced by the amount of principal losses or principal payments, if any, allocated to the Class C certificates (determined without giving effect to any exchange and conversion of any Class C certificates for Class EC certificates).The notional amount
of the Class X-D certificates will be reduced by the amount of principal losses or principal payments, if any, allocated to the Class D certificates.

 
 
 

 
 
See “Description of the Certificates” in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 

E. Shortfalls in Available Funds
 
The following types of shortfalls in available funds will reduce distributions to the classes of certificates with the lowest payment priorities: shortfalls resulting from the payment of special servicing fees and other additional compensation that the special servicer is entitled to receive; shortfalls resulting from interest on advances made by the master servicer, the special servicer or the trustee (to the extent not covered by late payment charges or default interest paid by the related borrower); shortfalls resulting from the application of appraisal reductions to reduce principal and interest advances; shortfalls resulting from extraordinary expenses of the trust, including indemnification payments payable to the depositor, master servicer, special servicer, certificate administrator, trustee or senior trust advisor; shortfalls resulting from a modification of a mortgage loan’s interest rate or principal balance; and shortfalls
resulting from other unanticipated or default-related expenses of the trust. Prepayment interest shortfalls on the mortgage loans that are not covered by certain compensating interest payments made by the master servicer are required to be allocated among the classes of certificates (other than the Class EC, Class R and Class Z certificates), on a pro rata basis, to reduce the amount of interest 

 
 
 

 


S-39
 
 



 
 
 

 
 
payable on each such class of certificates to the extent described in this free writing prospectus. The Class EC certificates will receive the sum of the interest that would otherwise be distributable to the Class A-S, Class B and Class C certificates that are converted in an exchange for such Class EC certificates, and will therefore bear the risk of prepayment interest shortfalls that would otherwise be allocated to such certificates. See “Description of the Certificates—Distributions—Priority” in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 

F. Excess Interest
 
On each distribution date, any excess interest in respect of the increase in the interest rate on any mortgage loan with an anticipated repayment date after the related anticipated repayment date to the extent actually collected and applied as interest during a due period will be distributed to the holders of the Class Z certificates on the related distribution date. This excess interest will not be available to make distributions to any other class of certificates or to provide credit support for other classes of certificates or offset any interest shortfalls or to pay any other amounts to any other party under the pooling and servicing agreement.

 
 
 

Advances
 
 

 
 
 

A. P&I Advances
 
The master servicer is required to advance a delinquent periodic mortgage loan payment (unless the master servicer or the special servicer determines that the advance would be nonrecoverable). Neither the master servicer nor the trustee will be required to advance balloon payments due at maturity in excess of the regular periodic payment, interest in excess of a mortgage loan’s regular interest rate, default interest, late payment charges, prepayment premiums or yield maintenance charges. The amount of the interest portion of any advance will be subject to reduction to the extent that an appraisal reduction of the related mortgage loan has occurred (and with respect to any mortgage loan that is part of a whole loan, to the extent such appraisal reduction amount is allocated to the related mortgage loan). See “Description of the Certificates—Advances” in this free writing prospectus. There may be other circumstances in which the
master servicer will not be required to advance a full month of principal and/or interest. If the master servicer fails to make a required advance, the trustee will be required to make the advance, unless the trustee determines that the advance would be nonrecoverable. See “Description of the Certificates—Advances” in this free writing prospectus. If an interest advance is made by the master servicer, the master servicer will not advance the portion of interest that constitutes its servicing fee, but will advance the portion of interest that constitutes the certificate administrator’s fee and the CREFC® license fee. See “Description of the Certificates—Advances” in this free writing prospectus. None of the master servicer, the special servicer or the trustee will make, or be permitted to make, any principal or interest advance with respect to any companion loan that is not part of the trust.

 
 
 

B. Property Protection Advances
 
The master servicer may be required to make advances with respect to mortgage loans that it is required to service to pay 

 
 
 

 


S-40
 
 



 
 
 
 

 
 
delinquent real estate taxes, assessments and hazard insurance premiums and similar expenses necessary to:

 
 
 

 
 
·
protect and maintain (and in the case of REO properties, lease and manage) the related mortgaged property;

 
 
 
 

 
 
·
maintain the lien on the related mortgaged property; and/or

 
 
 
 

 
 
·
enforce the related mortgage loan documents.

 
 
 

 
 
The special servicer will have no obligation to make any property protection advances, but may make such advances in an urgent or emergency situation as described in “Description of the Certificates—Advances” in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 

 
 
If the master servicer fails to make a required advance of this type, the trustee will be required to make this advance. None of the master servicer, the special servicer or the trustee is required to advance amounts determined by such party to be nonrecoverable. See “Description of the Certificates—Advances” in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 

 
 
With respect to the Civic Opera Building mortgage loan, the master servicer (and the trustee, as applicable), under the JPMBB 2015-C31 pooling and servicing agreement is required to make similar advances with respect to delinquent real estate taxes, assessments and hazard insurance premiums as described above. It is expected that the applicable master servicer under the trust and servicing agreement governing the securitization of the U-Haul Portfolio companion loans will be required to make similar advances with respect to delinquent real estate taxes, assessments and hazard insurance premiums as described above. With respect to the One Shell Square mortgage loan and the Brunswick Portfolio mortgage loan, the master servicer (and the trustee, as applicable), under the JPMBB 2015-C30 pooling and servicing agreement is required to, and the special servicer under the JPMBB 2015-C30 pooling and servicing agreement may, make similar advances
with respect to delinquent real estate taxes, assessments and hazard insurance premiums as described above. 

 
 
 

C. Interest on Advances
 
The master servicer, the special servicer and the trustee, as applicable, will be entitled to interest on the above described advances at the “Prime Rate” as published in The Wall Street Journal, as described in this free writing prospectus. Interest accrued on outstanding advances may result in reductions in amounts otherwise payable on the certificates. Neither the master servicer nor the trustee will be entitled to interest on advances made with respect to principal and interest due on a mortgage loan until the related due date has passed and any grace period for late payments applicable to the mortgage loan has expired. See “Description of the Certificates—Advances” and “—Subordination; Allocation of Collateral Support Deficit” in this free writing prospectus. 

 
 
 

 


S-41
 
 



 
 
 

 
 
With respect to the non-serviced mortgage loans, the applicable makers of advances under the related pooling and servicing agreement will similarly be entitled to interest on advances.

 
 
 

 
 
The Mortgage Loans

 
 
 

The Mortgage Pool
 
The trust’s primary assets will be eighty-nine (89) fixed rate commercial mortgage loans, each evidenced by one or more promissory notes secured by first mortgages, deeds of trust, deeds to secure debt or similar security instruments on the fee and/or leasehold estate of the related borrower(s) in two hundred and seventy-three (273) commercial, multifamily and manufactured housing community properties. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Additional Debt” in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 

 
 
The aggregate principal balance of the mortgage loans as of the cut-off date will be approximately $1,148,162,649.

 
 
 

 
 
Whole Loans

 
 
 

 
 
As used in this free writing prospectus, the term “mortgage loan” refers to the mortgage loans that are assets of the trust and does not include any subordinate companion loan or any of the pari passu companion loans.

 
 
 

 
 
In the case of the seven (7) mortgage loans identified as “Civic Opera Building”, “First National Building”, “One Shell Square”, “Eastmont Town Center”, “Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio”, “Brunswick Portfolio” and “New Center One Building” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing approximately 6.5%, 3.5%, 3.1%, 2.5%, 2.2%, 1.7% and 1.7%, respectively, of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date, each such mortgage loan is part of a split loan structure that also includes one or more pari passu companion loans. Each such mortgage loan is secured by the same mortgage instrument(s) on the same mortgaged property or portfolio of mortgaged properties as a related pari passu companion loan, each of which companion loan is evidenced by a pari passu note that is not part of the trust and is referred to in this free writing prospectus
as the respective “pari passu companion loan”.

 
 
 

 
 
In the case of the mortgage loan identified as “U-Haul Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing approximately 4.3% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date, such mortgage loan is secured by the same mortgage instruments on the same mortgaged properties as (i) two (2) related companion loans (each pari passu with the U-Haul Portfolio mortgage loan and each comprised of one or more pari passu notes), which companion loans are not part of the trust, and are each referred to in this free writing prospectus as a “pari passu companion loan”, and (ii) one (1) subordinate companion loan (comprised of two (2) pari passu notes), which subordinate companion loan is not part of the trust, and is referred to in this free writing prospectus as a “subordinate companion loan”.

Each mortgage loan identified in the above table is included in the trust; however, none of the related companion loans are included in the trust. In the case of the Civic Opera Building whole loan, the note comprising the related pari passu companion loan is included in the JPMBB Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2015-C31 securitization. In the case of the U-Haul Portfolio whole loan, the notes comprising the related pari passu companion loans and the notes comprising the related subordinate companion loan are expected to be included in a private CMBS securitization and one or more future securitizations. In the case of the One Shell Square whole loan, the note comprising the related pari passu companion loan is included in the JPMBB Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2015-C30 securitization. In the case of the Eastmont Town Center whole loan, the note comprising the related pari passu companion loan is included

In the case of the Brunswick Portfolio whole loan, the two related pari passu companion loans are included in the JPMBB Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2015-C30 securitization and the JPMBB Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2015-C31 securitization, respectively. In the case of each of the First National Building pari passu companion loan, the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio pari passu companion loan and the New Center One Building pari passu companion loan, each such pari passu companion loan is expected to be deposited into one or more future securitizations. In each instance, the related pari passu companion loan(s) is pari passu in right of payment with the related mortgage loan. 

 
 
 

Servicing of the Whole Loans
 
Each of the First National Building whole loan, the Eastmont Town Center whole loan, the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio whole loan and the New Center One Building whole loan will be serviced in accordance with the pooling and servicing agreement for this transaction and the related intercreditor agreement by the master servicer and the special servicer, and in accordance with the servicing standard provided in the pooling and servicing agreement.

Mortgage Loan Characteristics

 
 
 

 
 
The following tables set forth certain anticipated characteristics of the mortgage loans as of the cut-off date (unless otherwise indicated). With respect to each of the mortgage loans that is part of a whole loan, we generally present the loan-to-value ratio, debt service coverage ratio, debt yield and cut-off date balance per net rentable square foot, bed, room or unit, as applicable, in this free writing prospectus (including any tables, charts and information set forth on Annexes A-1, A-2 and A-3) in a manner that takes account of that mortgage loan and its related pari passu companion loan(s) but not the related subordinate companion loan. Other than as specifically noted, the loan-to-value ratio, the debt service coverage ratio, debt yield and mortgage loan rate information for each mortgage loan is presented in this free writing prospectus without regard to any other indebtedness (whether or not secured by the related mortgaged property,
ownership interests in the related borrower or otherwise) that currently exists or that may be incurred by the related borrower or its owners in the future, in order to present statistics for the related mortgage loan without combination with the other indebtedness. 

 
 
 

 
 
The sum of the numerical data in any column may not equal the indicated total due to rounding. Unless otherwise indicated, all figures and percentages presented in this “Summary of Terms” are calculated as described under “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Additional Mortgage Loan Information” in this free writing prospectus and, unless otherwise indicated, such figures and percentages are approximate and in each case, represent the indicated figure or percentage of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date. The principal balance of each mortgage loan as of the cut-off date assumes the timely receipt of principal scheduled to be paid on or before the cut-off date and no defaults, delinquencies or prepayments on, or modifications of, any mortgage loan on or prior to the cut-off date. Whenever percentages and other information in this free writing prospectus are presented on the mortgaged property
level rather than the mortgage loan level, the information for mortgage loans secured by more than one mortgaged property (or within a group of cross-collateralized mortgage loans) is based on allocated loan amounts as stated in Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus.

In the case of eight
  (8) mortgaged properties identified as “Hilton Suites Chicago Magnificent Mile”, “Civic Opera Building”,
  “One Shell Square”, “Hilton Atlanta Perimeter”, “Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio” and “Langhorne
  Shopping Center” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing six (6) mortgage loans representing approximately
  22.5% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date, the loan-to-value ratio was
  calculated based upon a hypothetical valuation other than an “as-is” value. In addition, with respect to one hundred
  and five (105) mortgaged properties securing one (1) mortgage loan identified as “U-Haul Portfolio” on Annex A-1
  to this free writing prospectus, representing approximately 4.3% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage
  loans as of the cut-off date, the loan-to-value ratio was calculated based on the portfolio value rather than the aggregate
  individual appraised values, which includes a premium for the value of selling the portfolio in its entirety. The remaining
  mortgage loans were calculated using “as-is” values as described under “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Additional
  Mortgage Loan Information” in this free writing prospectus. For further information, see Annex A-1 to this free
  writing prospectus. See also “Risk Factors—Limitations of Appraisals”, “Transaction Parties—The
  Sponsors and Mortgage Loan Sellers—JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association—Exceptions to JPMCB’s Disclosed
  Underwriting Guidelines” and “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Assessments of Property Value and
  Condition—Appraisals” in this free writing prospectus.

In the case of eight (8) mortgage loans
  identified as “Cedar Pointe Apartments”, “South View (Avalon) Apartments”, “Forest View Apartments”,
  “Royal Palms Apartments”, “Beverly Terrace Apartments”, “Iron Mountain Apartments”, “Highland
  Springs Apartments” and “Highland Meadows (43/44) Apartments” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus,
  representing approximately 0.9% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date, the
  mortgage loans are comprised of four (4) groups of cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted loans, and the loan-to-value ratios
  and debt service coverage ratios are presented on an aggregate basis. For each mortgage loan with a related pari passu
  companion loan, the calculation of the loan-to-value ratios and debt service coverage ratios includes the principal balance
  and debt service payment of the related pari passu companion loan(s), but excludes the related subordinate companion
  loan. With respect to one (1) mortgage loan identified as “U-Haul Portfolio”
  on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing approximately 4.3% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool
  of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date, the calculation of the loan-to-value ratios and debt service coverage ratios is
  without regard to the related subordinate companion loan, and the related loan-to-value ratio as of the cut-off date and underwritten
  net cash flow debt service coverage ratio including the related subordinate companion loan are 58.8% and 1.38x, respectively.

 
 
 
 

 
 
 (7)
For each partial interest-only loan, the
  debt service coverage ratio was calculated based on the first principal and interest payment to be made into the trust during
  the term of the mortgage loan once amortization has commenced. For all interest-only loans, the debt service coverage ratio
  was calculated based on the sum of the first 12 interest payments following the cut-off date. With respect to
  one hundred and seventy-two (172) mortgaged properties identified as “Hilton Suites Chicago Magnificent Mile”,
  “U-Haul Portfolio”, “One Shell Square”, “The Park at Veneto”, “Brunswick Portfolio”,
  “New Center One Building”, “The Park at Murano”, “780 Dedham Street”, “One Park
  Centre”, “Colony Village” and “Brynn Marr Village” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus,
  securing eleven (11) mortgage loans, representing approximately 23.0% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage
  loans as of the cut-off date, certain assumptions and/or adjustments were made to the underwritten net cash flow and underwritten
  net cash flow debt service coverage ratios reflected in the table above. For specific discussions on those particular assumptions
  and adjustments, see “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Net Cash Flow and Certain Underwriting Considerations”,
  “—Mortgaged Property Considerations—Tenant Issues—Occupancy and Tenant Concentrations”
  and “—Additional Mortgage Loan Information” in this free writing prospectus. See also Annex A-1 and

All
  of the mortgage loans accrue interest on an actual/360 basis (other than one (1) mortgage loan identified
  as “The Outlet Shoppes at Gettysburg” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing
  approximately 3.3% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date,
  which accrues interest on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months).

One (1) mortgage loan secured
  by the mortgaged property identified as “Eastmont Town Center” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus,
  representing approximately 2.5% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date, provides
  for an increase in the related interest rate after, and otherwise provides incentives to the related borrower to repay the
  mortgage loan by, a certain date, referred to as the anticipated repayment date. The interest accrued in excess of the original
  rate, together with any interest on that accrued interest (if any, as required by the mortgage loan documents and to the extent
  permitted by applicable law), will be deferred and will not be paid until the principal balance of the mortgage loan has been
  paid, at which time the excess interest, to the extent actually collected, will be required to be paid to the Class Z certificates.
  After the anticipated repayment date, cash flow in excess of that required for debt service, required reserves and certain
  budgeted expenses with respect to the mortgaged property would be applied towards the payment of principal (without payment
  of a yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium) of the mortgage loan until its principal balance has been reduced to
  zero and then to the payment of accrued excess interest. A substantial principal payment will be required to pay off the mortgage
  loan on its anticipated repayment date. The actual term for the mortgage loan is longer than the period up to the mortgage
  loan’s anticipated repayment date. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Additional Mortgage Loan Information”
  and “—Certain Terms and Conditions of the Mortgage Loans—ARD Loans” in this free writing prospectus
  and representation number 38 in Annex D-1 and the identified exceptions to that representation in Annex D-2 to this free writing

Prepayments may occur (often without any yield maintenance
  charge or prepayment premium) in connection with a casualty at or condemnation of the related mortgaged property and, if the
  casualty or condemnation is sufficiently material and/or if the insurance proceeds or condemnation award is not released for
  restoration, some mortgage loans permit the related borrower to prepay the related mortgage loan in full or up to a specified
  percentage of the allocated loan amount of the affected property to obtain a property release.

With respect to one (1) mortgage loan secured by the
  mortgaged properties identified as “U-Haul Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing
  approximately 4.3% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date, the mortgage loan
  fully amortizes during the defeasance period and there is no open period.

Includes fifty-eight (58) mortgaged properties securing
  one (1) mortgage loan identified as “Brunswick Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing
  approximately 1.7% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date, that permits the
  related borrower to prepay a portion of the mortgage loan at any time (including during the lockout period) with the payment
  of a yield maintenance premium in connection with the termination of the master lease as to any mortgaged property which the
  tenants under the master lease deem uneconomical or unsuitable for further use in the tenants’ business. See “Description
  of the Mortgage Pool—Mortgaged Property Considerations—Purchase Options, Rights of First Refusal and Rights of
  First Offer” and “—Certain Terms and Conditions of the Mortgage Loans—Releases of Individual
  Mortgaged Properties” in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 

 
 
Defeasance permits the related borrower to substitute
  direct non-callable U.S. Treasury obligations or, in certain cases, other government securities for the related mortgaged
  property as collateral for the related mortgage loan (or whole loan).

Because this table presents information relating to mortgaged
  properties and not mortgage loans, the information for mortgage loans secured by more than one mortgaged property is based
  on allocated loan amounts as set forth in Annex A-1.

 
 
 

Refinanced Loans
 
Several of the mortgage loans were refinancings of loans
  in default at the time of refinancing and/or otherwise involved discounted pay-offs in connection with the origination of
  the mortgage loan as described below:

 
 
 

 
 
With respect to four (4) mortgaged properties identified
  as “Big Curve Shopping Center”, “Freeway Crossing”, “Condor Garden Apartments” and “Comfort
  Inn – Woodstock, VA” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing four (4) mortgage loans representing
  approximately 2.4% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date, the related mortgage
  loans refinanced prior loans that were in maturity default.

 
 
 

 
 
With respect to one (1) mortgaged property identified
  as “780 Dedham Street” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan representing
  approximately 0.6% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date, the mortgaged
  property was previously financed through a securitized loan with an original principal balance of approximately $12.6 million.  The
  prior loan was transferred to special servicing in July 2011 after a drop in tenancy at the mortgaged property, and the mortgaged
  property was foreclosed on in February 2012.  The current loan sponsor acquired the mortgaged property in 2014 for
  the purchase price of $6,425,000, which represents an approximately 43.4% discount of the amount due and payable by the related
  borrower under the prior loan at the time of the foreclosure.

Optional Termination
 
On any distribution date on which the aggregate principal
  balance of the pool of mortgage loans is less than (or, in the case of clause (ii) below, less than or equal to) the greater
  of (i) 1% of the aggregate principal balance of the mortgage loans as of the cut-off date, or (ii) if the mortgage loan identified

A-1
  to this free writing prospectus as “U-Haul Portfolio” is an asset of the trust fund, the product of (x) a
  percentage that is calculated by dividing the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loan identified on Annex A-1
  to this free writing prospectus as “U-Haul Portfolio” on the date that is the 10-year anniversary from the
  start-up date of the trust by the aggregate principal balance of the mortgage loans as of the cut-off date and (y) the
  aggregate principal balance of the mortgage loans as of the cut-off date, certain entities specified in this free writing
  prospectus will have the option to purchase all of the remaining mortgage loans (and all property acquired through exercise
  of remedies in respect of any mortgage loan) at the price specified in this free writing prospectus; provided, however,
  that this termination right will not be exercisable at the percentage threshold specified in clause (ii) above earlier
  than the distribution date in October 2025. Exercise of this option will terminate the trust and retire the then-outstanding
  certificates.
 
The
  trust may also be terminated in connection with a voluntary exchange of all the then-outstanding certificates (other than
  the Class R and Class Z certificates) (provided, however, that the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3,
  Class A-4, Class A-5, Class A-SB, Class A-S, Class B, Class C, Class EC, Class D, Class
  X-A, Class X-B, Class X-C and Class X-D certificates are no longer outstanding, there is only one holder (or multiple
  holders acting unanimously) of the outstanding certificates (other than the Class R and Class Z certificates) and the
  master servicer consents to the exchange) for the mortgage loans and each REO property remaining in the trust.
 
See
  “Description of the Certificates—Termination; Retirement of Certificates” in this free writing
  prospectus and “Description of the Certificates—Termination” in the prospectus. 

 
 
 

Required Repurchases or
 
 

Substitutions of Mortgage Loans
 
Under certain circumstances, the related mortgage loan seller (or
  Starwood Mortgage Capital LLC, Redwood Trust Inc. or RAIT Financial Trust, as applicable, as guarantor of the repurchase and
  substitution obligations of Starwood Mortgage Funding II LLC, Redwood Commercial Mortgage Corporation or RAIT Funding,
  LLC,  respectively) may be obligated to repurchase (without payment of any yield maintenance charge or prepayment
  premium) or substitute for an affected mortgage loan from the trust as a result of a material document defect or a material
  breach of a representation and warranty made by the related mortgage loan seller with respect to the mortgage loan in the
  mortgage loan purchase agreement that materially and adversely affects the value of the mortgage loan, the value of the related
  mortgaged property or the interests of certificateholders in the mortgage loan. See “Description of the Mortgage
  Pool—Representations and Warranties; Repurchases and Substitutions” in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 

Sale of Defaulted Loans
 
Pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement (and subject to
  any applicable intercreditor agreement), the special servicer may offer to sell to any person (or may offer to purchase) any

 
 
 



 

S-54
 

 



 
 
 

 
 
specially serviced mortgage loan (other than a non-serviced mortgage
  loan) if it determines that no satisfactory arrangements (including by way of a discounted pay-off) can be made for collection
  of delinquent payments and such a sale would be in the best economic interest of the trust (or, in the case of any serviced
  whole loan, the trust and the holder of the related serviced companion loan, as a collective whole) on a net present value
  basis. The special servicer is generally required to accept the highest offer received from any person as more particularly
  described in “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans” in this
  free writing prospectus. However, with respect to each mortgage loan with a related mezzanine loan (including if any such
  mezzanine loan is originated in the future), the sale by the special servicer of any defaulted mortgage loan may be subject
  to the rights of the holder of any related mezzanine debt, to exercise its option to purchase the related mortgage loan or
  REO property, as applicable, following a default to the extent set forth in the related intercreditor agreement.

 
 
 

 
 
If any mortgage loan with a related pari passu companion loan becomes
  a defaulted mortgage loan and the special servicer (or, with respect to each non-serviced mortgage loan, the applicable other
  special servicer described in this free writing prospectus) determines to sell the related mortgage loan as described above,
  then the applicable special servicer will be required to sell the related pari passu companion loan(s) and, in the case of
  the U-Haul Portfolio whole loan only, the related subordinate companion loan, together with the related mortgage loan as a
  single loan. In connection with any such sale, such special servicer will be required to follow the procedures set forth under
  “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans” in this free writing
  prospectus, or similar procedures provided for under the other pooling and servicing agreement, as applicable.

 
 
 

Tax Status
 
Elections will be made to treat designated portions of the trust
  (exclusive of (a) interest that is deferred after the anticipated repayment date of each mortgage loan with an anticipated
  repayment date and the excess interest distribution account and (b) the portion, if any, of the Class A-S, Class B
  and Class C certificates that have been exchanged for and converted to Class EC certificates and the related amounts
  in the Class EC distribution account) as two separate REMICs – the lower-tier REMIC and the upper-tier REMIC –
  for federal income tax purposes. In addition, (i) the portions of the trust consisting of (a) any Class A-S,
  Class B and Class C certificates that have been exchanged for and converted to Class EC certificates (and the
  related amounts in the Class EC distribution account) and (b) the excess interest (and related amounts in the excess
  interest distribution account), will be treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes under subpart E, part I
  of subchapter J of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (ii) the Class EC certificates will represent
  undivided beneficial interests in the portion of the grantor trust described in clause (i)(a) above and (iii) the
  Class Z certificates will represent 

 
 
 



 

S-55
 

 



 
 
 
 

 
 
undivided beneficial interests in the portion of the grantor trust described in clause (i)(b) above.

 
 
 

 
 
Pertinent federal income tax consequences of an investment
  in the offered certificates include:

 
 
 

 
 
•
Each class of offered certificates will represent or beneficially
  represent, in the case of the Class EC certificates, “regular interests” in a trust REMIC as further described
  under “Material Federal Income Tax Consequences” in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 
 

 
 
•
Each regular interest represented by an offered certificate will
  generally be treated as a newly originated debt instrument for federal income tax purposes.

 
 
 
 

 
 
•
You will be required to report income on the regular interest represented
  by your offered certificates using the accrual method of accounting.

It is anticipated that the Class certificates will be

Certain ERISA Considerations
 
Subject to important considerations described under
  “Certain ERISA Considerations” in this free writing prospectus and the prospectus, the offered certificates
  are eligible for purchase by persons investing assets of employee benefit plans or individual retirement accounts.

 
 
 

Legal Investment
 
No class of the certificates will constitute “mortgage
  related securities” for purposes of the Secondary Mortgage Market Enhancement Act of 1984, as amended.

 
 
 

 
 
If your investment activities are subject to legal investment
  laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities, then you may be subject to restrictions
  on investment in the certificates. You should consult your own legal advisors for assistance in determining the suitability
  of and consequences to you of the purchase, ownership, and sale of the certificates.

 
 
 

 
 
The issuing entity will not be registered under the
  Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The issuing entity will be relying on an exclusion or exemption from the definition
  of “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, contained in Section 3(c)(5) of
  the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or Rule 3a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, although
  there may be additional exclusions or exemptions available to the issuing entity.  The issuing entity is being structured
  so as not to constitute a “covered fund” for purposes of the Volcker Rule under the Dodd-Frank Act (both as defined
  in this free writing prospectus).

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Fitch Ratings,
  Inc., DBRS, Inc. and Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Inc. have informed us that the “sf” designation in their ratings
  represents an identifier for structured finance product ratings. For additional information about this identifier, prospective
  investors can go to the website of the applicable rating agency. The depositor, issuing entity and the underwriters have not
  verified, do not adopt and do not accept responsibility for any statements made by the rating agencies on their Internet websites.
  Credit ratings referenced throughout this material are forward-looking opinions about credit risk and express a rating agency’s
  opinion about the ability of and willingness of an issuer of securities to meet its financial obligations in full and on time.
  Ratings are not indications of investment merit and are not buy, sell or hold recommendations, a measure of asset value, or
  an indication of the suitability of an investment.

 
 
 

 
 
The ratings address the likelihood of full and timely
  payment to the certificateholders of all distributions of interest at the applicable pass-through rate on the offered certificates
  on each distribution date and the ultimate payment in full of the certificate balance of each class of offered certificates
  on a date that is not later than the rated final distribution date with respect to such class of certificates. Each security
  rating assigned to the offered certificates should be evaluated independently of any other security rating. Such ratings on
  the offered certificates do not address the tax attributes of such certificates or the receipt of any default interest or
  prepayment premium or constitute an assessment of the likelihood or frequency of prepayments on the mortgage loans.

 
 
 

 
 
In general, the ratings address credit risk and not
  prepayment risk and do not represent any assessment of the yield to maturity that purchasers may experience as a result of
  the rate of principal prepayments. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, a measure of
  asset value or an indication of the suitability of an investment, and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time
  by the assigning rating agency. Ratings are forward-looking opinions about credit risk and express an agency’s opinion
  about the ability and

 
 
 



 

S-57
 

 



 
 
 

 
 
willingness of an issuer of securities to meet its financial obligations
  in full and on time. Ratings are not indications of investment merit. See “Ratings” in this free writing
  prospectus. A security rating does not represent any assessment of the yield to maturity that investors may experience or
  the possibility that the holders of the Class X-A and Class X-B certificates might not fully recover their initial
  investment in the event of delinquencies or defaults, prepayments (both voluntary (to the extent permitted) and involuntary),
  or losses in respect of the mortgage loans. As described in this free writing prospectus, the amounts payable with respect
  to the Class X-A and Class X-B certificates consist only of interest. If the mortgage loans were to prepay in the
  initial month, with the result that the holders of the Class X-A and Class X-B certificates receive only a single
  month’s interest and therefore, suffer a nearly complete loss of their investment, all amounts “due” to
  such holders will nevertheless have been paid, and such result is consistent with the rating received on the Class X-A
  and Class X-B certificates. The notional amounts of the Class X-A and Class X-B certificates on which interest
  is calculated may be reduced by the allocation of realized losses and principal prepayments, whether voluntary or involuntary.
  The ratings do not address the timing or magnitude of reductions of such notional amount, but only the obligation to pay interest
  timely on the notional amount, as so reduced from time to time. Therefore, the ratings of the Class X-A and Class X-B
  certificates should be evaluated independently from similar ratings on other types of securities.

 
 
 

 
 
The rated final distribution date will be the distribution date
  in November 2048. See “Yield and Maturity Considerations” and “Description of the Certificates—Advances”
  in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 

 
 
Although the depositor will prepay fees for ongoing rating surveillance
  by certain of the rating agencies engaged by the depositor, the depositor has no obligation or ability to ensure that any
  rating agency performs ratings surveillance. In addition, a rating agency may cease ratings surveillance if the information
  furnished to that rating agency is insufficient to allow it to perform surveillance.

 
 
 

 
 
Additionally, other nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
  that we have not engaged to rate the offered certificates may nevertheless issue unsolicited credit ratings on one or more
  classes of certificates, relying on information they receive pursuant to Rule 17g-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
  as amended, or otherwise. If any such unsolicited ratings are issued, we cannot assure you that they will not be different
  from or lower than any ratings assigned to the offered certificates by any other nationally recognized statistical rating
  organization. The issuance of an unsolicited rating of a class of the offered certificates that is lower than the ratings
  assigned by the rating agencies engaged by the depositor may adversely impact the liquidity, market value and regulatory characteristics
  of that class. As part of the process of obtaining ratings for the offered certificates, the depositor had initial discussions
  with and

 
 
 



 

S-58
 

 



 
 
 

 
 
submitted certain materials to DBRS, Inc., Fitch Ratings, Inc.,
  Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Inc., Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC. Based on preliminary
  feedback from those nationally recognized statistical rating organizations at that time, the depositor selected Moody’s
  Investors Service, Inc., Fitch Ratings, Inc., DBRS, Inc., and Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Inc. to rate the offered certificates
  and not the other nationally recognized statistical rating organization due, in part, to their initial subordination levels
  for the various classes of offered and non-offered certificates. Had the depositor selected such other nationally recognized
  statistical rating organization to rate the offered certificates, we cannot assure you as to the ratings that such other nationally
  recognized statistical rating organization would ultimately have assigned to the offered certificates. In the case of Moody’s
  Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings, Inc., the depositor only requested ratings for certain classes of rated certificates,
  due in part to the final subordination levels provided by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch Ratings, Inc., as
  applicable, for such classes of certificates. If the depositor had selected either Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or
  Fitch Ratings, Inc. to rate those other classes of rated certificates not rated by it, its ratings of those other certificates
  may have been different, and potentially lower, than those ratings ultimately assigned to those certificates by DBRS, Inc.
  and Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Inc. Although unsolicited ratings may be issued by any nationally recognized statistical rating
  organization, a nationally recognized statistical rating organization might be more likely to issue an unsolicited rating
  if it was not selected after having provided preliminary feedback to the depositor. In addition, the decision not to engage
  Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings, Inc. in the rating of certain classes of the offered certificates
  to be issued in connection with this transaction, may negatively impact the liquidity, market value and regulatory characteristics
  of those classes of certificates. See “Risk Factors—Ratings of the Certificates” and “Ratings”
  in this free writing prospectus.

 
 
 

 
 
In addition, neither the depositor nor any other person or entity
  will be required to monitor any changes to any ratings of the offered certificates or will have any duty to notify you if
  any other nationally recognized statistical rating organization issues, or delivers notice of its intention to issue, unsolicited
  ratings on one or more classes of offered certificates after the date of this free writing prospectus. In no event will rating
  agency confirmations from any such other nationally recognized statistical rating organization (except insofar as the matter
  involves a mortgage loan with a split loan structure and such other rating organization is hired to rate securities backed
  by the related pari passu companion loan) be a condition to any action, or the exercise of any right, power or privilege
  by any person or entity under the pooling and servicing agreement.

 
 
 

 
 
Furthermore, the Securities and Exchange Commission may determine
  that any or all of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations engaged by the depositor to rate the offered
  certificates no longer qualifies as a nationally recognized

 
 
 



 

S-59
 

 



 
 
 

 
 
statistical rating organization, or is no longer qualified to rate
  the offered certificates, and that determination may have an adverse effect on the liquidity, market value and regulatory
  characteristics of the offered certificates. See “Risk Factors—Ratings of the Certificates” and “Ratings”
  in this free writing prospectus.

RISK FACTORS
 
You should
carefully consider the following risks and those risks described in “Risk Factors” in the accompanying
prospectus before making an investment decision. In particular, distributions on your certificates will depend on payments received
on, and other recoveries with respect to, the mortgage loans. Therefore, you should carefully consider the risk factors relating
to the mortgage loans and the mortgaged properties.
 
The risks
and uncertainties described below are not the only ones relating to the offered certificates. Additional risks and uncertainties
not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair your investment. If any of the following
events or circumstances identified as risks actually occur or materialize, your investment could be materially and adversely affected.
This free writing prospectus also contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could
differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks
described below and elsewhere in this free writing prospectus.
 
In connection
with the information presented in this free writing prospectus relating to risks that may relate to certain of the mortgage loans
or the mortgage loans in general, examples are sometimes given with respect to a particular risk and a particular mortgage loan.
However, the fact that examples are given should not be interpreted as meaning that such examples reflect all of the mortgage
loans in the trust to which such risk is applicable or that the identified mortgage loan is not subject to other risk factors
described in this free writing prospectus.
 
Combination or “Layering”
of Multiple Risks May Significantly Increase Risk of Loss
 
Although the various risks discussed in
this free writing prospectus are generally described separately, you should consider the potential effects of the interplay of
multiple risk factors. Where more than one significant risk factor is present, the risk of loss to an investor in the certificates
may be significantly increased.
 
The Offered Certificates
May Not Be a Suitable Investment for You
 
The offered certificates are not suitable
investments for all investors. In particular, you should not purchase any class of offered certificates unless you understand and
are able to bear the prepayment, credit, liquidity and market risks associated with that class of certificates. For the reasons
set forth in these “Risk Factors”, the yield
to maturity and the aggregate amount and timing of distributions on the offered certificates are subject to material variability
from period to period and over the life of those certificates. The interaction of the foregoing factors and their effects are impossible
to predict and are likely to change from time to time. As a result, an investment in the offered certificates involves substantial
risks and uncertainties and should be considered only by sophisticated institutional investors with substantial investment experience
with similar types of securities and who have conducted appropriate diligence on the mortgage loans and the offered certificates.
 
The Credit Crisis and Downturn
in the Real Estate Market Have Adversely Affected and May Continue To Adversely Affect the Value of Commercial Mortgage-Backed
Securities
 
In recent years, the real estate and securitization
markets, including the market for commercial mortgage-backed securities, as well as the debt markets, global financial markets
and the economy generally, experienced significant dislocations, illiquidity and volatility. Declining real estate values, coupled
with diminished availability of leverage and/or refinancings for commercial real estate resulted in increased delinquencies and
defaults on commercial mortgage loans. In addition, the most recent downturn in the general economy affected the financial strength
of many commercial real estate tenants and resulted in increased rent delinquencies and increased vacancies, particularly in the
retail sector.
 
Any further economic downturn may lead to
increased vacancies, decreased rents or other declines in income from, or the value of, commercial real estate, which would likely
have an adverse effect on the value and/or liquidity of commercial mortgage-backed securities that are backed by loans secured
by
 


S-61
 

 
such commercial real estate. We cannot assure you that the dislocation in the commercial mortgage-backed securities market will
not continue to occur or become more severe. Even if the commercial mortgage-backed securities market does recover, the mortgaged
properties and therefore, the mortgage loans and the offered certificates, may decline in value. Any further economic downturn
may adversely affect the financial resources of the related borrower under the mortgage loans and may result in the inability of
the related borrower to make principal and interest payments on, or refinance, the outstanding debt when due or to sell the mortgaged
properties for an aggregate amount sufficient to pay off the outstanding debt when due. In the event of default by a borrower under
any of the mortgage loans, the trust may suffer a partial or total loss with respect to such mortgage loan and, consequently, the
offered certificates. Any delinquency or loss on the mortgage loans may have an adverse effect on the distributions of principal
and interest received by holders of the certificates.
 
Even if commercial mortgage-backed securities
are performing as anticipated, the value of such commercial mortgage-backed securities in the secondary market may nevertheless
decline as a result of a deterioration in general market conditions for other asset backed securities or structured products. Trading
activity associated with commercial mortgage-backed securities indices may also drive spreads on those indices wider than spreads
on commercial mortgage-backed securities, thereby resulting in a decrease in value of such commercial mortgage-backed securities.
 
Market Considerations and
Limited Liquidity
 
The offered certificates will not be listed
on any national securities exchange or traded on any automated quotation systems of any registered securities association, and
there is currently no secondary market for the offered certificates. While the underwriters currently intend to make a secondary
market in the offered certificates, no underwriter is obligated to do so, any market-making may be discontinued at any time, and
we cannot assure you that an active secondary market for the offered certificates will develop. Additionally, one or more purchasers
may purchase substantial portions of one or more classes of offered certificates. Accordingly, you may not have an active or liquid
secondary market for the offered certificates. Lack of liquidity could result in a substantial decrease in the market value and
may adversely affect the regulatory characteristics of the offered certificates. The market value of the offered certificates also
may be affected by many other factors, including the then-prevailing interest rates and market perceptions of risks associated
with commercial mortgage lending. No representation is made by any person or entity as to what the market value of any offered
certificate will be at any time. Furthermore, you should be aware that the market for securities of the same type as the offered
certificates has in the past been volatile and offered very limited liquidity from time to time. See “Risk Factors—Your
Ability to Resell Certificates May Be Limited Because of Their Characteristics” in the prospectus.
 
The market value of the offered certificates
can decline even if the offered certificates and the mortgage loans are performing at or above your expectations. The market value
of the offered certificates will be sensitive to fluctuations in current interest rates. However, any change in the market value
of the offered certificates may be disproportionately impacted by upward or downward movement in current interest rates.
 
In particular, the market value of the offered
certificates will also be influenced by the supply of and demand for commercial mortgage-backed securities generally. The supply
of commercial mortgage-backed securities will depend on, among other things, the amount of commercial mortgage loans, whether newly
originated or held in portfolios, that are available for securitization. In addition, financial reform legislation enacted in the
United States could adversely affect the availability of credit for commercial real estate. A number of factors will affect investors’
demand for commercial mortgage-backed securities, including:
 

·the availability of alternative investments that offer higher yields or are perceived as being a better credit risk, having
a less volatile market value or being more liquid;
 

·legal and other restrictions that prohibit a particular entity from investing in commercial mortgage-backed securities, limit
the amount or types of commercial mortgage-backed securities 
 

S-62
 

 


  that it may acquire, or require it to maintain increased capital or
reserves as a result of its investment in commercial mortgage-backed securities;

 

·investors’ perceptions regarding the commercial real estate markets, which may be adversely affected by, among other
things, a decline in real estate values or an increase in defaults and foreclosures on commercial mortgage loans secured by income
producing properties;
 

·investors’ perceptions regarding the capital markets in general, which may be adversely affected by political, social
and economic events completely unrelated to the commercial real estate markets; and
 

·the impact on demand generally for commercial mortgage-backed securities as a result of the existence or cancellation of government-sponsored
economic programs.
 
If you decide to sell any offered certificates,
the ability to sell those certificates will depend on, among other things, whether and to what extent a secondary market then exists
for those certificates, and you may have to sell at a discount from the price you paid for reasons unrelated to the performance
of the certificates or the mortgage loans.
 
The liquidity of the offered certificates
may also be affected by present uncertainties and future unfavorable determinations concerning legal investment. No class of the
offered certificates will constitute “mortgage related securities” for purposes of the Secondary Mortgage Market Enhancement
Act of 1984, as amended. See “Legal Investment”
in this free writing prospectus.
 
Legal and Regulatory Provisions
Affecting Investors Could Adversely Affect the Liquidity of the Certificates
 
We make no representation as to the proper
characterization of the offered certificates for legal investment, financial institution regulatory, financial reporting or other
purposes, as to the ability of particular investors to purchase the offered certificates under applicable legal investment or other
restrictions, or as to the consequences of an investment in the offered certificates for such purposes or under such restrictions.
We note that regulatory or legislative provisions applicable to certain investors may have the effect of limiting or restricting
their ability to hold or acquire commercial mortgage-backed securities, which in turn may adversely affect the ability of investors
in the offered certificates who are not subject to those provisions to resell such certificates in the secondary market. For example:
 

·Effective January 1, 2014, EU Regulation 575/2013 (the “CRR”)
imposes on European Economic Area (“EEA”) credit
institutions and investment firms investing in securitizations issued on or after January 1, 2011, or in securitizations issued
prior to that date where new assets are added or substituted after December 31, 2014: (a) a requirement (the “Retention
Requirement”) that the originator, sponsor or original lender of such securitization has explicitly disclosed
to the investor that it will retain, on an on-going basis, a material net economic interest which, in any event, shall not be less
than 5%; and (b) a requirement (the “Due Diligence Requirement”)
that the investing credit institution or investment firm has undertaken certain due diligence in respect of the securitization
and the underlying exposures and has established procedures for monitoring them on an on-going basis.
 
National regulators in EEA member
states impose penal risk weights on securitization investments in respect of which the Retention Requirement or the Due Diligence
Requirement has not been satisfied in any material respect by reason of the negligence or omission of the investing credit institution
or investment firm.
 
If either of the Retention Requirement
or the Due Diligence Requirement is not satisfied in respect of a securitization investment held by a non-EEA subsidiary of an
EEA credit institution or investment firm, then a penal capital charge may be applied to such securitization investment when taken
into account on a consolidated basis at the level of the EEA credit institution or investment firm.
 

S-63
 

 
Requirements similar to the Retention
Requirement and the Due Diligence Requirement (the “Similar Requirements”):
(i) apply to investments in securitizations by investment funds managed by EEA investment managers subject to EU Directive
2011/61/EU; and (ii) subject to the adoption of certain secondary legislation, will apply to investments in securitizations
by EEA insurance and reinsurance undertakings and by EEA undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities.
 
None of the sponsors, the depositor
or any other party intends to retain a material net economic interest in the securitization constituted by the issue of the offered
certificates in accordance with Retention Requirement or to take any other action which may be required by EEA-regulated investors
for the purposes of their compliance with Retention Requirement, the Due Diligence Requirement or Similar Requirements. Consequently,
the offered certificates are not a suitable investment for EEA credit institutions, investment firms or the other types of EEA
regulated investors mentioned above. As a result, the price and liquidity of the offered certificates in the secondary market may
be adversely affected. EEA-regulated investors are encouraged to consult with their own investment and legal advisors regarding
the suitability of the offered certificates for investment.
 

·The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) enacted in the United
States requires that federal banking agencies amend their regulations to remove reference to or reliance on credit agency ratings,
including, but not limited to, those found in the federal banking agencies’ risk-based capital regulations. New capital regulations
were issued by the banking regulators in July 2013 and began phasing in on January 1, 2014; these regulations implement the increased
capital requirements established under the Basel Accord. These new capital regulations eliminate reliance on credit ratings and
otherwise alter, and in most cases increase, the capital requirements imposed on depository institutions and their holding companies,
including with respect to ownership of asset-backed securities such as CMBS. As a result of these regulations, investments in commercial
mortgage-backed securities like the certificates by institutions subject to the risk-based capital regulations may result in greater
capital charges to these financial institutions and these new regulations may otherwise adversely affect the treatment of commercial
mortgage-backed securities for their regulatory capital purposes.
 

·The Issuing Entity will be relying on an exclusion or exemption under the Investment Company Act contained in Section 3(c)(5)
of the Investment Company Act or Rule 3a-7 under the Investment Company Act, although there may be additional exclusions or exemptions
available to the Issuing Entity. The Issuing Entity is being structured so as not to constitute a “covered fund” for
purposes of the regulations adopted to implement Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (such statutory provision together with such
implementing regulations, the “Volcker Rule”). The Volcker Rule generally prohibits “banking entities”
(which is broadly defined to include U.S. banks and bank holding companies and many non-U.S. banking entities, together with their
respective subsidiaries and other affiliates) from (i) engaging in proprietary trading, (ii) acquiring or retaining an ownership
interest in or sponsoring a “covered fund” and (iii) entering into certain relationships with such funds. The Volcker
Rule became effective on July 21, 2012, and final regulations implementing the Volcker Rule were adopted on December 10, 2013 and
became effective on April 1, 2014. Conformance with the Volcker Rule and its implementing regulations is required by July 21, 2015
(subject to the possibility of up to two one-year extensions). In the interim, banking entities must make good-faith efforts to
conform their activities and investments to the Volcker Rule. Under the Volcker Rule, unless otherwise jointly determined otherwise
by specified federal regulators, a “covered fund” does not include an issuer that may rely on an exclusion or exemption
from the definition of “investment company” under the Investment Company Act other than the exclusions contained in
Section 3(c)(1) and Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. The Volcker Rule’s provisions may adversely affect the
ability of banking entities to purchase and sell the offered certificates. However, the general effects of the Volcker Rule remain
uncertain. Any prospective investor in the certificates, including a U.S. or foreign bank or a subsidiary or other affiliate thereof,
should consult its own legal advisors regarding such matters and other effects of the Volcker Rule.
 

S-64
 

 

·The Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted changes to the accounting standards for structured products. These changes,
or any future changes, may affect the accounting for entities such as the trust, could under certain circumstances require an investor
or its owner generally to consolidate the assets of the trust in its financial statements and record third parties’ investments
in the trust as liabilities of that investor or owner or could otherwise adversely affect the manner in which the investor or its
owner must report an investment in commercial mortgage-backed securities for financial reporting purposes.
 
Accordingly, all investors whose investment
activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities
should consult with their own legal, accounting and other advisors in determining whether, and to what extent, the offered certificates
will constitute legal investments for them or are subject to investment or other restrictions, unfavorable accounting treatment,
capital charges or reserve requirements.
 
The Volatile Economy and
Credit Crisis May Increase Loan Defaults and Affect the Value and Liquidity of Your Investment
 
In recent years, the global economy experienced
a significant recession, as well as a severe, ongoing disruption in the credit markets, including the general absence of investor
demand for and purchases of commercial mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities and structured financial products.
While the United States economy may technically be out of the recession, any recovery could be fragile and may not be sustainable
for any specific period of time, and the global or United States economy could slip into an even more significant recession. Continued
downward price pressures and increasing defaults and foreclosures in residential real estate or other conditions that severely
depressed the overall economy and contributed to the credit crisis have also led to increased vacancies, decreased rents or other/declines
in income from, or the value of, commercial real estate.
 
Additionally, decreases in the value of
commercial properties and the tightening by commercial real estate lenders of underwriting standards have prevented many commercial
borrowers from refinancing their mortgages. A substantial amount of U.S. mortgage loans, with balloon payment obligations in excess
of their respective current property values, are maturing over the coming three years. These circumstances have increased delinquency
and default rates of securitized commercial mortgage loans, and lead to widespread commercial mortgage defaults.
 
In addition, the declines in commercial
real estate values have resulted in reduced borrower equity, hindering such borrower’s ability to refinance in an environment
of increasingly restrictive lending standards and giving them less incentive to cure delinquencies and avoid foreclosure. Higher
loan-to-value ratios are likely to result in lower recoveries on foreclosure, and an increase in loss severities above those that
would have been realized had commercial property values remained the same or continued to increase. Defaults, delinquencies and
losses have further decreased property values, thereby resulting in additional defaults by commercial mortgage borrowers, further
credit constraints, further declines in property values and further adverse effects on the perception of the value of commercial
mortgage-backed securities. Even if the real estate market does recover, the mortgaged property underlying the mortgage loans and,
therefore, the certificates, may decline in value. Any further economic downturn may adversely affect the financial resources of
the related borrowers and may result in the inability of the related borrowers to make interest payments on the related mortgage
loans and repayment at maturity. In the event of default by the related borrowers under the related mortgage loans, the certificateholders
would likely suffer a loss on their investment.
 
In addition, the global financial markets
have experienced increased volatility due to uncertainty surrounding the level and sustainability of the sovereign debt of various
countries. Much of this uncertainty has related to certain countries, including Greece, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Italy, that
participate in the European Monetary Union and whose sovereign debt is generally denominated in euros, the common currency shared
by members of that union. In addition, some economists, observers and market participants have expressed concerns regarding the
sustainability of the monetary union and the common currency in their current form.
 

S-65
 

 
Concerns regarding sovereign debt may spread
to other countries at any time. Furthermore, many state and local governments in the United States are experiencing, and are expected
to continue to experience, severe budgetary constraints. Market volatility or disruption could result if a state were to default
on its debt, or a significant local government were to default on its debt or seek relief from their debt in bankruptcy or by agreement
with their creditors. In addition, recently-enacted financial reform legislation in the United States could adversely affect the
availability of credit for commercial real estate.
 
Any or all of the circumstances described
above may lead to further volatility in or disruption of the credit markets at any time. Moreover, other types of events, domestic
or international, may affect general economic conditions and financial markets, such as wars, revolts, insurrections, armed conflicts,
energy supply or price disruptions, terrorism, political crises, natural disasters and man-made disasters. We cannot predict such
matters or their effect on the value or performance of the certificates.
 
Investors should consider that general conditions
in the commercial real estate and mortgage markets may adversely affect the performance of the mortgage loans and accordingly the
performance of the offered certificates. In addition, in connection with all the circumstances described above, you should be aware
in particular that:
 

·such circumstances may result in substantial delinquencies and defaults on the mortgage loans and adversely affect the amount
of liquidation proceeds that would be realized in the event of foreclosures and liquidations;
 

·defaults on the mortgage loans may occur in large concentrations over a period of time, which might result in rapid declines
in the value of your certificates;
 

·notwithstanding that the mortgage loans were recently underwritten and originated or acquired, the values of the mortgaged
properties may have declined since the related mortgage loans were originated or acquired and may decline following the issuance
of the offered certificates and such declines may be substantial and occur in a relatively short period following the issuance
of the offered certificates; and such declines may or may not occur for reasons largely unrelated to the circumstances of the particular
property;
 

·if you determine to sell offered certificates, you may be unable to do so or you may be able to do so only at a substantial
discount from the price you paid, which may be the case for reasons unrelated to the then-current performance of the offered certificates
or the mortgage loans, and which may be the case within a relatively short period following the issuance of the offered certificates;
 

·if the mortgage loans default, then the yield on your investment may be substantially reduced notwithstanding that liquidation
proceeds may be sufficient to result in the repayment of the principal of and accrued interest on your certificates; an earlier
than anticipated repayment of principal (even in the absence of losses) in the event of a default in advance of the maturity date
would tend to shorten the weighted average period during which you earn interest on your investment; and a later than anticipated
repayment of principal (even in the absence of losses) in the event of a default upon the maturity date would tend to delay your
receipt of principal and the interest on your investment may be insufficient to compensate you for that delay;
 

·even if liquidation proceeds received on defaulted mortgage loans are sufficient to cover the principal and accrued interest
on those mortgage loans, the trust fund may experience losses in the form of special servicing fees and other expenses, and you
may bear losses as a result, or your yield may be adversely affected by such losses;
 

·the time periods to resolve defaulted mortgage loans may be long, and those periods may be further extended because of borrower
bankruptcies, judicial foreclosure and related litigation; and this may be especially true in the case of loans made to borrowers
that have, or whose affiliates have, substantial debts other than the mortgage loan, including related subordinate or mezzanine
financing. See “—Potential Conflicts of Interest” in this free writing prospectus;
 

S-66
 

 

·if foreclosure or similar proceedings involve mortgaged properties across multiple states, resolution may take a longer time
period and involve greater expenses, resulting in a lower recovery than may have been realized than if foreclosure or similar proceedings
were instituted in a single jurisdiction;
 

·trading activity associated with indices of commercial mortgage-backed securities may also drive spreads on those indices wider
than spreads on commercial mortgage-backed securities, thereby resulting in a decrease in value of such commercial mortgage-backed
securities, including your certificates, and spreads on those indices may be affected by a variety of factors, and may or may not
be affected for reasons involving the commercial real estate markets and may be affected for reasons that are unknown and cannot
be discerned; and
 

·even if you intend to hold your certificates, depending on your circumstances, you may be required to report declines in the
value of your certificates, and/or record losses, on your financial statements or regulatory or supervisory reports, and/or repay
or post additional collateral for any secured financing, hedging arrangements, repurchase transactions or other financial transactions
that you have entered into that are backed by or make reference to your certificates, in each case as if your certificates were
to be sold immediately.
 
In connection with all the circumstances
described above, the risks we describe elsewhere under “Risk Factors” in this free writing prospectus and the
accompanying prospectus are heightened substantially, and you should review and carefully consider such risk factors in light of
such circumstances.
 
The Prospective Performance
of the Mortgage Loans Included in the Trust Fund Should Be Evaluated Separately from the Performance of the Mortgage Loans in Any
of Our Other Trusts
 
While there may be certain common factors
affecting the performance and value of income-producing real properties in general, those factors do not apply equally to all income-producing
real properties and, in many cases, there are unique factors that will affect the performance and/or value of a particular income-producing
real property. Moreover, the effect of a given factor on a particular real property will depend on a number of variables, including
but not limited to property type, geographic location, competition, sponsorship and other characteristics of the property and the
related commercial mortgage loan. Each income-producing real property represents a separate and distinct business venture and,
as a result, each of the mortgage loans requires a unique underwriting analysis. Furthermore, economic and other conditions affecting
real properties, whether worldwide, national, regional or local, vary over time. The performance of a pool of mortgage loans originated
and outstanding under a given set of economic conditions may vary significantly from the performance of an otherwise comparable
mortgage pool originated and outstanding under a different set of economic conditions. Accordingly, investors should evaluate the
mortgage loans underlying the offered certificates independently from the performance of commercial mortgage loans underlying any
other series of certificates.
 
As a result of the distinct nature of each
pool of commercial mortgage loans, and the separate mortgage loans within the pool, this free writing prospectus does not include
disclosure concerning the delinquency and loss experience of static pools of periodic originations by the sponsor of assets of
the type to be securitized (known as “static pool data”). Because of the highly heterogeneous nature of the assets
in commercial mortgage backed securities transactions, static pool data for prior securitized pools, even those involving the same
asset types (e.g., hotels or office buildings), may be misleading, since the economics of the properties and terms of the
loans may be materially different. In particular, static pool data that may show a low level of delinquencies and defaults would
not be indicative of the performance of this pool or any other pools of mortgage loans originated by the same sponsor or sponsors.
Therefore, investors should evaluate this offering on the basis of the information set forth in this free writing prospectus with
respect to the mortgage loans, and not on the basis of any successful performance of other pools of securitized commercial mortgage
loans.
 

S-67
 

 
Commercial Lending Is Dependent
Upon Net Operating Income
 
The liquidation value of a commercial property
is determined, in substantial part, by the capitalization of the property’s cash flow. However, net operating income can
be volatile and may be insufficient to cover debt service on the commercial mortgage loan at any given time.
 
For historical financial information relating
to the mortgaged properties, including net operating income for the most recent reporting period and prior three calendar years,
to the extent available, prospective investors should review Annex A-1 and Annex A-3 to this free writing prospectus.
Certain mortgage loans are secured in whole or in part by mortgaged properties that have no prior operating history available or
otherwise lack or have limited historical financial figures and information. A mortgaged property may lack or have limited prior
operating history or historical financial information because it is newly constructed, it is a recent acquisition by the related
borrower or it is a single-tenant property that is subject to a triple net lease. In addition, a tenant’s lease may contain
confidentiality provisions that restrict the mortgage loan sellers’ access to or disclosure of such tenant’s financial
information. The underwritten net cash flows and underwritten net operating income for such mortgaged properties are derived principally
from current rent rolls or tenant leases (or, in some cases, based on leases that are not yet in place (and may still be under
negotiation) or on tenants that may have signed a lease, or lease amendment expanding the leased space, but are not yet in occupancy
in all or a portion of their space and/or paying rent) and historical expenses, adjusted to account for inflation, significant
occupancy increases and a market rate management fee. However, we cannot assure you that such tenants will execute leases or expand
their space or, in any event, that actual cash flows from such mortgaged properties will meet such projected cash flows, income
and expense levels or that those funds will be sufficient to meet the payment obligations of the related mortgage loans. See “Description
of the Mortgage Pool—Additional Mortgage Loan Information” and “—Net Cash Flow and Certain Underwriting
Considerations” in this free writing prospectus and “Risk Factors—Commercial and Multifamily Mortgage
Loans Have Risks That May Affect Payments on Your Certificates” in the prospectus.

 
The volatility of net operating income will
be influenced by many of the foregoing factors, as well as by:
 

·the length of tenant leases (including that, in certain cases, all or substantially all of the tenants, or one or more sole,
anchor or other major tenant at a particular mortgaged property have leases that expire or permit the tenant(s) to terminate its
or their lease(s) during the term of the related mortgage loan);
 

·the creditworthiness of tenants;
 

·tenant defaults;
 

·in the case of rental properties, the rate at which new rentals occur; and
 

·the property’s “operating leverage” which is generally the percentage of total property expenses in relation
to revenue, the ratio of fixed operating expenses to those that vary with revenues, and the level of capital expenditures required
to maintain the property and to retain or replace tenants.
 
A decline in the real estate market or in
the financial condition of a major tenant will tend to have a more immediate effect on the net operating income of properties with
short-term revenue sources, such as short-term or month-to-month leases, and may lead to higher rates of delinquency or defaults.
 
In addition, underwritten or adjusted cash
flows, by their nature, are speculative and are based upon certain assumptions and projections. The failure of such assumptions
or projections in whole or in part could cause the underwritten net operating income (calculated as described in “Description
of the Mortgage Pool—Additional Mortgage Loan Information” in this free writing prospectus) to vary substantially
from the actual net operating income of a mortgaged property. See “—Risks Relating to Underwritten Net Cash Flow”
below.
 

S-68
 

 
Risks Relating to Underwritten
Net Cash Flow
 
As described under “Description
of the Mortgage Pool—Additional Mortgage Loan Information” in this free writing prospectus, underwritten
net cash flow generally includes cash flow (including any cash flow from master leases) adjusted based on a number of assumptions
used by the mortgage loan sellers. No representation is made that the underwritten net cash flow set forth in this free writing
prospectus as of the cut-off date or any other date represents actual future net cash flows. For example, with respect to certain
mortgage loans included in the trust, the occupancy of the related mortgaged property reflects tenants that (i) may not have
yet actually executed leases, (ii) have signed leases but have not yet taken occupancy and/or are not paying full contractual
rent, (iii) are seeking or may in the future seek to sublet all or a portion of their respective spaces, (iv) are “dark”
tenants but paying rent, or (v) are affiliates of the related borrower and are leasing space pursuant to a master lease or
a space lease. Similarly, with respect to certain mortgage loans included in the trust, the underwritten net cash flow may be based
on certain tenants that have not yet executed leases (and may still be under negotiation) or that have signed leases but are not
yet in place and/or are not yet paying rent, or have a signed lease or lease amendment expanding the leased space, but are not
yet in occupancy in all or a portion of their space and/or paying rent, or may assume that future contractual rent steps (during
some or all of the remaining term of a lease) have occurred. Each investor should review these and other similar assumptions and
make its own determination of the appropriate assumptions to be used in determining underwritten net cash flow. In many cases,
co-tenancy provisions were assumed to be satisfied and vacant space was assumed to be occupied and space that was due to expire
was assumed to have been re-let, in each case at market rates that may have exceeded current rent.
 
In the event of the inaccuracy of any assumptions
or projections used in connection with the calculation of underwritten net cash flow, the actual net cash flow could be significantly
adversely affected.
 
In addition, the debt service coverage ratios
set forth in this free writing prospectus for the mortgage loans and the mortgaged properties vary, and may vary substantially,
from the debt service coverage ratios for the mortgage loans and the mortgaged properties as calculated pursuant to the definition
of such ratios as set forth in the related mortgage loan documents. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Net Cash
Flow and Certain Underwriting Considerations” and the charts entitled “Operating History and Underwritten Net Cash
Flow” and the related footnotes in “Description of Top Ten
Mortgage Loans and Additional Mortgage Loan Information” in Annex A-3 to this free writing prospectus
for additional information on certain of the mortgage loans in the trust.
 
Limited Information Causes
Uncertainty
 
Some of the mortgage loans that we intend
to include in the trust are mortgage loans that were made to enable the related borrower to acquire the related mortgaged property,
and certain mortgage loans may be secured by recently constructed properties. Accordingly, for certain of these mortgage loans,
limited or no historical operating information is available with respect to the related mortgaged properties. As a result, you
may find it difficult to analyze the historical performance of those mortgaged properties.
 
No Reunderwriting of the
Mortgage Loans
 
We have not reunderwritten the mortgage
loans. Instead, we have relied on the representations and warranties made by the mortgage loan sellers, and the applicable mortgage
loan seller’s obligation to repurchase, substitute for or cure a mortgage loan in the event that a representation or warranty
was not true when made and such breach materially and adversely affects the value of the mortgage loan, the value of the related
mortgaged property or the interests of the certificateholders. These representations and warranties do not cover all of the matters
that we would review in underwriting a mortgage loan and you should not view them as a substitute for reunderwriting the mortgage
loans. Furthermore, these representations and warranties in some respects represent an allocation of risk rather than a confirmed
description of the mortgage loans, although none of the mortgage loan sellers have made representations and warranties that they
know to be untrue (subject to the exceptions to the representations and
 

S-69
 

 
warranties described in the purchase agreement and this
free writing prospectus). If we had reunderwritten the mortgage loans, it is possible that the reunderwriting process may have
revealed problems with a mortgage loan not covered by a representation or warranty. In addition, we can give no assurance that
the applicable mortgage loan seller will be able to repurchase a mortgage loan if a representation or warranty has been breached.
See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Representations and
Warranties; Repurchases and Substitutions” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Risks Associated with Commercial
Real Estate Lending
 
The borrower’s ability to make payments
due on its related mortgage loan will be subject to the risks generally associated with real estate investments. These risks include
adverse changes in general or local economic conditions, real estate values generally and in the locales of the related mortgaged
properties, interest rates, real estate tax rates, other operating expenses (including costs of energy), inflation, the supply
of and demand for properties of the type involved, zoning laws or other governmental rules and policies (including environmental
restrictions), competitive conditions (including changes in land use and construction of new competitive properties) that may affect
the ability of a borrower to obtain or maintain full occupancy of the related mortgaged properties, bankruptcy or other events
adversely affecting the tenants or prospective tenants at such mortgaged properties, civil disorder, acts of war or of terrorists,
acts of God, such as floods or earthquakes, and other factors beyond the control of the related borrower. Due to these and other
factors, the performance of real estate has historically been cyclical. Such factors may make it difficult for the mortgaged properties
to generate sufficient net operating income to make full and timely payments on the related mortgage loans. Also, if any major
repair or improvement is required at a mortgaged property, we cannot assure you that the related borrower (or tenant, if required
under its lease) will be able to obtain funds to make such repair or improvement. As with all real estate, if reconstruction (for
example, following fire or other casualty) or any major repair or improvement is required at a mortgaged property, changes in governmental
approvals may be applicable and may materially affect the cost to, or ability of, the related borrower to effect such reconstruction,
major repair or improvement. Furthermore, certain of the reciprocal easement and operating agreements or anchor tenant leases may
provide that the anchor tenant is permitted to terminate its lease or operating covenant in certain circumstances, including if
a mortgaged property is substantially damaged or taken by condemnation. See “—Retail Properties Have Special Risks”
below.
 
Office Properties Have Special
Risks
 
Thirteen (13) of the mortgaged properties,
securing twelve (12) mortgage loans, representing approximately 28.6% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage
loans as of the cut-off date by allocated loan amount, are office properties.
 
A large number of factors may adversely
affect the value of office properties, including:
 

·the quality of an office building’s tenants;
 

·an economic decline in the business operated by the tenants;
 

·the physical attributes of the building in relation to competing buildings (e.g.,
age, condition, design, appearance, location, access to transportation and ability to offer certain amenities, such as sophisticated
building systems and/or business wiring requirements);
 

·the physical attributes of the building with respect to the technological needs of the tenants, including the adaptability
of the building to changes in the technological needs of the tenants;
 

·the diversity of an office building’s tenants (or reliance on a single or dominant tenant);
 

·the desirability of the area as a business location;
 

·the strength and nature of the local economy, including labor costs, tax environment and the quality of life for employees;
and
 

S-70
 

 

·an adverse change in population, patterns of telecommuting or sharing of office space, and employment growth (all of which
affect the demand for office space).
 
Certain of the mortgage loans identified
as being secured by office properties are medical office properties, which are subject to certain additional risks. The performance
of a medical office property may depend on (i) the proximity of such property to a hospital or other health care establishment
and (ii) reimbursements for patient fees from private or government-sponsored insurers. The performance of a medical or dental
office property may depend on (i) its ability to attract doctors and nurses to be on staff, (ii) its ability to afford
and acquire the latest medical or dental equipment, (iii) a sufficient patient base and (iv) reimbursements for patient
fees and other charges from private or government sponsored insurers. Issues related to reimbursement (ranging from non-payment
to delays in payment) from insurers could adversely impact cash flow at such mortgaged property.
 
Certain of the mortgage loans identified
as being secured by office properties may include parking garages, which present certain risks. Parking garages present risks not
associated with other properties. The primary source of income for parking garages is the rental fees charged for parking spaces.
Factors affecting the success of a parking garage include the number of rentable parking spaces and rates charged and the amount
of alternative parking spaces in the area. In addition, because of the unique construction requirements of many parking garages,
a parking garage may not be easily converted to other uses. See “—Some Mortgaged Properties May Not Be Readily Convertible
To Alternative Uses” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Moreover, the cost of refitting office space
for a new tenant is often higher than the cost of refitting other types of properties for new tenants. See “—Risks
Relating to Mortgage Loan Concentrations and Borrower-Sponsor Concentrations”
below and “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Mortgage Pool Characteristics—Property Type Concentrations”
in this free writing prospectus.
 
Retail Properties Have Special
Risks
 
Ninety-four (94) of the mortgaged properties,
securing twenty-one (21) mortgage loans, representing approximately 21.7% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage
loans as of the cut-off date by allocated loan amount, are retail properties. Sixteen (16) of these mortgaged properties identified
as “Frandor Shopping Center”, “The Outlet Shoppes at Gettysburg”, “Langhorne Shopping Center”,
“Town & Country Shopping Center”, “Premiere Place”, “Emerson Pointe”, “Big Curve
Shopping Center”, “Falcon Gateway”, “Southwest Plaza”, “Mattoon Market Place”, “Freeway
Crossing”, “Market Square at Montrose”, “Heritage Shopping Center”, “Chippewa Towne Centre”,
“Frankford Square” and “Pine Tree Square” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing sixteen
(16) mortgage loans, representing approximately 17.4% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the
cut-off date by allocated loan amount, may have one or more “anchor tenants” or “shadow anchor tenants”,
which may or may not be tenants at the mortgaged properties that represent collateral for the related mortgage loan. The value
of retail properties is significantly affected by the quality of the tenants as well as fundamental aspects of real estate, such
as location and market demographics. The correlation between success of tenant businesses and a retail property’s value may
be more direct with respect to retail properties than other types of commercial property because a component of the total rent
paid by certain retail tenants is often tied to a percentage of gross sales.
 
Whether a retail property is “anchored”,
“shadow anchored” or “unanchored” is also an important consideration. The presence or absence of an “anchor
tenant” or a “shadow anchor tenant” in or near a retail property also can be important because anchors play a
key role in generating customer traffic and making a center desirable for other tenants. An “anchor tenant” located
on a related property is usually proportionately larger in size than most other tenants in the property and is vital in attracting
customers to a retail property. A “shadow anchor tenant” is usually proportionally larger in size than most tenants
in the property, is important in attracting customers to a retail property and is located sufficiently close and convenient to
the property so as to influence and attract potential customers, but is not located on the mortgaged property. The economic performance
of an anchored or shadow anchored retail property will consequently be adversely affected by:
 

S-71
 

 

·an anchor tenant’s or shadow anchor tenant’s failure to renew or extend its lease;
 

·termination of an anchor tenant’s or shadow anchor tenant’s lease or, if the anchor tenant or shadow anchor tenant
owns its own site, a decision to vacate;
 

·the bankruptcy or economic decline of an anchor tenant, shadow anchor tenant or self-owned anchor; or
 

·the cessation of the business of an anchor tenant, a shadow anchor tenant or of a self-owned anchor (notwithstanding its continued
payment of rent).
 
In certain instances with respect to the
mortgaged properties, anchor tenant leases expire during the term of the related mortgage loan or such tenants may have the option
to terminate their respective leases early. See “Description of
Top Ten Mortgage Loans and Additional Mortgage Loan Information” in Annex A-3 to this free writing
prospectus for the lease rollover schedules for certain of the mortgage loans and see Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus
for the lease expiration dates for the five (5) largest tenants (based on net rentable area leased) at each mortgaged property
to the extent applicable. We cannot assure you that if anchor tenants or shadow anchor tenants at a particular mortgaged property
were to close or remain vacant, such anchor tenants or shadow anchor tenants, as applicable, would be replaced in a timely manner
or, if part of the collateral for the related mortgage loan, without incurring material additional costs to the related borrower
or resulting in adverse economic effects. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Mortgaged Property Considerations—Tenant
Issues—Terminations” and “—Expirations” in this free writing prospectus.
 
In addition, various anchor parcels and/or
anchor improvements at a mortgaged property may be owned by the anchor tenant (or an affiliate of the anchor tenant) or by a third
party and therefore not be part of the related mortgaged property and the related borrower may not receive rental income from such
anchor tenant.
 
Retail properties that have anchor tenant-owned
stores often have reciprocal easement and operating agreements between the retail property owner and such anchor tenants containing
certain operating and maintenance covenants. We cannot assure you that the reciprocal easement or operating agreements, as applicable,
will not expire prior to the maturity date of the related mortgage loan. Although an anchor tenant that owns its own parcel does
not pay rent, it generally is required to pay a contribution toward common area maintenance and real estate taxes on the improvements
and related real property. Anchor tenants that lease their stores often have operating covenants as well. Such operating covenants
may be provided for in the anchor tenant lease or in the reciprocal easement and operating agreement, if any, affecting the mortgaged
property. Anchor tenants that have no operating covenants or whose covenants have expired previously or will expire during the
term of the related mortgage loan are or will not be contractually obligated to operate their stores at the applicable mortgaged
property. A number of the tenant leases and reciprocal easement and operating agreements at the mortgaged properties have co-tenancy
clauses which permit such stores to abate the rent payable, refrain from opening for business, cease operating and/or terminate
their leases if certain anchor or other major tenants, and/or if a specified percentage of the stores at the related mortgaged
property, are not occupied and operating. Certain tenants may also have certain other termination rights related to sales targets.
Certain of the operating covenants with respect to the mortgaged properties have expired or will expire prior to the maturity date
of the related mortgage loan. We cannot assure you that operating covenants will be obtained in the future for these or any of
the anchor tenants.
 
Certain tenant (including anchor tenant)
estoppels obtained in connection with the origination of the mortgage loans identified disputes between the related borrower and
the applicable tenant, or alleged defaults or potential defaults by the applicable property owner under the lease or reciprocal
easement and operating agreement. Such disputes, defaults or potential defaults could result in a tenant off-setting rent or could
lead to a termination or attempted termination of the applicable lease or reciprocal easement and operating agreement by the tenant
or to litigation against the related borrower. We cannot assure you that the identified tenant disputes will not have a material
adverse effect on the ability of the related
 

S-72
 

 
borrowers to repay the mortgage loan. In addition, we cannot assure you that the tenant
estoppels obtained identify all potential disputes that may arise with tenants.
 
In addition, certain tenants may not provide
estoppels, or the estoppels obtained may not be timely. In such cases material information about the related leases may not have
been available for loan underwriting purposes at origination. We cannot assure you that the failure to obtain related estoppel
information will not have a material adverse effect on the related mortgage loans.
 
Rental payments from tenants of retail properties
typically comprise the largest portion of the net operating income of those mortgaged properties. Certain tenants at the mortgaged
properties may be paying rent but are not yet in occupancy or have signed leases but have not yet started paying rent and/or are
not yet in occupancy. See “—Certain Additional Risks Relating to Tenants” in this free writing prospectus.
Risks applicable to anchor tenants (such as bankruptcy, failure to renew leases, early terminations of leases and vacancies) also
apply to other tenants. We cannot assure you that the rate of occupancy at the stores will remain at the current levels or that
the net operating income contributed by the mortgaged properties will remain at its current or past levels. See “—Risks
of Lease Early Termination Options” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Borrowers, property managers and their affiliates
of mortgaged properties may currently own, and in the future property managers of mortgaged properties and affiliates of borrowers
may develop or acquire, additional properties and lease space in other properties in the same market areas where the mortgaged
properties are located. Property managers at the related mortgaged properties also may manage competing properties. None of the
property managers or any other party has any duty to favor the leasing of space in the mortgaged properties over the leasing of
space in other properties, one or more of which may be adjacent to, or near the mortgaged properties. See “Description
of the Mortgage Pool–Mortgage Pool Characteristics—Property Type Concentrations” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Retail properties also face competition
from sources outside a given real estate market. Factory outlet centers, discount shopping centers and clubs, video shopping networks,
catalogue retailers, home shopping networks, direct mail, Internet selling and telemarketing all compete with more traditional
retail properties for consumer dollars. Continued growth of these and other alternative retail outlets could adversely affect the
rents collectible at the mortgaged properties secured by retail properties. Increased competition could adversely affect income
from and market value of those mortgaged properties.
 
In some cases, the leases of certain anchor
and other significant tenants prohibit the landlord from leasing space at or near the related mortgaged property to a competitor
of the subject tenant, thereby adversely affecting the potential tenant pool and/or the value of the related mortgaged property
in a foreclosure scenario.
 
In addition, certain of the retail properties
have tenants that are subject to risks unique to their business, such as theaters, bowling alleys, gas stations, educational facilities,
fitness centers and restaurants. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Mortgage Pool Characteristics—Property
Type Concentrations” in this free writing prospectus. In such cases, aspects of building site design and adaptability
affect the value of such properties and other retailers at the mortgaged property. For example, the limited adaptability of certain
shopping malls that have proven unprofitable has recently resulted in extremely high loss severities on mortgage loans secured
by those shopping malls, which mortgage loans were owned by commercial mortgage-backed securitization trusts. In one particular
case, a significant amount of advances made by the applicable servicer(s) of a mortgage loan secured by a shopping mall property,
combined with low liquidation proceeds in respect of that property, resulted in a loss severity exceeding 100% of the outstanding
principal balance of that mortgage loan. See “—Some Mortgaged Properties May Not Be Readily Convertible to Alternative
Uses” below.
 
In addition, decreasing patronage at such
properties could adversely affect revenue of the property, which may, in turn, cause the tenants to experience financial difficulties,
resulting in downgrades in their credit, lease defaults, ratings and, in certain cases, bankruptcy filings. See “—Tenant
Bankruptcy Entails Risks” below. Additionally, receipts at such properties are also affected not only by objective factors
but by subjective factors. For instance, restaurant receipts are affected by such varied influences as the
 

S-73
 

 
current personal income
levels in the community, an individual consumer’s preference for type of food, style of dining and restaurant atmosphere,
the perceived popularity of the restaurant, food safety concerns related to personal health with the handling of food items at
the restaurant or by food suppliers and the actions and/or behaviors of staff and management and level of service to the customers.
In addition, because of unique construction requirements of such properties, any vacant space would not easily be converted to
other uses.
 
Certain retail properties may have other
non-retail types of tenants, including medical office tenants. For risks related to these types of tenants, see “—Office
Properties Have Special Risks” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Multifamily Properties Have
Special Risks
 
Thirty-six (36) of the mortgaged properties,
partially securing thirty-four (34) mortgage loans representing approximately 17.6% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool
of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date by allocated loan amount, are multifamily properties.
 
A large number of factors may adversely
affect the value and successful operation of a multifamily property, including:
 

·the physical attributes of the apartment or student housing building (e.g., its age, appearance and construction quality);
 

·the quality of property management;
 

·the location of the property (e.g., a change in the neighborhood over time or increased crime in the neighborhood);
 

·the ability of management to provide adequate security, maintenance and insurance;
 

·the types of services the property provides;
 

·the property’s reputation;
 

·the level of mortgage interest rates (which may encourage tenants to purchase rather than rent housing);
 

·the generally short term of residential leases and the need for continued reletting;
 

·rent concessions and month-to-month leases, which may impact cash flow on the property;
 

·in the case of student housing facilities, which may be more susceptible to damage or wear and tear than other types of multifamily
housing, the reliance on the financial well-being of the college or university to which it relates, competition from on-campus
housing units, which may adversely affect occupancy, the physical layout of the housing, which may not be readily convertible to
traditional multifamily use, and the fact that student tenants have a higher turnover rate (and may be financially less able to
make rent payments) than other types of multifamily tenants, which in certain cases is compounded by the fact that student leases
are available for periods of less than 12 months;
 

·restrictions on the age of tenants who may reside at the property;
 

·receipt of rent subsidies from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development under its Section 8 Tenant-Based
Assistance Rental Certificate Program;
 

·state and local regulations, including rent control and rent stabilization ordinances and regulations;
 


S-74
 
 

·whether the property is subject to low income housing use restrictions that limit income of tenants and rent for units;
 

·the presence of competing properties and residential developments in the local market;
 

·the existence of corporate tenants renting large blocks of units at the property, which in the event such tenant vacates would
leave the property with a significant percentage of unoccupied space; and in the event such tenant was renting at an above-market
rent may make finding replacement tenants difficult;
 

·the tenant mix, particularly if the tenants are predominantly students, personnel from or workers related to a military base
or workers from a particular business or industry;
 

·adverse local, regional or national economic conditions, which may limit the amount of rent that can be charged and may result
in a reduction in timely rent payments or a reduction in occupancy;
 

·state and local regulations;
 

·government assistance/rent subsidy programs; and

Hotel Properties Have Special
Risks
 
Eleven (11) of the mortgaged properties,
partially securing nine (9) mortgage loans, representing approximately 14.9% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of
mortgage loans as of the cut-off date by allocated loan amount, are hotel properties. See “Risk Factors—Commercial
and Multifamily Mortgage Loans Have Risks That May Affect Payments on Your Certificates” in the prospectus.
 
Because rooms are generally rented for short
periods of time, the financial performance of hospitality properties tends to be affected by adverse economic conditions and competition
more quickly than other commercial properties. Additionally, as a result of high operating costs, relatively small decreases in
revenue can cause significant stress on a property’s cash flow.
 
Moreover, the hospitality and lodging industry
is generally seasonal in nature and different seasons affect different hospitality properties differently depending on type and
location. This seasonality can be expected to cause periodic fluctuations in a hospitality property’s room and restaurant
revenues, occupancy levels, room rates and operating expenses. We cannot assure you that cash flow will be sufficient to offset
any shortfalls that occur at the mortgaged property during slower periods or that the related mortgage loans provide for seasonality
reserves, or if seasonality reserves are provided for, that such reserves will be funded or will be sufficient or available to
fund such shortfalls.
 
In addition, some of the hospitality mortgaged
properties are limited-service hotels. Hospitality properties that are limited-service hotels may subject a lender to more risk
than full-service hotels as they generally require less capital for construction than full-service hotels. In addition, as limited-service
hotels generally offer fewer amenities than full-service hotels, they are less distinguishable from each other. As a result, it
is easier for limited-service hotels to experience increased or unforeseen competition.
 
In addition to hotel operations, some hospitality
properties also operate entertainment complexes that include restaurants, lounges, nightclubs and/or banquet and meeting spaces
and may derive a significant portion of the related property’s revenue from such operations. Consumer demand for entertainment
resorts is particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the corresponding impact on discretionary spending on leisure
activities. Changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer
 

S-75
 

 
preferences could be driven by factors such as perceived or
actual general economic conditions, high energy, fuel and food costs, the increased cost of travel, the potential for bank failures,
the weakened job market, perceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth, fears of recession and changes in consumer
confidence in the economy, or fears of war and future acts of terrorism. These factors could reduce consumer demand for the leisure
activities that the property offers, thus imposing practical limits on pricing and harming operations. Restaurants and nightclubs
are particularly vulnerable to changes in consumer preferences. In addition, a nightclub’s, restaurant’s or bar’s
revenue is extremely dependent on its popularity and perception. These characteristics are subject to change rapidly and we cannot
assure you that any of a hospitality property’s nightclubs, restaurants or bars will maintain their current level of popularity
or perception in the market. Any such change could have a material adverse effect on the net cash flow of the property.
 
Some of the hotels have liquor licenses
associated with the mortgaged property. The liquor licenses for these mortgaged properties are generally held by affiliates of
the related borrowers, unaffiliated managers or operating lessees. The laws and regulations relating to liquor licenses generally
prohibit the transfer of such licenses to any person, or condition such transfer on the prior approval of the governmental authority
that issued the license. In the event of a foreclosure of a hotel property that holds a liquor license, the special servicer on
behalf of the trust or a purchaser in a foreclosure sale would likely have to apply for a new license, which might not be granted
or might be granted only after a delay that could be significant. We cannot assure you that a new license could be obtained promptly
or at all. The lack of a liquor license in a hotel could have an adverse impact on the revenue from the related mortgaged property
or on the hotel’s occupancy rate.
 
Additionally, certain of these mortgaged
properties may have been designated as historic or landmark buildings or may be located in areas designated as historic or landmark.
Such properties may have restrictions related to renovations, construction or other restrictions. See “Description of
the Mortgage Pool—Mortgage Pool Characteristics—Property Type Concentrations” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Risks Relating to Affiliation
with a Franchise or Hotel Management Company
 
Eleven (11) mortgaged properties identified
as “Hilton Suites Chicago Magnificent Mile”, “Hilton Atlanta Perimeter”, “Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio”,
“Residence Inn - Clifton Park”, “Best Western – Leesburg, VA”, “Comfort Inn – Staunton,
VA”, “La Quinta Inn & Suites – Angleton, TX”, “Comfort Inn – Woodstock, VA” and “Red
Roof Inn & Suites – Savannah GA” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing nine (9) mortgage
loans representing approximately 14.9% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date,
are affiliated with a franchise, licensing or hotel management company through a franchise, membership or management agreement.
See “Risk Factors—Commercial and Multifamily Mortgage Loans Have Risks That May Affect Payments on Your Certificates”
in the prospectus.
 
The continuation of a franchise agreement,
licensing agreement, membership agreement or management agreement is typically subject to specified operating standards, property
improvement plans, and other terms and conditions set forth in such agreements. The failure of a borrower to maintain such standards
or adhere to other applicable terms and conditions could result in the loss or cancellation of their rights under the franchise
agreement, licensing agreement, membership agreement or management agreement. In addition, some of these agreements applicable
to the hotel mortgaged properties expire, or grant the franchisor/licensor/member a termination right that is exercisable, during
the term of the related mortgage loan. We cannot assure you that a replacement franchise or license could be obtained in the event
of a termination. In addition, replacement franchises/licenses/memberships may require significantly higher fees as well as the
investment of capital to bring the hotel into compliance with the requirements of the replacement franchisor/licensor/member. Any
provision in a franchise agreement, licensing agreement, membership agreement or management agreement providing for termination
because of a bankruptcy of a franchisor or manager generally will not be enforceable.
 
The franchise agreements, license agreements,
membership agreements and the property management agreements generally restrict transfers of the subject agreement, transfers of
the ownership
 

S-76
 

 
interests of the related borrower and/or transfers of the subject hospitality mortgaged property, and generally (a) contain
certain approval rights regarding the transferee and/or (b) prohibit certain transfers for various reasons, including, without
limitation, that (i) the transferee does not have sufficient financial resources to fulfill the owner’s obligations
under the franchise agreement, licensing agreement, membership agreement or management agreement, as applicable, (ii) the
transferee is among a group of specifically designated prohibited transferees and/or (iii) the transferee is a competitor
(as defined in the franchise agreement, licensing agreement, membership agreement or management agreement). Such restrictions may
impact a foreclosure sale or a sale of an REO property. In the event of a foreclosure, the lender may not have the right to use
the franchise license without the franchisor’s consent or the manager might be able to terminate the management agreement.
Conversely, in the case of certain mortgage loans, the lender may be unable to remove a franchisor/licensor or a hotel management
company that it desires to replace following a foreclosure and, further, may be limited as regards the pool of potential transferees
for a foreclosure or real estate owned property.
 
In some cases where a hospitality property
is subject to a license or franchise agreement, the licensor or franchisor has required the completion of various repairs and/or
renovations pursuant to a property improvement plan issued by the franchisor. Failure to complete those repairs and/or renovations
in accordance with the plan could result in the hospitality property losing its license or franchise. Annex A-1 and the related
footnotes set forth the amount of reserves, if any, established under the related mortgage loans in connection with any of those
repairs and/or renovations. We cannot assure you that any amounts reserved will be sufficient to complete the repairs and/or renovations
required with respect to any affected hospitality property. In addition, in some cases, those reserves will be maintained by the
franchisor or property manager. Furthermore, the lender may not require a reserve for repairs and/or renovations in all instances.
 
In addition, there may be risks associated
with hospitality properties that have not entered into or become a party to any franchise agreement, license agreement, membership
agreement or other “flag”. Hospitality properties often enter into these types of agreements in order to align the
hospitality property with a certain public perception or to benefit from a centralized reservation system. We cannot assure you
that hospitality properties that lack such benefits will be able to operate successfully on an independent basis. See “Description
of Top Ten Mortgage Loans and Additional Mortgage Loan Information” in Annex A-3 to this free writing prospectus.

Have Special Risks” above and “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Mortgage Pool Characteristics—Property
Type Concentrations” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Mixed Use Facilities Have
Special Risks
 
Four (4) of the mortgaged properties, securing
four (4) mortgage loans representing approximately 6.7% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of
the cut-off date, are mixed use properties. The value of mixed use facilities with retail components is significantly affected
by the quality of the tenants as well as fundamental aspects of real estate, such as location and market demographics. The correlation
between success of tenant businesses and a retail property’s value may be more direct with respect to retail properties than
other types of commercial property because a component of the total rent paid by certain retail tenants is often tied to a percentage
of gross sales.
 
The mixed use mortgaged properties consist
of parking garage, retail, office and/or industrial components, and as such, the mortgage loans secured by the mixed use mortgaged
properties will share risks associated with such underlying components. In addition, a mixed use property may be managed by a manager
that is not experienced in managing all of the property types comprising the mortgaged property.

Special Risks”, “—Retail Properties Have Special Risks”, “—Industrial Properties
Have Special Risks” and “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Mortgage Pool Characteristics—Property
Type Concentrations” in this free writing prospectus.
 

S-77
 

 
Self Storage Properties Have
Special Risks
 
One hundred and ten (110) of the mortgaged
properties, securing four (4) mortgage loans representing approximately 6.7% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of
mortgage loans as of the cut-off date by allocated loan amount, are self storage properties.
 
The self storage facilities market contains
low barriers to entry. In addition, due to the short-term nature of self storage leases, self storage properties also may be subject
to more volatility in terms of supply and demand than loans secured by other types of properties.
 
Because of the construction utilized in
connection with certain self storage facilities, it might be difficult or costly to convert such a facility to an alternative use.
Thus the liquidation value of self storage properties may be substantially less than would be the case if the same were readily
adaptable to other uses.
 
In addition, it is difficult to assess the
environmental risks posed by self storage facilities due to tenant privacy, anonymity and unsupervised access to these facilities.
Therefore, these types of facilities may pose additional environmental risks to investors. The environmental site assessments discussed
in this free writing prospectus did not include an inspection of the contents of the self storage units included in the self storage
properties. We therefore cannot provide assurance that all of the units included in the self storage properties are free from hazardous
materials, or that they will remain so in the future.
 
See “Description of the Mortgage
Pool—Mortgage Pool Characteristics—Property Type Concentrations” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Industrial Properties Have
Special Risks
 
Three (3) of the mortgaged properties, securing
three (3) mortgage loans representing approximately 2.6% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of
the cut-off date, are industrial properties. Significant factors determining the value of industrial properties are:
 

·the quality of tenants;
 

·reduced demand for industrial space because of a decline in a particular industry segment;
 

·the property becoming functionally obsolete;
 

·building design and adaptability;
 

·unavailability of labor sources;
 

·changes in access, energy prices, strikes, relocation of highways, the construction of additional highways or other factors;
 

·changes in proximity of supply sources;
 

·the expenses of converting a previously adapted space to general use; and
 

·the location of the property.
 
Concerns about the quality of tenants, particularly
major tenants, are similar in both office properties and industrial properties, although industrial properties may be more frequently
dependent on a single or a few tenants.
 
Industrial properties may be adversely affected
by reduced demand for industrial space occasioned by a decline in a particular industry segment (for example, a decline in defense
spending), and a particular industrial or warehouse property that suited the needs of its original tenant may be difficult to
 

S-78
 

 
relet
to another tenant or may become functionally obsolete relative to newer properties. In addition, lease terms with respect to industrial
properties are generally for shorter periods of time and may result in a substantial percentage of leases expiring in the same
year at any particular industrial property. In addition, mortgaged properties used for many industrial purposes are more prone
to environmental concerns than other property types.
 
Aspects of building site design and adaptability
affect the value of an industrial property. Site characteristics that are generally desirable for a warehouse/industrial property
include high clear ceiling heights, wide column spacing, a large number of bays (loading docks) and large bay depths, divisibility,
a layout that can accommodate large truck minimum turning radii and overall functionality and accessibility.
 
In addition, because of unique construction
requirements of many industrial properties, any vacant industrial property space may not be easily converted to other uses. Thus,
if the operation of any of the industrial properties becomes unprofitable due to competition, age of the improvements or other
factors such that the borrower becomes unable to meet its obligations on the related mortgage loan, the liquidation value of that
industrial property may be substantially less, relative to the amount owing on the related mortgage loan, than would be the case
if the industrial property were readily adaptable to other uses.
 
Location is also important because an industrial
property requires the availability of labor sources, proximity to supply sources and customers and accessibility to rail lines,
major roadways and other distribution channels.
 
See “Description of the Mortgage
Pool—Mortgage Pool Characteristics—Property Type Concentrations” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Manufactured Housing Community
Properties Have Special Risks
 
Two (2) of the mortgaged properties, securing
two (2) mortgage loans representing approximately 1.1% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the
cut-off date, are manufactured housing community properties.
 
Commercial mortgage loans secured by liens
on manufactured housing community properties pose risks not associated with commercial mortgage loans secured by liens on other
types of income-producing real estate. The successful operation of a manufactured housing community property may depend upon the
number of other competing residential developments in the local market, such as:
 

·other manufactured housing community properties;
 

·apartment buildings; and
 

·site-built single family homes.
 
Other factors affecting the successful operation
of a manufactured housing community property may also include:
 

·the physical attributes of the community, including its age and appearance;
 

·location of the manufactured housing community property, including the seasonal effect upon occupancy, particularly with respect
to seasonal sites occupied by recreational vehicles and travel-trailers, which often have short term rental contracts;
 

·the percentage of owner-occupied homes versus rental homes;
 

·any restrictions on the age of tenants who may reside at the property;
 

·the ability of management to provide adequate maintenance and insurance;
 

S-79
 

 

·the types of services or amenities provided;
 

·the property’s reputation; and
 

·state and local regulations, including rent control and rent stabilization as well as tenant association rights.
 
In general, a manufactured housing community
property is a “single-purpose” property that could not be readily converted to general residential, retail or office
use. Thus, if the operation of the manufactured housing community property becomes unprofitable due to competition, age of the
improvements or other factors such that the borrower becomes unable to meet its obligations on the mortgage loan, the liquidation
value of that manufactured housing community property may be substantially less, relative to the amount owing on the mortgage loan,
than would be the case if the manufactured housing community property were readily adaptable to other uses.
 
Some of the manufactured housing community
mortgaged properties securing mortgage loans in the issuing entity:
 

·may be subject to rent control and other laws regulating the relationship between a property owner and its residential tenants;
 

·may not be connected to public water and sewer systems;
 

·have tenants that may not have leases or have short term or month-to-month leases and, accordingly, that are not obligated
to remain at such mortgaged property for any extended period;
 

·are located, in whole or in part, in a flood zone that requires the related borrower to maintain flood insurance if it owns
any material structures located in a flood zone; or
 

·may be deemed legally nonconforming for zoning purposes as to the underlying manufactured housing community use.
 
Certain manufactured housing community properties
securing mortgage loans in the issuing entity are, in whole or in part, age-restricted to individuals that, in general, are 55
years of age or older. Such restrictions limit the potential residents of the related mortgaged properties and may affect property
performance.
 
In the case of manufactured housing community
mortgaged properties that are not connected to public water and sewer systems, the borrower could incur a substantial expense in
connection with either the repair, maintenance or replacement of the existing system or the required connection to such public
systems in the future. In addition, the use of well water and/or septic systems or private sewage treatment facilities enhances
the likelihood that the property could be adversely affected by a recognized environmental condition that impacts soil and groundwater.
 
In the case of manufactured housing community
mortgaged properties that are located, in whole or in part, in a flood zone, flood insurance may not be available and, even if
there are no material borrower-owned structures located in that flood zone, the potential for flooding may be a deterrent to tenants.
See also representation number 18 in Annex D-1 and the identified exceptions to that representation in Annex D-2
to this free writing prospectus.
 
In the case of manufactured housing community
mortgaged properties for which the current use or building conformation is deemed legally nonconforming for zoning purposes, limitations
on rebuilding following a casualty can have significant and adverse economic effect on the related mortgaged property. First, zoning
ordinances frequently establish a damage threshold beyond which the current use or conformation has to conform to current requirements.
Where the units themselves are included in the calculation of the damage threshold (as opposed to the calculation being based solely
on the underlying pads), or where the units themselves are separately subject to the damage threshold, it is more probable
 

S-80
 

 
that
the damage threshold will be exceeded by manufactured housing community mortgaged properties than for other types of mortgaged
properties under comparable circumstances (and property value may be impaired by restrictions on replacing the units). Second,
even where proceeds from casualty insurance, including law and ordinance coverage, are available, the value of insured improvements
is generally much less than the loan amount. We cannot assure you that, if a casualty results in the manufactured housing community
uses or other zoning characteristics, such as setbacks, no longer being permitted by the applicable zoning regulations, the lender
will be able to recognize sufficient proceeds from the exercise of foreclosure or equivalent remedies or available insurance to
avoid losses on the manufactured housing community mortgage loan. See “—Zoning Compliance, Use Restrictions and
Condemnation May Adversely Affect Property Value” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Depending on the location of a manufactured
housing community property, occupancy and collections may be highly seasonal. For example, a manufactured housing community in
a warm weather state might earn most of its income from late fall to early spring.
 
Some of the manufactured housing community
mortgaged properties securing the mortgage loans in the issuing entity may have a material number of leased homes that are owned
(currently or in the future) by the related borrower or an affiliate of the related borrower and rented by the respective tenants,
like apartments. In circumstances where the leased homes are owned by an affiliate of the borrower, the related pads may, in some
cases, be subject to a master lease with that affiliate. In such cases, the tenants will tend to be more transient and less tied
to the property than if they owned their own home. Such leased homes may, in certain cases, constitute collateral for the related
mortgage loan. The borrower or an affiliate of the related borrower may acquire, own, lease, sell and/or finance the ownership
of homes at a manufactured housing community mortgaged property.
 
See “Description of the Mortgage
Pool—Mortgage Pool Characteristics—Property Type Concentrations” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Risks of Lease Early Termination
Options
 
Retail leases often give tenants the right
to terminate the related lease or abate or reduce the related rent at the applicable mortgaged property (i) if the borrower allows
uses at the mortgaged property in violation of use restrictions in current tenant leases, (ii) if the borrower or a prior
owner of the mortgaged property or any of their respective affiliates owns other properties within a certain radius of the mortgaged
property and allows uses at those properties in violation of use restrictions, (iii) if the related borrower fails to provide
a designated number of parking spaces or otherwise fails to comply with particular parking agreements, (iv) if there is construction
at the related mortgaged property or an adjacent property (whether or not such adjacent property is owned or controlled by the
borrower or any of its affiliates) that may interfere with visibility or a tenant’s use of, or access to, the mortgaged property,
(v) upon casualty or condemnation with respect to all or a portion of the mortgaged property that renders such mortgaged property
unsuitable for a tenant’s use or if the borrower fails to rebuild such mortgaged property within a certain time or if the
casualty or condemnation occurs near the end of the lease, (vi) if a tenant’s use is not permitted by zoning or applicable
law, (vii) if a tenant is not permitted to exercise expansion rights at the mortgaged property, (viii) if the landlord
fails to undertake various property renovations or improvement, (ix) if a tenant fails to meet certain sales criteria, or
(x) if the landlord defaults on its obligations under the lease. In each identified instance the borrower may have interests
adverse to the mortgagee, and we cannot assure you that the borrower will not violate those restrictions if it feels that such
violation may otherwise benefit it or its affiliates to do so, even where such action is to the detriment of the mortgaged property.
 
In addition, it is common for other tenants
at anchored or shadow-anchored retail centers to have the right to terminate their lease or abate or reduce rent if an anchor or
shadow anchor tenant goes dark or for anchor tenants to have such rights if other anchor tenants or shadow anchor tenants go dark.
Even if other tenants do not have termination or rent abatement rights, because an anchor or shadow anchor tenant plays a key role
in generating customer traffic and making a center desirable for other tenants, we cannot assure you that any loss of an anchor
tenant or shadow anchor tenant will not have a material
 

S-81
 

 
adverse impact on the non-anchor tenants’ ability to operate, which
may in turn adversely impact the borrower’s ability to meet its obligations under the related mortgage loan documents. If
an anchor tenant or shadow anchor tenant goes dark, generally the borrower’s only remedy is to terminate that lease after
the anchor tenant or shadow anchor tenant has been dark for a specified amount of time.
 
In addition, certain of the tenant leases
for the mortgaged properties permit the related tenant to terminate its lease and/or abate or reduce rent if the tenant fails to
meet certain sales targets or other business objectives for a specified period of time. We cannot assure you that all or any of
these tenants will meet the sales targets or business objectives required to avoid the exercise of any termination and/or abatement
rights.
 
In addition, certain of the tenant leases
for the mortgaged properties permit the affected tenants to terminate their leases and/or abate or reduce rent if a certain number
of anchor tenants, shadow anchors or particular significant tenants, and/or a percentage of the tenants, cease to operate, or a
certain percentage of the space at the property becomes vacant, at the applicable mortgaged property. Further, certain of the tenant
leases for the other mortgaged properties may permit affected tenants to terminate their leases or reduce their rent if a tenant
at an adjacent or nearby property terminates its lease or goes dark.
 
In addition to termination options tied
to certain triggers described above that are common with respect to retail properties, certain tenant leases of other property
types permit the related tenant to unilaterally terminate its lease or contract for its leased space without the occurrence of
any trigger. Generally, any tenants that hold termination options are required to provide advance notice and in some instances
pay a termination fee to the related borrowers. We cannot assure you that tenants at any of the mortgaged properties will not exercise
any such early termination and contraction rights, or will honor their obligations to pay a termination fee, and we cannot assure
you that the absence or reduced presence of any such tenants at the related mortgaged properties will not have a material adverse
impact on the related mortgaged properties. See “Description of Top Ten Mortgage Loans and Additional Mortgage Loan Information”
in Annex A-3 to this free writing prospectus for additional descriptions of lease termination rights or rights to reduce space
for certain tenants with respect to the applicable mortgage loans. In addition, see Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus
and the footnotes thereto for additional information on any tenant’s rights applicable to the top five tenants at the mortgaged
properties and “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Mortgaged Property Considerations—Tenant Issues—Terminations”,
“—Expirations” and “—Additional Considerations” in this free writing prospectus
for further information on the mortgage loans included in the trust.
 
Geographic Concentration
Entails Risks
 
Mortgaged properties located in Illinois,
Pennsylvania, Michigan, Texas, California, Florida and New Jersey, partially secure approximately 21.5%, 12.4%, 8.9%, 8.9%, 8.5%,
7.4% and 5.0%, respectively, of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date by allocated
loan amount and collectively secure approximately 72.6% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of
the cut-off date by allocated loan amount.
 
The remaining mortgaged properties are located
throughout thirty-four (34) other states and one (1) province in Canada, with no more than 3.9% of the aggregate principal balance
of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date by allocated loan amount secured by mortgaged properties located in any such
jurisdiction.
 
Repayments by borrowers and the market value
of the related mortgaged properties could be affected by economic conditions generally or specific to geographic areas or the regions
of the United States, and concentrations of mortgaged properties in particular geographic areas may increase the risk that adverse
economic or other developments or natural disasters affecting a particular region of the country could increase the frequency and
severity of losses on mortgage loans secured by those properties. In recent periods, several regions of the United States have
experienced significant real estate downturns. Regional economic declines or conditions in regional real estate markets could adversely
affect the income from, and market value of, the mortgaged properties. In addition, local or regional
 

S-82
 

 
economies may be adversely
affected to a greater degree than other areas of the country by developments affecting industries concentrated in such area. A
decline in the general economic condition in the region in which mortgaged properties securing the related mortgage loans are located
would result in a decrease in consumer demand in the region and the income from and market value of the mortgaged properties may
be adversely affected.
 
Several mortgaged properties are located
in areas that, based on low population density, poor economic demographics (such as higher than average unemployment rates, lower
than average annual household income and/or overall loss of jobs) and/or negative trends in such regards, would be considered secondary
or tertiary markets. Mortgage loans secured by mortgaged properties in these secondary or tertiary markets may be more susceptible
to the impacts of risks disclosed in this free writing prospectus.
 
Other regional factors—e.g.,
earthquakes, floods, forest fires or hurricanes or changes in governmental rules or fiscal policies—also may adversely
affect the mortgaged properties. Mortgaged properties in certain regional areas are more susceptible to certain hazards (such as
earthquakes, mudslides, wildfires, hurricanes or floods) than properties in other parts of the country and properties located in
coastal states or territories are generally more susceptible to hurricanes than properties in other parts of the country. As a
result, areas affected by such events often experience disruptions in travel, transportation and tourism, loss of jobs and an overall
decrease in consumer activity, and often a decline in real estate-related investments. We cannot assure you that the economies
in such impacted areas will recover sufficiently to support income producing real estate at pre-event levels or that the costs
of the related clean-up will not have a material adverse effect on the local or national economy. Furthermore, the mortgage loans
do not all require flood insurance on the related mortgaged property unless they have material improvements that are in flood zones
and flood insurance is available. We cannot assure you that any hurricane damage would be covered by insurance. See “Servicing
of the Mortgage Loans—Maintenance of Insurance” and “Certain
Legal Aspects of the Mortgage Loans” in this free writing prospectus and “Description of the Pooling
Agreements—Hazard Insurance Policies” in the prospectus.
 
In addition, certain cities, states or regions
of the country are currently facing or may face a depressed real estate market, which is not due to any natural disaster, but which
may cause an overall decline in property values. Certain of the mortgaged properties are located in such cities, states and regions
of the country.
 
See “Description of the Mortgage
Pool—Mortgage Pool Characteristics—Property Type Concentrations” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Risks Relating to Mortgage
Loan Concentrations and Borrower-Sponsor Concentrations
 
The effect of mortgage pool loan losses
will be more severe if the losses relate to mortgage loans that account for a disproportionately large percentage of the pool’s
aggregate principal balance. In this regard:
 

·The largest mortgage loan represents approximately 6.7% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as
of the cut-off date.
 

·The three (3) largest mortgage loans represent, in the aggregate, approximately 18.7% of the aggregate principal balance of
the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date.
 

·The ten (10) largest mortgage loans represent, in the aggregate, approximately 44.0% of the aggregate principal balance of
the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date.
 
See “Description
of the Mortgage Pool—Mortgage Pool Characteristics—Mortgage
Loan Concentrations” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Each of the other mortgage loans represents
no more than approximately 2.6% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date.
 

S-83
 
 
A
concentration of mortgaged property types can pose increased risks. A concentration of mortgage loans secured by the same types
of mortgaged property can increase the risk that a decline in a particular industry or business would have a disproportionately
large impact on the pool of mortgage loans. In that regard, the following table lists the property type concentrations in excess
of 5.0% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date:

(1)Because
  this table presents information relating to mortgaged properties and not mortgage loans,
  the information for mortgage loans secured by more than one mortgaged property is based
  on allocated loan amounts as set forth in Annex A-1.
 
A
concentration of mortgaged property types can pose increased risks. A concentration of mortgage loans secured by the same types
of mortgaged property can increase the risk that a decline in a particular industry or business would have a disproportionately
large impact on the pool of mortgage loans. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Mortgage Pool Characteristics—Property
Type Concentrations” in this free writing prospectus for information related to property type concentrations.
 
Certain
of the mortgage loans have borrowers that are related to each other. Mortgage loans with related borrowers are identified under
“Related Borrower” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus.
 
A
concentration of mortgage loans with the same borrower or related borrowers can also pose increased risks. Any adverse circumstances
relating to a borrower or an affiliate of the borrower and affecting one of the related mortgage loans or mortgaged properties
could also affect other mortgage loans or mortgaged properties of the related borrower. For example, if a borrower that owns or
controls several properties (whether or not all of them secure mortgage loans in the pool) experiences financial difficulty at
one property, it could defer maintenance at a mortgaged property in order to satisfy current expenses with respect to the other
properties, or they could attempt to avert a foreclosure by filing a bankruptcy petition that might have the effect of interrupting
payments for an indefinite period on all of the related mortgage loans. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Mortgage
Pool Characteristics—Cross-Collateralized Mortgage Loans; Multi-Property Mortgage Loans and Related Borrower Mortgage Loans”
in this free writing prospectus.
 
In
addition, it is possible that some or all of the properties owned or controlled by a borrower or related borrower will be managed
by the same property manager (whether or not all of the properties secure mortgage loans in the pool). A concentration of mortgaged
properties with a common property manager may result in a conflict of interest in that the property manager may have interests
in other competing properties that may be adverse to the mortgaged properties in the pool.
 
Mortgaged
properties owned by related borrowers are likely to:
 

•have
  common management, increasing the risk that financial or other difficulties experienced
  by the property manager could have a greater impact on the pool of mortgage loans; and
 

•have
  common general partners or managing members, which could increase the risk that a financial
  failure or bankruptcy filing would have a greater impact on the pool of mortgage loans.
 
Mortgage
loans involving more than one borrower could be challenged as fraudulent conveyances by creditors of the respective borrowers
in an action brought outside a bankruptcy case or, if a borrower were to become a debtor in a bankruptcy case, by a borrower’s
representative. See “Certain Legal
 

S-84
 
 
 Aspects of Mortgage Loans—Bankruptcy Laws” in the prospectus. This
is particularly the case where multiple borrowers with respect to a mortgage loan have differing ownership structures. Having
different ownership structures poses a greater risk that borrowers who own different properties securing one loan did not receive
fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value when they allowed their respective mortgaged properties to be encumbered by
a lien securing the entire indebtedness, and that the lien is an avoidable fraudulent conveyance.
 
A
lien granted by a borrower could be avoided if a court were to determine that (i) the borrower was insolvent when it granted
the lien, was rendered insolvent by the granting of the lien, was left with inadequate capital when it allowed its mortgaged property
or properties to be encumbered by a lien securing the entire indebtedness, or was not able to pay its debts as they matured when
it granted the lien; and (ii) the borrower did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value when it allowed
its mortgaged property or properties to be encumbered by a lien securing the entire indebtedness. Among other things, a legal
challenge to the granting of the liens may focus on the benefits realized by that borrower from the respective mortgage loan proceeds,
as well as the overall cross-collateralization. If a court were to conclude that the granting of the liens was an avoidable fraudulent
conveyance, that court could: (i) subordinate all or part of the pertinent mortgage loan to existing or future indebtedness
of that borrower; (ii) recover payments made under that mortgage loan; or (iii) take other actions detrimental to the
holders of the certificates, including, under certain circumstances, invalidating the mortgage loan or the mortgages securing
the cross-collateralization.

Mortgage Loans and Related Borrower Mortgage Loans” in this free writing prospectus for information relating to mortgage
loans secured by multiple mortgaged properties and mortgage loans with related borrowers.
 
The
Borrower’s Form of Entity May Cause Special Risks
 
The
borrowers are legal entities rather than individuals. Mortgage loans made to legal entities may entail risks of loss greater than
those of mortgage loans made to individuals. For example, a legal entity, as opposed to an individual, may be more inclined to
seek legal protection from its creditors under the bankruptcy laws. Unlike individuals involved in bankruptcies, most of the entities
generally, but not in all cases, do not have personal assets and creditworthiness at stake aside from their interest in the properties.
The terms of the mortgage loans generally, but not in all cases, require that the borrowers covenant to be single-purpose entities,
although in many cases the borrowers are not required to observe all covenants and conditions that typically are required in order
for them to be viewed under standard rating agency criteria as “single-purpose entities”. In general, but not in all
cases, borrowers’ organizational documents or the terms of the mortgage loans limit their activities to the ownership of
only the related mortgaged property or properties, and related ancillary activities, and limit the borrowers’ ability to
incur additional indebtedness or create or allow any encumbrance on the mortgaged properties to secure additional indebtedness
or obligations of other entities. These provisions are designed to mitigate the possibility that the borrowers’ financial
condition would be adversely impacted by factors unrelated to the mortgaged property and the mortgage loan in the pool. However,
we cannot assure you that the related borrowers will comply with these requirements. See “Certain Legal Aspects of Mortgage
Loans—Bankruptcy Laws” in the prospectus. Also, although a borrower may currently be a single purpose entity,
in certain cases, that borrower was not originally a single-purpose entity, but at origination of the related mortgage loan its
organizational documents were amended. That borrower may also have previously owned property other than the related mortgaged
property or be a “recycled” single-purpose vehicle that previously had other liabilities. See representation number 33
in Annex D-1 and the identified exceptions to that representation in Annex D-2 to this free writing prospectus. In addition,
that borrower may not have observed all covenants that typically are required to consider a borrower a “single purpose entity”.
The bankruptcy of a borrower, or a general partner or managing member of a borrower, may impair the ability of the lender to enforce
its rights and remedies under the related mortgage. Borrowers that are not single-purpose entities structured to limit the possibility
of becoming insolvent or bankrupt, may be more likely to become insolvent or the subject of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy
proceeding because the borrowers may be:
 

S-85
 
 


•operating
  entities with a business distinct from the operation of the mortgaged property with the
  associated liabilities and risks of operating an ongoing business; or
 

•entities
  or individuals that have personal liabilities unrelated to the mortgaged property.
 
However,
any borrower, even a single-purpose entity structured to be bankruptcy-remote, as an owner of real estate will be subject to certain
potential liabilities and risks. We cannot assure you that any borrower will not file for bankruptcy protection or that creditors
of a borrower or a corporate or individual general partner or managing member of a borrower will not initiate a bankruptcy or
similar proceeding against the borrower or corporate or individual general partner or managing member.
 
Certain
borrowers’ organizational documents or the terms of certain mortgage loans permit an affiliated property manager to maintain
a custodial account on behalf of such borrower and certain affiliates of such borrower into which funds available to such borrower
under the terms of the related mortgage loans and funds of such affiliates are held, but which funds are and will continue to
be separately accounted for as to each item of income and expense for each related mortgaged property and each related borrower.
A custodial account structure for affiliated entities, while common among certain REITs, institutions or independent owners of
multiple properties, presents a risk for consolidation of the assets of such affiliates as commingling of funds is a factor a
court may consider in considering a request by other creditors for substantive consolidation. Substantive consolidation is an
equitable remedy that could result in an otherwise solvent company becoming subject to the bankruptcy proceedings of an insolvent
affiliate, making its assets available to repay the debts of affiliated companies. A court has the discretion to order substantive
consolidation in whole or in part and may include non-debtor affiliates of the bankrupt entity in the proceedings. In particular,
consolidation may be ordered when corporate funds are commingled and used for a principal’s personal purposes, inadequate
records of transfers are made and corporate entities are deemed an alter ego of a principal. Strict adherence to maintaining separate
books and records, avoiding commingling of assets and otherwise maintaining corporate policies designed to preserve the separateness
of corporate assets and liabilities make it less likely that a court would order substantive consolidation, but we cannot assure
you that the related borrowers, property managers or affiliates will comply with these requirements as set forth in the related
mortgage loans.
 
Furthermore,
with respect to any affiliated borrowers, creditors of a common parent in bankruptcy may seek to consolidate the assets of such
borrowers with those of the parent. In addition, where a mortgage loan includes provisions imposing recourse liability on an affiliate
or sponsor there is greater risk of consolidation. In such event, consolidation of the assets of such borrowers would likely have
an adverse effect on the funds available to make distributions on your certificates, and may lead to a downgrade, withdrawal or
qualification of the ratings of your certificates.
 
The
organizational documents of a borrower (generally, but not in all cases, under a mortgage loan that has an original principal
balance in excess of $20,000,000) may also contain requirements that there be one or two independent directors, managers or trustees
(depending on the entity form of such borrower) whose vote is required before the borrower files a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency
petition or otherwise institutes insolvency proceedings. Generally, but not always, the independent directors, managers or trustees
may only be replaced by certain other independent successors. Although the requirement of having independent directors, managers
or trustees is designed to mitigate the risk of a voluntary bankruptcy filing by a solvent borrower, a borrower could file for
bankruptcy without obtaining the consent of its independent directors, managers or trustees (and we cannot assure you that such
bankruptcy would be dismissed as an unauthorized filing), and in any case the independent directors, managers or trustees may
determine in the exercise of their fiduciary duties to the applicable borrower that a bankruptcy filing is an appropriate course
of action to be taken by such borrower. Such determination might take into account the interests and financial condition of such
borrower’s parent entities and such parent entities’ other subsidiaries in addition to those of the borrower, such
that the financial distress of an affiliate of a borrower might increase the likelihood of a bankruptcy filing by a borrower.
In any event, we cannot assure you that a borrower will not file for bankruptcy protection, that creditors of a borrower will
not initiate a bankruptcy or similar proceeding against such borrower, or that, if initiated, a bankruptcy case of the borrower
could be dismissed.
 


S-86
 
 
For
example, in the bankruptcy case of In re General Growth Properties, Inc., notwithstanding that the subsidiaries were special
purpose entities with independent directors, numerous property-level, special purpose subsidiaries were filed for bankruptcy protection
by their parent entity. Nonetheless, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York denied various lenders’
motions to dismiss the special purpose entity subsidiaries’ cases as bad faith filings. In denying the motions, the bankruptcy
court stated that the fundamental and bargained-for creditor protections embedded in the special purpose entity structures at
the property level would remain in place during the pendency of the chapter 11 cases. Those protections included adequate protection
of the lenders’ interest in their collateral and protection against the substantive consolidation of the property-level
debtors with any other entities. The moving lenders had argued that the 20 property-level bankruptcy filings were premature and
improperly sought to restructure the debt of solvent entities for the benefit of equity holders. However, the bankruptcy code
does not require that a voluntary debtor be insolvent or unable to pay its debts currently in order to be eligible for relief
and generally a bankruptcy petition will not be dismissed for bad faith if the debtor has a legitimate rehabilitation objective.
Accordingly, after finding that the relevant debtors were experiencing varying degrees of financial distress due to factors such
as cross-defaults, a need to refinance in the near term (i.e., within 1 to 4 years), and other considerations, the bankruptcy
court noted that it was not required to analyze in isolation each debtor’s basis for filing. In the court’s view,
the critical issue was whether a parent company that had filed its bankruptcy case in good faith could include in the filing subsidiaries
that were crucial to the parent’s reorganization.
 
As
demonstrated in the In re General Growth Properties, Inc. bankruptcy case, although special purpose entities are designed
to mitigate the bankruptcy risk of a borrower, special purpose entities can become debtors in bankruptcy under various circumstances.
Unless a mortgage loan had an original principal balance in excess of $20 million, it is unlikely that the originator obtained
a non-consolidation opinion with respect to the related borrower. Additionally in certain circumstances where the related mortgage
loan had an original principal balance in excess of $20 million, no non-consolidation opinion was obtained with respect to the
related borrower at origination. See representation number 33 in Annex D-1 and the identified exceptions to that representation
in Annex D-2 to this free writing prospectus and see “Risk Factors—The Borrower’s Form of Entity May
Cause Special Risks” in the prospectus.
 
In
addition, certain of the mortgage loans may be secured by a mortgaged property owned by a Delaware statutory trust (or its signatory
trustee if required by local law) or by a borrower that has the ability to convert to a Delaware statutory trust (including two
(2) mortgaged properties identified as “Behringer Tractor Supply Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus,
securing one (1) mortgage loan representing approximately 0.3% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans
as of the cut-off date). Delaware statutory trusts are restricted in their ability to actively operate a property, including with
respect to loan workouts, leasing and re-leasing, making material improvements and other material actions affecting the related
mortgaged property. In addition, in the case of a mortgaged property that is owned by a Delaware statutory trust, certain decisions
may require the consent of the holders of the beneficial interests in the Delaware statutory trust and, in such event, there is
a risk that obtaining such consent will be time consuming and cause delays in the event certain actions need to be taken by or
on behalf of the borrower or with respect to the mortgaged property. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool”
in this free writing prospectus.
 
Tenancies-in-Common
May Hinder Recovery
 
Three (3)
mortgaged properties identified as “Freeway Crossing” and “CVS Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free
writing prospectus, securing two (2) mortgage loans representing approximately 1.0% of the aggregate principal balance of the
pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date, have one or more borrowers that own at least a portion of the related mortgaged
properties as tenants-in-common. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Mortgage Pool Characteristics—Tenancies-in-Common”
in this free writing prospectus for additional information on certain of the mortgage loans.
 
In
general, with respect to a tenant-in-common ownership structure, each tenant-in-common owns an undivided share in the property
and if such tenant-in-common desires to sell its interest in the property (and is unable to find a buyer or otherwise needs to
force a partition), the tenant-in-common has the 
 

S-87
 
 
ability to request that a court order a sale of the property and distribute the
proceeds to each tenant-in-common proportionally. As a result, if a tenant-in-common borrower or owner exercises its right of
partition, the related mortgage loan may be subject to prepayment. In addition, the tenant-in-common structure may cause delays
in the enforcement of remedies because each time a tenant-in-common borrower or owners file for bankruptcy, the bankruptcy court
stay will be reinstated. In each case, each related tenant-in-common borrower or owner has waived its right to partition, reducing
the risk of partition. However, we cannot assure you that, if challenged, this waiver would be enforceable. In addition, in some
cases, the related mortgage loan documents provide for full recourse or personal liability for losses as to the related tenants-in-common
and the guarantor or for the occurrence of an event of default under such mortgage loan documents if a tenant-in-common files
for partition. In some cases, a related tenant-in-common borrower or owner is a special purpose entity (in some cases bankruptcy
remote), reducing the risk of bankruptcy. We cannot assure you that a bankruptcy proceeding by a single tenant-in-common borrower
or owner will not delay enforcement of the related mortgage loan. Additionally, in some cases, subject to the terms of the related
mortgage loan documents, a borrower or a tenant-in-common borrower may assign its interests to one or more tenant-in-common borrowers.
Such change to, or increase in, the number of tenant-in-common borrowers increases the risks related to this ownership structure.
See “—The Borrower’s Form of Entity May Cause Special Risks” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Additional
Debt or the Ability To Incur Other Borrowings Entails Risk
 
When
a borrower (or its constituent members) also has one or more other outstanding loans (even if they are subordinate or mezzanine
loans), the trust is subjected to additional risk. See “Risk Factors—Ability to Incur Other Borrowings Entails
Risk” in the prospectus.
 
Seven
(7) mortgage loans identified as “Civic Opera Building”, “First National Building”, “One Shell Square”,
“Eastmont Town Center”, “Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio”, “Brunswick Portfolio” and “New
Center One Building” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing approximately 6.5%, 3.5%, 3.1%, 2.5%, 2.2%,
1.7% and 1.7%, respectively, of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date, are each
part of a pari passu split loan structure (i.e., each such mortgage loan and the related pari passu companion loan(s) are all
secured by the same mortgage instrument(s) on the related mortgaged property or portfolio of mortgaged properties). In the case
of the Civic Opera Building whole loan, the note comprising the related pari passu companion loan is included in the JPMBB Commercial
Mortgage Trust 2015-C31 securitization. In the case of the One Shell Square whole loan, the note comprising the related pari passu
companion loan is included in the JPMBB Commercial Mortgage Trust 2015-C30 securitization. In the case of the Eastmont Town Center
whole loan, the note comprising the related pari passu companion loan is included in the Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2015-GC29
securitization. In the case of the Brunswick Portfolio whole loan, one of the two notes comprising the related pari passu companion
loan is included in the JPMBB Commercial Mortgage Trust 2015-C30 securitization and the second note comprising the related pari
passu companion loan is included in the JPMBB Commercial Mortgage Trust 2015-C31 securitization. In the case of the First National
Building whole loan, the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio whole loan and the New Center One Building whole loan, each related pari
passu companion loan is expected to be included in one or more future securitizations. In each instance, the related pari passu
companion loan is pari passu in right of payment with the related mortgage loan and will be allocated losses pari passu with the
related mortgage loan. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—The Whole Loans—The Civic Opera Building Whole
Loan”, “—The First National Building Whole Loan”, “—The One Shell Square Whole
Loan”, “—The Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan”, “—The Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio
Whole Loan”, “—The Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan” and “—The New Center One
Building Whole Loan” in this free writing prospectus.
 
One
(1) mortgage loan identified as “U-Haul Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing
approximately 4.3% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date, is part of a senior
and subordinate split loan structure that is secured by the same mortgage instruments on the related mortgaged properties. With
respect to the U-Haul Portfolio whole loan, the related mortgage loan is included in the trust, but neither the related pari
passu companion loans nor the related subordinate companion loan is included in the trust. In the case of the U-Haul Portfolio
whole loan, one of the related pari passu companion loans and the related subordinate
 

S-88
 
 
 companion loan are expected to be
included in a private CMBS securitization. The other pari passu companion loan is expected to be included in a different
future securitization.
 
The
holder of the subordinate companion loan related to the U-Haul Portfolio whole loan does not have any cure or purchase rights
under the related intercreditor agreement. However, the consent and consultation rights with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio whole
loan will be held by the directing certificateholder or controlling class representative for the private CMBS securitization that
is expected to govern the servicing and administration of such whole loan. Each U-Haul Portfolio pari passu companion loan
is pari passu in right of payment with the U-Haul Portfolio mortgage loan and will be allocated losses pari passu
with the U-Haul Portfolio mortgage loan following allocation of losses to the related subordinate companion loan (subject to the
terms of the related intercreditor agreement). The U-Haul Portfolio subordinate companion loan is generally subordinate in right
of payment to the U-Haul Portfolio mortgage loan and the U-Haul Portfolio pari passu companion loans, subject to the terms
of the related intercreditor agreement. Amounts received in respect of the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan, after payment of certain
fees and expenses will be allocated first as interest to each of the notes comprising the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan,
on a pro rata and pari passu basis with one another, in each case up to the accrued and unpaid interest on each
such note, and then as principal to each of the notes comprising the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan: (i) unless a U-Haul Portfolio
cross over period has occurred and is continuing (as described in “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Additional
Debt” and “—The Whole Loans—The U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan” in this free writing prospectus)
first to the U-Haul Portfolio mortgage loan and the related U-Haul Portfolio pari passu companion loan in the related
group of senior notes (on a pro rata and pari passu basis with one another), and then to the other U-Haul
Portfolio pari passu companion loans in the other group of senior notes (on a pro rata and pari passu basis
with one another), and then to the U-Haul Portfolio subordinate companion loan; and (ii) during the occurrence and continuance
of a U-Haul Portfolio cross over period, first to the U-Haul Portfolio mortgage loan and each related U-Haul Portfolio
pari passu companion loan (on a pro rata and pari passu basis with one another) and then to the U-Haul
Portfolio subordinate companion loan, in each case up to the outstanding principal balance of the related note. As such, while
the Subordinate Companion Loan is subordinate to the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan and the U-Haul Portfolio Pari Passu Companion
Loans, even in a circumstance where the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan is in default, certain amounts received in respect of the
U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan will be paid to the Subordinate Companion Loan while amounts are still outstanding on the U-Haul Portfolio
Mortgage Loan. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Additional Debt” and “—The Whole
Loans—The U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan” and “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Servicing of the U-Haul
Portfolio Mortgage Loan” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Although
no pari passu or subordinate companion loan is an asset of the trust, in each instance the related borrower is still
obligated to make interest and principal payments on or in respect of each related pari passu or subordinate companion
loan. Additionally, in the case of the pari passu companion loans, such obligations are not subordinate to the obligations
under the related mortgage loan, but rather are pari passu in right of entitlement with the related mortgage loan. As a
result of the foregoing, the trust is subject to additional risks, including:
 

•the
  risk that the necessary maintenance of the related mortgaged property could be deferred
  to allow the related borrower to pay the required debt service on each related companion
  loan and that the value of the mortgaged property may decline as a result; and
 

•the
  risk that it may be more difficult for the related borrower to refinance the related
  mortgage loan, or to sell the related mortgaged property for purposes of making any balloon
  payment on the entire balance of the applicable whole loan, upon the maturity of the
  related mortgage loan.

and “—The New Center One Building Whole Loan” in this free writing prospectus.
 

S-89
 
 
Additionally,
the terms of certain mortgage loans permit or require the borrowers to post letters of credit and/or surety bonds for the benefit
of the related mortgage loan, which may constitute a contingent reimbursement obligation of the related borrower or an affiliate.
The issuing bank or surety will not typically agree to subordination and standstill protection benefiting the mortgagee.
 
The
mortgage loan documents generally place certain restrictions on the transfer and/or pledging of general partnership and managing
member equity interests in a borrower such as specific percentage or control limitations. The terms of the mortgage loans generally
permit, subject to certain limitations, the transfer or pledge of limited partnership, non-managing member or other passive equity
interests in a borrower. Certain of the mortgage loans do not restrict the pledging of ownership interests in the related borrower,
but do restrict the transfer of ownership interests in the related borrower by imposing a specific percentage or control limitation
or requiring the consent of the mortgagee to any such transfer (which consent in certain instances would consist of the mortgagee
ascertaining that certain specific transfer conditions have been satisfied). Moreover, in general, mortgage loans with borrowers
that do not meet single-purpose entity criteria may not restrict in any way the incurrence by the relevant borrower of mezzanine
debt or other types of debt. See “—The Borrower’s Form of Entity May Cause Special Risks” in this
free writing prospectus.
 
Certain
of the mortgage loans will have mezzanine debt secured by pledges of direct or indirect ownership interests in the related borrower
in place on the closing date of this securitization transaction. In addition, certain of the mortgage loans permit future mezzanine
debt, secured by pledges of direct or indirect ownership interests in the borrower, to be incurred in the future subject to criteria
set forth in the mortgage loan documents. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Additional Debt—Mezzanine
Debt” and “—Existing Mezzanine Debt” in this free writing prospectus.
 
See
“Description of the Mortgage Pool—Additional Debt—Existing Mezzanine Debt”, “—Future
Mezzanine Debt” and “Certain Legal Aspects of the Mortgage Loans” in this free writing prospectus
for information related to mortgage loans with subordinate, mezzanine or other additional debt or that permit subordinate, mezzanine
or other additional debt in the future. In addition, see representation number 9 in Annex D-1 and the identified exceptions
to that representation in Annex D-2 to this free writing prospectus.
 
In
addition, borrowers under most of the mortgage loans are generally permitted to incur trade payables and equipment financing,
which may not be limited or may be significant, in order to operate the related mortgaged properties. Also, with respect to certain
mortgage loans the related borrower either has incurred or is permitted to incur unsecured debt from an affiliate of either the
borrower or the sponsor of the borrower. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Additional Debt—Unsecured
Debt” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Borrower
May Be Unable To Repay Remaining Principal Balance on Maturity Date or Anticipated Repayment Date; Longer Amortization Schedules
and Interest-Only Provisions Create Risks
 
Mortgage
loans with substantial remaining principal balances on their stated maturity date or anticipated repayment date, as applicable,
involve greater risk than fully amortizing loans. This is because the borrower may be unable to repay the mortgage loan at that
time. In addition, fully amortizing mortgage loans that may pay interest on an actual/360 basis but have fixed monthly payments
may, in effect, have a small balloon payment due at maturity. See “Risk Factors—Borrowers May Be Unable to Make
Balloon Payments” in the prospectus.
 
The
mortgage loan sellers have informed us that each mortgage loan is expected to have a substantial remaining principal balance as
of the stated maturity date or anticipated repayment date of the related mortgage loan, including certain mortgage loans that
pay interest-only for a portion of the related term or until the respective maturity dates or anticipated repayment dates of the
related mortgage loans, and that substantially all of the mortgage loans have amortization schedules that are significantly longer
than their respective terms to maturity or any related anticipated repayment dates. See “Description of the Mortgage
Pool—Certain Terms and Conditions of the Mortgage Loans” in this free writing prospectus.
 

S-90
 
 

A
longer amortization schedule or an interest-only provision in a mortgage loan will result in a higher amount of principal outstanding
under the mortgage loan at any particular time, including at the maturity date or anticipated repayment date of the mortgage loan,
as applicable, than would have otherwise been the case had a shorter amortization schedule been used or had the mortgage loan
had a shorter interest-only period or not included an interest-only provision at all. That higher principal amount outstanding
could both (i) make it more difficult for the related borrower to make the required balloon or anticipated repayment date payment
at maturity or on the related anticipated repayment date, as applicable, and (ii) lead to increased losses for the trust
either during the loan term or at maturity or on the anticipated repayment date if the mortgage loan becomes a defaulted mortgage
loan. The ability of a borrower to make the required balloon or anticipated repayment date payment at maturity or on the related
anticipated repayment date, as applicable, depends upon its ability either to refinance the related mortgage loan (including any
related companion loan) or to sell the mortgaged property for an amount that is sufficient to repay the mortgage loan (including
any related companion loan) in full with interest. A borrower’s ability to achieve either of these goals will be affected
by a number of factors, including:
 

•the
  availability of, and competition for, credit for commercial properties, which may fluctuate
  over time;
 

•prevailing
  interest rates;
 

•the
  fair market value of the related mortgaged property;
 

•the
  borrower’s equity in the related mortgaged property;
 

•the
  borrower’s financial condition;
 

•the
  operating history and occupancy level of the mortgaged property;
 

•tax
  laws; and
 

•prevailing
  general and regional economic conditions.
 
See
“Risk Factors—Borrowers May Be Unable to Make Balloon Payments” in the accompanying prospectus for additional
risk factor considerations.
 
Whether
or not losses are ultimately sustained, any delay in the collection of a balloon payment or an anticipated repayment date payment
that would otherwise be distributable on your certificates, whether such delay is due to a borrower default or to a modification
of the related mortgage loan or otherwise, will likely extend the weighted average life of your certificates. Failure to repay
a mortgage loan on any applicable anticipated repayment date is not an event of default.
 
Furthermore,
the recent credit crisis and economic downturn resulted in tightened lending standards and a substantial reduction in capital
available to refinance commercial mortgage loans at maturity. These factors increased the risk that refinancing may not be available
for commercial mortgage loans. See “—The Volatile Economy and Credit Crisis May Increase Loan Defaults and Affect
the Value and Liquidity of Your Investment” in this free writing prospectus. We cannot assure you that each borrower
under a balloon loan will have the ability to repay the principal balance of such mortgage loan on the related maturity date or
anticipated repayment date, as applicable. Although there may be financial incentives to do so, failure to pay a mortgage loan
with an anticipated repayment date in full on or before that date will not be an event of default.
 
Additionally,
none of the mortgage loan sellers, any party to the pooling and servicing agreement or any other person will be under any obligation
to refinance any mortgage loan. However, in order to maximize recoveries on defaulted mortgage loans, the pooling and servicing
agreement permits the special servicer to extend the maturity of, or otherwise modify mortgage loans (other than the non-serviced
mortgage loans, which will each be serviced pursuant to a separate pooling and servicing agreement) in a manner consistent with
the servicing standard and subject to Sections 860A through
 

S-91
 
 
860G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, any related
Treasury regulations, and any related rulings or announcements promulgated by the IRS, subject to the limitations described under
“Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Modifications, Waivers and Amendments” in this free writing prospectus.
We cannot assure you, however, that any such extension or modification will increase the present value of recoveries in a given
case.
 
We
cannot assure you that each borrower will have the ability to repay the remaining principal balances on the applicable maturity
date or anticipated repayment date.
 
See

Terms and Conditions of the Mortgage Loans” in this free writing prospectus for information on the terms of the mortgage
loans in the trust.
 
Tenant
Concentration Entails Risk
 
A
deterioration in the financial condition of a tenant can be particularly significant if a mortgaged property is wholly or significantly
owner-occupied or leased to a single tenant or if any tenant makes up a significant portion of the rental income. Mortgaged properties
that are wholly or significantly owner-occupied or that are leased to a single tenant or whose tenants make up a significant portion
of the rental income also are more susceptible to interruptions of cash flow if the owner-occupier’s business operations
are negatively impacted or that single tenant or those tenants fail to renew their leases. This is so because the financial effect
of the absence of operating income or rental income may be severe; more time may be required to re-lease the space; and substantial
capital costs may be incurred to make the space appropriate for replacement tenants.
 
With
respect to some of the mortgage loans that are secured by mortgaged properties that are leased to a single tenant or a tenant
that makes up a significant portion of the rental income, leases will expire prior to, at or soon after the anticipated repayment
dates or maturity dates of the related mortgage loans. In addition, certain of the mortgage loans may have mortgaged properties
for which the leases of significant tenants provide the tenant with the ability to assign its lease or sublease its space, in
some cases, subject to certain conditions set forth in such lease. In certain circumstances, the tenants and/or lease guarantors
may be released from further liability under such leases in connection with such assignments and/or subleases. See “—Mortgaged
Properties Leased to Borrowers or Borrower Affiliated Entities Also Have Risks” below.
 
The
underwriting of the single-tenant mortgage loans is based primarily upon the monthly rental payments due from the tenant under
the lease of the related mortgaged property. Where the primary lease term expires before the scheduled maturity date or anticipated
repayment date, as applicable, of the related mortgage loan, the mortgage loan sellers considered the incentives for the primary
tenant to re-lease the premises and the anticipated rental value of the premises at the end of the primary lease term or took
additional reserves or required letters of credit in connection with the lease expiration.
 
We
cannot assure you that any material or sole tenant will re-lease the premises or that the premises will be relet to another tenant
or that the space will be relet at the same rent per square foot during the term of, or at the expiration of, the primary lease
term, or that the related mortgaged property will not suffer adverse economic consequences in this regard. Additionally, the underwriting
of certain of these mortgage loans with mortgaged properties leased to single tenants or material tenants may have taken into
account the creditworthiness of the tenants under the related leases and consequently may have higher loan-to-value ratios and
lower debt service coverage ratios than other types of mortgage loans. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Mortgaged
Property Considerations—Tenant Issues” in this free writing prospectus for additional information on certain
mortgage loans included in the trust and “Risk Factors—Tenant Concentration Entails Risk” in the prospectus.
 
Certain
Additional Risks Relating to Tenants
 
Certain
of the mortgaged properties may have tenants that sublet a portion or all of their space or may intend to sublet out a portion
or all of their space in the future. With respect to certain of these
 

S-92
 
 
spaces that are sublet, the rents with respect to the related
mortgage loan may have been underwritten at the amount of rent paid by the direct tenant even if the rent being paid by the sublessee
is lower. See “Risk Factors—Certain Additional Risks Relating to Tenants” in the prospectus.
 
Certain
of the mortgaged properties are and/or may be leased in whole or in part by government-sponsored tenants who have the right to
rent reductions or to cancel their leases at any time for lack of appropriations or as a result of a government shutdown or for
damage to the leased premises caused by casualty or condemnation. In some of these cases, the government-sponsored tenant may
have the right to terminate its lease at any time for any reason. See Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus for an identification
of any government-sponsored tenant that constitutes one of the five (5) largest tenants at any mortgaged property. In addition,
see “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Mortgaged Property Considerations—Tenant Issues” in
this free writing prospectus.
 
In
addition, in certain cases a mortgaged property may be leased in whole or substantial part by the related borrower under the mortgage
loan to an affiliate of the borrower. In such cases, it may be more likely a landlord will waive lease conditions for an affiliated
tenant than it would for an unaffiliated tenant or have other non-standard, more tenant-friendly provisions. We cannot assure
you that any conflicts arising where a borrower is affiliated with a tenant at a mortgaged property would not adversely impact
the value of the related mortgage loan. In some cases an affiliated lessee may be physically occupying space related to its business;
in other cases, an affiliated lessee may be a tenant under a master lease with the related borrower, under which the tenant is
obligated to make rent payments but does not occupy any space at the mortgaged property. Master leases in these circumstances
may be used to bring occupancy to a “stabilized” level with the intent of finding additional tenants to occupy some
of all of the master leased space, but may not provide additional economic support for the mortgage loan. We cannot assure you
that any space “leased” by a borrower affiliate will eventually be occupied by third party tenants and consequently,
a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or its affiliates can be particularly significant to the borrower’s
ability to perform under the mortgage loan as it can directly interrupt the cash flow from the mortgaged property if the borrower’s
or its affiliate’s financial condition worsens. These risks may be mitigated when mortgaged properties are leased to unrelated
third parties. See “—Mortgaged Properties Leased to Borrowers or Borrower Affiliated Entities Also Have Risks”
below and “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Net Cash Flow and Certain Underwriting Considerations”
and “—Mortgage Pool Characteristics—Property Type Concentrations” in this free writing prospectus.
 
In
addition, certain of the mortgage loans may have tenants who are leasing their spaces on a month to month basis and have the right
to terminate their leases on a monthly basis. Further, certain tenants’ leases may permit affected tenants to terminate
their leases or reduce their rent if a tenant at an adjacent or nearby property terminates its lease or goes dark.
 
Tenant
Rollover Risks. The mortgaged properties related to certain mortgage loans have one or more properties with leases to single
tenants in which the lease expires prior to, at or shortly after the maturity date or anticipated repayment date, as applicable,
of the related mortgage loans. In addition, the mortgaged properties related to many of the mortgage loans will experience
substantial (50% or more, and as much as 100%, of gross leasable area) lease rollover prior to the maturity date or anticipated
repayment date, as applicable, of the related mortgage loan and in many cases relatively near, or soon after, the maturity dates
or anticipated repayment dates, as applicable, of the related mortgage loans. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Mortgaged
Property Considerations—Tenant Issues—Terminations” and “—Expirations” in this
free writing prospectus for additional information relating to lease terminations and expirations with respect to certain mortgage
loans in the trust. In addition, for tenant rollover information relating to each of the top ten mortgage loans, see the related
summaries attached as Annex A-3 to this free writing prospectus.
 
Certain
of the mortgaged properties securing other mortgage loans included in the trust are scheduled to have large lease rollovers prior
to or shortly after the related maturity date or anticipated repayment date. Prospective investors are encouraged to review the
lease expirations for the top five (5) tenants at each mortgaged property on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus where
applicable.
 

S-93
 
 
Co-tenancy.
In the event certain tenants fail to meet certain sales thresholds or other economic hurdles at the related mortgaged property,
or certain key tenants or a certain percent of tenants terminate their respective leases or cease operations or vacate their respective
premises at the related mortgaged properties, certain co-tenancy clauses may be triggered with respect to such tenants or other
tenants at the related mortgaged property thereby enhancing the impact of the lease expirations or terminations.
 
Certain
examples of co-tenancy provisions and other lease termination rights affecting various mortgaged properties are identified under
“Description of the Mortgage Pool—Mortgaged Property Considerations—Tenant Issues—Terminations”,
“—Expirations” and “—Additional Considerations” in this free writing prospectus
and in Annex A-1, Annex A-3 and in the footnotes to each such Annex.
 
Occupancy
and Other Leasing Considerations. With respect to the mortgage loans described above and certain other mortgage loans, some
of the related mortgage loan documents require tenant improvement and leasing commission or other reserves (including trapping
excess cash flow after notice of lease termination or failure to notify the lender of a lease term extension, or if the tenant
vacates its space or files for bankruptcy protection), and in some cases, the leases contain lessee extension options extending
the term of such leases for a specified term. However, we cannot assure you that any extension options will be exercised or that
the amount of any reserves will be adequate to mitigate the lack of rental income associated with these rollovers. Also, certain
of the mortgaged properties may be subject to tenant termination or contraction rights prior to the maturity date or anticipated
repayment date, as applicable, of the related mortgage loan. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Mortgaged Property
Considerations—Tenant Issues—Terminations” and “—Expirations” in this free writing
prospectus and in Annex A-1, Annex A-3 and in the footnotes to each such Annex.
 
In
addition, certain mortgaged properties may have ongoing negotiations with potential tenants or tenants for which leases (or subleases)
are “out for signature” or for which prospective tenants have signed letters of intent related to certain space at
the mortgaged property, or that have executed leases, but have not yet commenced paying rent, or are not in occupancy or may have
vacant space that is not leased. In addition, in certain cases the related lender has reserved funds for rent abatements and/or
tenant build-outs at the related space. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, the occupancy, underwritten net operating income
and underwritten net cash flow statistics set forth in this free writing prospectus assume that those tenants are presently occupying
the related leased space; however we cannot assure you that those tenants that are not currently in occupancy will ultimately
occupy their respective spaces or that those tenants that are not currently paying full rent will pay that rent as required under
their respective leases. For more information regarding tenants that have not executed leases or that may have executed leases,
but are not yet in occupancy, see Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus including the footnotes thereto, Annex A-3
to this free writing prospectus and “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Net Cash Flow and Certain Underwriting Considerations”
in this free writing prospectus. In addition, investors should note that mortgaged properties with significant vacant space may
be more difficult to relet as compared with mortgaged properties that have the benefit of higher occupancy rates.
 
Certain
anchor or national tenant leases permit such tenants to cease operations (or go “dark”). Any “dark” space
may often be recaptured by the related borrower, as landlord, following a period of vacancy or ceased operations to the extent
provided in the respective lease, however recapture is not always an available remedy if not otherwise provided in the related
lease and such tenant is not otherwise in default nor may a suitable replacement tenant be willing to relet the “dark”
space.
 
The
leases with respect to certain of the mortgage loans provide that under certain circumstances the related tenant has the right
to cease operating at the related mortgaged property provided that it continues to pay rent subject, in certain circumstances,
to certain landlord recapture rights.
 
Certain
tenants at the mortgaged properties may presently be dark but are continuing to pay current rent. See “Description of
the Mortgage Pool—Mortgaged Property Considerations—Tenant Issues—Occupancy and Tenant Concentrations”
in this free writing prospectus.
 

S-94
 
 

In
addition, certain of the tenant leases for the mortgaged properties permit the affected tenants to terminate their leases and/or
abate rent if all or a portion of the leased property is affected by a casualty or subject to a condemnation proceeding, which
in some cases is a relatively low percentage. See “Risk Factors—Certain Additional Risks Relating to Tenants”
in the prospectus.
 
For
additional descriptions of lease termination rights, rights to reduce space for certain tenants and occupancy and leasing issues
with respect to the applicable mortgage loans, see “—Risks of Lease Early Termination Options” and “—Certain
Additional Risks Relating to Tenants”, “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Mortgaged Property Considerations—Tenant
Issues—Terminations” and “—Expirations” in this free writing prospectus, and “Description
of Top Ten Mortgage Loans and Additional Mortgage Loan Information” in Annex A-3 to this free writing prospectus.
See also Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus and the related footnotes for additional information on certain occupancy
and leasing issues applicable to the top five tenants at the mortgaged properties.
 
Options
and Other Purchase Rights May Affect Value or Hinder Recovery with Respect to the Mortgaged Properties
 
With
respect to certain of the mortgage loans, the related borrower has given to one or more tenants or others an option to purchase,
a right of first refusal and/or a right of first offer to purchase all or a portion of the mortgaged property in the event a sale
is contemplated, and such right may not be subordinate to the related mortgage. In addition, state statutes may grant a right
of first refusal to certain designated parties. This may impede the mortgagee’s ability to sell the related mortgaged property
at foreclosure and may affect the value and/or marketability of the related mortgaged property. Additionally, the exercise of
such a purchase option may result in the related mortgage loan being prepaid during a period when voluntary prepayments are otherwise
prohibited. See “—Risks Relating to Prepayments and Repurchases”, “Description of the Mortgage
Pool—Mortgaged Property Considerations—Tenant Issues” in this free writing prospectus and “Description
of Top Ten Mortgage Loans and Additional Mortgage Loan Information” in Annex A-3 to this free writing prospectus.
 
Rights
of first refusal or rights of first offer may continue to apply after a foreclosure or comparable conversion of the related mortgaged
properties, and may have a chilling effect on the special servicer’s ability to liquidate the mortgaged property, and as
a result may materially adversely impact any liquidation proceeds available for distribution to certificateholders. Additionally,
the exercise of a purchase option may result in the related mortgage loan being prepaid during a period when voluntary prepayments
are otherwise prohibited.
 
See
“Description of the Mortgage Pool—Mortgaged Property Considerations—Tenant Issues” in this free
writing prospectus for additional information on certain mortgage loans in the trust relating to purchase options, rights of first
offer and rights of first refusal affecting the related mortgaged properties.
 
Risks
Related to Redevelopment and Renovation at the Mortgaged Properties
 
Certain
of the mortgaged properties are properties that are currently undergoing or are expected to undergo in the future redevelopment,
property improvement plans, renovations or expansions. As described in “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Assessments
of Property Value and Condition—Appraisals” in this free writing prospectus, the underwriting of certain of the
mortgage loans relied upon certain hypothetical values in the related appraisals related to such redevelopment, property improvements,
renovation or expansion. We cannot assure you that any current or planned redevelopment, property improvements, renovation or
expansion will be completed, that such redevelopment, property improvements, renovation or expansion will be completed in the
time frame contemplated, or that, when and if redevelopment, renovation or expansion is completed, such redevelopment, property
improvements, renovation or expansion will improve the operations at, or increase the value of, the subject property. Failure
of any of the foregoing to occur could have a material negative impact on the related mortgaged property, which could affect the
ability of the related borrower to repay the related mortgage loan.
 

S-95
 
 

In
the event the related borrower (or a tenant, if applicable) fails to pay the costs of work completed or material delivered in
connection with such ongoing redevelopment, renovation or expansion, the portion of the mortgaged property on which there is ongoing
construction or renovation may be subject to mechanic’s or materialmen’s liens that may be senior to the lien securing
the related mortgage loan.
 
The
existence of construction at a mortgaged property may take rental units or rooms or leasable space “off-line” or otherwise
make space unavailable for rental, impair access or traffic at or near the mortgaged property or, in general, make that mortgaged
property less attractive to tenants or their customers, and accordingly, in each case, could have a negative effect on net operating
income.
 
If
the special servicer forecloses on behalf of the trust on a mortgaged property that is being redeveloped, renovated or expanded,
pursuant to the REMIC provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the special servicer will only be permitted
to arrange for completion of the redevelopment, renovation or expansion if more than 10% of the costs of construction were incurred
at the time the default on the related mortgage loan became imminent. As a result, the trust fund may not realize as much proceeds
upon disposition of a foreclosure property as it would if it were permitted to complete construction.
 
In
addition, we cannot assure you that any disruption caused by renovations at the mortgaged properties will not have an adverse
impact on the revenue from the related mortgaged properties, and therefore on the borrower’s ability to repay the related
mortgage loan with income from the related mortgaged property. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Mortgaged
Property Considerations—Property Redevelopment and Renovation Issues” in this free writing prospectus for additional
related information on certain mortgage loans in the trust.
 
Mortgaged
Properties Leased to Borrowers or Borrower Affiliated Entities Also Have Risks
 
If
a mortgaged property is leased in whole or substantial part to the borrower under the related mortgage loan or to an affiliate
of the borrower, there may be conflicts of interest.
 
In
such cases, it may be more likely a landlord will waive lease conditions for an affiliated tenant than it would for an unaffiliated
tenant or have other non-standard, more tenant-friendly provisions. We cannot assure you that any conflicts arising where a borrower
is affiliated with a tenant at a mortgaged property would not adversely impact the value of the related mortgage loan. See “—Certain
Additional Risks Relating to Tenants” above and “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Net Cash Flow and Certain
Underwriting Considerations” and “—Mortgaged Property Considerations—Tenant Issues” in
this free writing prospectus.
 
See
“Risk Factors—Mortgaged Properties Leased to Borrowers or Borrower Affiliated Entities Also Have Risks”
in the prospectus.
 
Tenant
Bankruptcy Entails Risks
 
Any
tenant may, from time to time, experience a downturn in its business, which may weaken its financial condition and result in a
reduction or failure to make rental payments when due. If tenants’ sales were to decline, percentage rents may decline and,
further, tenants may be unable to pay their base rent or other occupancy costs. If a tenant defaults in its obligations to a property
owner, that property owner may experience delays in enforcing its rights as lessor and may incur substantial costs and experience
significant delays associated with protecting its investment, including costs incurred in renovating and reletting the property.
 
Section 365(e) of
the bankruptcy code generally invalidates clauses that terminate contracts automatically upon the filing by one of the parties
of a bankruptcy petition or that are conditioned on a party’s solvency, but the bankruptcy code allows the debtor to assume
or reject or, subject to certain conditions, assume and assign to a third party, any unexpired lease in full (which, as a practical
matter, may give the debtor leverage to seek amendments to the lease in order to avoid a rejection). If the tenant rejects the
lease, the landlord’s claim for breach of the lease would (absent collateral securing the claim)
 


S-96
 
 
be treated as a general
unsecured claim against the tenant. The amount of the claim would be limited to the amount owed for unpaid rent under the lease
for the periods prior to the bankruptcy petition, or earlier repossession or surrender of the lease premises, plus the rent under
the lease for the greater of one year, or 15%, not to exceed three years, of the remaining term of such lease, and the actual
amount of the recovery could be less than the amount of the claim. If a tenant assigns or assumes and assigns its lease, the tenant
must cure all defaults under the lease and provide the landlord with adequate assurance of its future performance under the lease.
We cannot assure you that tenants of the mortgaged properties will continue making payments under their leases or that tenants
will not file for bankruptcy protection in the future or, if any tenants so file, that they will continue to make rental payments
in the future or, if any tenants so file, that they will continue to make rental payments in a timely manner. See “Risk
Factors—Tenant Bankruptcy Entails Risks” in the prospectus.
 
Under
the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, upon the insolvency of certain banking institutions, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
would be appointed as receiver for such tenant and has the option to disaffirm any lease it determines to be burdensome if disaffirmance
will permit the orderly administration of the failed bank. In such event, where a bank was the lessee, damages would be limited
to contractual rent accruing before the later of the date (i) the notice of disaffirmance was mailed by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation or (ii) the disaffirmance becomes effective, unless the lessor is in breach of the lease. Upon such
a disaffirmance, the landlord will also generally have a claim for unpaid rent due as the date of appointment of the receiver,
subject to all defenses, and to the limitation on claims of the failed tenant’s creditors generally. To the extent the landlord’s
claim for past rent is unsecured, such claim may be further limited by the depositor preference provisions of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act that could cause the bulk of the failed tenant’s assets to be paid to depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation as the subrogee of any depositors paid by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in its capacity as insurer.
 
Mortgage
Loans Are Nonrecourse and Are Not Insured or Guaranteed
 
In
general, the mortgage loans are not insured or guaranteed by any person or entity, governmental or otherwise.
 
Investors
should treat each mortgage loan as a nonrecourse loan. If a default occurs, recourse generally may be had only against the specific
properties and other assets that have been pledged to secure the mortgage loan, subject to, in some cases, certain customary non-recourse
carveouts to the borrower and/or one or more principals or affiliates of the borrower. Even if a mortgage loan is recourse to
the borrower (or if a non-recourse carveout to the borrower applies), in most cases, the borrower’s assets are limited primarily
to its interest in the related mortgaged property. Consequently, payment prior to maturity or the anticipated repayment date is
dependent primarily on the sufficiency of the net operating income of the mortgaged property. Even if the mortgage loan provides
limited or full recourse to a principal or affiliate of the related borrower, we cannot assure you that any recovery from such
principal or affiliate will be made or that such principal’s or affiliate’s assets would be sufficient to pay any
otherwise recoverable claim. In certain cases, there may be limits or caps on the borrower’s or guarantor’s liability
for the non-recourse carveouts, and in other cases the borrower may be the only obligor responsible for breaches or violations
of some or all of the non-recourse carveout provisions. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Mortgaged Property
Considerations—Additional Considerations” in this free writing prospectus, as well as representation number 28
in Annex D-1 and the identified exceptions to that representation in Annex D-2 in this free writing prospectus.
 
Payment
at maturity or the anticipated repayment date is primarily dependent upon the market value of the mortgaged property in relation
to the unpaid balance of the related mortgage loan or the borrower’s ability to sell or refinance the mortgaged property
for an amount sufficient to repay the mortgage loan.
 
Lack
of Skillful Property Management Entails Risks
 
The
successful operation of a real estate project depends upon the property manager’s performance and viability. Certain individuals
involved in the management or general business development at certain
 

S-97
 
 
mortgaged properties may engage in unlawful activities or
otherwise exhibit poor business judgment that adversely affect operations and ultimately cash flow at such properties. We make
no representation or warranty as to the skills of any present or future managers. See “Risk Factors—Poor Property
Management May Adversely Affect the Performance of the Related Mortgaged Property” in the prospectus.
 
The
Performance of a Mortgage Loan and the Related Mortgaged Property Depends in Part on Who Controls the Borrower and the Related
Mortgaged Property
 
The
operation and performance of a mortgage loan will depend in part on the identity of the persons or entities who control the related
borrower and the related mortgaged property. The performance of such mortgage loan may be adversely affected if control of the
related borrower changes, which may occur, for example, by means of transfers of direct or indirect ownership interests in such
borrower. Generally, the mortgage loan documents place certain restrictions on the transfer and/or pledging of equity interests
in the related borrower, including specific percentage or control limitations. Oftentimes, however, the terms of the mortgage
loan documents will permit, subject to certain limitations, the transfer or pledge of less than a controlling portion of the equity
interests in the related borrower or a transfer of the equity interests of the borrower to an affiliate of the borrower and, in
certain cases, the mortgage loans may have existing or permitted future mezzanine indebtedness. See also “Description
of the Mortgage Pool—Certain Terms and Conditions of the Mortgage Loans—”Due-on-Sale” and “Due-on-Encumbrance”
Provisions” and “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Additional Debt—Existing Mezzanine Debt”
in this free writing prospectus.
 
Some
Mortgaged Properties May Not Be Readily Convertible to Alternative Uses
 
Some
of the mortgaged properties securing the mortgage loans included in the trust fund may not be readily convertible (or convertible
at all) to alternative uses if those properties were to become unprofitable for any reason. For example, mortgaged properties
that are part of a condominium regime may not be readily convertible due to use and other restrictive covenants imposed by the
condominium declaration and other related documents, especially in a situation where such mortgaged property does not represent
the entire condominium regime. Additionally, any vacant movie theater space would not easily be converted to other uses due to
the unique construction requirements of movie theaters. In addition, converting bowling alleys, self storage space, retail banks,
specialty self storage space, manufactured housing community properties, hospitals, parking garages, certain specialized tenant
retail, office or industrial properties, fitness and/or entertainment centers or other athletic facilities, educational institutions,
restaurants and kennels to alternate uses generally requires substantial capital expenditures and could result in a significant
adverse effect on, or interruption of, the revenues generated by such mortgaged properties. Furthermore, certain mortgaged properties
may be subject to certain use restrictions and/or low-income housing restrictions in order to remain eligible for low-income housing
tax credits or governmental subsidized rental payments that could prevent the conversion of the mortgaged property to alternative
uses. The liquidation value of any mortgaged property, subject to limitations of the kind described above or other limitations
on convertibility of use, may be substantially less than would be the case if the mortgaged property were readily adaptable to
other uses. See “—Retail Properties Have Special Risks” above.
 
Zoning
or other restrictions (including, without limitation, any designation of a mortgaged property as a landmark or historical site)
may also prevent alternative uses. See “—Zoning Compliance, Use Restrictions and Condemnation May Adversely Affect
Property Value” below.
 
Condominiums
and Master Developments May Limit Use and Improvements
 
With
respect to two (2) mortgaged properties identified as “The Outlet Shoppes at Gettysburg” and “Hawthorne Townhomes”
on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing two (2) mortgage loan representing approximately 4.1% of the aggregate
principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date, all or part of the related mortgaged properties consists
of the related borrower’s interest in commercial and/or residential condominium interests in buildings and/or other improvements
or in real
 


S-98
 
 
property that is part of a master development, and related interests in the common areas and/or the related voting
rights in the condominium or owners association.
 
Condominium
interests in buildings and/or other improvements or in real property that is part of a master development may in some cases constitute
less than a majority of such voting rights and result in the related borrower not having control of the related condominium or
owners association. The board of managers or directors of the related condominium or master development generally has discretion
to make decisions affecting the condominium or master development and we cannot assure you that the related borrower under a mortgage
loan secured by one or more interests in that condominium or by a property that is part of that master development will have any
control over decisions made by the related board of managers or directors. Thus, decisions made by that board of managers or directors,
including regarding assessments to be paid by the unit owners, insurance to be maintained on the condominium or master development
and many other decisions affecting the maintenance of that condominium or master development, may have a significant impact on
the related mortgage loans in the trust fund that are secured by mortgaged properties consisting of such condominium interests
or that are part of a master development. We cannot assure you that the related board of managers or directors will always act
in the best interests of the related borrower under the related mortgage loans. In addition, with respect to such mortgage loans,
there are certain circumstances when insurance proceeds must be used to repair and restore the related mortgaged property in accordance
with the terms of the governing documents for the related condominium or master development. The manner in which those proceeds
and awards are required to be used under the governing documents may limit the amounts available for restoration of the related
mortgaged property and may result in a material adverse effect on the related borrower’s ability to satisfy its obligations
under the mortgage loan documents.
 
Further,
due to the nature of condominiums and master developments, a default on the part of the borrower with respect to such mortgaged
properties will not allow the special servicer the same flexibility in realizing on the collateral as is generally available with
respect to commercial properties that are not condominium units or part of a master development. The rights of other unit or property
owners, the documents governing the management of the condominium units or properties that are part of master developments and
the state and local laws applicable to condominium units or properties that are part of master developments must be considered.
In addition, in the event of a casualty with respect to a condominium, due to the possible existence of multiple loss payees on
any insurance policy covering such property, there could be a delay in the allocation of related insurance proceeds, if any. Consequently,
servicing and realizing upon the collateral described above could subject the certificateholders to a greater delay, expense and
risk than with respect to a mortgage loan secured by a commercial property that is not a condominium unit or part of a master
development.
 
See
“Description of the Mortgage Pool—Mortgaged Property Considerations—Additional Considerations”
in this free writing prospectus for additional information on certain mortgage loans in the trust relating to condominium interests
affecting the related mortgaged properties.
 
Mortgage
Loans Secured by Leasehold Interests May Expose Investors to Greater Risks of Default and Loss
 
With
respect to four (4) mortgaged properties identified as “Walnut Multifamily Portfolio – Forbes Terrace”, “Walnut
Multifamily Portfolio – Walnut on Wightman”, “Market Square at Montrose” and “CVS Portfolio –
CVS Pharmacy-Cortland” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing or partially securing three (3) mortgage
loans collectively representing approximately 1.6% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the
cut-off date by allocated loan amount, all or a portion of the related mortgaged property consists of a leasehold interest in
the related mortgaged property. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Mortgage Pool Characteristics—Fee &
Leasehold Estates; Ground Leases” in this free writing prospectus and “Risk Factors—Mortgage Loans Secured
by Leasehold Interests May Expose Investors to Greater Risks of Default and Loss” in the accompanying prospectus. Additionally,
see representation No. 36 in Annex D-1 and the identified exceptions to that representation in Annex D-2 to this
free writing prospectus for additional information with respect to any mortgage loan secured in whole or in part by a leasehold
interest.
 

S-99
 
 
Limitations of Appraisals
 
Appraisals were obtained with respect to
each of the mortgaged properties at or about the time of the origination or acquisition of the applicable mortgage loan. In general,
appraisals represent the analysis and opinion of qualified appraisers, but appraisals are not guarantees of present or future value.
One appraiser may reach a different conclusion than the conclusion that would be reached if a different appraiser were appraising
that property. Moreover, notwithstanding that all of the mortgage loans were underwritten and originated within approximately the
past seven (7) months (and all of the mortgage loans have appraisal dates within approximately eleven (11) months of the cut-off
date), the values of the mortgaged properties may have fluctuated significantly since the appraisals were performed. Moreover,
appraisals seek to establish the amount a typically motivated buyer would pay a typically motivated seller and, in certain cases,
may have taken into consideration the purchase price paid by the borrower. That amount could be significantly higher than the amount
obtained from the sale of a mortgaged property under a distress or liquidation sale. In addition, certain appraisals may be based
on extraordinary assumptions, including without limitation, that certain tenants are in-place and paying rent when such tenants
have not yet taken occupancy. Additionally, certain appraisals with respect to mortgage loans secured by multiple mortgaged properties
may have been conducted on a portfolio basis rather than on an individual property basis, and the sum of the values of the individual
properties may be different from (and in some cases may be less than) the appraised value of the aggregate of such properties on
a portfolio basis. Further, with respect to eight (8) mortgaged properties identified as “Hilton Suites Chicago Magnificent
Mile”, “Civic Opera Building”, “One Shell Square”, “Hilton Atlanta Perimeter”, “Hyatt
Place Texas Portfolio” and “Langhorne Shopping Center” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing
six (6) mortgage loans representing approximately 22.5% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of
the cut-off date, the related appraisals provided a hypothetical valuation other than an “as-is” value, as described
under “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Assessments of Property Value and Condition—Appraisals”
in this free writing prospectus. In addition, with respect to one hundred and five (105) mortgaged properties identified as “U-Haul
Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan representing approximately 4.3% of
the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date, the loan-to-value ratio was calculated based
on the portfolio value rather than the sum of the individual appraised values, which includes a premium for the value of selling
the portfolio in its entirety. With respect to certain mortgage loans made in connection with the acquisition of the related mortgaged
properties, the acquisition price of such mortgaged properties was less than the “as-is” appraised value set forth
in the related appraisal. See “—Risks Related to Redevelopment and Renovation at the Mortgaged Properties”,

free writing prospectus and “Risk Factors—Limitations of Appraisals” in the prospectus.
 
Different Timing of Mortgage
Loan Amortization Poses Certain Risks
 
As principal payments or prepayments are
made on a mortgage loan that is part of a pool of mortgage loans, the pool will be subject to more concentration risks with respect
to the diversity of mortgaged properties, types of mortgaged properties and number of borrowers, as described in this free writing
prospectus. Classes that have a later sequential designation or a lower payment priority are more likely to be exposed to this
concentration risk than are classes with an earlier sequential designation or a higher priority. This is so because principal on
the offered certificates is generally payable in sequential order, and no class entitled to distributions of principal generally
receives principal until the certificate balance of the preceding (higher priority) class or classes entitled to receive principal
has been reduced to zero.
 
Environmental Risks Relating
to the Mortgaged Properties
 
The trust could become liable for a material
adverse environmental condition at an underlying mortgaged property. Any such potential liability could reduce or delay payments
on the offered certificates.
 


S-100
 
 
Each of the mortgaged properties was either
(i) subject to environmental site assessments prior to the time of origination of the related mortgage loan (or in certain
limited cases, after origination), including Phase I environmental site assessments or updates of previously performed Phase I
environmental site assessments, or (ii) subject to a secured creditor environmental insurance policy or other environmental
insurance policy. In some cases, the related environmental site assessment may have recommended no further action where (i) underground
storage tanks had been removed or abandoned in place with no contamination found and/or were issued regulatory closure, (ii) former
gas stations or dry cleaning facilities or manufacturing activities had resulted in soil and/or groundwater contamination that
received regulatory closure based on completion of remediation or of a determination of low environmental risk, or (iii) nearby
third-party contamination sites were not likely to impact the mortgaged properties. In other cases, Phase II environmental
site assessments or equivalent tests also have been performed or recommended. In certain cases, these assessments revealed conditions
that resulted in requirements that the related borrowers establish operations and maintenance plans, monitor the mortgaged property
or nearby properties, abate or remediate the condition, and/or provide additional security such as letters of credit, reserves,
a secured creditor impaired property policy, environmental insurance policy or pollution legal liability environmental impairment
policy or environmental indemnification. In certain cases, recommended Phase II site assessments were not performed and reserves
or insurance policies were obtained in lieu of such Phase II site assessments or the related lender otherwise determined not
to have the Phase II site assessment performed. Additionally, certain of the mortgaged properties have had recognized environmental
conditions for which remediation has previously occurred or ongoing remediation or monitoring is still continuing. Although assessments
were made on the majority of the mortgaged properties and these involved site visits and other types of review, we cannot assure
you that all environmental conditions and risks were identified.
 
Except as described under “Description
of the Mortgage Pool—Mortgaged Property Considerations—Environmental Considerations” in this free
writing prospectus, none of the environmental site assessments revealed any material adverse environmental condition or circumstance
at any mortgaged property except for those:
 

·that will be remediated or abated in all material respects by the closing date;
 

·for which an escrow or letter of credit for the remediation was established;
 

·for which an environmental insurance policy was obtained from a third party insurer;
 

·for which the consultant recommended an operations and maintenance plan with respect to the applicable mortgaged property or
periodic monitoring of nearby properties, which recommendations are consistent with industry practice;
 

·for which the borrower, the principal of the borrower or another financially responsible party has provided an indemnity or
is required to take, or is liable for the failure to take, such actions, if any, with respect to such matters as have been required
by the applicable governmental authority or recommended by the environmental site assessments;
 

·for which such conditions or circumstances were investigated further and the environmental consultant recommended no further
action or remediation;
 

·as to which the borrower or other responsible party obtained a “no further action” letter or other evidence that
governmental authorities are not requiring further action or remediation (or as to which the borrower or other responsible party
will be obtaining such “no further action” or remediation letter and a holdback or other assurance was made to secure
the receipt of such letter); or
 

·that would not require substantial cleanup, remedial action or other extraordinary response under environmental laws.
 


S-101
 
 
With respect to such environmental site
assessments, in certain cases the identified condition was related to the presence of asbestos-containing materials, lead-based
paint, mold and/or radon. Where these substances were present, the environmental consultant generally recommended, and the related
mortgage loan documents, with certain exceptions, generally required the establishment of an operation and maintenance plan to
address the issue or, in some cases involving asbestos-containing materials, lead-based paint and mold, a containment, abatement
or removal program. Other identified conditions could, for example, include leaks from storage tanks or hydraulic equipment and
on-site spills. Corrective action, as required by the regulatory agencies, has been or is currently being undertaken and, in some
cases, the related borrowers have made deposits into environmental reserve accounts. However, we cannot assure you that any environmental
indemnity, insurance, letter of credit or reserve amounts will be sufficient to remediate the environmental conditions or that
all environmental conditions have been identified or that operation and maintenance plans will be put in place and/or followed.
Additionally, we cannot assure you that actions of tenants at mortgaged properties will not adversely affect the environmental
condition of the mortgaged properties.
 
In addition, problems associated with mold
may pose risks to mortgaged properties and may also be the basis for personal injury claims against a borrower. Although the mortgaged
properties are required to be inspected periodically, we cannot assure you that the presence or extent of mold will be accurately
identified. If left unchecked, the growth of mold could result in the interruption of cash flow, litigation and remediation expenses,
any of which could adversely impact collections from a mortgaged property or otherwise adversely affect the ability of the borrower
to pay its loan obligations.
 
We cannot assure you that with respect to
any mortgaged property that any remediation plan or any projected remedial costs or time is accurate or sufficient to complete
the remediation objectives, or that no additional contamination requiring environmental investigation or remediation will not be
discovered on any mortgaged property. Likewise, all environmental policies naming the lender as named insured cover certain risks
or events specifically identified in the policy, but the coverage is limited by its terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions,
and does not purport to cover all environmental conditions whatsoever affecting the applicable mortgaged property, and we cannot
assure you that any environmental conditions currently known, suspected, or unknown and discovered in the future will be covered
by the terms of the policy.
 
In general, different types of environmental
liability insurance policies provide coverage with respect to a mortgage loan for one or more of the following losses, subject
to the applicable coverage limits and deductibles, and further subject to each policy’s conditions and exclusions:
 

·if, during the term of some types of lender environmental policies, the borrower defaults under its mortgage loan and adverse
environmental conditions exist at levels above legal limits on the related underlying real property, the insurer will indemnify
the insured for an amount (in some cases capped at remediation costs) equal to the outstanding principal balance (or, in some cases,
a lesser specified amount) of the related mortgage loan on the date of the default, together with accrued interest from the date
of default (or, in some cases, the date that the default is reported to the insurer) until the date that the outstanding principal
balance is paid; or
 

·if the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as a result of a claim first made against the insured and reported to the insurer
during the term of a policy, for bodily injury, property damage or clean-up costs resulting from adverse environmental conditions
on, under or emanating from the underlying real property, the insurer will pay the lesser of a specified amount and the amount
of that claim; or
 

·if the insured enforces the related mortgage loan, the insurer will thereafter pay the lesser of a specified amount and the
amount of the legally required clean-up costs for adverse environmental conditions at levels above legal limits which exist on
or under the acquired underlying real property; provided
that the appropriate party reported those conditions to the applicable government agency in accordance with applicable law.
 


S-102
 
 
Environmental liability insurance policies
do not cover adverse environmental conditions that the insured first became aware of before the term of the policy unless those
conditions were disclosed to the insurer before the policy was issued. In some cases, policies exclude coverage for known conditions
even if disclosed.
 
Environmental liability insurance policies
may contain additional limitations and exclusions, including, but not limited to, exclusions from coverage for mold or other microbial
contamination, asbestos and lead based paint, coverages that are less than the related loan amount or policy durations which do
not extend to or beyond the maturity of the related loan.
 
Some borrowers under the mortgage loans
may not have satisfied or may not satisfy all post-closing obligations required by the related mortgage loan documents with respect
to environmental matters. We cannot assure you that recommended operations and maintenance plans have been implemented or will
continue to be complied with.
 
In some cases, the environmental consultant
did not recommend that any action be taken by the related borrower with respect to a potential adverse environmental condition
at a mortgaged property because a responsible party, other than the related borrower, had been identified with respect to that
condition. We cannot assure you, however, that such a responsible party will be willing or financially able to remediate the subject
condition.
 
In addition, certain properties may be undergoing
ongoing monitoring in connection with past remediation or contamination.
 
We cannot assure you that the environmental
assessments revealed all existing or potential environmental risks or that all adverse environmental conditions have been or will
be completely abated or remediated or that any reserves, insurance or operations and maintenance plans will be sufficient to remediate
the environmental conditions. Moreover, we cannot assure you that:
 

·future laws, ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability; or
 

·the current environmental condition of the mortgaged properties will not be adversely affected by tenants or by the condition
of land or operations in the vicinity of the mortgaged properties (such as underground storage tanks).
 
Before the special servicer acquires title
to a mortgaged property on behalf of the trust, it must obtain an environmental assessment of such mortgaged property, or rely
on a recent environmental assessment. This requirement will decrease the likelihood that the trust will become liable under any
environmental law. However, this requirement may effectively preclude foreclosure until a satisfactory environmental assessment
is obtained, or until any required remedial action is taken. There is accordingly some risk that the mortgaged property will decline
in value while this assessment is being obtained or remedial action is being taken. Moreover, we cannot assure you that this requirement
will effectively insulate the trust from potential liability under environmental laws. Any such potential liability could reduce
or delay distributions to certificateholders.

Availability of Earthquake,
Flood and Other Insurance
 
Although the mortgaged properties are required
to be insured against certain risks, there is a possibility of casualty loss with respect to the mortgaged properties for which
insurance proceeds may not be adequate or which may result from risks not covered by insurance.
 
In addition, hazard insurance policies will
typically contain co-insurance clauses that in effect require an insured at all times to carry insurance of a specified percentage,
generally 80% to 90%, of the full replacement value of the improvements on the related mortgaged property in order to recover the
full amount of any partial loss. As a result, even if insurance coverage is maintained, if the insured’s coverage falls below
this specified percentage, those clauses generally provide that the insurer’s liability in the event of partial loss does
not exceed the lesser of (1) the replacement cost of the improvements less physical depreciation and (2) that proportion
of the loss as the amount of insurance carried bears to the specified percentage of the full replacement cost of those improvements.
 
The mortgage loans do not all require flood
insurance on the related mortgaged properties unless they have material improvements that are in a flood zone and flood insurance
is available and, in certain instances, even where the related mortgaged property was in a flood zone and flood insurance was available,
flood insurance was not required.
 
Furthermore, with respect to certain mortgage
loans, the insurable value of the related mortgaged property as of the origination date of the related mortgage loan was lower
than the principal balance of the related mortgage loan.  In the event of a casualty when a borrower is not required to rebuild
or cannot rebuild, we cannot assure you that the insurance required with respect to the related mortgaged property will be sufficient
to pay the related mortgage loan in full and there is no “gap” insurance required under such mortgage loan to cover
any difference. In those circumstances, a casualty that occurs near the maturity date may result in an extension of the maturity
date of the mortgage loan if the master servicer, in accordance with the servicing standard, determines that such extension was
in the best interest of certificateholders.
 
We cannot assure you that the borrowers
will in the future be able to comply with requirements to maintain adequate insurance with respect to the mortgaged properties
or be able to pay any deductible on a policy, and any uninsured loss could have a material adverse impact on the amount available
to make payments on the related mortgage loan, and consequently, the offered certificates. As with all real estate, if reconstruction
(for example, following fire or other casualty) or any major repair or improvement is required to the damaged property, changes
in laws and governmental regulations may be applicable and may materially affect the cost to, or ability of, the borrowers to effect
such reconstruction, major repair or improvement. As a result, the amount realized with respect to the mortgaged properties and
the amount available to make payments on the related mortgage loan and, consequently, the offered certificates could be reduced.
In addition, we cannot assure you that the amount of insurance required or provided would be sufficient to cover damages caused
by any casualty, or that such insurance will be available in the future at commercially reasonable rates.
 
In general (other than where the mortgage
loan documents permit the borrower to rely on a tenant (including a ground tenant) or other third party (such as a condominium
association, if applicable) to obtain the insurance coverage, on self-insurance provided by a tenant or on a tenant’s agreement
to rebuild or continue paying rent), the master servicer and the special servicer will be required to cause the borrower on each
mortgage loan to maintain such insurance coverage in respect of the related mortgaged property as is required under the related
mortgage loan documents. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Certain Terms and Conditions of the Mortgage Loans—Hazard,
Liability and Other Insurance” in this free writing prospectus. In general, the standard form of fire and extended
coverage policy covers physical damage to or destruction of the improvements of a property by fire, lightning,
 


S-104
 
 
explosion, smoke,
windstorm and hail, and riot, strike and civil commotion, subject to the conditions and exclusions specified in each policy (windstorm
is a common exclusion for properties located in certain locations). Most policies typically do not cover any physical damage resulting
from, among other things:
 

·war;
 

·revolution;
 

·terrorism;
 

·nuclear, biological or chemical materials;
 

·governmental actions;
 

·floods and other water related causes;
 

·earth movement, including earthquakes, landslides and mudflows;
 

·wet or dry rot;
 

·vermin; and
 

·domestic animals.
 
Unless the related mortgage loan documents
specifically require the borrower to insure against physical damage arising from such causes, then, the resulting losses may be
borne by you as a holder of certificates. See “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Maintenance of Insurance”
in this free writing prospectus.
 
Even if a type of loss is covered by the
insurance policies required to be in place at the mortgaged properties, the mortgaged properties may suffer losses for which the
insurance coverage is inadequate. For example:
 

·in a case where terrorism coverage is included under a policy, if the terrorist attack is, for example, nuclear, biological
or chemical in nature, the policy may include an exclusion that precludes coverage for such terrorist attack;
 

·in certain cases, particularly where land values are high, the insurable value (at the time of origination of the mortgage
loan) of the mortgaged property may be significantly lower than the principal balance of the mortgage loan;
 

·with respect to mortgaged properties located in flood prone areas where flood insurance is required, the related mortgaged
property may only have federal flood insurance (which only covers up to $500,000), not private flood insurance, and the related
mortgaged property may suffer losses that exceed the amounts covered by the federal flood insurance;
 

·the mortgage loan documents may limit the requirement to obtain related insurance to where the premium amounts are “commercially
reasonable” or a similar limitation; and
 

·if reconstruction or major repairs are required, changes in laws may materially affect the borrower’s ability to effect
any reconstruction or major repairs and/or may materially increase the costs of the reconstruction or repairs and insurance may
not cover or sufficiently compensate the insured.

of the Mortgage Pool—Certain Terms and Conditions of the Mortgage Loans—Hazard, Liability and Other Insurance”
in this free writing prospectus.
 


S-105
 
 
Risks Associated with Blanket
Insurance Policies or Self-Insurance
 
Certain of the mortgaged properties are
covered by blanket insurance policies, which also cover other properties of the related borrower or its affiliates (including certain
properties in close proximity to the mortgaged properties). In the event that such policies are drawn on to cover losses on such
other properties, the amount of insurance coverage available under such policies would thereby be reduced and could be insufficient
to cover insurable risks at the related mortgaged property. In addition, with respect to some of the mortgaged properties, a tenant,
the related borrower or their respective affiliates are permitted to provide insurance or to self-insure against risks. To the
extent that insurance coverage relies on self-insurance, there is risk that the “insurer” will not be willing or have
the financial ability to satisfy the claim when a loss occurs. Additionally, the risk of blanket or self-insurance can be magnified
if affiliated borrowers under multiple mortgage loans in the trust are covered under the same blanket policy. See representation
number 18 on Annex D-1 to this free writing prospectus and the exceptions to that representation on Annex D-2 to
this free writing prospectus.
 
Availability of Terrorism
Insurance
 
Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist
attacks in the New York City area and Washington, D.C. area, many reinsurance companies (which assume some of the risk of policies
sold by primary insurers) eliminated coverage for acts of terrorism from their reinsurance policies. Without that reinsurance coverage,
primary insurance companies would have to assume that risk themselves, which may cause them to eliminate such coverage in their
policies, increase the amount of the deductible for acts of terrorism or charge higher premiums for such coverage. In order to
offset this risk, Congress passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, which established the Terrorism Insurance Program.
On December 26, 2007, the Terrorism Insurance Program was extended and amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization
Act of 2007 through December 31, 2014 and was reauthorized and amended on January 12, 2015 until December 31, 2020 under the
Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015.
 
The Terrorism Insurance Program is administered
by the Secretary of the Treasury and provides some financial assistance from the United States Government to insurers in the event
of another terrorist attack that results in an insurance claim. The program applies to United States risks only and to acts that
are committed by an individual or individuals as an effort to influence or coerce United States civilians or the United States
Government. To facilitate the availability of coverage for acts of terrorism, the Terrorism Insurance Program voids exclusions
in property and casualty insurance policies for acts of terrorism; however, it does not expressly void coverage exclusions in such
policies, such as those for damage resulting from nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological attacks. See “Description
of the Mortgage Pool—Certain Terms and Conditions of the Mortgage Loans—Hazard, Liability and Other Insurance”
in this free writing prospectus.
 
In addition, no compensation is payable
under the Terrorism Insurance Program unless the aggregate industry losses relating to such act of terror exceed a specified threshold,
which is $100 million in 2015, subject to annual $20 million increases until the threshold is equal to $200 million. As a result,
unless the borrowers obtains separate coverage for events that do not meet these thresholds (which coverage may not be required
by the respective mortgage loan documents and may not otherwise be obtainable), such events would not be covered. We cannot assure
you that the Terrorism Insurance Program will create any long term changes in the availability and cost of insuring terrorism risks.
In addition, we cannot assure you that terrorism insurance or the Terrorism Insurance Program will be available or provide sufficient
protection against risks of loss on the mortgaged properties resulting from acts of terrorism.
 
Under the Terrorism Insurance Program, the
federal share of compensation will be equal to 85% in 2015, subject to annual decreases of 1% until equal to 80% of the portion
of insured losses that exceeds an applicable insurer deductible required to be paid during each program year (which insurer deductible
was fixed by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 at 20% of an insurer’s direct earned premium
for any program year). The federal share in the aggregate in any program year
 


S-106
 
 
may not exceed $100 billion (with the insurers being
liable for any amount that exceeds this cap). An insurer that paid its deductible is not liable for the payment of any portion
of total annual United States wide losses that exceed $100 billion, regardless of the terms of the individual insurance contracts.
 
In addition, certain of the mortgage loans
contain limitations on the borrower’s obligation to obtain terrorism insurance, such as (i) waiving the requirement
that such borrowers are required to maintain terrorism insurance if such insurance is not available at commercially reasonable
rates, (ii) waiving the requirement that such borrowers are required to maintain terrorism insurance, or limiting the amount
of such insurance, for mortgaged properties in certain locations or for certain property types, (iii) providing that the related
borrowers may not be required to spend in excess of a specified dollar amount or a cap based on a percentage or multiple factor
in order to obtain such terrorism insurance, or, in the event such terrorism insurance is not available from a “qualified
carrier”, then the borrower may be permitted to obtain such terrorism insurance from the highest rated insurance company
providing such terrorism coverage, (iv) permitting certain tenants to insure or to self-insure as to risks of terrorism at
mortgaged properties that may only be occupied (or are predominantly occupied) by such tenants, or (v) allowing for a deductible
(which may be substantial in certain instances) for such terrorism insurance.
 
See “Description
of the Mortgage Pool—Certain Terms and Conditions of the Mortgage Loans—Hazard, Liability and Other Insurance”
in this free writing prospectus for additional information on certain mortgage loans in the trust. See also representation
number 31 in Annex D-1 and the identified exceptions to that representation in Annex D-2 to this free writing
prospectus.
 
We cannot assure you that all of the mortgaged
properties will be insured against the risks of terrorism and similar acts. As a result of any of the foregoing, the amount available
to make distributions on your certificates could be reduced.
 
Zoning Compliance, Use Restrictions
and Condemnation May Adversely Affect Property Value
 
Certain of the mortgaged properties may
not comply with current zoning laws, including density, use, parking, height and set back requirements, due to changes in zoning
requirements after such mortgaged properties were constructed. From time to time, there may be condemnations pending or threatened
against one or more of the mortgaged properties securing the mortgage loans. The proceeds payable in connection with a total condemnation
may not be sufficient to satisfy the remaining indebtedness of the related mortgage loan. Similarly, proceeds payable in connection
with partial condemnations may not be sufficient to restore the related mortgaged property and, as a result, any partial condemnation
may have a material adverse effect on the continued use of, or income generation from, the affected mortgaged property. Therefore,
we cannot assure you that the occurrence of any condemnation will not have a negative impact upon distributions on your certificates.
See also representation number 26 in Annex D-1 and the identified exceptions to that representation in Annex D-2 to this
free writing prospectus.
 
Certain of the mortgaged properties have
zoning violations based on current law, including those related to density, use, parking, height, setbacks, area ratio or building
separation. Many of these mortgaged properties have been determined to be (i) legal non-conforming structures, which would
be required to be rebuilt in accordance with current zoning requirements if there is a casualty greater than a certain threshold
percentage of the property, or (ii) legal non-conforming uses, which would no longer be permitted if there is a casualty greater
than a certain threshold percentage of the property or if there is an abandonment of the legal non-conforming use for a requisite
period. In some cases, the related borrower has obtained law and ordinance insurance to cover additional costs that result from
the inability to rebuild the improvements as it existed prior to such casualty. However, if as a result of the applicable zoning
laws the rebuilt improvements are constrained by size or square footage limitations, or otherwise are limited in the type of property
that may be rebuilt as compared to the original improvements, any potential loss in income will generally not be covered by law
and ordinance insurance. In addition, certain of the mortgaged properties are in violation of zoning requirements. In connection
with the mortgaged properties that are legal non-conforming or have zoning violations, see “Description of the Mortgage
Pool—Assessments of Property Value and Condition—Zoning and Building Code Compliance and Condemnation” in
this free writing prospectus for additional information on certain mortgage loans in the
 


S-107
 
 
trust and “Risk Factors—If
Mortgaged Properties Are Not in Compliance With Current Zoning Laws Restoration Following a Casualty Loss May Be Limited”
in the prospectus. See also representation number 26 in Annex D-1 and the identified exceptions to that representation
in Annex D-2 to this free writing prospectus.
 
In addition, certain of the mortgaged properties
may be subject to certain use restrictions and/or operational requirements imposed pursuant to development agreements, ground leases,
restrictive covenants, environmental deed restrictions, reciprocal easement agreements or operating agreements or, in the case
of those mortgaged properties that are condominiums, condominium declarations or other condominium use restrictions or regulations,
especially in a situation where the mortgaged property does not represent the entire condominium building. Such use restrictions
could include, for example, limitations on the character of the improvements or the properties, limitations affecting noise and
parking requirements, among other things, and limitations on the borrowers’ right to operate certain types of facilities
within a prescribed radius. These limitations may impose upon the borrower stricter requirements with respect to repairs and alterations,
including following a casualty loss. These limitations could adversely affect the ability of the related borrower to lease the
mortgaged property on favorable terms, thus adversely affecting the borrower’s ability to fulfill its obligations under the
related mortgage loan.
 
Additionally, certain of these mortgaged
properties may have been designated as historic or landmark buildings or may be located in areas designated as historic or landmark.
Such properties may be subject to historic preservation requirements and regulations. Compliance with these regulations may be
costly and may impede the related borrowers’ ability to renovate or remodel the related property. Historic preservation regulations
may also adversely impact the ability of the related borrowers to convert the related property to alternative uses or otherwise
develop or alter the property. In addition, any alteration, reconstruction, demolition, or new construction affecting such property
may require prior approval. Any such approval process, even if successful, could delay any redevelopment or alteration of a related
property. The liquidation value of such property, to the extent subject to limitations of the kind described above or other limitations
on convertibility of use, may be substantially less than would be the case if such property was readily adaptable to other uses
or redevelopment.
 
Increases in Real Estate
Taxes Due to Termination of a PILOT Program or Other Tax Abatement Arrangements May Reduce Net Cash Flow and Payments to Certificateholders
 
Certain of the mortgaged properties securing
the mortgage loans may have or may in the future have the benefit of reduced real estate taxes under a local government program
of payment in lieu of taxes (often known as a “PILOT”
program) or other tax abatement or reimbursement arrangements. Some of these programs or arrangements are scheduled to terminate
or have significant tax increases prior to the maturity of the related mortgage loan, resulting in higher, and in some cases substantially
higher, real estate tax obligations for the related borrower or a reduction of payments to the related borrower. An increase in
real estate taxes may affect the ability of the borrower to pay debt service on the related mortgage loan. We cannot assure you
that any such program will continue for the term of the related mortgage loan or would survive a mortgage loan foreclosure or deed
in lieu of foreclosure.
 
Litigation or Other Legal
Proceedings Could Adversely Affect the Mortgage Loans
 
There may be pending or threatened legal
proceedings against, or other past or present adverse regulatory circumstances experienced by, the borrowers, their sponsors and
managers of the mortgaged properties and their respective affiliates related to the business of or arising out of the ordinary
business of the borrowers, their sponsors, managers and affiliates. Any such litigation or proceedings could adversely impact the
related borrower’s ability to meet its obligations under the related mortgage loan and, as a result, have a material adverse
effect on your certificates.
 
In addition, certain of the borrower sponsors,
property managers, affiliates of any of the foregoing and/or entities controlled thereby have been a party to bankruptcy proceedings,
mortgage loan defaults and restructures, discounted payoffs, foreclosure proceedings or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transactions,
 


S-108
 
 
or other material proceedings (including criminal proceedings) in the past, whether or not related to the mortgaged property securing
a mortgage loan in this securitization transaction. In some cases, mortgaged properties securing certain of the mortgage loans
previously secured other loans that had been in default, restructured or the subject of a discounted payoff, foreclosure or deed-in-lieu
of foreclosure.
 
Certain of the borrower sponsors may have
a history of litigation or other proceedings against their lender, in some cases involving various parties to a securitization
transaction. We cannot assure you that the borrower sponsors that have engaged in litigation or other proceedings in the past will
not commence action against the trust in the future upon any attempt by the special servicer to enforce the mortgage loan documents.
Any such actions by the borrower or borrower sponsor may result in significant expense and potential loss to the issuing entity
and a shortfall in funds available to make payments on the offered certificates. In addition, certain principals or borrower sponsors
may have in the past been convicted of, or pled guilty to, a felony.
 
If a borrower or a principal of a borrower
or affiliate has been a party to a bankruptcy, foreclosure, litigation or other proceeding, particularly against a lender, or has
been convicted of a crime in the past, we cannot assure you that the borrower or principal will not be more likely than other borrowers
or principals to avail itself or cause a borrower to avail itself of its legal rights, under the federal bankruptcy code or otherwise,
in the event of an action or threatened action by the lender or its servicer to enforce the related mortgage loan documents, or
otherwise conduct its operations in a manner that is in the best interests of the lender and/or the mortgaged property. We cannot
assure you that any such proceedings or actions will not have a material adverse effect upon distributions on your certificates.
 
Further, borrowers, principals of borrowers,
property managers and affiliates of such parties may, in the future, be involved in bankruptcy proceedings, foreclosure proceedings
or other material proceedings (including criminal proceedings), whether or not related to the mortgage loans. We cannot assure
you that any such proceedings will not negatively impact a borrower’s or loan sponsor’s ability to meet its obligations
under the related mortgage loan and, as a result could have a material adverse effect upon your certificates.
 
Often it is difficult to confirm the identity
of owners of all of the equity in a borrower, which means that past issues may not be discovered as to such owners.
 
See “Description of the Mortgage
Pool—Mortgaged Property Considerations—Litigation Considerations; Bankruptcy Issues and Other Proceedings”
in this free writing prospectus for additional information on certain mortgage loans in the trust and “Risk Factors—Litigation
Concerns” in the prospectus.
 
Certain of the Mortgage Loans
Lack Customary Provisions
 
Certain of the mortgage loans lack one or
more features that are customary in mortgage loans intended for securitization. The borrowers with respect to those mortgage loans
may not be required to make payments to lockboxes or to maintain reserves for certain expenses, such as taxes, insurance premiums,
capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions, or the requirement to make such payments may be suspended if
the related borrower or a tenant at the mortgaged property complies with the terms of the related mortgage loan documents, or the
lenders under such mortgage loans may not have the right to terminate the related property manager upon the occurrence of certain
events or require lender approval of a replacement property manager. However, as described in this free writing prospectus, the
mortgage loans were generally originated in accordance with the related mortgage loan seller’s underwriting guidelines.

Subordination of the Class
A-S, Class B, Class C, Class EC and Class D Certificates Will Affect the Timing of Distributions and the Application of Losses
on the Class A-S, Class B, Class C, Class EC and Class D Certificates
 
As described in this free writing prospectus,
the rights of the holders of each class of subordinate certificates, and the Class EC certificates in respect of its various components,
to receive payments of principal and interest otherwise payable on their certificates will be subordinated to such rights of the
holders of the more senior certificates having an earlier alphabetical or alphanumeric class designation and to the rights of the
holders of the Class EC certificates in respect of any components thereof having an earlier alphabetical designation. If your certificates
are Class A-S, Class B, Class C, Class EC or Class D certificates, your rights to receive distributions of amounts collected
or advanced on or in respect of the mortgage loans will generally be subordinated to those of the holders of the Class A-1,
Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5, Class A-SB, Class X-A, Class X-B, Class X-C and Class X-D certificates and, if your
certificates are Class B or Class C certificates, to those of the holders of the Class A-S certificates (and the holders
of the Class EC certificates, to the extent of the Class A-S certificates exchanged for such Class EC certificates) and,
if your certificates are Class C certificates, to those of the holders of the Class B certificates (and the holders of
the Class EC certificates, to the extent of the Class B certificates exchanged for such Class EC certificates) and if
your certificates are Class D certificates, to those of the holders of the Class C certificates (and the holders of the Class EC
certificates, to the extent of the Class C certificates exchanged for such Class EC certificates). Because the notional amount
of the Class X-A certificates is based upon the aggregate certificate principal balance of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3,
Class A-4, Class A-5 and Class A-SB certificates and the Class A-S certificates (determined without giving effect to any exchange
and conversion of any Class A-S certificates for Class EC certificates), the Class X-A certificates will be adversely affected
by losses allocated to such classes of certificates. Because the notional amount of the Class X-B certificates is based upon the
certificate balance of the Class B certificates (determined without giving effect to any exchange and conversion of any Class B
certificates for Class EC certificates), the Class X-B certificates will be adversely affected by losses allocated to such certificates.
See “Description of the Certificates” in this free writing prospectus. As a result, you will generally bear
the effects of losses on the mortgage loans and unreimbursed expenses of the trust fund before the holders of those other classes
of certificates. See “Description of the Certificates—Distributions” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Potential Conflicts of Interest
 
Potential Conflicts of
Interest of the Sponsors and Mortgage Loan Sellers
 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association
is a sponsor and one of the mortgage loan sellers and is an affiliate of each of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities
Corp., the depositor and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, an underwriter and an initial purchaser of the non-offered certificates. JPMorgan
Chase Bank, National Association currently holds the First National Building pari passu companion loan and the New Center
One Building pari passu companion loan; however, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association expects to deposit each such
pari passu companion loan into one or more future securitizations. In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association
currently holds one or more promissory notes comprising a portion of a U-Haul Portfolio pari passu companion loan or U-Haul
Portfolio subordinate companion loan, as applicable; however, J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, National Association, expects to deposit
each of its promissory notes comprising a portion of each U-Haul Portfolio pari passu companion loan or U-Haul Portfolio
subordinate companion loan, as applicable, into a private CMBS securitization prior to the closing of this securitization.
 
JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association
provides warehouse financing to an affiliate of Redwood Commercial Mortgage Corporation, a mortgage loan seller, through a repurchase
facility. Two (2) of the mortgage loans that Redwood Commercial Mortgage Corporation will transfer to the depositor identified
 


S-110
 
 
as “Park Place I & II Portfolio” and “Falcon Gateway” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus,
representing approximately 3.6% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date, are expected
to be subject to that repurchase facility.
 
In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National
Association currently holds certain equity interests in the parent company for the two tenants under the master lease related to
the mortgaged properties identified as “Brunswick Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing
approximately 1.7% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date. JPMorgan Chase Bank,
National Association acquired the equity interests as part of the reorganization of the parent company after a bankruptcy filing
in 2012. JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association owns a minority interest in the parent company and is entitled to appoint one
member of the board of directors, which consists of nine total members.
 
Barclays Bank PLC is a sponsor and
one of the mortgage loan sellers and is an affiliate of Barclays Capital Inc., an underwriter for the offered certificates
and an initial purchaser of the non-offered certificates. Barclays Bank PLC provides warehouse financing to Starwood Mortgage Funding II
LLC through a repurchase facility. All of the mortgage loans that Starwood Mortgage Funding II LLC will transfer to the depositor,
except the mortgage loan identified as “Best Buy Sanford, FL” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing
approximately 12.3% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date, are subject to that
repurchase facility. Proceeds received by Starwood Mortgage Funding II LLC in connection with the contribution of mortgage
loans to this securitization transaction will be applied, among other things, to reacquire the financed mortgage loans and make
payments to Barclays Bank PLC as the repurchase agreement counterparty.
 
Starwood Mortgage Funding II LLC, a sponsor
and mortgage loan seller, is an affiliate of LNR Partners, LLC, the initial special servicer, and of LNR Securities Holdings, LLC
(or its affiliate), which is expected to purchase the Class E, Class F, Class G, Class NR and Class Z certificates and may
purchase certain other classes of certificates. Conflicts may arise due to Starwood Mortgage Funding II LLC participating in this
transaction in the capacity of a sponsor and mortgage loan seller as well as being an affiliate of the initial special servicer
and the anticipated purchaser of the Class E, Class F, Class G, Class NR and Class Z certificates.
 
In connection with its acquisition of the
Class E, Class F, Class G, Class NR and Class Z certificates, LNR Securities Holdings, LLC (or its affiliate) was given the
opportunity to perform due diligence on the mortgage loans originally identified by the mortgage loan sellers for inclusion in
the trust, or to request the removal, re-sizing or modification of other features of some or all of the mortgage loans. We cannot
assure you that a third party purchaser or an unaffiliated purchaser of the Class E, Class F, Class G, Class NR and Class
Z certificates would have agreed to the inclusion of any or all of such mortgage loans in the trust.
 
Because the incentives of the anticipated
purchaser of the Class E, Class F, Class G, Class NR and Class Z certificates, may, in certain circumstances, differ from
a purchaser who is not the same entity as, or is not affiliated with, any of the mortgage loan sellers, prospective investors should
consider the potential impact of the conflicts of interest described above.
 
Starwood Mortgage Funding II LLC currently
holds the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio pari passu companion loan; however, Starwood Mortgage Funding II LLC or an affiliate
expects to deposit such pari passu companion loan into a future securitization.
 
Redwood Commercial Mortgage Corporation
is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Redwood Trust, Inc. Redwood Trust, Inc. will guarantee the performance of Redwood Commercial
Mortgage Corporation’s obligations to repurchase or replace its respective mortgage loans for material breaches of representations
and warranties or defective loan documentation under the circumstances described under “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Sale
of Mortgage Loans; Mortgage File Delivery” and “—Representations and Warranties; Repurchases and Substitutions”
in this free writing prospectus.
 


S-111
 
 
Redwood Commercial Mortgage Corporation,
a sponsor and mortgage loan seller, is currently the holder of one (1) mezzanine loan related to one (1) mortgage loan identified
as “Falcon Gateway” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing approximately 0.9% of the aggregate
principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date. The additional financial interest in this mortgaged property
may create a conflict of interest. See “Description of the Mortgage
Pool—Additional Debt” in this free writing prospectus. In exercising its rights, the mezzanine lender has
no obligation to consider the interests of, or impact of the exercise of such rights upon, the trust or the certificateholders.
 
RAIT Funding, LLC is an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of RAIT Financial Trust. RAIT Financial Trust will guarantee the performance of RAIT Funding, LLC’s obligations
to repurchase or replace its respective mortgage loans for material breaches of representations and warranties or defective loan
documentation under the circumstances described under “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Sale of Mortgage Loans;
Mortgage File Delivery” and “—Representations and Warranties; Repurchases and Substitutions”
in this free writing prospectus.
 
Pursuant to the related mortgage loan purchase
agreement, each mortgage loan seller (or Starwood Mortgage Capital LLC, as guarantor of the repurchase and substitution obligations
of Starwood Mortgage Funding II LLC, Redwood Trust Inc. as guarantor of the repurchase and substitution obligations of Redwood
Commercial Mortgage Corporation and RAIT Financial Trust as guarantor of the repurchase and substitution obligations of RAIT Funding,
LLC) is obligated to repurchase or substitute a similar commercial mortgage loan for a mortgage loan sold by it in connection with
either a material breach of such mortgage loan seller’s representations and warranties or any material document defects,
if the applicable mortgage loan seller does not otherwise cure such breach or defect pursuant to the related mortgage loan purchase
agreement. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Representations and Warranties; Repurchases and Substitutions”
in this free writing prospectus.
 
Conflicts may also arise because the mortgage
loan sellers and their respective affiliates intend to continue to actively acquire, develop, operate, finance and dispose of real
estate-related assets in the ordinary course of their businesses. During the course of their business activities, the mortgage
loan sellers and their respective affiliates may acquire, sell or lease properties, or finance loans secured by properties, which
may include the mortgaged properties securing the mortgage loans or properties that are in the same markets as the mortgaged properties.
Such other properties, similar to other third-party owned real estate, may compete with the mortgaged properties for existing and
potential tenants. The mortgage loan sellers may also, from time to time, be among the tenants at the mortgaged properties, and
they should be expected to make occupancy-related decisions based on their self-interest and not that of the trust fund. We cannot
assure you that the activities of these parties with respect to such other properties will not adversely impact the performance
of the mortgaged properties.
 
In addition, certain of the mortgage loans
included in the trust may have been refinancings of debt previously held by a mortgage loan seller or an affiliate of a mortgage
loan seller or a mortgage loan seller or its affiliates may have or have had equity investments in the borrowers or mortgaged properties
under certain of the mortgage loans included in the trust. Each of the mortgage loan sellers and their respective affiliates have
made and/or may make loans to, or equity investments in, affiliates of the borrowers under the related mortgage loans. In the circumstances
described above, the interests of the mortgage loan sellers and their respective affiliates may differ from, and compete with,
the interests of the trust fund. Additional financial interests in, or other financial dealings with, a borrower or its affiliates
under any of the related mortgage loans may also create conflicts of interest.
 
Courts may apply the doctrine of equitable
subordination to subordinate the claim or lien of a lender against a borrower to claims or liens of other creditors of the borrower,
when the lender or one of its affiliates is found to have engaged in unfair, inequitable or fraudulent conduct. The courts have
also applied the doctrine of equitable subordination when a lender or one of its affiliates is found to have exerted inappropriate
control over a client, including control resulting from the ownership of equity interests in the borrower. Payments on a loan to
a borrower in which the lender or one of its affiliates also holds an equity interest, may be subject to claims of equitable subordination.
If the lender were deemed to have the ability to control or otherwise exercise influence over the business and affairs of the borrower
resulting in economic hardship to other creditors of the borrower, this control or influence may constitute
 


S-112
 
 
grounds for equitable
subordination and a court may treat one or more of the loans as if it were unsecured or common equity in the borrower. In that
case, if the borrower were to liquidate, the lender (which may include unaffiliated assignees in some cases) would be entitled
to repayment of its loan on a pro rata basis with other unsecured debt or, if the effect of subordination was to place the
lender at the level of common equity, then on an equal basis with other holders of the borrower’s common equity only after
all of the borrower’s obligations relating to its debt and preferred securities had been satisfied.
 
In addition, the sponsors and their affiliates
may benefit from this offering in a number of ways, some of which may be inconsistent with the interests of purchasers of the certificates.
The sponsors will sell the mortgage loans to the depositor. To the extent unhedged or not completely hedged, these sales will reduce
or eliminate the sponsors’ exposure to these mortgage loans by effectively transferring the sponsors’ exposure to the
purchasers of the offered certificates. The sponsors and their respective affiliates will be compensated in an amount based on,
among other things, the offering price of the offered certificates and the amount of proceeds received from the sale of the offered
certificates to investors.
 
Furthermore, the sponsors and their respective
affiliates may benefit from a completed offering of the offered certificates because the offering would establish an additional
market precedent and a valuation data point for securities similar to the offered certificates, thus enhancing the ability of the
sponsors and their respective affiliates to conduct similar offerings in the future and permitting them to write up, avoid writing
down or otherwise adjust the fair value of mortgage loans or other similar assets or securities held on their balance sheet.
 
Each of the foregoing relationships should
be considered carefully by you before you invest in any certificates.
 
Potential Conflicts of
Interest of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer
 
The pooling and servicing agreement provides
that the mortgage loans and any serviced whole loans are required to be administered in accordance with the servicing standard
without regard to ownership of any certificate by the master servicer, the special servicer or any of their respective affiliates.
See “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—General”
in this free writing prospectus.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the master
servicer, the special servicer or any of their respective affiliates may have interests when dealing with the mortgage loans and
any serviced whole loans that are in conflict with those of holders of the certificates, especially if the master servicer, the
special servicer or any of their respective affiliates holds remaining certificates, or has financial interests in or other financial
dealings with a borrower under any of the mortgage loans and any serviced whole loans. In order to minimize the effect of this
conflict of interest, for so long as the special servicer is a borrower party with respect to a mortgage loan (any such loan referred
to herein as an “excluded special servicer loan”), the special servicer will be required to resign as special servicer
with respect to that mortgage loan and, prior to the occurrence of a control event under the pooling and servicing agreement, the
directing certificateholder or the controlling class representative on its behalf will be required to select a separate special
servicer that is not a borrower party (referred to herein as an “excluded special servicer”) with respect to any excluded
special servicer loan, unless such excluded special servicer loan is also an excluded loan. After the occurrence and during the
continuance of a control event or at any time the applicable excluded special servicer loan is also an excluded loan, the resigning
special servicer will be required to select the related excluded special servicer. See “Transaction Parties—Replacement
of the Special Servicer” in this free writing prospectus. Any excluded special servicer will be required to perform all
of the obligations of the special servicer with respect to such excluded special servicer loan and will be entitled to all special
servicing compensation with respect to such excluded special servicer loan earned during such time as the related mortgage loan
is an excluded special servicer loan. While the special servicer will have the same access to information related to the excluded
special servicer loan as it does with respect to the other mortgage loans, the special servicer will covenant in the pooling and
servicing agreement that it will not directly or indirectly provide any information related to the excluded special servicer loan
to the related borrower party or any employees or personnel of such borrower party involved in the management of any investment
in the related borrower party or the related mortgaged property and
 


S-113
 
 
will maintain sufficient internal controls and appropriate
policies and procedures in place in order to comply with those obligations. Notwithstanding those restrictions, there can be no
assurance that the related borrower party will not obtain sensitive information related to the strategy of any contemplated workout
or liquidation related to an excluded special servicer loan.
 
The special servicer may enter into one
or more arrangements with the directing certificateholder, holders of controlling class certificates or any person with the right
to appoint or remove and replace the special servicer to provide for a discount and/or revenue sharing with respect to the special
servicer’s compensation in consideration of, among other things, the appointment of the special servicer and limitations
on the directing certificateholder’s right to replace the special servicer. Each of these relationships may create a conflict
of interest. For instance, a special servicer or its affiliate that holds remaining certificates or an interest in a companion
loan might seek to reduce the potential for losses allocable to those certificates or from a related troubled mortgage loan with
a split loan structure by deferring acceleration in hope of maximizing future proceeds. However, that action could result in less
proceeds to the trust than would be realized if earlier action had been taken. In general, neither the master servicer nor the
special servicer is required to act in a manner more favorable to the certificates or any particular class of certificates than
to the remaining certificates. See “—Special Servicer May Be Directed To Take Actions” below. LNR Partners,
LLC, which is expected to act as the initial special servicer, is an affiliate of LNR Securities Holdings, LLC (or its affiliate),
the anticipated initial directing certificateholder, Starwood Mortgage Funding II LLC, one of the sponsors and mortgage loan sellers,
and Starwood Mortgage Capital LLC, an originator.
 
LNR Partners, LLC assisted LNR Securities
Holdings, LLC (or its affiliate), which is expected to purchase the Class E, Class F, Class G, Class NR and Class Z certificates,
with due diligence relating to the mortgage loans to be included in the mortgage pool.
 
The master servicer services and will, in
the future, service, in the ordinary course of its business, existing and new mortgage loans for third parties, including portfolios
of mortgage loans similar to the mortgage loans. The real properties securing these other mortgage loans may be in the same markets
as, and compete with, certain of the mortgaged properties securing the mortgage loans. Consequently, personnel of the master servicer
may perform services, on behalf of the trust, with respect to the mortgage loans at the same time as they are performing services,
on behalf of other persons, with respect to other mortgage loans secured by properties that compete with the mortgaged properties
securing the mortgage loans. This may pose inherent conflicts for the master servicer.
 
Certain relationships and transactions between
the directing certificateholder (or any other party entitled to remove the special servicer) and the special servicer may result
in conflicts of interest. The directing certificateholder appoints and can remove the special servicer during such time as the
Class E certificates have a certificate balance (taking into account the application of appraisal reductions to notionally reduce
the certificate balance of such class of certificates) that is not less than 25% of its initial certificate balance (a) for cause
at any time and (b) without cause if either (i) LNR Partners, LLC or its affiliate is no longer the special servicer or (ii) LNR
Securities Holdings, LLC or its affiliate owns less than 25% of the controlling class of certificates. In addition, the directing
certificateholder maintains certain consent and consultation rights with respect to the mortgage loans that relate to, and could
impact, the special servicer’s duties. Additionally, these parties (and/or their affiliates) may, in the ordinary course
of business, have relationships with, render services to, and engage in other transactions with each other. We cannot assure you
that these transactions and relationships will not influence the actions taken by the special servicer.
 
In addition, the Civic Opera Building mortgage
loan is serviced under the JPMBB 2015-C31 pooling and servicing agreement. The directing certificateholder under the JPMBB 2015-C31
pooling and servicing agreement has certain consent and consultation rights with respect to the Civic Opera Building whole loan
that are substantially similar to those of the directing certificateholder under the pooling and servicing agreement for this securitization,
subject to similar appraisal mechanics. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—The Whole Loans—The Civic Opera
Building Whole Loan” in this free writing prospectus. While the directing certificateholder in this securitization has
certain consultation rights with respect to actions for which the JPMBB 2015-C31 directing certificateholder has consent rights,
in
 


S-114
 
 
exercising such rights the JPMBB 2015-C31 directing certificateholder does not have any obligation to consider the interests
of, or impact on, the trust or the holders of the certificates. Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National Association
is the master servicer and the special servicer of the Civic Opera Building whole loan under the JPMBB 2015-C31 pooling and servicing
agreement.
 
In addition, the U-Haul Portfolio mortgage
loan will be serviced under the trust and servicing agreement entered into in connection with the private CMBS securitization that
is expected to govern the servicing and administration of the U-Haul Portfolio whole loan. The controlling class representative
under the U-Haul Portfolio trust and servicing agreement has certain consent and consultation rights with respect to the U-Haul
Portfolio whole loan that are substantially similar to those of the directing certificateholder under the pooling and servicing
agreement for this securitization, subject to similar appraisal mechanics. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—The
Whole Loans—The U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan” in this free writing prospectus. While the directing certificateholder
in this securitization has certain consultation rights with respect to actions for which the controlling class representative in
the private CMBS securitization has consent rights, in exercising such rights the controlling class representative in the private
CMBS securitization does not have any obligation to consider the interests of, or impact on, the trust or the holders of the certificates.
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association is expected to be the servicer and the special servicer of the U-Haul Portfolio whole loan
under the U-Haul Portfolio trust and servicing agreement.
 
In addition, each of the One Shell Square
mortgage loan and the Brunswick Portfolio mortgage loan is serviced under the JPMBB 2015-C30 pooling and servicing agreement. The
directing certificateholder under the JPMBB 2015-C30 pooling and servicing agreement has certain consent and consultation rights
with respect to the One Shell Square whole loan and the Brunswick Portfolio whole loan that are substantially similar to those
of the directing certificateholder under the pooling and servicing agreement for this securitization, subject to similar appraisal
mechanics. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—The Whole Loans—The One Shell Square Whole Loan”
and “—The Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan” in this free writing prospectus. While the directing
certificateholder in this securitization has certain consultation rights with respect to actions for which the JPMBB 2015-C30 directing
certificateholder has consent rights, in exercising such rights the JPMBB 2015-C30 directing certificateholder does not have any
obligation to consider the interests of, or impact on, the trust or the holders of the certificates. Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association is the master servicer and Torchlight Loan Services, LLC is the special servicer of the One Shell Square whole loan
and the Brunswick Portfolio whole loan under the JPMBB 2015-C30 pooling and servicing agreement.
 
Each of the foregoing relationships should
be considered carefully by you before you invest in any certificates.
 
Potential Conflicts of
Interest of the Directing Certificateholder
 
The special servicer, an affiliate of the
entity expected to be the initial directing certificateholder, will be required to consult with the directing certificateholder
with respect to certain actions of the special servicer and in certain circumstances obtain the consent of the directing certificateholder
(other than with respect to an excluded loan described in “Description of the Certificates—Reports to Certificateholders;
Certain Available Information” in this free writing prospectus). The directing certificateholder has no duties to the
holders of any class of certificates and may take actions that favor the interests of the holders of the controlling class over
the interests of the holders of one or more other classes of certificates. See “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—The
Directing Certificateholder” in this free writing prospectus. In order to minimize the effect of this conflict of interest,
for so long as any borrower party is the directing certificateholder or the holder of the majority of the controlling class,
the directing certificateholder will not have consent or consultation rights solely with respect to the related excluded loan (however,
the directing certificateholder will be provided certain notices and certain information relating to such excluded loan as described
in the pooling and servicing agreement). In addition, for so long as any borrower party is the directing certificateholder
or a controlling class certificateholder, as applicable, the directing certificateholder or such controlling class certificateholder,
as applicable, will not be given access to any excluded information solely relating to the related excluded controlling class loan
and/or the
 


S-115
 
 
related mortgaged properties pursuant to the terms of the pooling and servicing agreement. Notwithstanding those restrictions,
there can be no assurance that the directing certificateholder or any controlling class certificateholder will not obtain sensitive
information related to the strategy of any contemplated workout or liquidation related to an excluded controlling class loan or
otherwise seek to exert its influence over the special servicer in the event an excluded controlling class loan becomes subject
to a workout or liquidation. See “Description of the Certificates—Reports to Certificateholders; Certain Available
Information” in this free writing prospectus.
 
The directing certificateholder and its
affiliates may have interests that are in conflict with those of certificateholders, especially if the directing certificateholder
or any of its affiliates holds certificates, or has financial interests in or other financial dealings with a borrower or a parent
of a borrower. Each of these relationships may create a conflict of interest.
 
Conflicts Between Certificateholders
and the Holder of a Companion Loan
 
With respect to eight (8) mortgage loans
identified as “Civic Opera Building”, “U-Haul Portfolio”, “First National Building”, “One
Shell Square”, “Eastmont Town Center”, “Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio”, “Brunswick Portfolio”
and “New Center One Building” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing approximately 6.5%, 4.3%,
3.5%, 3.1%, 2.5%, 2.2%, 1.7% and 1.7%, respectively, of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the
cut-off date, the related mortgaged property or properties also secures one or more related pari
passu companion loans, and, with respect to one (1) mortgage loan identified as “U-Haul Portfolio” on Annex
A-1 to this free writing prospectus, one related subordinate companion loan. In addition, with respect to four (4) of these mortgage
loans identified as “First National Building”, “Eastmont Town Center”, “Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio”
and “New Center One Building”, representing approximately 3.5%, 2.5%, 2.2% and 1.7%, respectively, of the aggregate
principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date, pursuant to the related intercreditor agreement, for so
long as each such mortgage loan and each related pari passu
companion loan are serviced under the pooling and servicing agreement, certain decisions to be made with respect to each such mortgage
loan will be subject to the consent and consultation rights of the directing certificateholder.
 
The Civic Opera Building whole loan will
be serviced pursuant to the JPMBB 2015-C31 pooling and servicing agreement and certain decisions to be made with respect to the
related mortgage loan are subject to the consent and consultation rights of the directing certificateholder of that securitization.
As a result, you will have less control over the servicing of the Civic Opera Building mortgage loan than you would have if such
mortgage loan was being serviced by the master servicer and the special servicer pursuant to the terms of the pooling and servicing
agreement. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—The Whole Loans—The Civic Opera Building Whole Loan”
and “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Servicing of the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan” in this free
writing prospectus.
 
The U-Haul Portfolio whole loan will be
serviced pursuant to the trust and servicing agreement entered into in connection with the private CMBS securitization that is
expected to govern the servicing and administration of the U-Haul Portfolio whole loan and certain decisions to be made with respect
to the related mortgage loan are subject to the consent and consultation rights of the directing certificateholder of that securitization.
As a result, you will have less control over the servicing of the U-Haul Portfolio mortgage loan than you would have if such mortgage
loan was being serviced by the master servicer and the special servicer pursuant to the terms of the pooling and servicing agreement.
See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—The Whole Loans—The U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan” and
“Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Servicing of the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan” in this free writing
prospectus.
 
The One Shell Square whole loan and the
Brunswick Portfolio whole loan will be serviced pursuant to the JPMBB 2015-C30 pooling and servicing agreement and certain decisions
to be made with respect to the related mortgage loans are subject to the consent and consultation rights of the directing certificateholder
of that securitization. As a result, you will have less control over the servicing of the One Shell Square mortgage loan and the
Brunswick Portfolio mortgage loan than you would have if such mortgage loans were being serviced by the master servicer and the
special servicer pursuant to the terms of the pooling and servicing agreement. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—The
Whole Loans—The
 


S-116
 
 
One Shell Square Whole Loan”, “—The Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan” and
“Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Servicing of the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan and the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage
Loan” in this free writing prospectus.
 
The interests of each directing certificateholder
of the other securitizations (or such other party specified in the JPMBB 2015-C31 pooling and servicing agreement, the U-Haul Portfolio
trust and servicing agreement or the JPMBB 2015-C30 pooling and servicing agreement, as applicable) entitled to exercise various
rights with respect to the servicing of the Civic Opera Building whole loan, the U-Haul Portfolio whole loan, the One Shell Square
whole loan and the Brunswick Portfolio whole loan, respectively, may conflict with the interests of, and its decisions may adversely
affect, the holders of one or more classes of offered certificates. No certificateholder may take any action against any such party
for having acted solely in its respective interest. See “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Servicing of the Civic
Opera Building Mortgage Loan”, “Servicing of the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan” and “Servicing
of the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan and the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan” in this free writing prospectus.
 
In exercising the rights set forth above,
no holder of a pari passu companion loan or any representative of such holder has any obligation to consider the interests
of, or impact of the exercise of such rights upon, the trust or the certificateholders. However, pursuant to the intercreditor
agreements related to each of the Civic Opera Building mortgage loan, the U-Haul Portfolio mortgage loan, the One Shell Square
mortgage loan and the Brunswick Portfolio mortgage loan, the directing certificateholder under the pooling and servicing agreement
related to this securitization will have certain consultation rights with the applicable special servicer.
 
Potential Conflicts of
Interest of the Underwriters and Their Affiliates
 
The activities of the underwriters and their
respective affiliates (which, in the case of certain of the underwriters, include a sponsor for this securitization transaction)
may result in certain conflicts of interest. The underwriters and their respective affiliates may retain, or own in the future,
classes of the offered certificates, and any voting rights of that class could be exercised by them in a manner that could adversely
impact the certificates. Any of the underwriters or their respective affiliates may invest or take long or short positions in securities
or instruments, including the offered certificates, that may be different from your position as an investor in the offered certificates.
If that were to occur, that underwriter or affiliate’s interests may not be aligned with your interests in the offered certificates
that you acquire.
 
The underwriters and their respective affiliates
include broker-dealers whose business includes executing securities and derivative transactions on their own behalf as principals
and on behalf of clients. Accordingly, the underwriters and their respective affiliates and clients acting through them from time
to time buy, sell or hold securities or other instruments, which may include one or more classes of the offered certificates, and
do so without consideration of the fact that the underwriters acted as underwriters for such certificates. Such transactions may
result in underwriters and their respective affiliates and/or their clients having long or short positions in such instruments.
Any such short positions will increase in value if the related securities or other instruments decrease in value. Further, the
underwriters and their respective affiliates may (on their own behalf as principals or for their clients) enter into credit derivative
or other derivative transactions with other parties pursuant to which they sell or buy credit protection with respect to one or
more of the offered certificates. The positions of the underwriters and their respective affiliates or their clients in such derivative
transactions may increase in value if the offered certificates default or decrease in value. In conducting such activities, no
underwriter or its respective affiliates has any obligation to take into account the interests of the certificateholders or holders
of companion loans or any possible effect that such activities could have on them. The underwriters and their respective affiliates
and clients acting through them may execute such transactions, modify or terminate such derivative positions and otherwise act
with respect to such transactions, and may exercise or enforce, or refrain from exercising or enforcing, any or all of their rights
and powers in connection therewith, without regard to whether any such action might have an adverse effect on the certificates
or the certificateholders or holders of companion loans.
 


S-117
 
 
In addition, the underwriters and their
respective affiliates will have no obligation to monitor the performance of the offered certificates or the actions of the master
servicer, the special servicer, the senior trust advisor, the certificate administrator or the trustee and will have no authority
to advise the master servicer, the special servicer, the senior trust advisor, the certificate administrator or the trustee or
to direct their actions.
 
In addition, the underwriters and their
respective affiliates may have ongoing relationships with, render services to, and engage in transactions with the borrowers, the
sponsors and their respective affiliates, which relationships and transactions may create conflicts of interest between the underwriters
and their respective affiliates, on the one hand, and the trust, on the other hand.
 
See “Summary of Terms—Relevant
Parties and Dates—Certain Affiliations” in this free writing prospectus for a description of certain affiliations
and relationships between the underwriters and other participants in this offering.
 
Each of those relationships should be considered
carefully by you before you invest in any of the offered certificates.
 
Other Possible Conflicts
of Interest
 
The managers of the mortgaged properties
and the borrowers may experience conflicts of interest in the management and/or ownership of the mortgaged properties because:
 

·a substantial number of the mortgaged properties are managed by property managers affiliated with the respective borrowers;
 

·these property managers also may manage and/or franchise additional properties, including properties that may compete with
the mortgaged properties; and
 

·affiliates of the managers and/or the borrowers, or the managers and/or the borrowers themselves, also may own other properties,
including competing properties.
 
None of the borrowers, property managers,
or any of their affiliates or any employees of the foregoing has any duty to favor the leasing of space in the mortgaged properties
over the leasing of space in other properties, one or more of which may be adjacent to, or near the mortgaged properties.
 
With respect to mortgage loans that have
mezzanine debt, the mezzanine lenders will have certain rights with respect to the related mortgage loan under certain circumstances,
including the right, under certain conditions, to consent to various modifications and waivers or other matters affecting the related
mortgage loan and certain actions and amendments to the mortgage loan documents proposed by the special servicer with respect to
the related mortgage loan or to purchase the related mortgage loan after certain defaults under such mortgage loan (and an originator
of a mortgage loan that intends to retain the related mezzanine debt that it also originated may have an incentive to give itself
more favorable rights as a mezzanine lender than it would grant an unaffiliated third party). With respect to one (1) mortgage
loan identified as “Falcon Gateway” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing approximately 0.9% of
the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date, Redwood Commercial Mortgage Corporation,
a sponsor and mortgage loan seller, is the holder of a related mezzanine loan secured by direct or indirect equity interests in
the related mortgage borrower. These additional financial interests in the mortgaged properties may create conflicts of interest.
See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Additional Debt” in this free writing prospectus. In exercising
such rights, no mezzanine lender has any obligation to consider the interests of, or impact of the exercise of such rights upon,
the trust or the certificateholders.
 
Pentalpha Surveillance LLC has been appointed
the senior trust advisor. See “Transaction Parties—The Senior Trust Advisor” in this free writing prospectus.
Pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement, during such time as the Class E certificates have a certificate balance
(taking into account the application of appraisal reductions to notionally reduce the certificate balance of such class of certificates)
 


S-118
 
 
that is less than 25% of its initial certificate balance, the senior trust advisor will be required to consult with the special
servicer with respect to certain actions of the special servicer. Additionally, during that time, the master servicer or the special
servicer, as applicable, will be required to use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with the servicing standard to collect
a senior trust advisor consulting fee from the related borrower in connection with certain major decisions related to the mortgage
loans, to the extent not prohibited by the related mortgage loan documents. In acting as senior trust advisor, the senior trust
advisor is acting solely as a contracting party to the extent described in this free writing prospectus and will have no fiduciary
duty to any party. See “Transaction Parties—The Senior Trust Advisor” in this free writing prospectus.
 
In the normal course of conducting its business,
Pentalpha Surveillance LLC and its affiliates may have rendered services to, performed surveillance of, and negotiated with, numerous
parties engaged in activities related to structured finance and commercial mortgage securitization. These parties may have included
institutional investors, the depositor, the sponsors, the mortgage loan sellers, the master servicer, the special servicer, the
certificate administrator, the trustee, the directing certificateholder, collateral property owners or affiliates of any of the
foregoing parties. Each of these relationships, to the extent they exist, may continue in the future and may involve a conflict
of interest with respect to Pentalpha Surveillance LLC’s duties as senior trust advisor. There can be no guarantee that the
existence of these relationships and other relationships in the future will not impact the manner in which the senior trust advisor
performs its duties under the pooling and servicing agreement.
 
In addition, the senior trust advisor and
its affiliates may have duties with respect to existing and new commercial and multifamily mortgage loans for third parties or
itself or its affiliates, including portfolios of mortgage loans similar to the mortgage loans included in the issuing entity.
These other mortgage loans and the related mortgaged properties may be in the same markets as, or have owners, obligors or property
managers in common with, one or more of the mortgage loans in the issuing entity and the related mortgaged properties. In addition,
in the event that the only mortgage loan (or REO loan) that remains in the trust is the mortgage loan identified as “U-Haul
Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing 4.3% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool
of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date, the senior trust advisor may resign as senior trust advisor. A replacement senior trust
advisor will not be engaged in the event that the senior trust advisor elects to resign under these circumstances. As a result
of the investments and activities described above, the interests of the senior trust advisor and its affiliates and their clients
may differ from, and compete with the interests of the issuing entity.
 
Although the senior trust advisor is required
to consider the servicing standard in connection with its analysis and reporting regarding the special servicer under the pooling
and servicing agreement, the senior trust advisor will not itself be bound by the servicing standard.
 
The senior trust advisor is prohibited from
making a principal investment in any class of certificates issued by the trust. However, that prohibition will not be construed
to have been violated in connection with riskless principal transactions effected by a broker-dealer affiliate of the senior trust
advisor or investments by an affiliate of the senior trust advisor if the senior trust advisor and such affiliate maintain policies
and procedures designed to segregate personnel involved in the activities of the senior trust advisor under the pooling and servicing
agreement from personnel involved in such affiliate’s investment activities and to prevent such affiliate and its personnel
from gaining access to information regarding the trust fund and the senior trust advisor and its personnel from gaining access
to such affiliate’s information regarding its investment activities. In addition, we cannot assure you that such policies
and procedures will be effective for their intended purposes.
 
Each of the foregoing relationships should
be considered carefully by prospective investors.
 
Potential Conflicts of
Interest in the Selection of the Mortgage Loans
 
The anticipated purchasers of the Class E,
Class F, Class G, Class NR and Class Z certificates were given the opportunity by the sponsors to perform due diligence on the
mortgage loans originally identified by the sponsors for inclusion in the trust, and to request the removal, re-sizing or modification
of other features of some or all of the mortgage loans or to request certain price adjustments or cost mitigation
 


S-119
 
 
arrangements
in connection with their agreement to purchase those classes of certificates. The mortgage loans’ pricing and purchase terms
as originally proposed by the sponsors may be adjusted based on some of this feedback prior to the closing date.
 
We cannot assure you that you or another
investor would make requests to modify the original pool if given the opportunity or that the final pool if influenced by such
purchasers’ feedback would not adversely affect the performance of the offered certificates and benefit the performance of
such purchasers’ certificates. Because of the differing subordination levels, such purchasers have interests that may, in
some circumstances, differ from those of purchasers of other classes of certificates, and may desire a portfolio composition that
benefits such purchasers but that does not benefit other investors. In addition, such purchasers may enter into hedging or other
transactions or otherwise have business objectives that also could cause their interests with respect to the asset pool to diverge
from those of other purchasers of the certificates.
 
The anticipated purchasers of those certificates
will have no liability to any certificateholder for any actions taken with respect to the preceding two paragraphs, and the pooling
and servicing agreement will provide that each certificateholder, by its acceptance of a certificate, waives any claims against
such buyers in respect of such actions.
 
It is anticipated that LNR Securities Holdings,
LLC (or its affiliate) will purchase the Class E, Class F, Class G, Class NR and Class Z certificates, and may purchase certain
other classes of certificates, and is expected to be the initial directing certificateholder, and thus will have certain rights
to direct and consult with the special servicer as described under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—The Directing
Certificateholder” in this free writing prospectus.
 
LNR Partners, LLC, which is expected to
act as the special servicer, assisted LNR Securities Holdings, LLC (or its affiliate) with due diligence relating to the mortgage
loans to be included in the mortgage pool.
 
Because the incentives and actions of the
anticipated purchaser of those certificates may, in some circumstances, differ from or be adverse to those of purchasers of other
classes of certificates, you are advised and encouraged to make your own investment decision based on a careful review of the information
set forth in this free writing prospectus and your own view of the mortgage loans.
 
Your Lack of Control Over
the Trust Can Adversely Impact Your Investment
 
Except as described in this free writing
prospectus, investors in the certificates do not have the right to make decisions with respect to the administration of the trust.
These decisions are generally made, subject to the express terms of the pooling and servicing agreement, by the master servicer,
the special servicer, the certificate administrator and the trustee. Any decision made by any of those parties in respect of the
trust in accordance with the terms of the pooling and servicing agreement, even if it determines that decision to be in your best
interests, may be contrary to the decision that you would have made and may negatively affect your interests.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the directing
certificateholder appointed by the controlling class will have certain consent rights prior to the occurrence and continuance of
such time as the Class E certificates have a certificate balance (taking into account the application of appraisal reductions
to notionally reduce the certificate balance of such class of certificates) that is less than 25% of its initial certificate balance,
and will have certain non-binding consultation rights prior to such time as the Class E certificates have a certificate balance
(without taking into account the application of appraisal reductions to notionally reduce the certificate balance of such class
of certificates) that is less than 25% of its initial certificate balance. See “Servicing
of the Mortgage Loans—The Directing Certificateholder” in this free writing prospectus and “Risk
Factors—Your Lack of Control Over Trust Fund Can Create Risks” in the prospectus.
 
In addition, while there is a senior trust
advisor with certain obligations in respect of reviewing the compliance of the special servicer with certain of its obligations
under the pooling and servicing
 


S-120
 
 
agreement, the senior trust advisor (i) has no control rights over actions by the special
servicer at any time, (ii) has no ability to communicate with or directly influence the activities of the borrowers at any time,
and (iii) has no consultation rights over actions by the special servicer prior to such time as the Class E certificates
have a certificate balance (taking into account the application of appraisal reductions to notionally reduce the certificate balance
of such class of certificates) that is less than 25% of its initial certificate balance. In addition, the senior trust advisor
only has the limited obligations and duties set forth in the pooling and servicing agreement, and the special servicer is under
no obligation at any time to act upon any of the senior trust advisor’s recommendations. In addition, the senior trust advisor
has no (A) fiduciary duty or (B) other duty to act on behalf of the certificateholders or the trust fund or in the best
interest of any particular certificateholder. It is not intended that the senior trust advisor act as a surrogate for the certificateholders.
Investors should not rely on the senior trust advisor to affect the special servicer’s actions under the pooling and servicing
agreement or to monitor the actions of the directing certificateholder or special servicer, other than to the limited extent specifically
required in respect of certain actions of the special servicer at certain prescribed times under the pooling and servicing agreement.
Further, the senior trust advisor will generally have no obligations or consultation rights under the pooling and servicing agreement
for this transaction with respect to any non-serviced whole loan or any related REO Property, which will be or are expected to
be serviced pursuant to separate pooling and servicing agreements. However, Pentalpha Surveillance LLC is the senior trust advisor
under the JPMBB 2015-C31 pooling and servicing agreement, and, in such capacity, has certain obligations and consultation rights
with respect to the Civic Opera Building whole loan that are substantially similar to those of the senior trust advisor under the
pooling and servicing agreement for this transaction. Pentalpha Surveillance LLC is also the senior trust advisor under the JPMBB
2015-C30 pooling and servicing agreement, and, in such capacity, has certain obligations and consultation rights with respect to
the One Shell Square whole loan and the Brunswick Portfolio whole loan that are substantially similar to those of the senior trust
advisor under the pooling and servicing agreement for this transaction. There will be no senior trust advisor under the trust and
servicing agreement entered into in connection with the private CMBS securitization that is expected to govern the servicing and
administration of the U-Haul Portfolio whole loan.
 
In certain limited circumstances, certificateholders
have the right to vote on matters affecting the trust. In some cases these votes are by certificateholders taken as a whole and
in others the vote is by class. In all cases, voting is based on the outstanding certificate balance, which is reduced by realized
losses, and in certain cases, also by appraisal reductions. These limitations on voting could adversely affect your ability to
protect your interests with respect to matters voted on by certificateholders. See “Description of the Certificates—Voting
Rights” and “Transaction Parties—Replacement of the Special Servicer” in this free writing prospectus.
 
In addition, none of the pari passu
companion loans will be included as an asset of the trust fund, but each related whole loan (other than the non-serviced whole
loans) will be serviced under the pooling and servicing agreement for this transaction. The directing certificateholder (or, with
respect to each non-serviced whole loan, the directing certificateholder or controlling class representative for the related securitization)
will have certain rights with respect to the related whole loan and the related mortgaged property or properties, including the
right, under certain conditions, to advise and direct the applicable master servicer and/or the applicable special servicer with
respect to various servicing matters or mortgage loan modifications affecting the related whole loan.
 
The directing certificateholder in this
securitization will have certain consultation rights with respect to actions taken by the directing certificateholder or controlling
class representative under the JPMBB 2015-C31 pooling and servicing agreement in the case of the Civic Opera Building whole loan.
The directing certificateholder in this securitization will also have certain consultation rights with respect to actions taken
by the directing certificateholder or controlling class representative under the trust and servicing agreement entered into in
connection with the private CMBS securitization that is expected to govern the servicing and administration of the U-Haul Portfolio
whole loan in the case of the U-Haul Portfolio whole loan. In addition, the directing certificateholder in this securitization
will have certain consultation rights with respect to actions taken by the directing certificateholder or controlling class representative
under the JPMBB 2015-C30 pooling and servicing agreement in the case of the One Shell Square whole loan and the Brunswick Portfolio
whole loan. No directing certificateholder or controlling class representative (in
 


S-121
 
 
this securitization or the securitization of
any pari passu companion loan), in exercising any
consultation, consent or direction rights, will have any obligation to consider the interests of or the impact on, the holder of
the certificates in any transaction other than the related controlling class for which it is acting. The directing certificateholder
or controlling class representative for any other trust may not have the same incentives with respect to the effects on this trust
as would the directing certificateholder for this securitization.
 
In addition, with respect to mortgage loans
that have mezzanine debt (or permit future mezzanine debt), the related mezzanine lender will usually have the right under certain
limited circumstances to (i) cure certain defaults with respect to, and under certain default scenarios, purchase (without
payment of any yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium) the related mortgage loan and (ii) so long as no event of default
with respect to the related mortgage loan continues after the mezzanine lender’s cure right has expired, approve certain
modifications and consent to certain actions to be taken with respect to the related mortgage loan. See “Description of
the Mortgage Pool—Mortgage Pool Characteristics” and “—Additional Debt” in this
free writing prospectus.
 
Special Servicer May Be Directed
To Take Actions
 
In connection with the servicing of the
mortgage loans (other than the non-serviced mortgage loans), the special servicer may, at the direction of the directing certificateholder
(prior to the occurrence and continuance of a control event and other than with respect to an excluded loan described in “Description
of the Certificates—Reports to Certificateholders; Certain Available Information” in this free writing prospectus),
take actions with respect to such specially serviced mortgage loans that could adversely affect the holders of some or all of the
classes of offered certificates. The directing certificateholder will be controlled by the controlling class certificateholders.
The directing certificateholder may have interests in conflict with those of the other certificateholders. As a result, it is possible
that the directing certificateholder may direct the special servicer to take actions that conflict with the interests of certain
classes of the offered certificates. However, the special servicer is not permitted to take actions that are prohibited by law
or violate the servicing standard or the terms of the mortgage loan documents.
 
In addition, except as limited by certain
conditions described under “Transaction Parties—Replacement
of the Special Servicer”, the special servicer may be removed by the directing certificateholder (a) for cause
at any time and (b) without cause if either (i) LNR Partners, LLC or its affiliate is no longer the special servicer or (ii) LNR
Securities Holdings, LLC or its affiliate owns less than 25% of the controlling class of certificates, in each case, as described
in this free writing prospectus. The special servicer may also be removed in certain circumstances (x) if a request is made
by certificateholders evidencing not less than 25% of the voting rights (taking into account the application of appraisal reductions
to notionally reduce the respective certificate balances) of the certificates (other than the Class X-A, Class X-B, Class X-C,
Class X-D, Class Z and Class R certificates) and (y) upon receipt of approval by certificateholders holding at least
75% of a quorum of the certificateholders (which is the holders of certificates evidencing at least 75% of the voting rights (taking
into account the application of realized losses and the application of appraisal reductions to notionally reduce the respective
certificate balances) of the certificates (other than the Class X-A, Class X-B, Class X-C, Class X-D, Class Z and
Class R certificates)), as described in this free writing prospectus. See “Servicing
of the Mortgage Loans—General”, “Transaction Parties—The
Special Servicer” and “—Replacement of the Special Servicer” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Similarly, (i) the special servicer under
the JPMBB 2015-C31 pooling and servicing agreement may, at the direction of the related directing certificateholder or controlling
class representative, take actions with respect to the Civic Opera Building mortgage loan that could adversely affect the holders
of some or all of the classes of the offered certificates, (ii) the special servicer under the trust and servicing agreement entered
into in connection with the private CMBS securitization that is expected to govern the servicing and administration of the U-Haul
Portfolio whole loan may, at the direction of the related directing certificateholder or controlling class representative, take
actions with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio mortgage loan that could adversely affect the holders of some or all of the classes
of the offered certificates and (iii) the special servicer under the JPMBB 2015-C30 pooling and servicing agreement
 


S-122
 
 
may, at the
direction of the related directing certificateholder or controlling class representative, take actions with respect to the One
Shell Square mortgage loan and the Brunswick Portfolio mortgage loan that could adversely affect the holders of some or all of
the classes of the offered certificates.
 
The directing certificateholder under the
JPMBB 2015-C31 pooling and servicing agreement will exercise its rights in accordance with the related pooling and servicing agreement
and the related intercreditor agreement, pursuant to which the Civic Opera Building mortgage loan and the related companion loan
are serviced. The directing certificateholder or controlling class representative under the trust and servicing agreement entered
into in connection with the private CMBS securitization that is expected to govern the servicing and administration of the U-Haul
Portfolio whole loan will exercise its rights in accordance with the related trust and servicing agreement and the related intercreditor
agreement, pursuant to which the U-Haul Portfolio mortgage loan and the related companion loans are serviced. The directing certificateholder
under the JPMBB 2015-C30 pooling and servicing agreement will exercise its rights in accordance with the related pooling and servicing
agreement and the related intercreditor agreement, pursuant to which the One Shell Square mortgage loan and the Brunswick Portfolio
mortgage loan and the related companion loans are serviced.
 
Each of these parties have interests in
conflict with those of the certificateholders of the classes of the offered certificates in this transaction. As a result, it is
possible that such parties may direct the special servicer under the trust and servicing agreement or pooling and servicing agreement,
as applicable, entered into in connection with the securitization of the related pari
passu companion loans to take actions that conflict with the interests of certain classes of the offered certificates.
However, such special servicer will not be permitted to take actions that are prohibited by law or violate the servicing standards
or breach the terms of the related mortgage loan documents. In addition such special servicer may be removed without cause by the
related directing certificateholder or controlling class representative as described in this free writing prospectus. See “Servicing
of the Mortgage Loans—General”, “—The
Directing Certificateholder”, “Transaction Parties—The
Special Servicer” and “Description of the Mortgage Pool—The Whole Loans—The Civic Opera Building
Whole Loan”, “—The U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan”, “—The One Shell Square Whole
Loan” and “—The Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Furthermore, there will be no senior trust
advisor under the private CMBS securitization that governs the servicing and administration of the U-Haul Portfolio whole loan. 
The special servicer of the U-Haul Portfolio whole loan and the directing certificateholder under such private CMBS securitization
are expected to be the same party. If the U-Haul Portfolio whole loan were to become specially serviced, then after the occurrence
and continuance of a control event under such securitization, or after the occurrence of a consultation termination event under
such securitization, no party would be engaged to review the special servicer’s performance under such securitization or
to determine if the special servicer is acting in accordance with the servicing standard under such securitization, respectively. 
A conflict of interest affecting the duties of the special servicer of the U-Haul Portfolio whole loan under the private CMBS securitization
could adversely affect the holders of some or all of the classes of the offered certificates.
 
The Sponsors, the Depositor
and the Trust Are Subject to Bankruptcy or Insolvency Laws That May Affect the Trust Fund’s Ownership of the Mortgage Loans
 
In the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency
of a sponsor or the depositor, it is possible the trust’s right to payment from or ownership of the mortgage loans could
be challenged, and if such challenge were successful, delays, reductions in payments and/or losses on the certificates could occur.
 
The transfer of the mortgage loans by the
sponsors in connection with this offering is not expected to qualify for the securitization safe harbor adopted by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation for securitizations sponsored by insured depository institutions (12 C.F.R. § 360.6); however,
the safe harbor is non-exclusive.
 
In the case of each sponsor, an opinion
of counsel will be rendered on the closing date, based on certain facts and assumptions and subject to certain qualifications,
to the effect that the transfer of the applicable mortgage loans by such sponsor to the depositor would generally be respected
in the event of
 


S-123
 
 
a bankruptcy or insolvency of such sponsor. Nevertheless, we cannot assure you that the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, a bankruptcy trustee, if applicable, or another interested party would not attempt to assert that such transfer was
not a sale. Even if a challenge were not successful, it is possible that payments on the offered certificates would be delayed
while a court resolves the claim.
 
In addition, since the trust is a common
law trust, it may not be eligible for relief under the federal bankruptcy laws, unless it can be characterized as a “business
trust” for purposes of the federal bankruptcy laws. Bankruptcy courts look at various considerations in making this determination,
so it is not possible to predict with any certainty whether or not the trust would be characterized as a “business trust”.
Regardless of whether a bankruptcy court ultimately determines that the trust is a “business trust”, it is possible
that payments on the offered certificates would be delayed while the court resolved the issue.
 
Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act provides for an orderly liquidation authority under which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
can be appointed as receiver of certain U.S. non-bank financial companies and their direct or indirect subsidiaries in certain
cases if it is determined that their failure would have adverse effects on U.S. financial stability. We make no representation
as to whether this would or could apply to any of the sponsors. In January 2011, the acting general counsel of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation issued a letter in which he expressed his view that, under then-existing regulations, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, as receiver under the orderly liquidation authority, would not, in the exercise of its orderly liquidation
authority repudiation powers, recover as property of a financial company assets transferred by the financial company; provided
that the transfer satisfies the conditions for the exclusion of assets from the financial company’s estate under the bankruptcy
code. The letter further noted that, while the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation staff may be considering recommending further
regulations under orderly liquidation authority, the acting general counsel would recommend that such regulations incorporate a
90 day transition period for any provisions affecting the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s statutory power to disaffirm
or repudiate contracts. If, however, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation were to adopt a different approach than that described
in the acting general counsel’s letter, delays or reductions in payments on the offered certificates would occur.
 
Barclays, a loan seller, is subject to the
provisions of the Insolvency Act 1986 (United Kingdom Act of Parliament, 1986 ch. 45) (the “Insolvency Act”)
and the Banking Act 2009 (United Kingdom Act of Parliament, 2009 ch. 1) (the “Banking Act”). Under the terms
of the Insolvency Act, certain transactions by an English-registered company, such as Barclays, may be challenged by an insolvency
officer appointed to that company on its insolvency. Under the Banking Act, the Secretary of State, Prudential Regulation Authority,
or Bank of England can apply to the court for implementation of an insolvency regime specifically for certain deposit-taking institutions.
One aspect of this regime is that an insolvency officer will conduct the relevant insolvency process in such a manner as to promote
protection of retail deposits held by such an institution (in combination with the United Kingdom Financial Services Compensation
Scheme). Further, under the Banking Act, the UK Treasury, the Prudential Regulation Authority and/or the Bank of England may also,
in the circumstances set out in the Banking Act, make an order for the transfer of any property, assets or liabilities of a UK
authorized deposit taker either to a company owned by the Bank of England or to any private sector purchaser. Orders under the
Banking Act may also modify the way in which rights of third parties can be exercised. These powers exist within a broader range
of powers designed to ensure the stability of the UK banking sector and exercise of such may have an impact on the rights of third
parties relative to Barclays. An opinion of counsel will be rendered on the closing date, based on certain facts and assumptions
and subject to certain qualifications, to the effect that the transfer of Barclays’ interest in the mortgage loan by Barclays
will constitute a true sale of such assets. Nevertheless, we cannot assure you that an interested party would not attempt to assert
that such transfer was not a sale nor challenge the transaction under UK insolvency rules, nor that the transfer could not be affected
by an order under the Banking Act. Even if a challenge were not successful, or if an order under the Banking Act itself was successfully
challenged, resolution of such a matter could cause significant delay which may impact on payments under the certificates.
 


S-124
 
 
If Barclays were acting through its New
York branch, and were to become the subject of an insolvency proceeding under the laws of the United Kingdom and a proceeding were
initiated under Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code or the New York Superintendent of Financial Services were to take possession
of the New York branch, it is possible that the New York Superintendent of Financial Services, a creditor or trustee in bankruptcy
of Barclays may argue that the sale of its interest in the mortgage loan by Barclays was a pledge of the receivables rather than
a sale. The New York Superintendent of Financial Services, a creditor, a bankruptcy trustee or another interested party could still
attempt to assert that the transfer of Barclays’ interest in the mortgage loan was not a sale. If such party’s challenge
is successful, payments on the certificates would be reduced or delayed. Even if the challenge is not successful, payments on the
certificates could be delayed while a court resolves the claim.
 
Risks Relating to the Exchangeable
Certificates and Class EC Certificates
 
The characteristics of the Class EC
certificates will reflect, in the aggregate, the characteristics of the exchangeable certificates that make up the components of
such class. As a result, the Class EC certificates will be subject to the same risks as each exchangeable certificate described
in this free writing prospectus. Investors are encouraged to also consider a number of factors that will limit a certificateholder’s
ability to exchange and convert exchangeable certificates for Class EC certificates and vice versa:
 

·At the time of a proposed exchange and conversion, a certificateholder must own exchangeable certificates in the requisite
exchange proportion to make the desired exchange and conversion.
 

·A certificateholder that does not own each class of the exchangeable certificates in the requisite exchange proportion may
be unable to obtain the necessary exchangeable certificates because the holders of the needed certificates may be unwilling or
unable to sell them or because the necessary certificates have been placed into other financial structures.
 

·Principal distributions will decrease the amounts available for exchange and conversion over time and once any class of exchangeable
certificates has been reduced to zero as a result of such class being paid all interest and principal on such class in full or
through the allocation of collateral support deficits, conversions will no longer be permissible.
 

·Certificates may only be held in authorized denominations.
 
Risks Relating to Prepayments
and Repurchases
 
The yield to maturity on your certificates
will depend, in significant part, upon the rate and timing of principal payments on the mortgage loans. For this purpose, principal
payments include both voluntary prepayments, if permitted, and involuntary prepayments, such as prepayments resulting from casualty
or condemnation, defaults and liquidations or repurchases upon breaches of representations and warranties or document defects.
 
In addition, it is important to note that
previously issued commercial mortgage-backed securities (including, potentially, certain commercial mortgage-backed securities
sponsored by JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, Barclays Bank PLC, Starwood Mortgage Funding II LLC, MC-Five Mile
Commercial Mortgage Finance LLC, Redwood Commercial Mortgage Corporation, RAIT Funding, LLC or affiliates of any of those parties)
have recently experienced greater losses than expected, and in certain circumstances significantly greater losses, as a result
of defaults and liquidations of the mortgage loans that comprise those commercial mortgage-backed securities. We cannot assure
you that the losses actually incurred with respect to the mortgage loans that back the offered certificates will not similarly
exceed any assumed or expected losses. See “Yield and Maturity
Considerations” in this free writing prospectus.
 
The yield on each of the classes of certificates
that have a pass-through rate equal to, limited by, or based on, the weighted average mortgage rate could (or in the case of any
class of certificates with a
 


S-125
 
 
pass-through rate equal to, or based on, the weighted average mortgage rate, would) be adversely affected
if mortgage loans with higher interest rates pay faster than the mortgage loans with lower interest rates. The pass-through rates
on these classes of certificates may also be adversely affected as a result of a decrease in the weighted average of the net mortgage
rates on the mortgage loans even if principal prepayments do not occur. See “Yield
and Maturity Considerations” in this free writing prospectus.
 
The Class X-A and Class X-B certificates
will not be entitled to distributions of principal but instead will accrue interest on their respective notional amounts. Because
the notional amount of the Class X-A certificates is based upon the outstanding aggregate certificate balances of the Class A-1,
Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5, Class A-SB and Class A-S certificates (determined without
giving effect to any exchange and conversion of any Class A-S certificates for Class EC certificates) and the notional
amount of the Class X-B certificates is based upon the outstanding certificate balance of the Class B certificates (determined
without giving effect to any exchange and conversion of any Class B certificates for Class EC certificates), the yield
to maturity on the Class X-A and Class X-B certificates will be extremely sensitive to the rate and timing of prepayments
of principal, liquidations and principal losses on the mortgage loans to the extent allocated to the related classes of certificates.
In particular, the Class X-A certificates (and to a lesser extent, the Class X-B certificates) will be sensitive to prepayments
on the mortgage loans because the prepayments will have the effect of reducing the notional amount of the Class X-A certificates
first. A rapid rate of principal prepayments, liquidations and/or principal losses on the mortgage loans could result in the failure
to recoup the initial investment in the Class X-A certificates and then the Class X-B certificates. Investors in the Class X-A
and Class X-B certificates should fully consider the associated risks, including the risk that an extremely rapid rate of amortization,
prepayment or other liquidation of the mortgage loans could result in the failure of such investors to recoup fully their initial
investments.
 
In addition, with respect to the Class A-SB
certificates, the extent to which the planned balances are achieved and the sensitivity of the Class A-SB certificates to
principal prepayments on the mortgage loans will depend in part on the period of time during which the Class A-1, Class A-2,
Class A-3, Class A-4 and Class A-5 certificates remain outstanding. As such, the Class A-SB certificates will
become more sensitive to the rate of prepayments on the mortgage loans than they were when the Class A-1, Class A-2,
Class A-3, Class A-4 and Class A-5 certificates were outstanding.
 
The investment performance of your certificates
may vary materially and adversely from your expectations if the actual rate of prepayment on the mortgage loans is higher or lower
than you anticipate.
 
Any changes in the weighted average lives
of your certificates may adversely affect your yield. Prepayments resulting in a shortening of weighted average lives of your certificates
may be made at a time of low interest rates when you may be unable to reinvest the resulting payment of principal on your certificates
at a rate comparable to the effective yield anticipated by you in making your investment in the certificates, while delays and
extensions resulting in a lengthening of those weighted average lives may occur at a time of high interest rates when you may have
been able to reinvest principal payments that would otherwise have been received by you at higher rates.
 
In addition, the extent to which prepayments
on the mortgage loans in the trust fund ultimately affect the average life of the offered certificates will depend on the terms
of the offered certificates, more particularly:
 

·A class of offered certificates that entitles the holders of those certificates to a disproportionately larger share of the
prepayments on the mortgage loans increases the “call risk” or the likelihood of early retirement of that class if
the rate of prepayment is relatively fast; and
 

·A class of offered certificates that entitles the holders of the offered certificates to a disproportionately smaller share
of the prepayments on the mortgage loans increases the likelihood of “extension risk” or an extended average life of
that class if the rate of prepayment is relatively slow.

in this free writing prospectus.
 


S-126
 
 
Although the mortgage loans generally have
prepayment protection in the form of lockout periods and/or one or more of the following: (a) defeasance, (b) yield maintenance
or (c) prepayment premium provisions, we cannot assure you that the related borrowers will refrain from prepaying their related
mortgage loans due to the existence of yield maintenance charges or prepayment premiums or that involuntary prepayments will not
occur.
 
There are nineteen (19) mortgage loans identified
as “Hilton Suites Chicago Magnificent Mile”, “Civic Opera Building”, “First National Building”,
“One Shell Square”, “Waterstone Apartments”, “Hilton Atlanta Perimeter”, “Brunswick Portfolio”,
“New Center One Building”, “North Miami Business Park”, “Town & Country Shopping Center”,
“780 Dedham Street”, “Colony Village”, “Guardian Self Storage - Liberty Avenue”, “Brynn
Marr Village”, “Best Western – Leesburg, VA”, “Comfort Inn – Staunton, VA”, “Bedford
Square I & II”, “Chippewa Towne Centre”, and “Comfort Inn – Woodstock, VA” on
Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing approximately 35.2% of the aggregate principal balance of the pool
of mortgage loans as of the cut-off date, that permit prepayment together with the payment of a yield maintenance premium, generally
following the end of a lockout period of at least twenty-three (23) due dates from and including the first payment date.
 
We are not aware of any relevant publicly
available or authoritative statistics with respect to the historical prepayment experiences of commercial mortgage loans. However,
the rate at which voluntary prepayments occur on the mortgage loans will be affected by a variety of factors, including:
 

·the terms of the related mortgage loans;
 

·the length of any prepayment lockout period;
 

·the level of prevailing interest rates;
 

·the availability of mortgage credit;
 

·any applicable yield maintenance charges and prepayment premiums;
 

·the master servicer’s or special servicer’s ability to enforce those yield maintenance charges or prepayment premiums;
 

·the failure to meet certain requirements for the release of escrows;
 

·the occurrence of casualties or natural disasters; and
 

·economic, demographic, tax, legal or other factors.
 
In addition, the rate at which voluntary
prepayments occur may also be impacted by the existence of any purchase options related to a mortgaged property. The exercise of
the purchase option could occur during what would otherwise be a lockout/defeasance period. The resulting prepayment is required
to be accompanied by a yield maintenance charge. See “Yield and Maturity Considerations” in this free writing
prospectus. Further, the rate at which voluntary prepayments occur may also be impacted by the ability of borrowers with respect
to certain mortgage loans to affect a paydown of amounts owing under the related mortgage loan documents in connection with a release
of a particular related mortgaged property or a portion of the related mortgaged property or by the application of earnout reserves
to pay down a mortgage loan as a result of the related borrower’s failure to satisfy the conditions for a release of the
reserves, in any event during periods in which prepayments on the mortgage loan were otherwise prohibited. See “Description
of the Mortgage Pool—Mortgaged Property Considerations—Tenant Issues” and “—Certain Terms
and Conditions of the Mortgage Loans—Releases of Individual Mortgaged Properties” in this free writing prospectus
for additional information relating to prepayment provisions on certain mortgage loans in the trust.
 
We cannot assure you that the obligation
to pay any yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium will be enforceable. See “—Risks
Relating to Prepayments and Repurchases” in this free writing prospectus. Provisions requiring yield maintenance
charges or prepayment premiums may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions and under federal bankruptcy law. Those provisions
also may be
 


S-127
 
 
interpreted as constituting the collection of interest for usury purposes. Also, we cannot assure you that liquidation
proceeds will be sufficient to pay an enforceable yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium. Generally, no yield maintenance
charge or prepayment premium will be required for prepayments in connection with a casualty or condemnation. In addition, certain
of the mortgage loans permit the related borrower, after a partial casualty or partial condemnation or a change in applicable laws
that would allow a lender to accelerate the related mortgage loan pursuant to the related mortgage loan documents, to prepay the
remaining principal balance of the mortgage loan (after application of the related insurance proceeds or condemnation award to
pay the principal balance of the mortgage loan), which may in certain cases not be accompanied by any prepayment consideration;
provided that the prepayment of the remaining balance is
made within a specified period of time following the date of the application of proceeds or award and/or no event of default has
occurred and is continuing under the mortgage loan. See “Risk
Factors—Risks Relating to Enforceability of Yield Maintenance Charges, Prepayment Premiums or Defeasance Provisions”
in the prospectus.
 
Additionally, although the collateral substitution
provisions related to defeasance do not have the same effect on the certificateholders as prepayment, we cannot assure you that
a court would not interpret those provisions as requiring a yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium. In certain jurisdictions,
those collateral substitution provisions might be deemed unenforceable under applicable law or public policy, or usurious.
 
Certain shortfalls in interest as a result
of involuntary prepayments may reduce the available distribution amount. In addition, if a mortgage loan seller repurchases any
mortgage loan from the trust due to breaches of representations or warranties or document defects, the repurchase price paid with
respect to such mortgage loan will be passed through to the holders of the offered certificates with the same effect as if the
mortgage loan had been prepaid in part or in full, and no yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium will be payable. Mezzanine
lenders may have the option to purchase the related mortgage loan after certain defaults, and the purchase price may not include
any yield maintenance payments or prepayment charges. In addition, certain of the mortgage loans are secured by mortgaged properties
that have franchisors, tenants or other parties that have an option to purchase the mortgaged property. See “—Certain
Additional Risks Relating to Tenants” above. A repurchase or the exercise of such a purchase option may adversely affect
the yield to maturity on the offered certificates.
 
Certain of the mortgage loans are secured
in part by letters of credit and/or cash reserves that in each such case:
 
                 
(i)   will be released to the related borrower, in
whole or in part, upon satisfaction by that borrower of certain performance related conditions, which may include, in some cases,
meeting debt service coverage ratio levels and/or satisfying leasing conditions; and
 
                
(ii)   if not so released, may, at the discretion
of the lender, prior to loan maturity (or earlier loan default or loan acceleration), be drawn on and/or applied to prepay or defease
the related mortgage loan if such performance related conditions are not satisfied within specified time periods.
 
In addition, with respect to certain of
the mortgage loans, if the borrower does not satisfy the performance conditions and does not qualify for the release of the related
cash reserve, the reserve, less, in some cases, a yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium (which, in some cases, may be
paid out of the related additional collateral), may be applied to reduce the principal balance of the mortgage loan and the remaining
unpaid balance of the mortgage loan may be re-amortized over the remaining amortization term. If such amount is used to prepay
or defease the mortgage loan as described in paragraph (ii) above, there is no obligation on the part of the related
borrower to replenish such cash reserves.
 
Optional Early Termination
of the Trust Fund May Result in an Adverse Impact on Your Yield or May Result in a Loss
 
The certificates will be subject to optional
early termination by means of the purchase of the mortgage loans and any REO properties in the trust fund. We cannot assure you
that the proceeds from a sale of
 


S-128
 
 
the mortgage loans and/or REO properties will be sufficient to distribute the outstanding certificate
balance plus accrued interest and any undistributed shortfalls in interest accrued on the certificates that are subject to the
termination. Accordingly, the holders of offered certificates affected by such a termination may suffer an adverse impact on the
overall yield on their certificates, may experience repayment of their investment at an unpredictable and inopportune time or may
even incur a loss on their investment. See “Description of the
Certificates—Termination; Retirement of Certificates” in this free writing prospectus.
 
The Mortgage Loan Sellers
May Not Be Able To Make a Required Repurchase or Substitution of a Defective Mortgage Loan
 
The related mortgage loan seller is the
sole warranting party in respect of the mortgage loans sold by it to us. However, Starwood Mortgage Capital LLC, Redwood Trust,
Inc. and RAIT Financial Trust will guarantee the performance of Starwood Mortgage Funding II LLC’s, Redwood Commercial
Mortgage Corporation’s and RAIT Funding, LLC’s obligations, respectively, to repurchase or replace defective mortgage
loans. Neither we nor any of our affiliates (except, in certain circumstances, for JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association solely
in its capacity as a mortgage loan seller) are obligated to repurchase or substitute any mortgage loan in connection with either
a material breach of a mortgage loan seller’s representations and warranties or any material document defects, if the applicable
mortgage loan seller defaults on its obligation to do so. We cannot assure you that the loan sellers or, notwithstanding the existence
of any guarantee, the related guarantor, will effect or cause, as applicable, such a repurchase or substitution. If any mortgage
loan seller fails to fulfill such obligation, you could experience cash flow disruptions or losses on your certificates. In addition,
the mortgage loan sellers (or Starwood Mortgage Capital LLC, Redwood Trust Inc. or RAIT Financial Trust, as applicable, as guarantor
of the repurchase and substitution obligations of Starwood Mortgage Funding II LLC, Redwood Commercial Mortgage Corporation
and RAIT Funding, LLC, respectively) may have various legal defenses available to them in connection with a repurchase or substitution
obligation. See “Transaction Parties—The Sponsors and Mortgage Loan Sellers—Starwood Mortgage Funding II
LLC”, “Redwood Commercial Mortgage Corporation” and “—RAIT Funding, LLC”
in this free writing prospectus. Any mortgage loan that is not repurchased or substituted and that is not a “qualified mortgage”
for a REMIC may cause designated portions of the trust fund to fail to qualify as one or more REMICs or cause the trust fund to
incur a tax. See “Transaction Parties—The Sponsors and Mortgage
Loan Sellers” and “Description of the Mortgage
Pool—Representations and Warranties; Repurchases and Substitutions” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Realization on Certain Mortgage
Loans May Be Adversely Affected by the Rights of the Holder of the Related Mezzanine Lender
 
Mezzanine lenders commonly hold a defaulted
mortgage loan purchase option pursuant to the related intercreditor agreement, which generally permits the mezzanine lender to
purchase its related defaulted mortgage loan for a purchase price generally equal to the outstanding principal balance of the related
defaulted mortgage loan, together with accrued and unpaid interest (exclusive of default interest) on, and unpaid servicing expenses
and fees, protective advances and interest on advances related to, such defaulted mortgage loan. However, in the event that such
party is not obligated to pay some or all of those fees and additional expenses, including any liquidation fee payable to the special
servicer under the terms of the pooling and servicing agreement, then the exercise of such party’s rights under the intercreditor
agreement to purchase the related mortgage loan from the trust may result in a loss to the trust in the amount of those fees and
additional expenses. Furthermore, a mezzanine lender generally has the right to cure defaults under the related defaulted mortgage
loan, thereby delaying the mortgagee’s ability to realize on or otherwise take action with respect to such defaulted mortgage
loan.
 
Limited Obligations
 
The certificates, when issued, will represent
beneficial interests in the trust fund. The certificates will not represent an interest in, or obligation of, the sponsors, the
mortgage loan sellers, the depositor, the master servicer, the special servicer, the certificate administrator, the trustee or
any other person. The
 


S-129
 
 
primary assets of the trust fund will be the notes evidencing the mortgage loans, and the primary security
and source of payment for the mortgage loans will be the mortgaged properties and the other collateral described in this free writing
prospectus. Payments on the offered certificates are expected to be derived from payments made by the borrowers on or in respect
of the mortgage loans. We cannot assure you that the cash flow from the mortgaged properties and the proceeds of any sale or refinancing
of the mortgaged properties will be sufficient to pay the principal of, and interest on, the mortgage loans or to distribute in
full the amounts of interest and principal to which the holders of the offered certificates are entitled. See “Description
of the Certificates—General” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Changes to Accounting Standards
and Regulatory Restrictions Could Have an Adverse Impact on the Certificates
 
None of the issuing entity, the depositor,
the sponsors or the underwriters make any representation or warranty regarding any accounting implications related to the offered
certificates. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted changes to the accounting standards for structured products.
These changes, or any other future changes, may impact the accounting for entities such as the trust and could require the trust
to be consolidated in an investor’s financial statements. Each investor in the offered certificates should consult its accounting
advisor to determine the impact these accounting changes might have as a result of an investment in the offered certificates.
 
Tax Consequences Related
to Foreclosure
 
If the trust were to acquire a mortgaged
property subsequent to a default on the related mortgage loan pursuant to a foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, the special
servicer would be required to retain an independent contractor to operate and manage such mortgaged property. Among other things,
the independent contractor would not be able to perform construction work other than repair, maintenance or certain types of tenant
build-outs, unless such construction was more than 10% completed when the default on the related mortgage loan became imminent.
Any (i) net income from such operation and management (other than qualifying “rents from real property”), (ii) rental
income based on the net profits of a tenant or sub-tenant or allocable to a service that is noncustomary in the area and for the
type of property involved, and (iii) rental income attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of
real property if the rent attributable to that personal property exceeds 15% of the total rent at the related mortgaged property
for the taxable year, will subject the related REMIC to federal (and possibly state or local) tax on such income at the highest
marginal corporate tax rate (currently 35%), thereby reducing net proceeds available for distribution to certificateholders. No
determination has been made whether any portion of the income from the mortgaged property constitutes “rents from real property”.
The pooling and servicing agreement provides that the special servicer will be permitted to cause the REMICs to earn “net
income from foreclosure property” that is subject to tax if it determines that the net after-tax benefit to certificateholders
is greater than another method of operating, e.g., net leasing
the mortgaged property. See “Material Federal Income Tax Consequences” in this free writing prospectus. In addition,
if the trust were to acquire any mortgaged property pursuant to a foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, upon acquisition
of those mortgaged properties, the trust may in certain jurisdictions, particularly in New York, be required to pay state or local
transfer or excise taxes upon liquidation of such properties. Such state or local taxes may reduce net proceeds available for distribution
to the certificateholders.
 
State and Local Tax Considerations
 
In addition to the federal income tax consequences
described under the heading “Material Federal Income Tax Consequences”
in this free writing prospectus, potential purchasers should consider the state and local income tax consequences of the acquisition,
ownership and disposition of the certificates. State and local income tax laws may differ substantially from the corresponding
federal tax laws, and this free writing prospectus does not purport to describe any aspects of the income tax laws of the states
or localities in which the mortgaged properties are located or of any other applicable state or locality.
 


S-130
 
 
It is possible that one or more jurisdictions
may attempt to tax nonresident holders of certificates solely by reason of the location in that jurisdiction of the depositor,
the certificate administrator, the trustee, the related borrower or the mortgaged properties or on some other basis, may require
nonresident holders of certificates to file returns in such jurisdiction or may attempt to impose penalties for failure to file
such returns; and it is possible that any such jurisdiction will ultimately succeed in collecting such taxes or penalties from
nonresident holders of certificates. We cannot assure you that holders of certificates will not be subject to tax in any particular
state or local taxing jurisdiction.
 
If any tax or penalty is successfully asserted
by any state or local taxing jurisdiction, none of the depositor, the related borrower, the certificate administrator, the trustee,
the master servicer or the special servicer will be obligated to indemnify or otherwise to reimburse the holders of certificates
therefor.
 
Potential purchasers should consult their
own tax advisors with respect to the various state and local tax consequences of an investment in the certificates.
 
Ratings of the Certificates
 
The ratings assigned to the offered certificates
by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Fitch Ratings, Inc., DBRS, Inc. and Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Inc. are based, among other
things, on the economic characteristics of the mortgaged properties and other relevant structural features of the transaction.
A security rating does not represent any assessment of the yield to maturity that a certificateholder may experience. The ratings
assigned to the offered certificates reflect only the views of the respective rating agencies as of the date such ratings were
issued. Future events could have an adverse impact on such ratings. The ratings may be reviewed, revised, suspended, downgraded,
qualified or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agency as a result of changes in or unavailability of information. The
ratings do not consider to what extent the offered certificates will be subject to prepayment or that the outstanding principal
amount of any class of the offered certificates will be prepaid.
 
Furthermore, the amount, type and nature
of credit support, if any, provided with respect to the offered certificates are determined on the basis of criteria established
by each rating agency. These criteria are sometimes based upon analysis of the behavior of mortgage loans in a larger group. However,
we cannot assure you that the historical data supporting that analysis will accurately reflect future experience, or that the data
derived from a large pool of mortgage loans will accurately predict the delinquency, foreclosure or loss experience of the mortgage
loans in the trust. As evidenced by the significant amount of downgrades, qualifications and withdrawals of ratings assigned to
previously issued commercial mortgage-backed securities during the recent credit crisis by the hired rating agencies and other
nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, the assumptions by the rating agencies engaged by the depositor and other
nationally recognized statistical rating organizations regarding the performance of the mortgage loans related to such commercial
mortgage-backed securities were not, in all cases, correct.
 
We are not obligated to maintain any particular
rating with respect to any class of the offered certificates, and the ratings initially assigned to the offered certificates by
any or all of the rating agencies engaged by the depositor to rate the offered certificates could change adversely as a result
of changes affecting, among other things, the underlying mortgage loans, the mortgaged properties, the sponsors, the certificate
administrator, the trustee, the senior trust advisor, the master servicer or the special servicer, or as a result of changes to
ratings criteria employed by any or all of the rating agencies engaged by the depositor to rate the offered certificates. Although
these changes would not necessarily be or result from an event of default on any underlying mortgage loan, any adverse change to
the ratings of the offered certificates would likely have an adverse effect on the market value, liquidity and/or regulatory characteristics
of those certificates. Changes affecting the mortgaged properties, the trustee, the certificate administrator, the master servicer,
the special servicer or another person may have an adverse effect on the ratings of the offered certificates, and thus on the liquidity,
market value and regulatory characteristics of the offered certificates, although such adverse changes would not necessarily be
an event of default under any related mortgage loan. See “Ratings” in this free writing prospectus.
 


S-131
 
 
Further, a rating of any class of offered
certificates below an investment grade rating by any of the rating agencies engaged by the depositor or another nationally recognized
statistical rating organization, whether initially or as a result of a ratings downgrade, could adversely affect the ability of
a benefit plan or other investor to purchase or retain that class. See “Certain ERISA Considerations” and “Legal
Investment” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Although the depositor will prepay fees
for ongoing rating surveillance by certain of the rating agencies engaged by the depositor, the depositor has no obligation or
ability to ensure that any rating agency performs ratings surveillance. In addition, a rating agency may cease ratings surveillance
if the information furnished to that rating agency is insufficient to allow it to perform surveillance.
 
The depositor has requested a rating on
the offered certificates from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Fitch Ratings, Inc., DBRS, Inc. and Kroll Bond Rating Agency,
Inc. We cannot assure you as to whether such rating agencies will rate each class of offered certificates or, if they were to rate
only certain class of offered certificates, what rating would be assigned to the other classes of offered certificates. Additionally,
we cannot assure you as to whether another nationally recognized statistical rating organization will rate any class of the offered
certificates or, if it were to rate any class of offered certificates, what rating would be assigned by it. Additionally, other
nationally recognized statistical rating organizations that we have not engaged to rate the offered certificates may nevertheless
issue unsolicited credit ratings on one or more classes of the offered certificates and any of Moody’s Investors Service,
Inc., Fitch Ratings, Inc., DBRS, Inc. and Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Inc. may issue unsolicited credit ratings on one or more classes
of offered certificates that it ultimately did not rate, relying on information they receive pursuant to Rule 17g-5 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise. If any such unsolicited ratings are issued, we cannot assure you
that they will not be different from the ratings assigned by the rating agencies engaged by the depositor. The issuance of an unsolicited
rating of a class of the offered certificates that is lower than the ratings assigned by the rating agencies engaged by the depositor
may adversely impact the liquidity, market value and regulatory characteristics of that class. As part of the process of obtaining
ratings for the offered certificates, the depositor had initial discussions with and submitted certain materials to DBRS, Inc.,
Fitch Ratings, Inc., Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Inc., Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC.
Based on preliminary feedback from those nationally recognized statistical rating organizations at that time, the depositor selected
four of them to rate the offered certificates (although Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Fitch Ratings, Inc., DBRS, Inc.
and Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Inc. may not ultimately issue ratings on all the offered certificates), and did not select the other
nationally recognized statistical rating organization due, in part, to their initial subordination levels for the various classes
of the offered certificates. Had the depositor selected the other nationally recognized statistical rating organization to rate
the offered certificates, we cannot assure you as to the ratings that it would ultimately have assigned to the offered certificates.
In addition, had the depositor engaged each of Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Fitch Ratings, Inc., DBRS, Inc. and Kroll
Bond Rating Agency, Inc. to rate all classes of the offered certificates, the ratings of those classes of the offered certificates
that were not ultimately rated by one or more of those rating agencies may have been different, and potentially lower, than the
ratings ultimately assigned to the offered certificates. In the case of Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings,
Inc., the depositor only requested ratings for certain classes of rated certificates, due in part to the final subordination levels
provided by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch Ratings, Inc., as applicable, for such classes of certificates. If the
depositor had selected either Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch Ratings, Inc. to rate those other classes of rated
certificates not rated by it, its ratings of those other certificates may have been different, and potentially lower, than those
ratings ultimately assigned to those certificates by DBRS, Inc. and Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Inc. Although unsolicited ratings
may be issued by any nationally recognized statistical rating organization, a nationally recognized statistical rating organization
might be more likely to issue an unsolicited rating if it was not selected after having provided preliminary feedback to the depositor.
The decision not to engage Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings, Inc. in the rating of certain classes of offered
certificates to be issued in connection with this transaction, may negatively impact the liquidity, market value and regulatory
characteristics of those classes of certificates. In addition, neither the depositor nor any other person or entity will have any
duty to notify you if any other nationally recognized statistical rating organization issues, or delivers notice of its intention
to issue, unsolicited ratings on one or more classes of the offered certificates after the date of
 


S-132
 
 
this free writing prospectus.
In no event will rating agency confirmations from any such other nationally recognized statistical rating organization (except
insofar as the matter involves a mortgage loan with a split loan structure and such other rating organization is hired to rate
securities backed by the related companion loan) be a condition to any action, or the exercise of any right, power or privilege
by any person or entity under the pooling and servicing agreement.
 
Certain actions provided for in the mortgage
loan agreements require, as a condition to taking such action, that a rating agency confirmation be obtained from each of the rating
agencies engaged by the depositor. In certain circumstances, this condition may be deemed to have been met or waived without any
such rating agency confirmation being obtained. In the event such an action is taken without a rating agency confirmation being
obtained, we cannot assure you that the applicable rating agency will not downgrade, qualify or withdraw its ratings on the certificates
as a result of the taking of such action. If you invest in the certificates, the terms of the pooling and servicing agreement will
be binding on you, and as a result, you should be aware of the procedures relating to no downgrade confirmations described under
the definition of “Rating Agency Confirmation” in “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Rating Agency Confirmations”
in this free writing prospectus.
 
Furthermore, the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission may determine that any or all of the rating agencies engaged by the depositor to rate the offered certificates
no longer qualifies as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, or is no longer qualified to rate the offered certificates,
and that determination may have an adverse effect on the liquidity, market value and regulatory characteristics of the offered
certificates. See “Ratings” in this free writing prospectus.

Description
of the Mortgage Pool
 
General
 
The trust will consist primarily of a pool
of eighty-nine (89) fixed rate commercial mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1,148,162,649 as
of the Cut-off Date (the “Initial Pool Balance”).
 
On or about October 29, 2015 (the “Closing
Date”), J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., as depositor, will acquire the mortgage loans
from JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“JPMCB”),
Barclays Bank PLC (“Barclays”), Starwood
Mortgage Funding II LLC (“SMF II”), MC-Five Mile Commercial Mortgage Finance LLC (“MC-Five
Mile”), Redwood Commercial Mortgage Corporation (“RCMC”) and RAIT Funding, LLC (“RAIT”),
pursuant to a separate mortgage loan purchase agreement with each mortgage loan seller (each, a “Purchase
Agreement”). We will then assign our interests in the mortgage loans, without recourse, to Wilmington Trust, National
Association, as trustee for the benefit of the holders of the certificates (each, a “Certificateholder”).
 
The “Cut-off
Date” with respect to each mortgage loan is the related due date in October 2015, or with respect to any mortgage
loan that has its first due date in November 2015, the date that would have otherwise been the related due date in October 2015.
All percentages of the mortgage loans and Mortgaged Properties, or of any specified group of mortgage loans and Mortgaged Properties,
referred to in this free writing prospectus without further description are approximate percentages by Cut-off Date Balances and/or
allocated loan amounts.
 
The “Cut-off
Date Balance” of any mortgage loan will be the unpaid principal balance of that mortgage loan as of the Cut-off
Date for such mortgage loan after application of all payments due on or before that date, whether or not received.
 
The mortgage loans were originated in the
period between March 6, 2015 and September 22, 2015 and were selected for this transaction from mortgage loans specifically originated
for securitizations of this type by the mortgage loan sellers and their respective affiliates, or originated or co-originated by
or with others and/or acquired by the mortgage loan sellers specifically for a securitization of this type, in either case, taking
into account, among other factors, rating agency criteria and anticipated feedback from investors in the most subordinate certificates,
property type and geographic location. Forty-one (41) mortgage loans, representing approximately 42.5% of the Initial Pool Balance,
will not have made any scheduled debt service payments as of the related Cut-off Date.
 
As of the Cut-off Date, none of the mortgage
loans will be 30 days or more delinquent and none of the mortgage loans have been 30 days or more delinquent since origination.
A mortgage loan will be treated as 30 days delinquent if the scheduled payment for a due date is not received from the related
borrower by the immediately following due date.
 
The mortgage loans are not insured or guaranteed
by the sponsors, the mortgage loan sellers or any other person or entity. You should consider all of the mortgage loans to be nonrecourse
loans as to which recourse in the case of default will be limited to the specific property and other assets, if any, pledged to
secure the related mortgage loan.
 
As used in this free writing prospectus,
the term “mortgage loan” refers to the mortgage loans that are assets of the trust, which will be either (i) a
whole mortgage loan, (ii) in the case of any of the Civic Opera Building Whole Loan, the First National Building Whole Loan,
the One Shell Square Whole Loan, the Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan, the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Whole Loan, the Brunswick
Portfolio Whole Loan and the New Center One Building Whole Loan (each as described below), only the related mortgage loan but not
any related Pari Passu Companion Loan or (iii) in the case of the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan (as described below), only the
related mortgage loan but not the related Pari Passu Companion Loans or the related Subordinate Companion Loan. See “Description
of Top Ten Mortgage Loans and Additional Mortgage Loan Information” in Annex A-3 to this free writing prospectus
for additional descriptions of these mortgage loans.
 


S-134
 
 
Lenders typically look to the “debt
yield” and/or “debt service coverage ratio” or “DSCR”, each of which is based on the property’s
net operating income, and the “Loan-to-Value Ratio” or “LTV Ratio” as important factors in evaluating the
risk of default on that loan and the likelihood of recovery of the principal balance of the loan in the event of a default and
liquidation. See “Description of the Trust Funds—Mortgage Loans—Default and Loss Considerations with Respect
to the Mortgage Loans” in the prospectus for a description of debt service coverage ratios, net operating income, LTV
Ratios and debt yield, the manner in which these terms are calculated and important considerations related to their use.
 
Mortgage Pool Characteristics
 
General
 
For a discussion of the presentation of
statistical information on the mortgage loans and Mortgaged Properties described in this free writing prospectus and the related
Annexes, see “—Additional Mortgage Loan Information”. Calculations of debt service coverage ratios, LTV
Ratios and debt yields will differ, and may differ significantly, depending on the assumptions and inputs used. The information
presented in this free writing prospectus reflects assumptions and inputs provided by the mortgage loan sellers in connection with
the origination of the mortgage loans. For purposes of the mortgage loan and pool composition data and other information contained
in this free writing prospectus (including any tables, charts and information set forth on Annexes A-1, A-2 and A-3) with
respect to each of the mortgage loans that is part of a Whole Loan, we generally present the loan-to-value ratio, debt service
coverage ratio, debt yield and cut-off date balance per net rentable square foot, pad, room or unit, as applicable, in this free
writing prospectus in a manner that takes account of that mortgage loan and its related Pari Passu Companion Loan, but not the
related Subordinate Companion Loan. Other than as specifically noted, the loan-to-value ratio, the debt service coverage ratio,
debt yield and mortgage loan rate information for each mortgage loan is presented in this free writing prospectus without regard
to any other indebtedness (whether or not secured by the related mortgaged property, ownership interests in the related borrower
or otherwise) that currently exists or that may be incurred by the related borrower or its owners in the future, in order to present
statistics for the related mortgage loan without combination with the other indebtedness. See “Risk Factors—Commercial
Lending Is Dependent Upon Net Operating Income” and “—Limitations of Appraisals” in this free
writing prospectus.
 
The tables set forth in this free writing
prospectus present certain anticipated characteristics of the mortgage loans as of the Cut-off Date (unless otherwise indicated).
The sum of the numerical data in any column may not equal the indicated total due to rounding. Unless otherwise indicated, all
figures and percentages presented in these tables are calculated as described below under “—Additional Mortgage
Loan Information” and, unless otherwise indicated, such figures and percentages are approximate and in each case, represent
the indicated figure or percentage of the aggregate principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans as of the Cut-off Date. The
principal balance of each mortgage loan as of the Cut-off Date assumes the timely receipt of principal scheduled to be paid on
or before the Cut-off Date and no defaults, delinquencies or prepayments on, or modifications of, any mortgage loan on or prior
to the Cut-off Date. Whenever percentages and other information in this free writing prospectus are presented on the Mortgaged
Property level rather than the mortgage loan level, the information for mortgage loans secured by more than one Mortgaged Property
(or within a group of cross-collateralized mortgage loans) is based on allocated loan amounts as stated in Annex A-1 to this
free writing prospectus.

  the case of one (1) mortgage loan with an Anticipated Repayment Date, identified as “Eastmont
  Town Center” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing approximately
  2.5% of the Initial Pool Balance, calculated as of the Anticipated Repayment Date.
 

(3)Excludes
  one (1) mortgage loan identified as “Chippewa Towne Centre” on Annex A-1
  to this free writing prospectus, representing approximately 0.3% of the Initial Pool
  Balance, that is interest only for the entire term.
 

(4)In
  the case of one (1) mortgage loan identified as “U-Haul Portfolio” on Annex
  A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing approximately 4.3% of the Initial Pool
  Balance, the loan will amortize based on the assumed principal payment schedule set forth
  on Annex F to this free writing prospectus.
 

(5)In
the case of eight (8) Mortgaged Properties identified as “Hilton Suites Chicago Magnificent Mile”, “Civic Opera
Building”, “One Shell Square”, “Hilton Atlanta Perimeter”, “Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio”
and “Langhorne Shopping Center” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing six (6) mortgage loans representing
approximately 22.5% of the Initial Pool Balance by allocated loan amount, the Loan-to-Value Ratio was calculated based upon a
hypothetical valuation other than an “as-is” value. In addition, with respect to one hundred and five (105) Mortgaged
Properties, securing one (1) mortgage loan identified as “U-Haul Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing
prospectus, representing approximately 4.3% of the Initial Pool Balance, the Loan-to-Value Ratio was calculated based on the portfolio
value rather than the aggregate individual appraised values, which includes a premium for the value of selling the portfolio in
its entirety. The remaining mortgage loans were calculated using “as-is” values as described under “—Additional
Mortgage Loan Information” in this free writing prospectus. For further information,

see Annex A-1
to this free writing prospectus. See also “Risk Factors—Limitations of Appraisals”, “Transaction
Parties—The Sponsors and Mortgage Loan Sellers—JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association—Exceptions to JPMCB’s
Disclosed Underwriting Guidelines”, and “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Assessments of Property Value
and Condition—Appraisals” in this free writing prospectus.
 

(6)In
  the case of eight (8) mortgage loans identified as “Cedar Pointe Apartments”,
  “South View (Avalon) Apartments”, “Forest View Apartments”, “Royal
  Palms Apartments”, “Beverly Terrace Apartments”, “Iron Mountain
  Apartments”, “Highland Springs Apartments” and “Highland Meadows
  (43/44) Apartments” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing
  approximately 0.9% of the Initial Pool Balance, the mortgage loans are comprised of four
  (4) groups of cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted loans with each other, and the
  Loan-to-Value Ratios and DSCRs are presented on an aggregate basis. For each mortgage
  loan with a related Pari Passu Companion Loan, the calculation of the Loan-to-Value Ratios
  and debt service coverage ratios includes the principal balance and debt service payment
  of the related Pari Passu Companion Loan(s), but excludes the related Subordinate Companion
  Loan. With respect to one (1) mortgage loan identified as “U-Haul Portfolio”
  on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing approximately 4.3% of
  the Initial Pool Balance, the calculation of the Loan-to-Value Ratios and DSCRs is determined
  without regard to the related Subordinate Companion Loan, and the related Loan-to-Value
  Ratio as of the Cut-off Date and UW NCF DSCR calculated including the related Subordinate
  Companion Loan are 58.8% and 1.38x, respectively.
 

(7)For
  each partial interest only loan, the UW NCF DSCR was calculated based on the first principal
  and interest payment to be made into the trust during the term of the mortgage loan once
  amortization has commenced. For all interest only loans, the UW NCF DSCR was calculated
  based on the sum of the first 12 interest payments following the Cut-off Date. With respect
  to one hundred and seventy-two (172) Mortgaged Properties identified as “Hilton
  Suites Chicago Magnificent Mile”, “U-Haul Portfolio”, “One Shell
  Square”, “The Park at Veneto”, “Brunswick Portfolio”, “New
  Center One Building”, “The Park at Murano”, “780 Dedham Street”,
  “One Park Centre”, “Colony Village” and “Brynn Marr Village”
  on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing eleven (11) mortgage loans, representing
  approximately 23.0% of the Initial Pool Balance, certain assumptions and/or adjustments
  were made to the UW NCF and/or UW NCF DSCRs reflected in the table above. For specific
  discussions on those particular assumptions and adjustments, see “—Net
  Cash Flow and Certain Underwriting Considerations”, “—Mortgaged
  Property Considerations—Tenant Issues—Occupancy and Tenant Concentrations”
  and “—Additional Mortgage Loan Information” in this free writing
  prospectus. See also Annex A-1 and Annex A-3 to this free writing prospectus.
 
Fee & Leasehold
Estates; Ground Leases
 
Each mortgage loan, including any Whole
Loan, is evidenced by one or more promissory notes (each, a “Mortgage
Note”) and secured by one or more mortgages, deeds of trust or other similar security instruments (each, a “Mortgage”).
In all cases, the Mortgages create a first mortgage lien:
 
(1)    
on a fee simple estate in one or more commercial properties;
 
(2)    
on a leasehold estate in one or more commercial properties; and/or
 
(3)    
on a combination of fee simple estates and leasehold estates in one or more commercial properties (each of the fee simple
estates and/or leasehold estates described in clauses (1), (2) and/or this clause (3), a “Mortgaged
Property”).

  this table presents information relating to Mortgaged Properties and not mortgage loans,
  the information for mortgage loans secured by more than one Mortgaged Property is based

(1)In
  the case of each of the mortgage loans that is part of a Whole Loan, each of which has
  a related Pari Passu Companion Loan that is not part of the trust, the Loan per SF/Room,
  UW NCF DSCR and Cut-off Date LTV Ratio for each such mortgage loan is calculated based
  on the principal balance, debt service payment and Underwritten Net Cash Flow for the
  mortgage loan included in the trust and any related Pari Passu Companion Loan in the
  aggregate but not the principal balance and debt service payment of the related Subordinate
  Companion Loan. See “—Assessments of Property Value and Condition”
  in this free writing prospectus for additional information.
 
For more information regarding the ten largest
mortgage loans and/or loan concentrations and related Mortgaged Properties, see the individual mortgage loan and portfolio descriptions
under “Description of Top Ten Mortgage Loans and
Additional Mortgage Loan Information” in Annex A-3 to this free writing prospectus. Other than with respect to the
top ten mortgage loans identified in the table above, each of the other mortgage loans represents no more than 2.6% of the Initial
Pool Balance.
 
See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating
to Mortgage Loan Concentrations and Borrower-Sponsor Concentrations” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Cross-Collateralized Mortgage
Loans; Multi-Property Mortgage Loans and Related Borrower Mortgage Loans
 
The pool of mortgage loans will include
seventeen (17) mortgage loans, set forth in the table below entitled “Cross-Collateralized/Multi-Property Mortgage Loans”,
representing approximately 16.1% of the
 


S-138
 
 
Initial Pool Balance, which are each secured by two or more properties. In some cases,
however, the amount of the mortgage lien encumbering a particular property may be less than the full amount of indebtedness under
the mortgage loan, generally to minimize recording tax. In such instances, the mortgage amount may equal a specified percentage
(generally ranging from 100% to 150%, inclusive) of the appraised value or allocated loan amount for the particular Mortgaged Property.
This would limit the extent to which proceeds from that property would be available to offset declines in value of the other Mortgaged
Properties securing the same mortgage loan or group of cross-collateralized mortgage loans. See “Risk Factors—The
Volatile Economy and Credit Crisis May Increase Loan Defaults and Affect the Value and Liquidity of Your Investment”
in this free writing prospectus.

(1)Because
  this table presents information relating to Mortgaged Properties and not mortgage loans,
  the information for mortgage loans secured by more than one Mortgaged Property is based
  on allocated loan amounts as set forth in Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus.
 
With respect to the office properties set
forth in the above chart and mixed use, retail and self-storage properties that include office tenants, we note in particular the
following:
 

·Eight (8) Mortgaged
Properties identified as “Gateway Business Park”, “Eastmont Town Center”, “New Center One Building”,
“Robinson Plaza”, “Big Curve Shopping Center”, “One Park Centre”, “Bedford Square I
& II” and “Pine Tree Square” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing eight (8) mortgage
loans representing approximately 12.8% of the Initial Pool Balance, have one or more tenants operating medical, veterinary hospital
and/or dental offices among the five (5) largest tenants (by net rentable area leased) at the related Mortgaged Property. Medical
and dental offices and facilities pose unique risks. See “Risk Factors—Office Properties Have
 


S-141
 
 
Special Risks” in this free writing prospectus. In addition, one (1) Mortgaged Property identified as “Big Curve
Shopping Center” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan representing approximately
1.0% of the Initial Pool Balance, have a retail bank or credit union branch among the five (5) largest tenants (by net rentable
area leased) at the Mortgaged Property. Bank branches or specialty use properties that are outfitted with vaults, teller counters
and other equipment and installations require significant capital expenditures in connection with the conversion to any alternative
use. The ability to lease this space to entities other than financial institutions may be difficult due to the added costs and
time of retrofitting the property. See “Risk Factors—Some Mortgaged Properties May Not Be Readily Convertible to
Alternative Uses” in this free writing prospectus.
 

·With respect to one (1) Mortgaged Property identified as “One Shell Square” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus,
securing one (1) mortgage loan representing approximately 3.1% of the Initial Pool Balance, affiliates of the borrower and sponsor
currently (and in the future may) own properties within a five mile radius which compete with the Mortgaged Property. The mortgage
loan documents restrict the borrower and its sponsor from offering below-market inducements to any tenants at the Mortgaged Property
and require that the borrower offer market-rate incentives to maintain existing tenants. The mortgage loan documents also restrict
the borrower from relocating any tenants at the Mortgaged Property to any other property without the prior consent of the lender,
unless such tenant(s) elects to relocate in its discretion upon expiration of the lease term.
 
See “Risk Factors—Office
Properties Have Special Risks” and “Risk Factors—Mixed Use Facilities Have Special Risks” in
this free writing prospectus.

prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan representing approximately 0.9% of the Initial Pool Balance, the Mortgaged Property
is subject to a Land Use Restrictive Agreement (“LURA”), which requires a minimum of 35 units be leased to residents
that qualify as “lower income families” (annual income not in excess of 80% of area household median) and a minimum
of 20 units be leased to residents that qualify as “very low income families” (annual income not in excess of 50% of
area household median). The LURA has a 40 year term and expires in 2034.

Concentration Entails Risks” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Additional Debt
 
General.
Substantially all of the mortgage loans permit the related borrower to incur limited indebtedness in the ordinary course
of business that is not secured by the related Mortgaged Property. Moreover, in general, any borrower that does not meet single
purpose entity criteria may not be restricted from incurring unsecured debt.
 
The terms of certain mortgage loans permit
the borrowers to post letters of credit and/or surety bonds for the benefit of the mortgagee under the mortgage loans, which may
constitute a contingent reimbursement obligation of the related borrower or an affiliate. The issuing bank or surety will not typically
agree to subordination and standstill protection benefiting the mortgagee. See “Risk Factors—Additional Debt or
the Ability To Incur Other Borrowings Entails Risk” in this free writing prospectus.

Mezzanine
Debt. Although the mortgage loans generally place certain restrictions on incurring mezzanine debt by the pledging of
general partnership and managing member equity interests in a borrower, such as specific percentage or control limitations, the
terms of the Mortgages generally permit, subject to certain limitations, the pledge of less than a controlling portion of the limited
partnership or non-managing membership equity interests in a borrower. Certain mortgage loans described below permit the incurrence
of mezzanine debt subject to satisfaction of certain conditions including a certain maximum combined loan-to-value ratio and/or
a minimum combined debt service coverage ratio, and in some cases mezzanine debt is already in place. Also, certain of the mortgage
loans do not restrict the pledging of ownership interests in the related borrower, but do restrict the transfer of ownership interests
in a borrower by imposing limitations on transfer of control or a specific percentage of ownership interests. In addition, in general,
a borrower (or its direct or indirect owners) that does not meet single-purpose entity criteria may not be restricted in any way
from incurring mezzanine debt. To the extent that a direct or indirect equity owner in a mortgage borrower has previously incurred,
or in the future incurs, mezzanine debt secured by its direct or indirect equity interests, the holders of such mezzanine loans
may have (or, in the case of the existing mezzanine loans described below, do have) the right to cure certain defaults occurring
on the related mortgage loan, consent rights over certain modifications, waivers and amendments of the related mortgage loan, and
the right to purchase the related mortgage loan if certain defaults on the related mortgage loan occur. The purchase price generally
required to be paid in connection with the purchase of a mortgage loan by a mezzanine lender is equal to the outstanding principal
balance of the related mortgage loan, together with accrued and unpaid interest (other than default interest) on, and unpaid servicing
expenses, liquidation fees (with respect to certain loans and in certain circumstances), protective advances and interest on Advances
related to, such mortgage loan. However, with respect to permitted future mezzanine loans, that price may have different components.
In addition, the holder of the mezzanine debt typically is able to foreclose upon the ownership interests in the related borrower
subject to the terms of an intercreditor agreement, which typically require either confirmation from each Rating Agency that the
transfer would not result in the downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of the then-current ratings assigned to any class of offered
certificates, lender approval or that the holder of the ownership interests is the original mezzanine lender or an entity which
at the time it acquires the mezzanine loan meets certain financial and other tests under the related intercreditor agreement. See
“Risk Factors—Additional Debt or the Ability To Incur Other Borrowings Entails Risk” in this free writing
prospectus.

(1)For
  the mortgage loan secured by the Mortgaged Property identified as “Palmer House
  Retail Shops” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, future mezzanine debt
  is permitted provided that certain conditions are satisfied, which conditions
  include (but are not limited to) the following:
(i) the combined loan-to-value ratio, as calculated in the loan documents, does
  not exceed 95.0% of the loan-to-value ratio on the origination date (approximately 63.7%,
  based on the Cut-off Date LTV Ratio) and (ii) the combined debt service coverage ratio,
  as calculated in the loan documents, is not less than 105.0% of the debt service coverage
  ratio on the origination date (approximately 1.33x, based on the UW NCF DSCR).
 

(2)The
  calculation of the Combined Minimum DSCR under the loan documents is based on the 12-month
  period immediately preceding the funding of the mezzanine loan using the net operating
  income for the prior three months annualized.
 

(3)For
  the mortgage loans secured by the Mortgaged Properties identified as “Colony Village”
  and “Brynn Marr Village” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus,
  future mezzanine debt is permitted only in connection with a bona fide sale and assumption
  under the related loan documents.
 
The mortgage loans may also permit mezzanine
debt in circumstances where, if the mezzanine lender were to take possession of the equity collateral, such transfer would not
trigger any due-on-sale clause.
 
Generally, upon a default under a mezzanine
loan, the holder of the mezzanine loan would be entitled to foreclose upon the equity in the related borrower, which has been pledged
to secure payment of such mezzanine debt. Although this transfer of equity may not trigger the due-on-sale clause under the related
mortgage loan, it could cause a change in control of the borrower and/or cause the obligor under the mezzanine debt to file for
bankruptcy, which could negatively affect the operation of the related Mortgaged Property and the related borrower’s ability
to make payments on the related mortgage loan in a timely manner.

Certain risks relating to additional debt
are described in “Risk Factors—Additional Debt or the Ability To Incur Other Borrowings Entails Risk”
and “Certain Legal Aspects of the Mortgage Loans” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Unsecured Debt. Substantially all
of the mortgage loans permit the related borrower to incur limited indebtedness in the ordinary course of business that is not
secured by the related Mortgaged Property. Moreover, in general, any borrower that does not meet single purpose entity criteria
may not be restricted from incurring unsecured debt.
 
With respect to two (2) Mortgaged Properties
identified as “Hilton Suites Chicago Magnificent Mile” and “Hilton Atlanta Perimeter” on Annex A-1 to this
free writing prospectus, securing two (2) mortgage loans representing approximately 9.4% of the Initial Pool Balance, the related
franchisor provided “key money” financing in the original amounts of $3,000,000 and $1,000,000, respectively, for use
by the borrowers in connection with the property improvement plans required by the franchise agreements. In each case, the “key
money” financing is unsecured and there is no obligation to repay the indebtedness unless the franchise agreement is terminated
prior to its expiration or the related borrower fails to complete the property improvement plan in accordance with the requirements
of the related franchise agreement. To the extent the related borrower is required to repay the financing, it will be required
to pay the unamortized portion of the remaining debt. In each case, the mortgage loan documents include a non-recourse carve-out
to the related borrower and guarantor for any losses associated with this financing. We can provide no assurances that the related
borrowers will complete the property improvement plans as required by the franchise agreement or whether the borrowers and guarantors
have the financial ability to repay the “key money” financing in the event the franchise agreements are terminated.
 
With respect to one (1) Mortgaged Property
identified as “First National Building” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan
representing approximately 3.5% of the Initial Pool Balance, the loan documents allow for one or more additional loan(s) to the
borrower that are unsecured and subordinate to the mortgage loan, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including,
without limitation, that (i) the lenders enter into a subordination and standstill agreement satisfactory to the mortgage lender
in its sole discretion, (ii) amounts payable pursuant to such loan(s) are only permitted from excess cash flow from the Mortgaged
Property after all required payments under the mortgage loan documents are made, and (iii) there is no maturity date for the subordinate
loan(s). The loan documents provide that the aggregate amount of such unsecured loan(s), together with trade payables, may
not exceed 4% of the original principal balance of the mortgage loan.
 
The Whole Loans
 
The Civic Opera Building
Whole Loan
 
General. The Civic Opera Building
Mortgage Loan, representing approximately 6.5% of the Initial Pool Balance, is part of a split loan structure comprised of two
(2) mortgage notes, each of which is secured by the same mortgage instrument on the same underlying Mortgaged Property.
 
The Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan is
evidenced by a promissory note with a Cut-off Date Balance of $75,000,000. The Civic Opera Building Pari Passu Companion Loan is
evidenced by a promissory note with an aggregate outstanding principal balance as of the Cut-off Date of $89,000,000 that is not
included in the trust. Only the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan is included in the trust. The Civic Opera Building Mortgage
Loan and the Civic Opera Building Pari Passu Companion Loan are pari passu with each other in terms of priority and are collectively
referred to in this free writing prospectus as the Civic Opera Building Whole Loan.
 
The holders (the “Civic Opera Building
Noteholders”) of each promissory note comprising the Civic Opera Building Whole Loan have entered into a co-lender agreement
(the “Civic Opera Building Intercreditor Agreement”) that sets forth the respective rights of each Civic Opera
Building Noteholder. The Civic Opera Building Whole Loan will be serviced and administered pursuant to the terms of the JPMBB 2015-C31
Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The Civic Opera Building Intercreditor Agreement
 


S-151
 
 
provides that expenses, losses and shortfalls
relating to the Civic Opera Building Whole Loan will be allocated on a pro rata basis to the Civic Opera Building Noteholders.
 
The trust formed pursuant to the JPMBB 2015-C31
Pooling and Servicing Agreement (the “JPMBB 2015-C31 Trust”) is the holder of a Civic Opera Building Pari Passu
Companion Loan and so long as no control event has occurred under the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the JPMBB
2015-C31 directing certificateholder will have the right to direct, consult with and advise the JPMBB 2015-C31 Master Servicer
and the JPMBB 2015-C31 Special Servicer with respect to the Civic Opera Building Whole Loan, but will be required to consult with
the Directing Certificateholder of the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan (so long as no Control Event has occurred and is continuing
under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement for this transaction) with respect to such advice, consent or action. In the event that
the parties exercising the rights of the holder of the Civic Opera Building Pari Passu Companion Loan and the holder of the Civic
Opera Building Mortgage Loan under the Civic Opera Building Intercreditor Agreement disagree, the decision of the party exercising
the rights of the holder of the Civic Opera Building Pari Passu Companion Loan under the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing Agreement
will be binding.
 
Servicing. The Civic Opera Building
Whole Loan (including the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan) and any related REO Property will be serviced and administered by
the JPMBB 2015-C31 Master Servicer and, if necessary, the JPMBB 2015-C31 Special Servicer, according to the terms of the JPMBB
2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the servicing standard thereunder, which requires the JPMBB 2015-C31 Master Servicer
and the JPMBB 2015-C31 Special Servicer to take into account the interests, as a collective whole, of both the Certificateholders
and the holder of the Civic Opera Building Pari Passu Companion Loan.
 
Amounts payable to the trust as holder of
the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan pursuant to the related Civic Opera Building Intercreditor Agreement will be included in
the Available Distribution Amount for the related Distribution Date to the extent described in this free writing prospectus, and
amounts payable to the holder of the Civic Opera Building Pari Passu Companion Loan will be distributed to such holder net of certain
fees and expenses on the Civic Opera Building Pari Passu Companion Loan as set forth in the Civic Opera Building Intercreditor
Agreement and will not be available for distributions on the Offered Certificates.
 
Application of Payments. The Civic
Opera Building Intercreditor Agreement sets forth the respective rights of the holder of the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan
and the holder of the Civic Opera Building Pari Passu Companion Loan with respect to distributions of funds received in respect
of the Civic Opera Building Whole Loan, and provides, in general, that:
 

·the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan and the Civic Opera Building Pari Passu Companion Loan are of equal priority with each
other and no portion of either of them will have priority or preference over any portion of the other or security therefor;
 

·all payments, proceeds and other recoveries on or in respect of the Civic Opera Building Whole Loan or the related Mortgaged
Property will be applied to the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan and the Civic Opera Building Pari Passu Companion Loan on a
pro rata and pari passu basis according to their respective outstanding principal balances (subject, in each case,
to the payment of amounts for required reserves or escrows required by the related mortgage loan documents and payment and reimbursement
rights of the JPMBB 2015-C31 Master Servicer, the JPMBB 2015-C31 Special Servicer, the related senior trust advisor, the related
certificate administrator, the related depositor and the related trustee) in accordance with the terms of the Civic Opera Building
Intercreditor Agreement and the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing Agreement; and
 

·costs, fees, expenses, losses and shortfalls relating to the Civic Opera Building Whole Loan will be allocated, on a pro
rata and pari passu basis, to the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan and the Civic Opera Building Pari Passu Companion
Loan in accordance with the terms of the Civic 
 


S-152
 
 
Opera Building Intercreditor Agreement and the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing
Agreement.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a P&I
Advance is made with respect to the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
then that P&I Advance, together with interest on that P&I Advance, may only be reimbursed out of future payments and collections
on the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan or, as and to the extent described under “Description of the Certificates—Advances”
in this free writing prospectus, on other mortgage loans in this securitization, but not out of payments or other collections on
the Civic Opera Building Pari Passu Companion Loan or any loans included in any securitization trust related to the Civic Opera
Building Pari Passu Companion Loan.
 
Certain costs and expenses (such as a pro
rata share of any servicing advance with respect to the Civic Opera Building Whole Loan made pursuant to the JPMBB 2015-C31
Pooling and Servicing Agreement) allocable to the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan in accordance with the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling
and Servicing Agreement and the Civic Opera Building Intercreditor Agreement may be paid or reimbursed out of payments and other
collections on the mortgage pool. This may result in temporary (or, if not ultimately reimbursed, permanent) shortfalls to holders
of the certificates.
 
Consultation and Control. The controlling
noteholder under the Civic Opera Building Intercreditor Agreement will be the JPMBB 2015-C31 Trust as holder of a Civic Opera Building
Pari Passu Companion Loan under the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing Agreement; provided that, prior to the occurrence
and continuance of a control event under the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the controlling class certificateholder
(or the directing certificateholder on its behalf) under the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing Agreement (the “JPMBB
2015-C31 Directing Certificateholder”) will be entitled to exercise the rights of the controlling noteholder with respect
to the Civic Opera Building Whole Loan. The JPMBB 2015-C31 Directing Certificateholder will be entitled to exercise rights substantially
similar to the rights of the trust, in its capacity as the controlling noteholder under the Civic Opera Building Intercreditor
Agreement, as described in this free writing prospectus under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—The Directing Certificateholder”
with respect to the Civic Opera Building Whole Loan, and the implementation of any recommended actions outlined in an asset
status report with respect to the Civic Opera Building Whole Loan will require the JPMBB 2015-C31 Special Servicer to consult with
and/or obtain the approval of the JPMBB 2015-C31 Directing Certificateholder in a manner substantially similar to that described
herein under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—General”. Pursuant to the terms of the JPMBB 2015-C31
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the JPMBB 2015-C31 Directing Certificateholder and the related senior trust advisor will each
have the same consent and/or consultation rights with respect to the Civic Opera Building Whole Loan as each does, and for so long
as each does, with respect to the other mortgage loans included in that trust.
 
In addition, pursuant to the terms of the
Civic Opera Building Intercreditor Agreement, the holder of the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan (or its representative, which
will be the Controlling Class Certificateholder or any other party assigned the rights to exercise the rights of the holder
of the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan, as and to the extent provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) will (i) have
the right to receive copies of all notices, information and reports that the JPMBB 2015-C31 Master Servicer or the JPMBB 2015-C31
Special Servicer, as applicable, is required to provide to the JPMBB 2015-C31 Directing Certificateholder (within the same time
frame, such notices, information and reports are or would have been required to be provided to the JPMBB 2015-C31 Directing Certificateholder
under the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing Agreement without regard to the occurrence of any control event or consultation
termination event under the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing Agreement) with respect to any major decisions to be taken with
respect to the Civic Opera Building Whole Loan or the implementation of any recommended action outlined in an asset status report
relating to the Civic Opera Building Whole Loan and (ii) have the right to be consulted on a strictly non-binding basis to
the extent the holder of the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan (or its representative) requests consultation with respect to certain
major decisions to be taken with respect to the Civic Opera Building Whole Loan or the implementation of any recommended action
outlined in an asset status report relating to the Civic Opera Building Whole Loan. The consultation right of the holder of the
Civic Opera
 

S-153
 

 
Building Mortgage Loan (or its representative) will expire 10 business days following the delivery of written notice
and information relating to the matter subject to consultation whether or not the holder of the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan
(or its representative) has responded within such period; provided that if the JPMBB 2015-C31 Master Servicer or the JPMBB
2015-C31 Special Servicer, as applicable, proposes a new course of action that is materially different from the actions previously
proposed, the 10 business day consultation period will be deemed to begin anew from the date of delivery of such new proposal and
delivery of all information related to such new proposal. Notwithstanding the consultation rights of the holder of the Civic Opera
Building Mortgage Loan (or its representative) described above, the JPMBB 2015-C31 Master Servicer or the JPMBB 2015-C31 Special
Servicer, as applicable, is permitted to make any material decision or take any action set forth in the asset status report before
the expiration of the aforementioned 10 business day period if it determines that immediate action with respect to such decision
is necessary to protect the interests of the holders of the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan and the Civic Opera Building Pari
Passu Companion Loan. Neither the JPMBB 2015-C31 Master Servicer nor the JPMBB 2015-C31 Special Servicer will be obligated at any
time to follow or take any alternative actions recommended by the holder of the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan (or its representative,
including, the directing certificateholder (or similar entity)). The senior trust advisor will generally have no obligations or
consultation rights under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement with respect to the Civic Opera Building Whole Loan or any related
REO Property. However, Pentalpha Surveillance LLC is also the senior trust advisor under the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing
Agreement and, in such capacity, will have certain obligations and consultation rights with respect to the Civic Opera Building
Whole Loan that are substantially similar to those of the senior trust advisor under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
Neither the JPMBB 2015-C31 Master Servicer
nor the JPMBB 2015-C31 Special Servicer may follow or be required to follow any direction, advice or consultation provided by the
holder of the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan (or its representative) that would require or cause the JPMBB 2015-C31 Master
Servicer or the JPMBB 2015-C31 Special Servicer, as applicable, to violate any applicable law, including Sections 860A through
860G of the Code, any related Treasury regulations, and any related rulings or announcements promulgated by the IRS (collectively,
the “REMIC Provisions”), be inconsistent with the servicing standard under the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, require or cause the JPMBB 2015-C31 Master Servicer or the JPMBB 2015-C31 Special Servicer, as applicable, to violate
provisions of the Civic Opera Building Intercreditor Agreement or the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, require or
cause the JPMBB 2015-C31 Master Servicer or the JPMBB 2015-C31 Special Servicer, as applicable, to violate the terms of the Civic
Opera Building Whole Loan, or materially expand the scope of any of the JPMBB 2015-C31 Master Servicer’s or the JPMBB 2015-C31
Special Servicer’s, as applicable, responsibilities under the Civic Opera Building Intercreditor Agreement or the JPMBB 2015-C31
Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
In addition to the consultation rights of
the holder of the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan (or its representative) described above, pursuant to the terms of the Civic
Opera Building Intercreditor Agreement, the holder of the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan (or its representative) will have
the right to attend (in-person or telephonically in the discretion of the JPMBB 2015-C31 Master Servicer or the JPMBB 2015-C31
Special Servicer, as applicable) annual meetings with the JPMBB 2015-C31 Master Servicer or the JPMBB 2015-C31 Special Servicer,
as applicable, upon reasonable notice and at times reasonably acceptable to the JPMBB 2015-C31 Master Servicer or the JPMBB 2015-C31
Special Servicer, as applicable, for the purpose of discussing servicing issues related to the Civic Opera Building Whole Loan.
 
Sale of Defaulted Civic Opera Building
Whole Loan. Pursuant to the terms of the Civic Opera Building Intercreditor Agreement, if the Civic Opera Building Whole Loan
becomes a defaulted whole loan, and if the JPMBB 2015-C31 Special Servicer determines to sell the Civic Opera Building Pari Passu
Companion Loan included in the JPMBB 2015-C31 Trust in accordance with the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, then
the JPMBB 2015-C31 Special Servicer will be required to sell the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan together with the Civic Opera
Building Pari Passu Companion Loan as one whole loan. In connection with any such sale, the JPMBB 2015-C31 Special Servicer will
be required to follow the procedures contained in the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
 


S-154
 
 
which are substantially similar
to those set forth under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans” in
this free writing prospectus.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the JPMBB
2015-C31 Special Servicer will not be permitted to sell the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan and the Civic Opera Building Pari

The U-Haul Portfolio Whole
Loan
 
General. The U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage
Loan, representing approximately 4.3% of the Initial Pool Balance, is part of a split loan structure comprised of six (6) mortgage
notes, each of which is secured by the same mortgage instrument on the same underlying Mortgaged Property.
 
The U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan is evidenced
by one (1) promissory note (the “U-Haul Portfolio Trust A-1B Note”), as set forth in the chart below) with an
aggregate Cut-off Date Balance of $49,666,409. The U-Haul Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loans are comprised in the aggregate of
three (3) promissory notes (Note A-1A (the “U-Haul Portfolio Companion A-1A Note” and, together with the U-Haul
Portfolio Trust A-1B Note, the “U-Haul Portfolio Group 1 Notes”), Note A-2A (the “U-Haul Portfolio
Companion A-2A Note”) and Note A-2B (collectively, the “U-Haul Portfolio Group 2 Notes” and, together
 


S-155
 
 
with the U-Haul Portfolio Group 1 Notes, the “U-Haul Portfolio Senior Notes”), each as set forth in the chart
below) with an aggregate Cut-off Date Balance of $108,666,409 that are not included in the trust. The U-Haul Portfolio Subordinate
Companion Loan is evidenced by two (2) promissory notes, each of which is subordinate to the U-Haul Portfolio Senior Notes (Note A-3A
and Note A-3B (collectively, the “U-Haul Portfolio Group 3 Notes” and, together with the U-Haul Portfolio
Group 1 Notes and the U-Haul Portfolio Group 2 Notes, the “U-Haul Portfolio Notes” and each a “U-Haul
Portfolio Note”), each as set forth in the chart below) with an aggregate Cut-off Date Balance of $111,000,000, that
are not included in the trust. Only the U-Haul Portfolio Trust A-1B Note is included in the trust. Each U-Haul Portfolio Group
1 Note is pari passu with each other U-Haul Portfolio Group 1 Note, each U-Haul Portfolio Group 2 Note is pari passu
with each other U-Haul Portfolio Group 2 Note, and each U-Haul Portfolio Group 3 Note is pari passu with each other
U-Haul Portfolio Group 3 Note. Each U-Haul Portfolio Group 1 Note is also pari passu with each U-Haul Portfolio Group 2
Note. The U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan, the U-Haul Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loans and the U-Haul Portfolio Subordinate
Companion Loan are collectively referred to in this free writing prospectus as the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan. The interests in
the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan described above and their relative priority are as set forth in the chart below (the loan balances
set forth in the chart below are the original principal balances of the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan, the U-Haul Portfolio Pari
Passu Companion Loans and the U-Haul Portfolio Subordinate Companion Loan, as applicable).

The holders (the “U-Haul Portfolio
Noteholders”) of each promissory note comprising the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan, have entered into a co-lender agreement
(the “U-Haul Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement”) that sets forth the respective rights of the U-Haul Portfolio
Noteholders. Pursuant to the terms of the U-Haul Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement, the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan will be serviced
and administered pursuant to the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement. In each case the U-Haul Portfolio Intercreditor
Agreement provides that expenses, losses (including any reductions by a bankruptcy court) and shortfalls relating to the U-Haul
Portfolio Whole Loan will be allocated in reverse sequential order, first, to the U-Haul Portfolio Group 3 Notes
(and pro rata between the promissory notes comprising such Subordinate Companion Loan), and then, pro rata
among the U-Haul Portfolio Senior Notes. Any realized losses (including reductions by a bankruptcy court) applied to reduce the
principal balance of the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan will be reimbursed in sequential order after all amounts of interest and principal
have otherwise been paid in full on all the notes.
 
Servicing.  The U-Haul Portfolio
Whole Loan and any related REO Property will be serviced and administered by the U-Haul Portfolio Master Servicer and, if necessary,
the U-Haul Portfolio Special Servicer, according to the terms of the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement and the servicing
standard thereunder, which will require the U-Haul Portfolio Servicers to take into account the interests, as a collective whole,
of each of the Certificateholders, the holder of the U-Haul Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loans and the holder of the U-Haul Portfolio
Subordinate Companion Loan (taking into account the subordinate or pari passu nature of such Companion Loans, as the case
may be).
 
Amounts payable to the trust as holder of
the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan pursuant to the U-Haul Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement net of certain fees and expenses on
the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan, will be included in the Available Distribution Amount for the related Distribution Date to the
extent described in this free writing prospectus, and amounts payable to the holder of the U-Haul Portfolio Pari Passu Companion
Loans and the U-Haul Portfolio Subordinate Companion Loan will be distributed to such holders net of certain fees and expenses
on the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan as set forth in the U-
 


S-156
 
 
Haul Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement and will not be available for distributions
on the Offered Certificates.
 
Application of Payments. The U-Haul
Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement sets forth the respective rights of the holder of the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan, the holders
of the U-Haul Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loans and the holder of the U-Haul Portfolio Subordinate Companion Loan with respect
to distributions of funds received in respect of the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan, and provides, in general, that
 

·as long as no U-Haul Portfolio Triggering Event of Default (as defined below) has occurred and is continuing, all amounts available
for payment on the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan (excluding (i) all amounts for required reserves or escrows required by the loan
documents to be held as reserves or escrows and proceeds, awards or settlements to be applied to the restoration or repair of the
related properties or released to the related borrowers in accordance with the terms of the loan documents, (ii) all amounts received
as reimbursements on account of recoveries in respect of property protection advances then due and payable or reimbursable to the
U-Haul Portfolio Trustee, the U-Haul Portfolio Master Servicer or the U-Haul Portfolio Special Servicer, and (iii) certain amounts
that are then due, payable or reimbursable to the U-Haul Portfolio Servicer or the U-Haul Portfolio Special Servicer), will be

Intercreditor Agreement, as follows:
 

○first, to the holders of the U-Haul Portfolio
Senior Notes on a pro rata and pari passu basis up to the amount of any unreimbursed costs and expenses paid by

Trustee, as applicable) with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan pursuant to the U-Haul Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement
or the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement;

 

○second, pro rata based on their respective

exceed the amounts required to be applied in accordance with the foregoing clauses first through third and, as a
result of a

 


S-157
 
 
workout the principal balances
of the U-Haul Portfolio Senior Notes have been reduced (to the extent such reductions were made in accordance with the U-Haul
Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement notwithstanding the provisions of the U-Haul Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement by reason
of the insufficiency of the U-Haul Portfolio Group 3 Notes to bear the full economic effect of the workout), such excess amount
will be paid to the holders of the U-Haul Portfolio Senior Notes on a pro rata and pari passu basis in an amount
up to the reduction of the aggregate principal balance of the U-Haul Portfolio Senior Notes as a result of such workout, plus
interest on such amount at the interest rate under the mortgage loan agreement;
 

○fifth, to the holders of the U-Haul Portfolio
Group 3 Notes on a pro rata and pari passu basis up to the amount of any unreimbursed costs and expenses paid by
such holders of the U-Haul Portfolio Group 3 Notes (or paid or advanced by a U-Haul Portfolio Servicer or the U-Haul Portfolio
Trustee, as applicable) with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan pursuant to the U-Haul Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement
or the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement;

 

○sixth, to the holders of the U-Haul Portfolio
Group 3 Notes on a pro rata and pari passu basis, to each holder of a U-Haul Portfolio Group 3 Note in an amount
equal to its respective principal entitlement with respect to the applicable monthly payment date, which amount will be applied
in reduction of the principal balances of such U-Haul Portfolio Group 3 Notes;

 

○seventh, if the proceeds of any foreclosure sale
or any liquidation of the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan or related Mortgaged Properties exceed the amounts required to be applied
in accordance with the foregoing clauses first through sixth and, as a result of a workout the principal balances
of the U-Haul Portfolio Group 3 Notes have been reduced, such excess amount will be paid to the holders of the U-Haul Portfolio
Group 3 Notes on a pro rata and pari passu basis in an amount up to the reduction of the aggregate principal balance
of the U-Haul Portfolio Group 3 Notes as a result of such workout, plus interest on such amount at the interest rate under the
mortgage loan agreement;

 

○eighth, to the holders of the U-Haul Portfolio
Notes, pro rata, based on their respective percentage interests, any prepayment or yield maintenance premium, to the extent
paid by the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan borrowers;

 

○ninth, to the extent assumption fees, transfer
fees, late payment fees or charges (other than any prepayment or yield maintenance premium) actually paid by the U-Haul Portfolio
Whole Loan borrowers are not required to be otherwise applied under the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement, including,
without limitation, to provide reimbursement for advance interest, to pay any additional servicing expenses or to compensate a
U-Haul Portfolio Servicer (in each case provided that such reimbursements or payments relate to the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan),
any such fees or expenses, to the extent actually paid by the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan borrowers, will be paid to the holder
of the U-Haul Portfolio Notes, pro rata, based on their respective percentage interests; and

 

○tenth, if any excess amount is available to be
distributed in respect of the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan, and not otherwise applied in accordance with the foregoing clauses
first through ninth, any remaining amount will be paid pro rata to the holder of the U-Haul Portfolio Notes

Mortgaged Properties (including pursuant to a condemnation) at a time when the loan-to-value ratio of the U-Haul Portfolio Whole
Loan (as determined in accordance with the applicable
 


S-158
 
 
REMIC requirements) exceeds 125% (based solely upon the value of the remaining
real property and excluding any personal property or going concern value), will be allocated to reduce the principal balances of
the Notes in the manner permitted by the REMIC Provisions.
 

·if a U-Haul Portfolio Triggering Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all amounts available for payment on the

or the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement;

in accordance with the applicable REMIC requirements) exceeds 125% (based solely upon the value of the remaining real property
and excluding any personal property or going concern value), will be allocated to reduce the principal balances of the U-Haul
Portfolio Notes in the manner permitted by the REMIC Provisions; and

 

·costs, fees, expenses, losses and shortfalls relating to the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan will be allocated, first, to

then that P&I Advance, together with interest on that P&I Advance, may only be reimbursed out of future payments and collections
on the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan, but not out of payments or other collections on the U-

Haul Portfolio Companion Loans or
any loans included in any future securitization trust related to any U-Haul Portfolio Companion Loan.
 
A “U-Haul Portfolio Cross Over
Period” means any period during which an event of default under the related loan documents has occurred and is continuing
and either (i) the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the U-Haul Portfolio Group 3 Notes has been reduced to zero or (ii)
the aggregate appraisal reduction amount applied to the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan pursuant to the terms of the U-Haul Portfolio
Trust and Servicing Agreement is greater than or equal to the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the U-Haul Portfolio Group
3 Notes.
 
A “U-Haul Portfolio Triggering
Event of Default” means (i) any event of default with respect to an obligation of the related borrowers to pay money
due under the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan or (ii) any non-monetary event of default as a result of which the U-Haul Portfolio Whole
Loan becomes a specially serviced mortgage loan (which, for clarification, will not include certain defaults based on the judgment
of the U-Haul Portfolio Master Servicer under the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement).
 
Consultation and Control. The controlling
noteholder under the U-Haul Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement will be the trust formed pursuant to the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and
Servicing Agreement (the “U-Haul Portfolio Trust”) as holder of the U-Haul Portfolio Companion A-2A Note under
the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement; provided that, prior to the occurrence and continuance of a control
event under the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement, the U-Haul Portfolio controlling class certificateholder (or the
U-Haul Portfolio directing certificateholder on its behalf) (the “U-Haul Portfolio Directing Certificateholder”)
will be entitled to exercise the rights of the controlling noteholder with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan. The U-Haul
Portfolio Directing Certificateholder will be entitled to exercise rights as described under “Servicing of the Mortgage
Loans—Servicing of the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan” with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan,
and the implementation of any recommended actions outlined in an asset status report with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio Whole
Loan will require the U-Haul Portfolio Special Servicer to consult with the U-Haul Portfolio Directing Certificateholder upon request
in a manner substantially similar to that described herein under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—General”.
It is expected that a majority of the U-Haul Portfolio controlling class will be held by an affiliate of the guarantor of the U-Haul
Portfolio Whole Loan and consequently it is expected that there will be no U-Haul Portfolio Directing Certificateholder on the
closing date of the securitization relating to the U-Haul Portfolio Trust.
 
In addition, pursuant to the terms of the
U-Haul Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement, the holder of the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan (or its related representative, which
will be the Directing Certificateholder or any other party assigned the rights to exercise the rights of the holder of the
U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan, as and to the extent provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement), (i) will have non-binding
consultation rights with respect to “major decisions” and the implementation of any recommended action outlined in
the asset status report, (ii) will have the right to an annual meeting with the U-Haul Portfolio Master Servicer and the U-Haul
Portfolio Special Servicer in which servicing issues related to the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan may be discussed and (iii) will
have the right to receive copies of all notices, information and reports that the U-Haul Portfolio Master Servicer or the U-Haul
Portfolio Special Servicer, as applicable, is required to provide to the U-Haul Portfolio Directing Certificateholder (within the
same time frame such notices, information and reports are or would have been required to be provided to the U-Haul Portfolio Directing
Certificateholder under the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement).
 
Neither of the U-Haul Portfolio Servicers
will be permitted to follow any advice or consultation provided by the U-Haul Portfolio Directing Certificateholder (or its representative)
that would require or cause such U-Haul Portfolio Servicer to violate any applicable law, including the REMIC Provisions, be inconsistent
with the servicing standard under the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement, require or cause such U-Haul Portfolio Servicer
to violate provisions of the U-Haul Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement or the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement, require
or cause such U-Haul Portfolio Servicer to violate the terms of the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan, or materially expand the scope
of any of such U-Haul Portfolio Servicer’s responsibilities under the U-Haul Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement.
 


S-161
 
 
Sale of Defaulted U-Haul Portfolio Whole
Loan.  Pursuant to the terms of the U-Haul Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement, if the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan becomes a
defaulted mortgage loan, and if the U-Haul Portfolio Directing Certificateholder (or the U-Haul Portfolio Special Servicer acting
on its behalf) determines to sell the related Pari Passu Companion Loans in accordance with the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing
Agreement, then the U-Haul Portfolio Special Servicer will be required to sell the U-Haul Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loans
and the U-Haul Portfolio Subordinate Companion Loan together with the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan as one whole loan. In connection
with any such sale, the U-Haul Portfolio Special Servicer will be required to follow the procedures contained in the U-Haul Portfolio
Trust and Servicing Agreement, which are substantially similar to those set forth under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Realization
Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans.”
 
Special Servicer Appointment Rights.
Pursuant to the U-Haul Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement and the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement, the controlling
noteholder (or its representative) with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan (which will be the U-Haul Portfolio Directing
Certificateholder) will have the right, with or without cause, to replace the special servicer then acting with respect to the
U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan and appoint a replacement special servicer in lieu of such special servicer without the consent of
the holder of the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan. The U-Haul Portfolio Directing Certificateholder (prior to a control event under
the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement) and the applicable certificateholders under the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and
Servicing Agreement with the requisite percentage of voting rights (after a control event under the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and
Servicing Agreement) will have the right, with or without cause, to replace the U-Haul Portfolio Special Servicer and appoint a
replacement special servicer in lieu thereof, in a manner described under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Servicing
of the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan” in this free writing prospectus.
 
The First National Building
Whole Loan
 
General. The First National Building
Mortgage Loan, representing approximately 3.5% of the Initial Pool Balance, is part of a split loan structure comprised of two
(2) mortgage notes, each of which is secured by the same mortgage instrument on the same underlying Mortgaged Property.
 
The First National Building Mortgage Loan
is evidenced by a promissory note with a Cut-off Date Balance of $40,000,000. The related First National Building Pari Passu Companion
Loan is evidenced by a promissory note with an outstanding principal balance as of the Cut-off Date of $30,000,000 that is not
included in the trust. Only the First National Building Mortgage Loan is included in the trust. The First National Building Mortgage
Loan and the First National Building Pari Passu Companion Loan are pari passu with each other in terms of priority and are collectively
referred to in this free writing prospectus as the First National Building Whole Loan. It is anticipated that the First National
Building Pari Passu Companion Loan will be included in a future securitization; however, we cannot assure you that this will ultimately
occur.
 
The holders (the “First National
Building Noteholders”) of each promissory note comprising the First National Building Whole Loan have entered into a
co-lender agreement (the “First National Building Intercreditor Agreement”) that sets forth the respective rights
of each First National Building Noteholder. The First National Building Whole Loan will be serviced and administered pursuant to
the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement by the master servicer and the special servicer, as the case may be, according
to the Servicing Standard. The First National Building Intercreditor Agreement provides that expenses, losses and shortfalls relating
to the First National Building Whole Loan will be allocated on a pro rata basis to the First National Building Noteholders.
 
Servicing. The First National Building
Whole Loan (including the First National Building Mortgage Loan) and any related REO Property will be serviced and administered
by the master servicer and, if necessary, the special servicer, pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, in the manner
described under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans” in this free writing prospectus, but subject to the terms of the
related First National Building Intercreditor Agreement. In servicing the First National Building Whole Loan, the Servicing Standard
set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement will require the
 


S-162
 
 
master servicer and the special servicer to take into account
the interests, as a collective whole, of both the Certificateholders and the holder of the First National Building Pari Passu Companion
Loan.
 
Amounts payable to the trust as holder of
the First National Building Mortgage Loan pursuant to the related First National Building Intercreditor Agreement will be included
in the Available Distribution Amount for the related Distribution Date to the extent described in this free writing prospectus,
and amounts payable to the holder of the First National Building Pari Passu Companion Loan will be distributed to such holder net
of certain fees and expenses on the First National Building Pari Passu Companion Loan as set forth in the First National Building
Intercreditor Agreement and will not be available for distributions on the Offered Certificates.
 
Application of Payments. The First
National Building Intercreditor Agreement sets forth the respective rights of the holder of the First National Building Mortgage
Loan and the holder of the First National Building Pari Passu Companion Loan with respect to distributions of funds received in
respect of the First National Building Whole Loan, and provides, in general, that:
 

·the First National Building Mortgage Loan and the First National Building Pari Passu Companion Loan are of equal priority with
each other and no portion of either of them will have priority or preference over any portion of the other or security therefor;
 

·all payments, proceeds and other recoveries on or in respect of the First National Building Whole Loan or the related Mortgaged
Property will be applied to the First National Building Mortgage Loan and the First National Building Pari Passu Companion Loan
on a pro rata and pari passu basis according to their respective outstanding principal balances (subject, in each case, to the
payment of amounts for required reserves or escrows required by the related mortgage loan documents and payment and reimbursement
rights of the master servicer, the special servicer, the senior trust advisor, the certificate administrator, the depositor and
the trustee) in accordance with the terms of the First National Building Intercreditor Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement; and
 

·costs, fees, expenses, losses and shortfalls relating to the First National Building Whole Loan will be allocated, on a pro
rata and pari passu basis, to the First National Building Mortgage Loan and the First National Building Pari Passu Companion Loan
in accordance with the terms of the First National Building Intercreditor Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a P&I
Advance is made with respect to the First National Building Mortgage Loan pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
then that P&I Advance, together with interest on that P&I Advance, may only be reimbursed out of future payments and collections
on the First National Building Mortgage Loan or, as and to the extent described under “Description of the Certificates—Advances”
in this free writing prospectus, on other mortgage loans in this securitization, but not out of payments or other collections on
the First National Building Pari Passu Companion Loan or any loans included in any future securitization trust related to the First
National Building Pari Passu Companion Loan.
 
Because of the timing of collections on
the First National Building Whole Loan, certain costs and expenses (such as related Servicing Advances and interest thereon) allocable
to the First National Building Whole Loan may be paid or reimbursed out of payments and other collections on the mortgage pool,
subject to the trust’s right to reimbursement from future payments and other collections on the First National Building Pari
Passu Companion Loan or from general collections with respect to the securitization of the First National Building Pari Passu Companion
Loan for its pro rata share of such costs and expenses. This may result in temporary (or, if not ultimately reimbursed, permanent)
shortfalls to holders of the certificates.
 
Consultation and Control. The controlling
noteholder under the First National Building Intercreditor Agreement will be the trust as holder of the First National Building
Mortgage Loan; provided that, prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Control Event, the Directing Certificateholder will
be entitled to exercise the rights of the controlling noteholder with respect to the First National Building Whole Loan.
 


S-163
 
 
The Directing
Certificateholder will be entitled to exercise all of the rights of the trust in its capacity as the controlling noteholder under
the First National Building Intercreditor Agreement, as and to the extent described in this free writing prospectus under “Servicing
of the Mortgage Loans—The Directing Certificateholder” with respect to the First National Building Whole Loan,
and the implementation of any recommended actions outlined in an asset status report with respect to the First National Building
Whole Loan will require the special servicer to consult with and/or obtain the approval of the Directing Certificateholder as and
to the extent described in this free writing prospectus under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—General”
in this free writing prospectus. Pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Directing Certificateholder
and the senior trust advisor will each have the same consent and/or consultation rights with respect to the First National Building
Whole Loan as each does, and for so long as each does, with respect to the other mortgage loans included in the trust.
 
In addition, pursuant to the terms of the
First National Building Intercreditor Agreement, the holder of the First National Building Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative
which, at any time the First National Building Pari Passu Companion Loan is included in a securitization, may be the directing
certificateholder or controlling class representative for that securitization or any other party assigned the rights to exercise
the rights of the holder of the First National Building Pari Passu Companion Loan, as and to the extent provided in the related
pooling and servicing agreement) will (i) have the right to receive copies of all notices, information and reports that the master
servicer or special servicer, as applicable, is required to provide to the Directing Certificateholder (within the same time frame
such notices, information and reports are or would have been required to be provided to the Directing Certificateholder under the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement without regard to the occurrence of a Control Event or Consultation Termination Event) with respect
to any major decisions to be taken with respect to the First National Building Whole Loan or the implementation of any recommended
action outlined in an asset status report relating to the First National Building Whole Loan and (ii) have the right to be consulted
on a strictly non-binding basis to the extent the holder of the First National Building Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative)
requests consultation with respect to certain major decisions to be taken with respect to the First National Building Whole Loan
or the implementation of any recommended action outlined in an asset status report relating to the First National Building Whole
Loan. The consultation right of the holder of the First National Building Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative) will
expire 10 business days following the delivery of written notice and information relating to the matter subject to consultation
whether or not the holder of the First National Building Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative) has responded within
such period; provided that if the master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, proposes a new course of action that is materially
different from the actions previously proposed, the 10 business day consultation period will be deemed to begin anew from the date
of delivery of such new proposal and delivery of all information related to such new proposal. Notwithstanding the consultation
rights of the holder of the First National Building Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative) described above, the master
servicer or special servicer, as applicable, is permitted to make any material decision or take any action set forth in the asset
status report before the expiration of the aforementioned 10 business day period if it determines that immediate action with respect
to such decision is necessary to protect the interests of the holders of the First National Building Mortgage Loan and First National
Building Pari Passu Companion Loan. Neither the master servicer nor the special servicer will be obligated at any time to follow
or take any alternative actions recommended by the holder of the First National Building Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative,
including, if the First National Building Pari Passu Companion Loan has been contributed to a securitization, the related directing
certificateholder or controlling class representative (or similar entity)).
 
Neither the master servicer nor the special
servicer may follow or be required to follow any direction, advice or consultation provided by the Directing Certificateholder
or the holder of the First National Building Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative) that would require or cause the
master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, to violate any applicable law, including the REMIC Provisions, be inconsistent
with the Servicing Standard, require or cause the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, to violate provisions
of the First National Building Intercreditor Agreement, require or cause the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable,
to violate the terms of the First National Building Whole Loan, or materially expand the scope of any of the master servicer’s
or the
 


S-164
 
 
special servicer’s, as applicable, responsibilities under the First National Building Intercreditor Agreement or the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
In addition to the consultation rights of
the holder of the First National Building Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative) described above, pursuant to the terms
of the First National Building Intercreditor Agreement, the holder of the First National Building Pari Passu Companion Loan (or
its representative) will have the right to attend (in-person or telephonically in the discretion of the master servicer or special
servicer, as applicable) annual meetings with the master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, upon reasonable notice and
at times reasonably acceptable to the master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, for the purpose of discussing servicing
issues related to the First National Building Whole Loan.
 
Sale of Defaulted Serviced Pari Passu
Whole Loan. Pursuant to the terms of the First National Building Intercreditor Agreement, if the First National Building Mortgage
Loan becomes a Defaulted Mortgage Loan, and if the special servicer determines to sell the First National Building Mortgage Loan
upon its becoming a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, then the special servicer
will be required to sell the related First National Building Pari Passu Companion Loan together with the First National Building
Mortgage Loan as one whole loan. In connection with any such sale, the special servicer will be required to follow the procedures
set forth under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans” in this free
writing prospectus.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the special
servicer will not be permitted to sell the First National Building Mortgage Loan and First National Building Pari Passu Companion
Loan if such Whole Loan becomes a defaulted whole loan without the written consent of the holder of the First National Building
Pari Passu Companion Loan (provided that such consent is not required if the holder of the First National Building Pari Passu Companion
Loan is the borrower or an affiliate of the borrower) unless the special servicer has delivered to the holder of the First National
Building Pari Passu Companion Loan: (a) at least 15 business days prior written notice of any decision to attempt to sell the related
Whole Loan; (b) at least 10 days prior to the proposed sale date, a copy of each bid package (together with any material amendments
to such bid packages) received by the special servicer in connection with any such proposed sale; (c) at least 10 days prior to
the proposed sale date, a copy of the most recent appraisal for the First National Building Whole Loan, and any documents in the
servicing file reasonably requested by the holder of the First National Building Pari Passu Companion Loan that are material to
the price of the First National Building Whole Loan; and (d) until the sale is completed, and a reasonable period of time (but
no less time than is afforded to other offerors and the Directing Certificateholder) prior to the proposed sale date, all information
and other documents being provided to other offerors and all leases or other documents that are approved by the master servicer
or the special servicer in connection with the proposed sale; provided that the holder of the First National Building Pari Passu
Companion Loan may waive as to itself any of the delivery or timing requirements described in this sentence. Subject to the terms
of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the holder of the First National Building Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative)
will be permitted to submit an offer at any sale of the related Whole Loan.
 
See “Servicing of the Mortgage
Loans—Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Special Servicer Appointment Rights.
Subject to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the controlling noteholder (or its representative) with respect to
the First National Building Whole Loan (which will be the trust) will have the right to replace the special servicer then acting
with respect to the First National Building Whole Loan (a) for cause at any time and (b) without cause if either (i) LNR Partners,
LLC (or its affiliate) is no longer the special servicer or (ii) LNR Securities Holdings, LLC (or its affiliate) owns less than
25% of the Controlling Class, and appoint a replacement special servicer without the consent of the holder of the First National
Building Pari Passu Companion Loan. The Directing Certificateholder (prior to a Control Event), and the applicable certificateholders
with the requisite percentage of Voting Rights (after a Control Event) will exercise the rights of the trust as controlling noteholder,
and will have the right, with or without cause (subject to the limitations described herein and
 


S-165
 
 
in the pooling and servicing agreement),
to replace the special servicer then acting with respect to the First National Building Whole Loan and appoint a replacement special
servicer, as described under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Rights Upon Servicer Termination Event”
in this free writing prospectus.
 
The One Shell Square Whole
Loan
 
General. The One Shell Square Mortgage
Loan, representing approximately 3.1% of the Initial Pool Balance, is part of a split loan structure comprised of two (2) mortgage
notes, each of which is secured by the same mortgage instrument on the same underlying Mortgaged Property.
 
The One Shell Square Mortgage Loan is evidenced
by a promissory note with a Cut-off Date Balance of $36,100,000. The One Shell Square Pari Passu Companion Loan is evidenced by
a promissory note with an aggregate outstanding principal balance as of the Cut-off Date of $90,000,000 that is not included in
the trust. Only the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan is included in the trust. The One Shell Square Mortgage Loan and the One Shell
Square Pari Passu Companion Loan are pari passu with each other in terms of priority and are collectively referred to in this free
writing prospectus as the One Shell Square Whole Loan.
 
The holders (the “One Shell Square
Noteholders”) of each promissory note comprising the One Shell Square Whole Loan have entered into a co-lender agreement
(the “One Shell Square Intercreditor Agreement”) that sets forth the respective rights of each One Shell Square
Noteholder. The One Shell Square Whole Loan will be serviced and administered pursuant to the terms of the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling
and Servicing Agreement. The One Shell Square Intercreditor Agreement provides that expenses, losses and shortfalls relating to
the One Shell Square Whole Loan will be allocated on a pro rata basis to the One Shell Square Noteholders.
 
The trust formed pursuant to the JPMBB 2015-C30
Pooling and Servicing Agreement (the “JPMBB 2015-C30 Trust”) is the holder of a One Shell Square Pari Passu
Companion Loan and so long as no control event has occurred under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the JPMBB
2015-C30 directing certificateholder will have the right to direct, consult with and advise the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer
and the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer with respect to the One Shell Square Whole Loan, but will be required to consult with the
Directing Certificateholder of the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan (so long as no Control Event has occurred and is continuing under
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement for this transaction) with respect to such advice, consent or action. In the event that the
parties exercising the rights of the holder of the One Shell Square Pari Passu Companion Loan and the holder of the One Shell Square
Mortgage Loan under the One Shell Square Intercreditor Agreement disagree, the decision of the party exercising the rights of the
holder of the One Shell Square Pari Passu Companion Loan under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement will be binding.
 
Servicing. The One Shell Square Whole
Loan (including the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan) and any related REO Property will be serviced and administered by the JPMBB
2015-C30 Master Servicer and, if necessary, the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer, according to the terms of the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling
and Servicing Agreement and the servicing standard thereunder, which requires the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer and the JPMBB
2015-C30 Special Servicer to take into account the interests, as a collective whole, of both the Certificateholders and the holder
of the One Shell Square Pari Passu Companion Loan.
 
Amounts payable to the trust as holder of
the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan pursuant to the related One Shell Square Intercreditor Agreement will be included in the Available
Distribution Amount for the related Distribution Date to the extent described in this free writing prospectus, and amounts payable
to the holder of the One Shell Square Pari Passu Companion Loan will be distributed to such holder net of certain fees and expenses
on the One Shell Square Pari Passu Companion Loan as set forth in the One Shell Square Intercreditor Agreement and will not be
available for distributions on the Offered Certificates.
 


S-166
 
 
Application of Payments. The One
Shell Square Intercreditor Agreement sets forth the respective rights of the holder of the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan and the
holder of the One Shell Square Pari Passu Companion Loan with respect to distributions of funds received in respect of the One
Shell Square Whole Loan, and provides, in general, that:
 

·the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan and the One Shell Square Pari Passu Companion Loan are of equal priority with each other
and no portion of either of them will have priority or preference over any portion of the other or security therefor;
 

·all payments, proceeds and other recoveries on or in respect of the One Shell Square Whole Loan or the related Mortgaged Property
will be applied to the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan and the One Shell Square Pari Passu Companion Loan on a pro rata and
pari passu basis according to their respective outstanding principal balances (subject, in each case, to the payment of
amounts for required reserves or escrows required by the related mortgage loan documents and payment and reimbursement rights of
the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer, the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer, the related senior trust advisor, the related certificate
administrator, the related depositor and the related trustee) in accordance with the terms of the One Shell Square Intercreditor
Agreement and the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement; and
 

·costs, fees, expenses, losses and shortfalls relating to the One Shell Square Whole Loan will be allocated, on a pro rata
and pari passu basis, to the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan and the One Shell Square Pari Passu Companion Loan in accordance
with the terms of the One Shell Square Intercreditor Agreement and the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a P&I
Advance is made with respect to the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
then that P&I Advance, together with interest on that P&I Advance, may only be reimbursed out of future payments and collections
on the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan or, as and to the extent described under “Description of the Certificates—Advances”
in this free writing prospectus, on other mortgage loans in this securitization, but not out of payments or other collections on
the One Shell Square Pari Passu Companion Loan or any loans included in any securitization trust related to the One Shell Square
Pari Passu Companion Loan.
 
Certain costs and expenses (such as a pro
rata share of any servicing advance with respect to the One Shell Square Whole Loan made pursuant to the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling
and Servicing Agreement) allocable to the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan in accordance with the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing
Agreement and the One Shell Square Intercreditor Agreement may be paid or reimbursed out of payments and other collections on the
mortgage pool. This may result in temporary (or, if not ultimately reimbursed, permanent) shortfalls to holders of the certificates.
 
Consultation and Control. The controlling
noteholder under the One Shell Square Intercreditor Agreement will be the JPMBB 2015-C30 Trust as holder of a One Shell Square
Pari Passu Companion Loan under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement; provided that, prior to the occurrence
and continuance of a control event under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the controlling class certificateholder
(or the directing certificateholder on its behalf) under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement (the “JPMBB
2015-C30 Directing Certificateholder”) will be entitled to exercise the rights of the controlling noteholder with respect
to the One Shell Square Whole Loan. The JPMBB 2015-C30 Directing Certificateholder will be entitled to exercise rights substantially
similar to the rights of the trust, in its capacity as the controlling noteholder under the One Shell Square Intercreditor Agreement,
as described in this free writing prospectus under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—The Directing Certificateholder”
with respect to the One Shell Square Whole Loan, and the implementation of any recommended actions outlined in an asset status
report with respect to the One Shell Square Whole Loan will require the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer to consult with the JPMBB
2015-C30 Directing Certificateholder in a manner substantially similar to that described herein under “Servicing of the
Mortgage Loans—General”. Pursuant to the terms of the JPMBB 2015-C30
 


S-167
 
 
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the
JPMBB 2015-C30 Directing Certificateholder and the related senior trust advisor will each have the same consent and/or consultation
rights with respect to the One Shell Square Whole Loan as each does, and for so long as each does, with respect to the other mortgage
loans included in that trust.
 
In addition, pursuant to the terms of the
One Shell Square Intercreditor Agreement, the holder of the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan (or its representative, which will be
the Controlling Class Certificateholder or any other party assigned the rights to exercise the rights of the holder of the
One Shell Square Mortgage Loan, as and to the extent provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) will (i) have the right
to receive copies of all notices, information and reports that the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer or the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special
Servicer, as applicable, is required to provide to the JPMBB 2015-C30 Directing Certificateholder (within the same time frame,
such notices, information and reports are or would have been required to be provided to the JPMBB 2015-C30 Directing Certificateholder
under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement without regard to the occurrence of any control event or consultation
termination event under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement) with respect to any major decisions to be taken with
respect to the One Shell Square Whole Loan or the implementation of any recommended action outlined in an asset status report relating
to the One Shell Square Whole Loan and (ii) have the right to be consulted on a strictly non-binding basis to the extent the
holder of the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan (or its representative) requests consultation with respect to certain major decisions
to be taken with respect to the One Shell Square Whole Loan or the implementation of any recommended action outlined in an asset
status report relating to the One Shell Square Whole Loan. The consultation right of the holder of the One Shell Square Mortgage
Loan (or its representative) will expire 10 business days following the delivery of written notice and information relating to
the matter subject to consultation whether or not the holder of the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan (or its representative) has
responded within such period; provided that if the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer or the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer,
as applicable, proposes a new course of action that is materially different from the actions previously proposed, the 10 business
day consultation period will be deemed to begin anew from the date of delivery of such new proposal and delivery of all information
related to such new proposal. Notwithstanding the consultation rights of the holder of the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan (or its
representative) described above, the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer or the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer, as applicable, is permitted
to make any material decision or take any action set forth in the asset status report before the expiration of the aforementioned
10 business day period if it determines that immediate action with respect to such decision is necessary to protect the interests
of the holders of the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan and the One Shell Square Pari Passu Companion Loan. Neither the JPMBB 2015-C30
Master Servicer nor the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer will be obligated at any time to follow or take any alternative actions
recommended by the holder of the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan (or its representative, including, the directing certificateholder
(or similar entity)). The senior trust advisor will generally have no obligations or consultation rights under the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement with respect to the One Shell Square Whole Loan or any related REO Property. However, Pentalpha Surveillance
LLC is also the senior trust advisor under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement and, in such capacity, will have
certain obligations and consultation rights with respect to the One Shell Square Whole Loan that are substantially similar to those
of the senior trust advisor under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
Neither the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer
nor the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer may follow or be required to follow any advice or consultation provided by the holder of
the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan (or its representative) that would require or cause the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer or the
JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer, as applicable, to violate any applicable law, including the REMIC Provisions, be inconsistent
with the servicing standard under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, require or cause the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master
Servicer or the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer, as applicable, to violate provisions of the One Shell Square Intercreditor Agreement
or the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, require or cause the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer or the JPMBB 2015-C30
Special Servicer, as applicable, to violate the terms of the One Shell Square Whole Loan, or materially expand the scope of any
of the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer’s or the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer’s, as applicable, responsibilities under
the One Shell Square Intercreditor Agreement or the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 


S-168
 
 
In addition to the consultation rights of
the holder of the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan (or its representative) described above, pursuant to the terms of the One Shell
Square Intercreditor Agreement, the holder of the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan (or its representative) will have the right to
attend (in-person or telephonically in the discretion of the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer or the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer,
as applicable) annual meetings with the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer or the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer, as applicable, upon
reasonable notice and at times reasonably acceptable to the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer or the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer,
as applicable, for the purpose of discussing servicing issues related to the One Shell Square Whole Loan.
 
Sale of Defaulted One Shell Square Whole
Loan. Pursuant to the terms of the One Shell Square Intercreditor Agreement, if the One Shell Square Whole Loan becomes a defaulted
whole loan, and if the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer determines to sell the One Shell Square Pari Passu Companion Loan included
in the JPMBB 2015-C30 Trust in accordance with the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, then the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special
Servicer will be required to sell the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan together with the One Shell Square Pari Passu Companion Loan
as one whole loan. In connection with any such sale, the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer will be required to follow the procedures
contained in the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, which are substantially similar to those set forth under “Servicing
of the Mortgage Loans—Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the JPMBB
2015-C30 Special Servicer will not be permitted to sell the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan and the One Shell Square Pari Passu
Companion Loan if such Whole Loan becomes a defaulted whole loan without the written consent of the holder of the One Shell Square
Mortgage Loan (provided that such consent is not required if the holder of the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan is the borrower or
an affiliate of the borrower) unless the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer has delivered to the holder of the One Shell Square Mortgage
Loan: (a) at least 15 business days prior written notice of any decision to attempt to sell the One Shell Square Whole Loan;
(b) at least 10 days prior to the proposed sale date, a copy of each bid package (together with any material amendments to
such bid packages) received by the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer in connection with any such proposed sale; (c) at least
10 days prior to the proposed sale date, a copy of the most recent appraisal for the One Shell Square Whole Loan, and any documents
in the servicing file reasonably requested by the holder of the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan that are material to the price of
the One Shell Square Whole Loan; and (d) until the sale is completed, and a reasonable period of time (but no less time than
is afforded to other offerors and the JPMBB 2015-C30 Directing Certificateholder) prior to the proposed sale date, all information
and other documents being provided to other offerors and all leases or other documents that are approved by the JPMBB 2015-C30
Master Servicer or the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer in connection with the proposed sale; provided that the holder of
the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan may waive any of the delivery or timing requirements described in this sentence. Subject to
the terms of the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the holder of the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan (or its representative)
will be permitted to bid at any sale of the One Shell Square Whole Loan (unless such person is the borrower or an agent or affiliate
of the borrower).

Loans—Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans” in this free writing prospectus.

Pursuant and subject to the terms of the One Shell Square Intercreditor Agreement and the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, the controlling noteholder (or its representative) with respect to the One Shell Square Whole Loan (which will be the

Square Whole Loan and appoint a replacement special servicer without the consent of the holder of the One Shell Square Mortgage
Loan. The JPMBB 2015-C30 Directing Certificateholder (prior to a control event under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement),
and the applicable certificateholders under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement with the requisite percentage of
voting rights (after a control event under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement) will exercise the rights of the
JPMBB 2015-C30 Trust as controlling noteholder, and will have the right to replace the special servicer then acting with respect

The Eastmont Town Center
Whole Loan
 
General. The Eastmont Town Center
Mortgage Loan, representing approximately 2.5% of the Initial Pool Balance, is part of a split loan structure comprised of two
(2) mortgage notes, each of which is secured by the same mortgage instrument on the same underlying Mortgaged Property.
 
The Eastmont Town Center Mortgage Loan is
evidenced by a promissory note with a Cut-off Date Balance of $28,805,390. The Eastmont Town Center Pari Passu Companion Loan is
evidenced by a promissory note with a Cut-off Date Balance of $12,242,291 that is not included in the trust. Only the Eastmont
Town Center Mortgage Loan is included in the trust. The Eastmont Town Center Mortgage Loan and the Eastmont Town Center Pari Passu
Companion Loan are pari passu with each other in terms of priority and are collectively referred to in this free writing
prospectus as the Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan.
 
The holders (the “Eastmont Town
Center Noteholders”) of each promissory note comprising the Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan have entered into a co-lender
agreement (the “Eastmont Town Center Intercreditor Agreement”) that sets forth the respective rights of each
the Eastmont Town Center Noteholder. Pursuant to the terms of the Eastmont Town Center Intercreditor Agreement, the Eastmont Town
Center Whole Loan will be serviced and administered pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Pursuant to the
Eastmont Town Center Intercreditor Agreement, expenses, losses and shortfalls relating to the Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan are
required to be allocated on a pro rata basis to the Eastmont Town Center Noteholders.
 
The trust formed in connection with the
issuance of the Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2015-GC29, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2015-GC29
(the “CGCMT 2015-GC29 Trust”) is the holder of the Eastmont Town Center Pari Passu Companion Loan. Prior to
the Closing Date, the Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan has been serviced under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement for the CGCMT
2015-GC29 Trust (the “CGCMT 2015-GC29 Pooling and Servicing Agreement”), by Midland Loan Services, a Division
of PNC Bank, National Association, as master servicer and as special servicer. From and after the Closing Date, the Eastmont Town
Center Whole Loan will be serviced under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
So long as no Control Event has occurred
under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Directing Certificateholder will have the right to direct, consult with and advise
the master servicer and the special servicer with respect to the Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan. However, the trust (or master
servicer or special servicer on its behalf) will also be required to consult, on a strictly non-binding basis, with the CGCMT 2015-GC29
Trust, as holder of the Eastmont Town Center Pari Passu Companion Loan, or its representative (which will be, prior to the occurrence
and continuance of a control event under the CGCMT 2015-GC29 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the controlling class certificateholder
under the CGCMT 2015-GC29 Pooling and Servicing Agreement (or the directing certificateholder under the CGCMT 2015-GC29 Pooling
and Servicing Agreement on its behalf)) with respect to certain major decisions and the implementation of any recommended actions
outlined in an asset status report; provided that in no event shall the trust (or the master servicer or special servicer on its
behalf) be obligated to follow or take any alternative actions recommended by the holder of the Eastmont Town Center Pari Passu
Companion Loan, or its representative.
 
Servicing. The Eastmont Town Center
Whole Loan (including the Eastmont Town Center Mortgage Loan) and any related REO Property will be serviced and administered by
the master servicer and, if necessary, the special servicer, pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, in the manner described

Amounts payable to the trust as holder of
the Eastmont Town Center Mortgage Loan pursuant to the Eastmont Town Center Intercreditor Agreement will be included in the Available
Distribution Amount for the related Distribution Date to the extent described in this free writing prospectus, and amounts payable
to the holder of the Eastmont Town Center Pari Passu Companion Loan will be distributed to such holder net of certain fees and
expenses on the Eastmont Town Center Pari Passu Companion Loan as set forth in the Eastmont Town Center Intercreditor Agreement
and will not be available for distributions on the Offered Certificates.
 
Application of Payments. The Eastmont
Town Center Intercreditor Agreement sets forth the respective rights of the holder of the Eastmont Town Center Mortgage Loan and
the holder of the Eastmont Town Center Pari Passu Companion Loan with respect to distributions of funds received in respect of
the Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan, and provides, in general, that:
 

·The Eastmont Town Center Mortgage Loan and the Eastmont Town Center Pari Passu Companion Loan are of equal priority with each
other and no portion of either of them will have priority or preference over any portion of the other or security therefor;
 

·all payments, proceeds and other recoveries on or in respect of the Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan or the related Mortgaged
Property will be applied to the Eastmont Town Center Mortgage Loan and the Eastmont Town Center Pari Passu Companion Loan on a
pro rata and pari passu basis according to their respective outstanding principal balances (subject, in each case,
to the payment of amounts for required reserves or escrows required by the related mortgage loan documents and payment and reimbursement
rights of the master servicer, the special servicer, the senior trust advisor, the certificate administrator, the depositor and
the trustee) in accordance with the terms of the Eastmont Town Center Intercreditor Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement;
and
 

·costs, fees, expenses, losses and shortfalls relating to the Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan will be allocated, on a pro
rata and pari passu basis, to the Eastmont Town Center Mortgage Loan and the Eastmont Town Center Pari Passu Companion
Loan in accordance with the terms of the Eastmont Town Center Intercreditor Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a P&I
Advance is made with respect to the Eastmont Town Center Mortgage Loan pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
then that P&I Advance, together with interest on that P&I Advance, may only be reimbursed out of future payments and collections
on the Eastmont Town Center Mortgage Loan or, as and to the extent described under “Description of the Certificates—Advances”
in this free writing prospectus, on other mortgage loans, but not out of payments or other collections on the Eastmont Town Center
Pari Passu Companion Loan or any loans included in the CGCMT 2015-GC29 Trust.
 
Because of the timing of collections on
the Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan, certain costs and expenses (such as Servicing Advances and interest thereon) allocable to
the Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan may be paid or reimbursed out of payments and other collections on the mortgage pool, subject
to the trust’s right to reimbursement from future payments and other collections on the Eastmont Town Center Pari Passu Companion
Loan or from general collections with respect to the CGCMT 2015-GC29 Trust for its pro rata share of such costs and expenses. This
may result in temporary (or, if not ultimately reimbursed, permanent) shortfalls to holders of the certificates.
 
Consultation and Control. The controlling
noteholder under the Eastmont Town Center Intercreditor Agreement will be the trust as holder of the Eastmont Town Center Mortgage
Loan; provided that, prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Control Event, the Directing Certificateholder will be
entitled to exercise the rights of the controlling noteholder with respect to the Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan. The Directing
Certificateholder will be entitled to exercise all the rights of the trust, in its capacity as the controlling noteholder under
the Eastmont Town Center Intercreditor Agreement, as and to the extent set forth in this free writing prospectus under “Servicing
of the Mortgage Loans—The Directing Certificateholder” with respect to the Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan,
and the implementation of any recommended actions outlined in an asset status report with respect to the Eastmont Town Center Whole
 

S-171
 
 
Loan will require the special servicer to consult with and/or obtain the approval of the Directing Certificateholder as and to
the extent described herein under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—General”. Pursuant to the terms
of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Directing Certificateholder and the senior trust advisor will each have the same consent
and/or consultation rights with respect to the Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan as each does, and for so long as each does, with
respect to the other mortgage loans included in the trust.
 
In addition, pursuant to the terms of the
Eastmont Town Center Intercreditor Agreement, the CGCMT 2015-GC29 Trust, as holder of the Eastmont Town Center Pari Passu Companion
Loan (or its representative (which will be, prior to the occurrence and continuance of a control event under the CGCMT 2015-GC29
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the controlling class representative under the CGCMT 2015-GC29 Pooling and Servicing Agreement)
or any other party assigned the rights to exercise the rights of the holder of the Eastmont Town Center Pari Passu Companion Loan,
as and to the extent provided in the CGCMT 2015-GC29 Pooling and Servicing Agreement) will (i) have the right to receive copies
of all notices, information and reports that the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, is required to provide
to the Directing Certificateholder (within the same time frame, such notices, information and reports are or would have been required
to be provided to the Directing Certificateholder under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement without regard to the occurrence of
a Control Event or Consultation Termination Event) with respect to any major decisions to be taken with respect to the Eastmont
Town Center Whole Loan or the implementation of any recommended action outlined in an asset status report relating to the Eastmont
Town Center Whole Loan and (ii) have the right to be consulted on a strictly non-binding basis to the extent the holder of
the Eastmont Town Center Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative) requests consultation with respect to certain major
decisions to be taken with respect to the Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan or the implementation of any recommended action outlined
in an asset status report relating to the Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan. The consultation right of the holder of the Eastmont
Town Center Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative) will expire 10 business days following the delivery of written notice
and information relating to the matter subject to consultation whether or not the holder of the Eastmont Town Center Pari Passu
Companion Loan (or its representative) has responded within such period; provided that if the master servicer or the special
servicer, as applicable, proposes a new course of action that is materially different from the actions previously proposed, the
10 business day consultation period will be deemed to begin anew from the date of delivery of such new proposal and delivery of
all information related to such new proposal. Notwithstanding the consultation rights of the holder of the Eastmont Town Center
Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative) described above, the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable,
is permitted to make any material decision or take any action set forth in the asset status report before the expiration of the
aforementioned 10 business day period if it determines that immediate action with respect to such decision is necessary to protect
the interests of the holders of the Eastmont Town Center Mortgage Loan and the Eastmont Town Center Pari Passu Companion Loan.
Neither the master servicer nor the special servicer will be obligated at any time to follow or take any alternative actions recommended
by the holder of the Eastmont Town Center Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative, including, the controlling class representative
(or similar entity)).
 
No objection of the Directing Certificateholder
or the holder of the Eastmont Town Center Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative) may require or cause the master servicer
or the special servicer, as applicable, to violate any provision of the Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan, applicable law, the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement, the Eastmont Town Center Intercreditor Agreement, the REMIC provisions of the Code or the obligation to
act in accordance with the Servicing Standard.
 
In addition to the consultation rights of
the holder of the Eastmont Town Center Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative) described above, pursuant to the terms
of the Eastmont Town Center Intercreditor Agreement, the holder of the Eastmont Town Center Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative)
will have the right to attend (in-person or telephonically in the discretion of the master servicer or the special servicer, as
applicable) annual meetings with the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, upon reasonable notice and at times
reasonably acceptable to the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, for the purpose of discussing servicing issues
related to the Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan.

Sale of Defaulted Eastmont Town Center
Whole Loan. Pursuant to the terms of the Eastmont Town Center Intercreditor Agreement, if the Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan
becomes a defaulted whole loan, and if the special servicer determines to sell the Eastmont Town Center Mortgage Loan in accordance
with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, then the special servicer will be required to sell the Eastmont Town Center Pari Passu
Companion Loan together with the Eastmont Town Center Mortgage Loan as one whole loan. In connection with any such sale, the special
servicer will be required to follow the procedures set forth under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Realization

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the special

consent of the holder of the Eastmont Town Center Pari Passu Companion Loan (provided that such consent is not required if the
holder of the Eastmont Town Center Pari Passu Companion Loan is the borrower or an affiliate of the borrower) unless the special

prior written notice of any decision to attempt to sell the Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan; (b) at least 10 days prior to

with the proposed sale; provided that the holder of the Eastmont Town Center Pari Passu Companion Loan may waive any of

General. The Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio
Mortgage Loan, representing approximately 2.2% of the Initial Pool Balance, is part of a split loan structure comprised of two
(2) mortgage notes, each of which is secured by the same mortgage instrument on the same underlying Mortgaged Property.
 
The Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Mortgage
Loan is evidenced by a promissory note with a Cut-off Date Balance of $25,000,000. The related Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio

S-173
 
 
$13,500,000 that is not included in the trust. Only the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Mortgage Loan is included in the trust.
The Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Mortgage Loan and the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loan are pari
passu with each other in terms of priority and are collectively referred to in this free writing prospectus as the Hyatt Place
Texas Portfolio Whole Loan. It is anticipated that the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loan will be included
in a future securitization; however, we cannot assure you that this will ultimately occur.
 
The holders (the “Hyatt Place Texas
Portfolio Noteholders”) of each promissory note comprising the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Whole Loan have entered
into a co-lender agreement (the “Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement”) that sets forth the respective
rights of each Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Noteholder. The Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Whole Loan will be serviced and administered
pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement by the master servicer and the special servicer, as the case may be,
according to the Servicing Standard. The Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement provides that expenses, losses and
shortfalls relating to the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Whole Loan will be allocated on a pro rata basis to the Hyatt
Place Texas Portfolio Noteholders.
 
Servicing. The Hyatt Place Texas
Portfolio Whole Loan (including the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Mortgage Loan) and any related REO Property will be serviced
and administered by the master servicer and, if necessary, the special servicer, pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
in the manner described under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans” in this free writing prospectus, but subject

Loan, the Servicing Standard set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement will require the master servicer and the special
servicer to take into account the interests, as a collective whole, of both the Certificateholders and the holder of the Hyatt
Place Texas Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loan.
 
Amounts payable to the trust as holder of
the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Mortgage Loan pursuant to the related Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement
will be included in the Available Distribution Amount for the related Distribution Date to the extent described in this free writing
prospectus, and amounts payable to the holder of the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loan will be distributed
to such holder net of certain fees and expenses on the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loan as set forth
in the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement and will not be available for distributions on the Offered Certificates.
 
Application of Payments. The Hyatt
Place Texas Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement sets forth the respective rights of the holder of the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio
Mortgage Loan and the holder of the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loan with respect to distributions
of funds received in respect of the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Whole Loan, and provides, in general, that:
 
·    the
Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Mortgage Loan and the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loan are of equal
priority with each other and no portion of either of them will have priority or preference over any portion of the other or security
therefor; and
 
·    all
payments, proceeds and other recoveries on or in respect of the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Whole Loan or the related Mortgaged
Property will be applied to the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Mortgage Loan and the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Pari Passu Companion
Loan on a pro rata and pari passu basis according to their respective outstanding principal balances (subject,
in each case, to the payment of amounts for required reserves or escrows required by the related mortgage loan documents and payment
and reimbursement rights of the master servicer, the special servicer and the trustee) in accordance with the terms of the Hyatt
Place Texas Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a P&I
Advance is made with respect to the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Mortgage Loan pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, then that P&I Advance, together with interest on that P&I Advance, may only be reimbursed out of future payments
and collections on the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Mortgage Loan or, as and to the extent described under
 

S-174
 
 
“Description
of the Certificates—Advances” in this free writing prospectus, on other mortgage loans in this securitization,
but not out of payments or other collections on the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loan or any loans included
in any future securitization trust related to the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loan.
 
Because of the timing of collections on
the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Whole Loan, certain costs and expenses (such as related Servicing Advances and interest thereon)
allocable to the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Whole Loan may be paid or reimbursed out of payments and other collections on
the mortgage pool, subject to the trust’s right to reimbursement from future payments and other collections on the Hyatt
Place Texas Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loan or from general collections with respect to the securitization of the Hyatt
Place Texas Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loan for its pro rata share of such costs and expenses. This may result in temporary
(or, if not ultimately reimbursed, permanent) shortfalls to holders of the certificates.
 
Consultation and Control. The controlling
noteholder under the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement will be the trust as holder of the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio
Mortgage Loan; provided that, prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Control Event, the Directing Certificateholder
will be entitled to exercise the rights of the controlling noteholder with respect to the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Whole Loan.
The Directing Certificateholder will be entitled to exercise all of the rights of the trust in its capacity as the controlling
noteholder under the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement, as and to the extent set forth in this free writing prospectus
under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—The Directing Certificateholder” with respect to the Hyatt
Place Texas Portfolio Whole Loan, and the implementation of any recommended actions outlined in an asset status report with respect
to the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Whole Loan will require the special servicer to consult with and/or obtain the approval
of the Directing Certificateholder as and to the extent described in this free writing prospectus under “Servicing of
the Mortgage Loans—General” in this free writing prospectus. Pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, the Directing Certificateholder and the senior trust advisor will each have the same consent and/or consultation rights

other mortgage loans included in the trust.

Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement, the holder of the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loan (or
its representative which, at any time the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loan is included in a securitization,
may be the directing certificateholder or controlling class representative for that securitization or any other party assigned
the rights to exercise the rights of the holder of the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loan, as and to the extent
provided in the related pooling and servicing agreement) will (i) have the right to receive copies of all notices, information
and reports that the master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, is required to provide to the Directing Certificateholder

the implementation of any recommended action outlined in an asset status report relating to the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Whole
Loan and (ii) have the right to be consulted on a strictly non-binding basis to the extent the holder of the Hyatt Place
Texas Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative) requests consultation with respect to certain major decisions

in an asset status report relating to the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Whole Loan. The consultation right of the holder of the Hyatt
Place Texas Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative) will expire 10 business days following the delivery
of written notice and information relating to the matter subject to consultation whether or not the holder of the Hyatt Place Texas
Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative) has responded within such period; provided that if the
master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, proposes a new course of action that is materially different from the actions
previously proposed, the 10 business day consultation period will be deemed to begin anew from the date of delivery of such new
proposal and delivery of all information related to such new proposal. Notwithstanding the consultation
 

S-175
 
 
rights of the holder of
the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative) described above, the master servicer or
special servicer, as applicable, is permitted to make any material decision or take any action set forth in the asset status report
before the expiration of the aforementioned 10 business day period if it determines that immediate action with respect to such
decision is necessary to protect the interests of the holders of the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Mortgage Loan and the Hyatt
Place Texas Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loan. Neither the master servicer nor the special servicer will be obligated at any
time to follow or take any alternative actions recommended by the holder of the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Pari Passu Companion
Loan (or its representative, including, if the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loan has been contributed

Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative) that would require or cause the master servicer or the special servicer,
as applicable, to violate any applicable law, including the REMIC Provisions, be inconsistent with the Servicing Standard, require
or cause the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, to violate provisions of the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Intercreditor
Agreement, require or cause the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, to violate the terms of the Hyatt Place
Texas Portfolio Whole Loan, or materially expand the scope of any of the master servicer’s or the special servicer’s,
as applicable, responsibilities under the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement or the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
In addition to the consultation rights of

of discussing servicing issues related to the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Whole Loan.

(the “Brunswick Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement”) that sets forth the respective rights of each Brunswick
Portfolio Noteholder. The Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan will be serviced and administered pursuant to the terms of the JPMBB 2015-C30
Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The Brunswick Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement provides that expenses, losses and shortfalls
relating to the Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan will be allocated on a pro rata basis to the Brunswick Portfolio Noteholders.
 
The trust formed pursuant to the JPMBB 2015-C30
Pooling and Servicing Agreement (the “JPMBB 2015-C30 Trust”) is the holder of a Brunswick Portfolio Pari Passu
Companion Loan and so long as no control event has occurred under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the JPMBB
2015-C30 directing certificateholder will have the right to direct, consult with and advise the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer
and the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer with respect to the Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan, but will be required to consult with
the Directing Certificateholder of the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan (so long as no Control Event has occurred and is continuing
under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement for this transaction) with respect to such advice, consent or action. In the event that
the parties exercising the rights of the holder or holders of the Brunswick Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loans and the holder
of the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan under the Brunswick Portfolio
 

S-177
 
 
Intercreditor Agreement disagree, the decision of the party
exercising the rights of the holder of the Brunswick Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loan under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing
Agreement will be binding.
 
Servicing. The Brunswick Portfolio
Whole Loan (including the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan) and any related REO Property will be serviced and administered by
the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer and, if necessary, the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer, according to the terms of the JPMBB
2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the servicing standard thereunder, which requires the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer
and the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer to take into account the interests, as a collective whole, of both the Certificateholders
and the holder or holders of the Brunswick Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loans.
 
Amounts payable to the trust as holder of
the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan pursuant to the related Brunswick Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement will be included in the
Available Distribution Amount for the related Distribution Date to the extent described in this free writing prospectus, and amounts
payable to the holder or holders of the Brunswick Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loans will be distributed to such holder net of
certain fees and expenses on the Brunswick Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loans as set forth in the Brunswick Portfolio Intercreditor
Agreement and will not be available for distributions on the Offered Certificates.
 
Application of Payments. The Brunswick
Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement sets forth the respective rights of the holder of the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan and the
holder or holders of the Brunswick Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loans with respect to distributions of funds received in respect
of the Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan, and provides, in general, that:
 

·the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan and the Brunswick Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loans are of equal priority with each
other and no portion of either of them will have priority or preference over any portion of the other or security therefor;
 

·all payments, proceeds and other recoveries on or in respect of the Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan or the related Mortgaged
Property will be applied to the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan and the Brunswick Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loans on a pro
rata and pari passu basis according to their respective outstanding principal balances (subject, in each case, to the
payment of amounts for required reserves or escrows required by the related mortgage loan documents and payment and reimbursement
rights of the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer, the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer, the related senior trust advisor, the related
certificate administrator, the related depositor and the related trustee) in accordance with the terms of the Brunswick Portfolio
Intercreditor Agreement and the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement; and
 

·costs, fees, expenses, losses and shortfalls relating to the Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan will be allocated, on a pro
rata and pari passu basis, to the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan and the Brunswick Portfolio Pari Passu Companion
Loans in accordance with the terms of the Brunswick Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement and the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing
Agreement.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a P&I
Advance is made with respect to the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
then that P&I Advance, together with interest on that P&I Advance, may only be reimbursed out of future payments and collections
on the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan or, as and to the extent described under “Description of the Certificates—Advances”
in this free writing prospectus, on other mortgage loans in this securitization, but not out of payments or other collections on
the Brunswick Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loans or any loans included in any securitization trust related to the Brunswick Portfolio
Pari Passu Companion Loans.
 
Certain costs and expenses (such as a pro
rata share of any servicing advance with respect to the Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan made pursuant to the JPMBB 2015-C30
Pooling and Servicing Agreement) allocable to the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan in accordance with the JPMBB 2015-C30
 

S-178
 
 
Pooling
and Servicing Agreement and the Brunswick Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement may be paid or reimbursed out of payments and other
collections on the mortgage pool. This may result in temporary (or, if not ultimately reimbursed, permanent) shortfalls to holders
of the certificates.
 
Consultation and Control. The controlling
noteholder under the Brunswick Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement will be the JPMBB 2015-C30 Trust as holder of a Brunswick Portfolio
Pari Passu Companion Loan under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement; provided that, prior to the occurrence
and continuance of a control event under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the controlling class certificateholder
(or the directing certificateholder on its behalf) under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement (the “JPMBB
2015-C30 Directing Certificateholder”) will be entitled to exercise the rights of the controlling noteholder with respect
to the Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan. The JPMBB 2015-C30 Directing Certificateholder will be entitled to exercise rights substantially
similar to the rights of the trust, in its capacity as the controlling noteholder under the Brunswick Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement,
as described in this free writing prospectus under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—The Directing Certificateholder”
with respect to the Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan, and the implementation of any recommended actions outlined in an asset
status report with respect to the Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan will require the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer to consult with
the JPMBB 2015-C30 Directing Certificateholder in a manner substantially similar to that described herein under “Servicing
of the Mortgage Loans—General”. Pursuant to the terms of the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
the JPMBB 2015-C30 Directing Certificateholder and the related senior trust advisor will each have the same consent and/or consultation
rights with respect to the Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan as each does, and for so long as each does, with respect to the other
mortgage loans included in that trust.
 
In addition, pursuant to the terms of the
Brunswick Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement, the holder of the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan (or its representative, which
will be the Controlling Class Certificateholder or any other party assigned the rights to exercise the rights of the holder
of the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan, as and to the extent provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) will (i) have
the right to receive copies of all notices, information and reports that the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer or the JPMBB 2015-C30
Special Servicer, as applicable, is required to provide to the JPMBB 2015-C30 Directing Certificateholder (within the same time
frame, such notices, information and reports are or would have been required to be provided to the JPMBB 2015-C30 Directing Certificateholder
under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement without regard to the occurrence of any control event or consultation
termination event under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement) with respect to any major decisions to be taken with
respect to the Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan or the implementation of any recommended action outlined in an asset status report
relating to the Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan and (ii) have the right to be consulted on a strictly non-binding basis to
the extent the holder of the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan (or its representative) requests consultation with respect to certain
major decisions to be taken with respect to the Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan or the implementation of any recommended action
outlined in an asset status report relating to the Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan. The consultation right of the holder of the
Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan (or its representative) will expire 10 business days following the delivery of written notice
and information relating to the matter subject to consultation whether or not the holder of the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan
(or its representative) has responded within such period; provided that if the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer or the JPMBB
2015-C30 Special Servicer, as applicable, proposes a new course of action that is materially different from the actions previously
proposed, the 10 business day consultation period will be deemed to begin anew from the date of delivery of such new proposal and
delivery of all information related to such new proposal. Notwithstanding the consultation rights of the holder of the Brunswick
Portfolio Mortgage Loan (or its representative) described above, the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer or the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special
Servicer, as applicable, is permitted to make any material decision or take any action set forth in the asset status report before
the expiration of the aforementioned 10 business day period if it determines that immediate action with respect to such decision
is necessary to protect the interests of the holders of the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan and the Brunswick Portfolio Pari
Passu Companion Loans. Neither the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer nor the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer will be obligated at
any time to follow or take any alternative actions recommended by the holder of the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan (or its representative,
 

S-179
 
 
including, the directing certificateholder (or similar entity)). The senior trust advisor will generally have no obligations or
consultation rights under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement with respect to the Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan or any related
REO Property. However, Pentalpha Surveillance LLC is also the senior trust advisor under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing
Agreement and, in such capacity, will have certain obligations and consultation rights with respect to the Brunswick Portfolio
Whole Loan that are substantially similar to those of the senior trust advisor under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
Neither the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer
nor the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer may follow or be required to follow any advice or consultation provided by the holder of
the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan (or its representative) that would require or cause the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer or
the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer, as applicable, to violate any applicable law, including the REMIC Provisions, be inconsistent
with the servicing standard under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, require or cause the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master
Servicer or the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer, as applicable, to violate provisions of the Brunswick Portfolio Intercreditor
Agreement or the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, require or cause the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer or the JPMBB
2015-C30 Special Servicer, as applicable, to violate the terms of the Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan, or materially expand the
scope of any of the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer’s or the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer’s, as applicable, responsibilities
under the Brunswick Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement or the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
In addition to the consultation rights of
the holder of the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan (or its representative) described above, pursuant to the terms of the Brunswick
Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement, the holder of the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan (or its representative) will have the right
to attend (in-person or telephonically in the discretion of the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer or the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer,
as applicable) annual meetings with the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer or the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer, as applicable, upon
reasonable notice and at times reasonably acceptable to the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer or the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer,
as applicable, for the purpose of discussing servicing issues related to the Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan.
 
Sale of Defaulted Brunswick Portfolio
Whole Loan. Pursuant to the terms of the Brunswick Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement, if the Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan
becomes a defaulted whole loan, and if the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer determines to sell the Brunswick Portfolio Pari Passu
Companion Loan included in the JPMBB 2015-C30 Trust in accordance with the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, then
the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer will be required to sell the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan together with the Brunswick
Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loans as one whole loan. In connection with any such sale, the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer will
be required to follow the procedures contained in the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, which are substantially similar
to those set forth under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans” in
this free writing prospectus.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the JPMBB
2015-C30 Special Servicer will not be permitted to sell the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan and the Brunswick Portfolio Pari
Passu Companion Loans if such Whole Loan becomes a defaulted whole loan without the written consent of the holder of the Brunswick
Portfolio Mortgage Loan (provided that such consent is not required if the holder of the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan is the
borrower or an affiliate of the borrower) unless the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer has delivered to the holder of the Brunswick
Portfolio Mortgage Loan: (a) at least 15 business days prior written notice of any decision to attempt to sell the Brunswick
Portfolio Whole Loan; (b) at least 10 days prior to the proposed sale date, a copy of each bid package (together with any
material amendments to such bid packages) received by the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer in connection with any such proposed
sale; (c) at least 10 days prior to the proposed sale date, a copy of the most recent appraisal for the Brunswick Portfolio
Whole Loan, and any documents in the servicing file reasonably requested by the holder of the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan
that are material to the price of the Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan; and (d) until the sale is completed, and a reasonable
period of time (but no less time than is afforded to other offerors and the JPMBB 2015-C30 Directing
 

S-180
 
 
Certificateholder) prior to
the proposed sale date, all information and other documents being provided to other offerors and all leases or other documents
that are approved by the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer or the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer in connection with the proposed
sale; provided that the holder of the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan may waive any of the delivery or timing requirements
described in this sentence. Subject to the terms of the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the holder of the Brunswick
Portfolio Mortgage Loan (or its representative) will be permitted to bid at any sale of the Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan (unless
such person is the borrower or an agent or affiliate of the borrower).

Loans—Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Special Servicer Appointment Rights.
Pursuant and subject to the terms of the Brunswick Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement and the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, the controlling noteholder (or its representative) with respect to the Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan (which will be
the 2015-C30 Trust) will have the right with or without cause to replace the special servicer then acting with respect to the Brunswick
Portfolio Whole Loan and appoint a replacement special servicer without the consent of the holder of the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage
Loan. The JPMBB 2015-C30 Directing Certificateholder (prior to a control event under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement),
and the applicable certificateholders under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement with the requisite percentage of
voting rights (after a control event under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement) will exercise the rights of the
JPMBB 2015-C30 Trust as controlling noteholder, and will have the right to replace the special servicer then acting with respect
to the Brunswick Portfolio Whole Loan and appoint a replacement special servicer, in a manner substantially similar to that described
under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Rights Upon Servicer Termination Event” in this free writing prospectus.
 
The New Center One Building
Whole Loan
 
General. The New Center One Building
Mortgage Loan, representing approximately 1.7% of the Initial Pool Balance, is part of a split loan structure comprised of two
(2) mortgage notes, each of which is secured by the same mortgage instrument on the same underlying Mortgaged Property.
 
The New Center One Building Mortgage Loan
is evidenced by a promissory note with a Cut-off Date Balance of $18,976,139. The related New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion
Loan is evidenced by a promissory note with an outstanding principal balance as of the Cut-off Date of $18,976,139 that is not
included in the trust. Only the New Center One Building Mortgage Loan is included in the trust. The New Center One Building Mortgage
Loan and the New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan are pari passu with each other in terms of priority and are collectively
referred to in this free writing prospectus as the New Center One Building Whole Loan. It is anticipated that the New Center One
Building Pari Passu Companion Loan will be included in a future securitization; however, we cannot assure you that this will ultimately
occur.
 
The holders (the “New Center One
Building Noteholders”) of each promissory note comprising the New Center One Building Loan have entered into a co-lender
agreement (the “New Center One Building Intercreditor Agreement”) that sets forth the respective rights of each
New Center One Building Noteholder. The New Center One Building Whole Loan will be serviced and administered pursuant to the terms
of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement by the master servicer and the special servicer, as the case may be, according to the Servicing
Standard. The New Center One Building Intercreditor Agreement provides that expenses, losses and shortfalls relating to the New
Center One Building Whole Loan will be allocated on a pro rata basis to the New Center One Building Noteholders.
 
Servicing. The New Center One Building
Whole Loan (including the New Center One Building Mortgage Loan) and any related REO Property will be serviced and administered
by the master servicer and, if necessary, the special servicer, pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, in the manner
described under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans” in this free writing prospectus, but subject to the terms
of the related New Center One Building Intercreditor Agreement. In servicing the New Center One
 

S-181
 
 
Building Whole Loan, the Servicing
Standard set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement will require the master servicer and the special servicer to take into
account the interests, as a collective whole, of both the Certificateholders and the holder of the New Center One Building Pari
Passu Companion Loan.
 
Amounts payable to the trust as holder of
the New Center One Building Mortgage Loan pursuant to the related New Center One Building Intercreditor Agreement will be included
in the Available Distribution Amount for the related Distribution Date to the extent described in this free writing prospectus,
and amounts payable to the holder of the New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan will be distributed to such holder net
of certain fees and expenses on the New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan as set forth in the New Center One Building
Intercreditor Agreement and will not be available for distributions on the Offered Certificates.
 
Application of Payments. The New
Center One Building Intercreditor Agreement sets forth the respective rights of the holder of the New Center One Building Mortgage
Loan and the holder of the New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan with respect to distributions of funds received in
respect of the New Center One Building Whole Loan, and provides, in general, that:
 

·the New Center One Building Mortgage Loan and the New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan are of equal priority with
each other and no portion of either of them will have priority or preference over any portion of the other or security therefor;
 

·all payments, proceeds and other recoveries on or in respect of the New Center One Building Whole Loan or the related Mortgaged
Property will be applied to the New Center One Building Mortgage Loan and the New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan
on a pro rata and pari passu basis according to their respective outstanding principal balances (subject, in each case, to the
payment of amounts for required reserves or escrows required by the related mortgage loan documents and payment and reimbursement
rights of the master servicer, the special servicer, the senior trust advisor, the certificate administrator, the depositor and
the trustee) in accordance with the terms of the New Center One Building Intercreditor Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement; and
 

·costs, fees, expenses, losses and shortfalls relating to the New Center One Building Whole Loan will be allocated, on a pro
rata and pari passu basis, to the New Center One Building Mortgage Loan and the New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan
in accordance with the terms of the New Center One Building Intercreditor Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a P&I
Advance is made with respect to the New Center One Building Mortgage Loan pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
then that P&I Advance, together with interest on that P&I Advance, may only be reimbursed out of future payments and collections
on the New Center One Building Mortgage Loan or, as and to the extent described under “Description of the Certificates—Advances”
in this free writing prospectus, on other mortgage loans in this securitization, but not out of payments or other collections on
the New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan or any loans included in any future securitization trust related to the New
Center One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan.
 
Because of the timing of collections on
the New Center One Building Whole Loan, certain costs and expenses (such as related Servicing Advances and interest thereon) allocable
to the New Center One Building Whole Loan may be paid or reimbursed out of payments and other collections on the mortgage pool,
subject to the trust’s right to reimbursement from future payments and other collections on the New Center One Building Pari
Passu Companion Loan or from general collections with respect to the securitization of the New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion
Loan for its pro rata share of such costs and expenses. This may result in temporary (or, if not ultimately reimbursed, permanent)
shortfalls to holders of the certificates.
 
Consultation and Control. The controlling
noteholder under the New Center One Building Intercreditor Agreement will be the trust as holder of the New Center One Building
Mortgage Loan; provided that, prior
 

S-182
 
 
to the occurrence and continuance of a Control Event, the Directing Certificateholder will
be entitled to exercise the rights of the controlling noteholder with respect to the New Center One Building Whole Loan. The Directing
Certificateholder will be entitled to exercise all of the rights of the trust in its capacity as the controlling noteholder under
the New Center One Building Intercreditor Agreement, as and to the extent described in this free writing prospectus under “Servicing
of the Mortgage Loans—The Directing Certificateholder” with respect to the New Center One Building Whole Loan,
and the implementation of any recommended actions outlined in an asset status report with respect to the New Center One Building
Whole Loan will require the special servicer to consult with and/or obtain the approval of the Directing Certificateholder as and
to the extent described in this free writing prospectus under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—General”
in this free writing prospectus. Pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Directing Certificateholder
and the senior trust advisor will each have the same consent and/or consultation rights with respect to the New Center One Building
Whole Loan as each does, and for so long as each does, with respect to the other mortgage loans included in the trust.
 
In addition, pursuant to the terms of the
New Center One Building Intercreditor Agreement, the holder of the New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative
which, at any time the New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan is included in a securitization, may be the directing
certificateholder or controlling class representative for that securitization or any other party assigned the rights to exercise
the rights of the holder of the New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan, as and to the extent provided in the related
pooling and servicing agreement) will (i) have the right to receive copies of all notices, information and reports that the master
servicer or special servicer, as applicable, is required to provide to the Directing Certificateholder (within the same time frame
such notices, information and reports are or would have been required to be provided to the Directing Certificateholder under the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement without regard to the occurrence of a Control Event or Consultation Termination Event) with respect
to any major decisions to be taken with respect to the New Center One Building Whole Loan or the implementation of any recommended
action outlined in an asset status report relating to the New Center One Building Whole Loan and (ii) have the right to be consulted
on a strictly non-binding basis to the extent the holder of the New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative)
requests consultation with respect to certain major decisions to be taken with respect to the New Center One Building Whole Loan
or the implementation of any recommended action outlined in an asset status report relating to the New Center One Building Whole
Loan. The consultation right of the holder of the New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative) will
expire 10 business days following the delivery of written notice and information relating to the matter subject to consultation
whether or not the holder of the New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative) has responded within
such period; provided that if the master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, proposes a new course of action that is materially
different from the actions previously proposed, the 10 business day consultation period will be deemed to begin anew from the date
of delivery of such new proposal and delivery of all information related to such new proposal. Notwithstanding the consultation
rights of the holder of the New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative) described above, the master
servicer or special servicer, as applicable, is permitted to make any material decision or take any action set forth in the asset
status report before the expiration of the aforementioned 10 business day period if it determines that immediate action with respect
to such decision is necessary to protect the interests of the holders of the New Center One Building Mortgage Loan and New Center
One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan. Neither the master servicer nor the special servicer will be obligated at any time to follow
or take any alternative actions recommended by the holder of the New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative,
including, if the New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan has been contributed to a securitization, the related directing
certificateholder or controlling class representative (or similar entity)).
 
Neither the master servicer nor the special
servicer may follow or be required to follow any direction, advice or consultation provided by the Directing Certificateholder
or the holder of the New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative) that would require or cause the
master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, to violate any applicable law, including the REMIC Provisions, be inconsistent
with the Servicing Standard, require or cause the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, to violate provisions
of the New Center One Building Intercreditor
 

S-183
 
 
Agreement, require or cause the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable,
to violate the terms of the New Center One Building Whole Loan, or materially expand the scope of any of the master servicer’s
or the special servicer’s, as applicable, responsibilities under the New Center One Building Intercreditor Agreement or the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
In addition to the consultation rights of
the holder of the New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative) described above, pursuant to the terms
of the New Center One Building Intercreditor Agreement, the holder of the New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan (or
its representative) will have the right to attend (in-person or telephonically in the discretion of the master servicer or special
servicer, as applicable) annual meetings with the master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, upon reasonable notice and
at times reasonably acceptable to the master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, for the purpose of discussing servicing
issues related to the New Center One Building Whole Loan.
 
Sale of Defaulted Serviced Pari Passu
Whole Loan. Pursuant to the terms of the New Center One Building Intercreditor Agreement, if the New Center One Building Mortgage
Loan becomes a Defaulted Mortgage Loan, and if the special servicer determines to sell the New Center One Building Mortgage Loan
upon its becoming a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, then the special servicer
will be required to sell the related New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan together with the New Center One Building
Mortgage Loan as one whole loan. In connection with any such sale, the special servicer will be required to follow the procedures
set forth under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans” in this free
writing prospectus.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the special
servicer will not be permitted to sell the New Center One Building Mortgage Loan and New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion
Loan if such Whole Loan becomes a defaulted whole loan without the written consent of the holder of the New Center One Building
Pari Passu Companion Loan (provided that such consent is not required if the holder of the New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion
Loan is the borrower or an affiliate of the borrower) unless the special servicer has delivered to the holder of the New Center
One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan: (a) at least 15 business days prior written notice of any decision to attempt to sell the
related Whole Loan; (b) at least 10 days prior to the proposed sale date, a copy of each bid package (together with any material

in the servicing file reasonably requested by the holder of the New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan that are material
to the price of the New Center One Building Whole Loan; and (d) until the sale is completed, and a reasonable period of time (but
no less time than is afforded to other offerors and the Directing Certificateholder) prior to the proposed sale date, all information
and other documents being provided to other offerors and all leases or other documents that are approved by the master servicer
or the special servicer in connection with the proposed sale; provided that the holder of the New Center One Building Pari Passu
Companion Loan may waive as to itself any of the delivery or timing requirements described in this sentence. Subject to the terms
of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the holder of the New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative)
will be permitted to submit an offer at any sale of the related Whole Loan.

Loans—Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Special Servicer Appointment Rights.
Subject to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the controlling noteholder (or its representative) with respect to
the New Center One Building Whole Loan (which will be the trust) will have the right to replace the special servicer then acting
with respect to the New Center One Building Whole Loan (a) for cause at any time and (b) without cause if either (i) LNR Partners,
LLC (or its affiliate) is no longer the special servicer or (ii) LNR Securities Holdings, LLC (or its affiliate) owns less than
25% of the Controlling Class, and appoint a replacement special servicer without the consent of the holder of the New Center One

percentage of Voting Rights (after a Control Event) will exercise the rights of the trust as controlling noteholder,
and will have the right, with or without cause (subject to the limitations described herein and in the pooling and servicing agreement),
to replace the special servicer then acting with respect to the New Center One Building Whole Loan and appoint a replacement special
servicer, as described under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Rights Upon Servicer Termination Event”
in this free writing prospectus.
 
Net Cash Flow and Certain Underwriting
Considerations
 
Underwritten net cash flow generally includes
cash flow (including any cash flow from master leases) adjusted based on a number of assumptions used by the mortgage loan sellers.
Each investor should review the assumptions described in “—Additional Mortgage Loan Information” below
and make its own determination of the appropriateness of the assumptions used in determining underwritten net cash flow. In addition,
with respect to the mortgage loans in the trust, we note the following:
 

·In the case of one hundred and five (105) Mortgaged Properties identified as “U-Haul Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to
this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan representing approximately 4.3% of the Initial Pool Balance, approximately
3.3% of the underwritten revenue of the Mortgaged Properties is non-storage revenue associated with four (4) agreements by and
among the related borrowers and certain affiliates of U-Haul International, Inc., which is also affiliated with the sponsor and
guarantor of the mortgage loan. The applicable affiliates of U-Haul International, Inc. have entered into an assignment and subordination
agreement that provides that, during the continuance of an event of default, the affiliates will continue to perform their obligations
under the agreements at the request of the lender or, at the option of the lender, the agreements will terminate. In addition,
upon a foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, unless the lender elects to terminate the agreements with at least 30 days’
written notice, the dealer agreements will remain in place for one year following the foreclosure or transfer in lieu of foreclosure.
We cannot assure you that net operating income or the Mortgaged Properties will not be negatively impacted if the lender elects
to foreclose on its interests in the Mortgaged Properties and terminates the dealer agreements, or that such revenue streams will
continue to be a significant portion of total revenues generated by the Mortgaged Properties.
 

·In the case of five (5) Mortgaged Properties identified as “Hilton Suites Chicago Magnificent Mile”, “Palmer
House Retail Shops”, “One Shell Square”, “New Center One Building” and “Sak’s Garage”
on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing five (5) mortgage loans representing approximately 17.2% of the Initial
Pool Balance, the related Mortgaged Properties include parking garages that is expected to generate parking income that accounts
for approximately 7.6%, 24.4%, 9.5%, 17.9% and 100.0%, respectively, of the net underwritten rental income at the related Mortgaged
Properties.
 

·In the case of sixty-five (65) Mortgaged Properties identified as “The Park at Veneto”, “Brunswick Portfolio”,
“Behringer Tractor Supply Portfolio”, “Residence Inn - Clifton Park”, “The Park at Murano”,
“Colony Village” and “Brynn Marr Village” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing six
(6) mortgage loans representing approximately 7.9% of the Initial Pool Balance, the related mortgage loans are secured in whole
or in part by recently acquired and/or newly renovated or constructed Mortgaged Properties that either have no or limited prior
operating histories or do not have historical financial information. See “Risk Factors—Commercial Lending
is Dependent Upon Net Operating Income” in this free writing prospectus.
 

·In the case of four (4) Mortgaged Properties identified as “780 Dedham Street”, “One Park Centre”,
“Colony Village” and “International Design Center” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing
four (4) mortgage loans representing approximately 2.2% of the Initial Pool Balance, the occupancy reflected in this free writing
prospectus includes certain tenants that are among the five (5) largest tenants at the related Mortgaged Property or which, in
the aggregate, constitute a significant portion of the related Mortgaged Property, that have signed leases but are not in occupancy
of their full spaces and/or are not paying full contractual rent and/or are entitled to periodic rent abatements (which in some
cases were not reserved for). The Underwritten Net 
 

S-185
 
 

Cash Flow and Underwritten Net Cash Flow Debt Service Coverage Ratio reflected
in this free writing prospectus includes rent from those tenants (without deduction for abated rent) even though the related tenants
may not be paying full contractual rent or are paying reduced or no rent or will receive periodic rent abatements. See Annex A-1
and Annex A-3 (including the related footnotes) in this free writing prospectus.
 

·In the case of one (1) Mortgaged Property identified as “Robinson Plaza” on Annex A-1 to this free writing
prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loans representing approximately 1.6% of the Initial Pool Balance, the second largest tenant,
Thermal Solutions, has executed a lease but has not yet completed its build-out, taken full occupancy of its leased space or begun
paying rent. At origination of the mortgage loan, the borrower reserved approximately $746,246 related to the base rent due under
such tenant’s lease.

to Underwritten Net Cash Flow”, Annex A-1 and Annex A-3 (including the related footnotes) in this free writing
prospectus.
 
Mortgaged Property Considerations
 
Environmental Considerations
 
In connection with the origination of the
mortgage loans, the related mortgage loan seller or other originator either (i) obtained or updated an environmental site
assessment for the related Mortgaged Property from a qualified environmental firm or (ii) obtained an environmental insurance
policy for the related Mortgaged Property. See “Transaction Parties—The Sponsors and Mortgage Loan Sellers—JPMorgan
Chase Bank, National Association—JPMCB’s Underwriting Guidelines and Processes—Environmental Site Assessment”,
“—Barclays Bank PLC—Barclays’ Underwriting Guidelines and Processes”, “—Starwood
Mortgage Funding II LLC—SMF II’s Underwriting Guidelines and Processes—Assessments of Property Condition—Environmental
Assessment”, “—MC-Five Mile Commercial Mortgage Finance LLC—MC-Five Mile’s Underwriting Guidelines
and Processes—Assessments of Property Condition—Environmental Assessment”, “—Redwood Commercial
Mortgage Corporation—RCMC’s Underwriting Standards and Loan Analysis—Environmental Report” and “—RAIT
Funding, LLC—RAIT’s Underwriting Guidelines and Processes”, “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Realization
Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans” and “Certain Legal Aspects of the Mortgage Loans” in this free
writing prospectus.
 
See “Risk Factors—Environmental
Risks Relating to the Mortgaged Properties” in this free writing prospectus and “Certain Legal Aspects of the
Mortgage Loans—Environmental Risks” in the prospectus. In addition, with respect to the mortgage loans in the trust,
we note the following:
 
With respect
to one (1) mortgage loan identified as “U-Haul Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing
approximately 4.3% of the Initial Pool Balance, the related environmental site assessments (“ESAs”) for certain
of the Mortgaged Properties reported potential or known residual impacts related to hydraulic lifts and current and former USTs
that in some cases were removed and investigated and/or remediated pursuant to state requirements, and other leaks or spills.  For
example, with respect to one such Mortgaged Property, identified as “U-Haul Portfolio – Grand Concourse” on Annex
A-1 to this free writing prospectus, partially securing the mortgage loan and representing approximately 0.2% of the Initial Pool
Balance by allocated loan amount, the related ESA reported that six USTs previously were used onsite and remediation was followed
by a regulatory no further action determination in 2002. However, the ESA noted that four remaining vent pipes might be related
to the former USTs. Given the unknown status and integrity of the UST systems, the ESA considered the USTs a recognized environmental
condition to be further investigated. Additionally, a waste oil spill was classified as no further action after groundwater monitoring
demonstrated declining contaminant levels in 2001-2002
and a gasoline release in 2000 received regulatory closure in 2003. The
borrowers maintain a blanket environmental insurance policy that covers each of the Mortgaged Properties and also obtained an additional
environmental insurance policy with an individual limit of $1,000,000 and an aggregate limit of $25,000,000 with a deductible of
$100,000. We cannot assure you that no future circumstances will
 

S-186
 
 
warrant any further action in regard to any of these matters or
that the environmental insurance policies will be sufficient to cover any required environmental remediation.
 
With respect to one (1) Mortgaged Property
identified as “Frandor Shopping Center” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan
representing approximately 3.5% of the Initial Pool Balance, an environmental consultant identified a recognized environmental
condition relating to the former operation of two dry cleaning facilities at the Mortgaged Property. The lender has received an
environmental impairment liability insurance policy from Beazley Insurance Company, Inc. for a term of 10 years and 30 days. The
policy has limits per incident and an aggregate limit of $2,000,000 with a deductible of $50,000. We can provide no assurance that
such environmental insurance policy will be sufficient to cover any required environmental remediation.
 
With respect to one (1) Mortgaged Property
identified as “Big Curve Shopping Center” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan
representing approximately 1.0% of the Initial Pool Balance, an environmental reserve in the amount of $300,000 was required for
remediation of elevated concentration of chlorinated solvents in soil gas as a result of the operation of an onsite dry cleaner.
Funds will be available to cover the cost of installation and operation of a soil vapor extraction system until the borrower obtains
a no further action letter from the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality and an engineer’s report stating successful
completion of Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) utilizing US EPA guidelines. If the borrower is able to obtain a no further action
letter and an engineer’s report without installation of the soil vapor extraction system, the remaining funds in the environmental
reserve will be released to the borrower according to the terms of the mortgage loan documents.
 
With respect to one (1) Mortgaged Property
identified as “Freeway Crossing” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan representing
approximately 0.6% of the Initial Pool Balance, a Phase II subsurface investigation was performed due to potential impacts associated
with the on-site dry cleaners. The Phase II investigation revealed elevated levels of tetrachloroethene (PCE) in various soil and
groundwater samples taken in the vicinity and that the presence of chlorinated VOCs in soil and groundwater represents a recognized
environmental condition and may present a risk for vapor intrusion. The environmental report recommended that (i) the soil and
groundwater data collected from the Phase II investigation be reported to the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural
Resources (“NCDENR”) and (ii) the borrower petition the site into the state’s Drycleaning Solvent Cleanup Act
(“DSCA”) program. The borrower submitted its application to the NCDENR on April 9, 2015. Under the DSCA program,
the state is responsible for directing all further investigation and remediation activities and is responsible for all costs with
the exception of a “co-pay”. The borrower is responsible for paying a $1,000 application fee plus 1% of assessment/remediation
costs (up to a cap of $1,000,000). If the above-noted potential vapor intrusion concern materializes, it is expected to be addressed
and remediated under the DSCA program. The mortgage loan contains a $15,000 environmental reserve (which is 150% of 1% of $1,000,000),
which represents the borrower’s maximum exposure to remediation costs. We cannot assure you that if accepted into the DSCA program,
funds will in fact be available to complete any necessary remediation.
 
With respect to one (1) Mortgaged Property
identified as “Heritage Shopping Center” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan
representing approximately 0.4% of the Initial Pool Balance, an environmental consultant identified a recognized environmental
condition relating to a dry cleaning facility that is currently operated at the Mortgaged Property. The environmental consultant
indicated that secondary containment was observed beneath the dry cleaning machine, however no secondary containment pallet was
observed beneath the 55-gallon waste drum. The environmental consultant indicated that evidence of spills or releases of solvent
or waste materials was observed in the vicinity of the waste drum in the form of staining on the floor. Additionally, deteriorated
asphalt paving was observed. The environmental consultant recommended that a limited subsurface investigation be conducted at an
estimated cost of $8,000 to $10,000. The lender has received a $5,000,000 Lender’s Environmental policy from Zurich American
Insurance Company with a $50,000 self-insured retention. We can provide no assurance that such environmental insurance policy will
be sufficient to cover any required environmental remediation.

Property Redevelopment
and Renovation Issues
 
Certain of the Mortgaged Properties are
properties that are currently undergoing or are expected to undergo in the future redevelopment or renovation.
 
Two (2) Mortgaged Properties identified
as “Hilton Suites Chicago Magnificent Mile” and “Hilton Atlanta Perimeter” on Annex A-1 to this free writing
prospectus, securing two (2) mortgage loans representing approximately 9.4% of the Initial Pool Balance, are subject to property
improvement plans (each, a “PIP”) required by the related franchise agreements. In each case, the PIP includes
comprehensive renovations to the entire hotels, including improvements to the guest rooms. The PIP for the Mortgaged Property identified
as “Hilton Suites Chicago Magnificent Mile” is expected to cost approximately $10.2 million and the PIP for the Mortgaged
Property identified as “Hilton Atlanta Perimeter” is expected to cost approximately $7.8 million. In each case, the
related borrower was required to reserve the full remaining estimated cost of the related PIP into a renovation reserve. We cannot
assure you that the borrowers will complete the PIPs in accordance with the requirements of the franchise agreements, that the
work required to complete the renovations will not have a material adverse effect on the performance of the related Mortgaged Property
or that the failure to complete the PIPs will not have a material adverse effect on the franchise agreements or the Mortgaged Properties.
 
With respect to one hundred and five (105)
Mortgaged Properties identified as “U-Haul Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1)
mortgage loan representing approximately 4.3% of the Initial Pool Balance, the borrowers may construct additional buildings or
structures at the Mortgaged Properties for the purpose of adding storage units or other ancillary improvements without the consent
of the lender, provided that such alterations will not have a material adverse effect on the borrowers’ financial condition,
the value of the Mortgaged Property or the net operating income of such Mortgaged Property. The loan documents require that any
such alterations or construction be performed in accordance with applicable legal requirements and without the incurrence of any
additional debt. The borrowers also have the right under the loan documents to acquire certain parcels of real estate adjacent
and contiguous to the Mortgaged Properties (or ground lease non-contiguous parcels which are owned by affiliates of the guarantors)
for purposes of expansion on the terms and conditions in the mortgage loan documents, which include, without limitation, delivery
of a title insurance policy covering the new property, a current survey, an environmental assessment showing no hazardous substances
or risk of contamination and certificates of insurance reflecting the insurance coverage required by the mortgage loan documents.
There are loss carve-outs related to the acquisition of any of the adjacent parcels, the ground lease of non-contiguous parcels
or for the failure to complete any alterations or construction as provided in the loan documents.
 
With respect to one (1) Mortgaged Property
identified as “One Shell Square” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan representing
approximately 3.1% of the Initial Pool Balance, the property condition report identified certain significant deferred maintenance
for which a reserve in the amount of $11,357,584 has been established with the lender. These deferred maintenance items include
repairs to the parking areas, HVAC and other systems. We cannot assure you that the borrower will complete these required renovations
or that the failure to complete will not have a material adverse effect on the Mortgaged Property or its operations.
 
With respect to three (3) Mortgaged Properties
identified as “Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage
loan representing approximately 2.2% of the Initial Pool Balance, each property is subject to a PIP required by the related franchise
agreement. The PIP includes renovating common areas, guest rooms and meeting spaces, pool and fitness center upgrades, resealing
and restriping parking lots, exterior painting and installing new windows. The borrower sponsor anticipates completing the interior
renovations by March 2016 and exterior renovations by December 2016. At origination of the mortgage loan, the borrower deposited
approximately $6,461,588 into a reserve, which amount represents approximately 100% of the estimated cost of the
 

S-188
 
 
PIP. We cannot
assure you that the borrower will complete the PIP in accordance with the requirements of the franchise agreement, that the work
required to complete the renovations will not have a material adverse effect on the performance of the related Mortgaged Property
or that the failure to complete the PIPs will not have a material adverse effect on the franchise agreement or the Mortgaged Properties.
 
With respect to one (1) Mortgaged Property
identified as “Langhorne Shopping Center” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan
representing approximately 1.3% of the Initial Pool Balance, the borrower is permitted to construct one or more buildings on the
expansion areas specified in the loan documents, provided that, among other conditions: (i) the borrower submits to the lender
the plans and specifications for approval; (ii) the borrower delivers to the lender a detailed budget of all hard and soft costs
for the construction of each building and the schedule of work to complete approved in writing by the architect or engineer; (iii)
the borrower provides the lender with the source of the equity funding for the construction and evidence reasonably satisfactory
to the lender that the borrower has sufficient funds to cover the costs of construction or deposits the amount reasonably required
by the lender to cover the costs of construction; and (iv) the borrower has executed one or more leases covering 100% of the rentable
square feet in the new building on the terms in the loan agreement. The borrower deposited $993,750 into the tenant improvements
and leasing commissions reserve at origination to cover the cost of such expansion. We cannot assure that the borrower will have
sufficient funds to complete the expansion or that the failure to complete the expansion at the Mortgaged Property will not have
a material adverse effect on the Mortgaged Property.
 
With respect to two (2) Mortgaged Properties
identified as “Colony Village” and “Brynn Marr Village” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing
two (2) mortgage loans representing approximately 1.1% of the Initial Pool Balance, the related sponsor intends to implement a
capital improvement plan at each Mortgaged Property. Each capital improvement plan includes renovations to the fixtures, hardware,
cabinets and countertops for the units. The renovations are expected to cost approximately $445,000 for Colony Village and approximately
$510,000 for Brynn Marr Village. At origination of the mortgage loans, the borrower for the Mortgaged Property identified as “Colony
Village” was required to escrow $449,275 into a replacement reserve and the borrower for the Mortgaged Property identified
as “Brynn Marr Village” loan was required to escrow $514,900 into a replacement reserve to pay for the renovations.
We can provide no assurances that the borrower will complete these required renovations or that the failure to complete will not
have a material adverse effect on the Mortgaged Property or its operations.
 
One (1) Mortgaged Property identified as
“Best Western – Leesburg, VA” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan representing
approximately 0.5% of the Initial Pool Balance, is subject to a PIP required by the related franchise agreement. The PIP includes
grounds and landscaping upgrades and repairs, new carpeting and fixtures at a front desk and vestibule area, breakfast area upgrades,
an additional computer in the business center, new carpeting, furniture and fixtures in standard guest rooms and parlor suites,
and minor guest bathroom upgrades. The sponsor reported that the renovations are expected to be completed by 2016. At origination
of the mortgage loan, the borrower deposited $319,819 into a reserve to pay for the PIP. We cannot assure you that the borrower
will complete the PIP in accordance with the requirements of the franchise agreement or that the failure to do so will not have
a material adverse effect on the franchise agreement or the Mortgaged Property.
 
We cannot assure you that any of these redevelopments,
renovations or expansions will be completed, that any amounts reserved in connection therewith will be sufficient to complete any
such redevelopment, renovation or expansion or that the failure to do so will not have a material adverse impact on the related
Mortgaged Properties.

to Redevelopment and Renovation at the Mortgaged Properties” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Litigation Considerations;
Bankruptcy Issues and Other Proceedings
 
There may be pending or threatened legal
proceedings against, or other past or present adverse regulatory circumstances experienced by, the borrowers, their sponsors and
managers of the Mortgaged
 

S-189
 
 
Properties and their respective affiliates arising out of the ordinary business of the borrowers, their
sponsors, managers and affiliates. In addition, certain of the borrower sponsors and/or entities controlled thereby have been a
party to bankruptcy proceedings, mortgage loan defaults and restructures, discounted payoffs, foreclosure proceedings or deed-in-lieu
of foreclosure transactions, or other material proceedings (including criminal proceedings) in the past. In some cases, Mortgaged
Properties securing certain of the mortgage loans previously secured other loans that had been in default, restructured or the
subject of a discounted payoff, foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.
 
Several of the mortgage loans refinanced
a loan which had been modified, in default and/or otherwise involved discounted pay offs in connection with the origination of
such mortgage loans as described below:
 

·With respect to four (4) Mortgaged Properties identified as “Big Curve Shopping Center”, “Freeway Crossing”,
“Condor Garden Apartments” and “Comfort Inn – Woodstock, VA” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus,
securing four (4) mortgage loans representing approximately 2.4% of the Initial Pool Balance, the related mortgage loans refinanced
prior loans that were in maturity default.
 

·With respect to one (1) Mortgaged Property identified as “780 Dedham Street” on Annex A-1 to this free writing
prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan representing approximately 0.6% of the Initial Pool Balance, the Mortgaged Property
was previously financed through a securitized loan with an original principal balance of approximately $12.6 million. The prior
loan was transferred to special servicing in July 2011 after a drop in tenancy at the Mortgaged Property, and the Mortgaged Property
was foreclosed on in February 2012. The current loan sponsor acquired the Mortgaged Property in 2014 for the purchase price of
$6,425,000, which represents an approximately 43.4% discount of the amount due and payable by the related borrower under the prior
loan at the time of the foreclosure.
 
With respect to twenty-nine (29) Mortgaged
Properties identified as “Frandor Shopping Center”, “The Outlet Shoppes at Gettysburg”, “Hyatt Place
Texas Portfolio”, “New Center One Building”, “Oakland Hills”, “Premiere Place”, “Simply
Self Storage Portfolio”, “Emerson Pointe”, “Mustang Crossing Apartments”, “Falcon Gateway”,
“Southwest Plaza”, “Hawthorne Townhomes”, “Freeway Crossing”, “780 Dedham Street”,
“University Studios”, “One Park Centre”, “Best Buy Sanford, FL”, “Condor Garden Apartments”,
“Heritage Shopping Center”, “International Design Center”, “Evergreen Village Apartments”,
“Bedford Square I & II”, “Sak’s Garage”, “Red Roof Inn & Suites - Savannah GA” and
“Frankford Square” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing twenty-five (25) mortgage loans representing
approximately 24.3% of the Initial Pool Balance, within the last 10 years, borrower sponsors or key principals (or affiliates of
borrower sponsors or key principals) have previously sponsored real estate projects (including in some such cases, the particular
Mortgaged Property or Mortgaged Properties in this trust (which Mortgaged Properties, in certain cases, involved prior owners in
connection with financings unrelated to the mortgage loans)) that became or are currently the subject of foreclosure proceedings,
deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, short sale, discounted pay offs, loan restructuring, forbearance agreement, bankruptcy or insolvency
proceedings or similar proceedings. See “Risk Factors—Risks Associated with Commercial Real Estate Lending”,
“—The Borrower’s Form of Entity May Cause Special Risks” and “—Litigation or Other
Legal Proceedings Could Adversely Affect the Mortgage Loans” in this free writing prospectus.
 
In the case of one (1) Mortgaged Property
identified as “Palmer House Retail Shops” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan
representing approximately 5.4% of the Initial Pool Balance, the borrower sponsor reported that it is subject to a complaint for
alleged breach of good faith, tortious interference, conspiracy, breach of contract and prospective economic damages. The plaintiff
entered into a contract with a seller to buy a building, which the seller terminated due to the plaintiff’s failure to pay
the down payment on time. The plaintiff’s case against the seller was dismissed and the plaintiff is now suing the borrower
sponsor of the Mortgaged Property, the ultimate buyer of the building. The borrower sponsor has filed a motion to dismiss. The
borrower sponsor reported that it is also subject to a separate complaint for alleged breach of contract, breach of the implied
covenant of
 

S-190
 
 
good faith, interference and contempt in connection with such plaintiff’s inability to use a trademark that the
borrower sponsor exclusively licensed to manufacture clothing under. The parties are discussing a settlement and if the case does
not settle, the borrower sponsor will file a motion to dismiss.
 
In the case of twenty-one (21) Mortgaged
Properties identified as “Shadow Hills Apartments”, “Summer View Apartments”, “Diamond Pointe Apartments
(6th/Deodar)”, “Rose Pointe Apartments (Euclid/Budd)”, “Cedar Pointe Apartments”, “South View
(Avalon) Apartments”, “Suncrest Apartments”, “Forest View Apartments”, “Royal Palms Apartments”,
“Rose Terrace Apartments (Parthenia)”, “Beverly Terrace Apartments”, “Iron Mountain Apartments”,
“Camellia Apartments”, “Highland Springs Apartments”, “Highland Meadows (43/44) Apartments”,
“Glen Terrace Apartments”, “Twin Palms”, “Highland Meadows (Meridian) Apartments”, “South
View (Carondelet) Apartments”, “South View (Main) Apartments” and “Summer Wind Apartments” on Annex
A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing twenty-one (21) mortgage loans collectively representing approximately 4.6% of the
Initial Pool Balance, the borrower sponsors reported that their primary owner (the “Owner”) is a defendant in
two pending suits brought by two of his brothers alleging that the Owner and his brothers orally formed a general partnership agreement
relating to certain business ventures. Among the claims brought by the Owner’s brothers is a claim filed in 2003 relating
to profits earned by the acquisition of certain apartment buildings. In connection with such claim, the plaintiffs sought $250,000,000
and a jury awarded them $65,000,000. Such decision was remanded back to the district court after the appellate court issued an
order affirming in part and reversing in part. The other brother asserts that he is entitled to a 19% interest in the Owner’s
real estate business and real estate assets.  No trial date has been set in either matter. The borrower sponsors have a combined
net worth of greater than $1,200,000,000 and a combined liquidity of greater than $655,000,000.
 
In the case of one hundred and five (105)
Mortgaged Properties identified as “U-Haul Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1)
mortgage loan representing approximately 4.3% of the Initial Pool Balance, AMERCO, the loan sponsor and non-recourse carve-out
guarantor for the mortgage loan, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2003 after it failed to obtain refinancing for $866
million of debt. The company emerged from bankruptcy approximately 9 months later, and creditors were paid in full on their claims.
The borrowers and the related Mortgaged Properties were not involved in the Chapter 11 proceedings. However, we can provide no
assurances that the guarantor will not choose to avail itself of its rights in bankruptcy in the event the company, or the Mortgaged
Properties, experiences additional economic hardship.
 
In the case of fifty-eight (58) Mortgaged
Properties identified as “Brunswick Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1)
mortgage loan representing approximately 1.7% of the Initial Pool Balance, the borrowers master lease all of the Mortgaged Properties
to two tenants, and the predecessor of the parent company of the tenants has filed for bankruptcy twice during the last 10 years.
The most recent bankruptcy resulted in the reorganization of the company, which then merged with another company, Strike Holdings,
LLC, to form the current company. While the master lease prohibits the tenants from rejecting the master lease in bankruptcy, we
cannot assure you that the parent company will not face solvency issues in the future or that any future bankruptcy filing will
not lead to a termination or rejection of the master lease in bankruptcy.
 
In the case of one (1) Mortgaged Property
identified as “Langhorne Shopping Center” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage
loan representing approximately 1.3% of the Initial Pool Balance, the borrower sponsor and non-recourse carve-out guarantor is
one of the defendants in an outstanding civil litigation in New Jersey, filed on December 24, 2013 by El Sid Properties, LLC (“El
Sid”) relating to Doremus Newark, LLC (“Doremus Newark”), a joint venture between El Sid and Equity
Industrial Partners Corp (“EIP”), an entity for which the guarantor is a principal. El Sid primarily alleges
that EIP and certain other affiliates and principals (including the guarantor) caused the fraudulent and wrongful diversion of
proceeds from a portfolio refinancing cross-collateralized by a property owned by Doremus Newark, as well as other properties in
which El Sid had no beneficial interest, misallocated liabilities, costs and expenses to the Doremus Newark entity, and engaged
in acts of self-dealing at the expense of the Doremus Newark venture. The plaintiff is demanding, among other things, unspecified
compensatory damages and punitive damages against all defendants, the appointment of a custodian to
 

S-191
 
 
manage the affairs of Doremus
Newark and its parent, and a full accounting of the defendants’ assets. In September 2014, a court-appointed special fiscal
agent produced a report finding that the majority of the proceeds received by Doremus Newark were properly accounted for, but expressed
no opinion on the allocation of debts and liabilities among the various entities as it was beyond the scope of the court-appointed
assignment. We can provide no assurances regarding the outcome of this litigation or the effects of an adverse judgment on the
guarantor or the Mortgaged Property.
 
In the case of one (1) Mortgaged Property
identified as “Oakland Hills” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan representing
approximately 1.2% of the Initial Pool Balance, the borrower sponsor reported that it is a financial participant in a 2005 land
transaction which remains the subject of ongoing litigation. The estimated maximum exposure to the borrower sponsor is approximately
$600,000 to $950,000. The combined net worth of the borrower sponsor is approximately $89,000,000 and the combined liquidity is
approximately $9,100,000.

Factors—Litigation Concerns” in the prospectus.
 
Tenant Issues
 
Occupancy and Tenant Concentrations.
Mortgaged Properties that are owner-occupied or leased to a single tenant, or leased to a tenant that makes up a significant portion
of the rental income, are more susceptible to interruptions of cash flow if that tenant’s business operations are negatively
impacted or if such tenant fails to renew its lease.
 
See “Risk Factors—Risks of
Lease Early Termination Options” and “—Certain Additional Risks Relating to Tenants” in this
free writing prospectus, and Annex A-3 to this free writing prospectus.
 
Mortgaged Properties securing certain mortgage
loans have tenant lease concentrations. For certain information on the top ten tenants at each of the top ten mortgage loans, see
the chart entitled “Tenant Summary” on Annex A-3 to this free writing prospectus. In addition, see Annex A-1
for the identity and size of the top five tenants at each Mortgaged Property. Further, we note the following with respect to the

prospectus, securing or partially securing eight (8) mortgage loans representing approximately 6.8% of
the Initial Pool Balance by allocated loan amount, are leased to a single tenant (or, in the case of the Mortgaged Properties identified
as “Brunswick Portfolio”, two affiliated tenants). With respect to certain of these mortgage loans, the single tenant’s
lease may expire prior to or shortly after the related maturity date or anticipated repayment date, as applicable. See Annex A-1
to this free writing prospectus for tenant lease expiration dates for the single tenants at these respective Mortgaged Properties.
 

·Five (5) Mortgaged Properties identified as “Eastmont Town Center”, “New Center One Building”, “North
Miami Business Park”, “Town & Country Shopping Center” and “Big Curve Shopping Center” on Annex
A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing five (5) mortgage loans representing approximately 7.8% of the Initial Pool Balance,
have government tenants among the five (5) largest tenants at the related Mortgaged Property that in certain cases may have the
right to terminate their leases under certain circumstances, including due to a lack of appropriations during the term of the lease.
 

·In the case of fifty-eight (58) Mortgaged Properties identified as “Brunswick Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free
writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan representing approximately 1.7% of the Initial Pool Balance by allocated loan
amount, all of the Mortgaged Properties are master leased by the borrowers to two tenants, unaffiliated with the borrowers, which
operate the businesses. JPMCB owns a minority interest in the parent company for the tenants under the master lease. See “Certain
Affiliations, Relationships and Related Transactions Involving Transaction Parties” in this free writing prospectus
for additional information.
 
See “Risk Factors—Tenant
Concentration Entails Risk” and “—Certain Additional Risks Relating to Tenants” in this free
writing prospectus.
 
Certain Mortgaged Properties securing some
of the mortgage loans may have low occupancy rates. For the occupancy rate and the date of its measurement for each mortgage loan,
see Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus.
 
Certain of the Mortgaged Properties are
leased to the related borrower or affiliates of the related borrower. In that regard, we note the following examples with respect
to the mortgage loans in this trust:
 

·In the case of two (2) Mortgaged Properties identified as “First National Building” and “Town & Country
Shopping Center” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing two (2) mortgage loans representing approximately
4.7% of the Initial Pool Balance, the largest and fourth largest tenants by net rentable area, respectively, at the related Mortgaged
Properties are affiliates of the borrowers and borrower sponsors.
 

·With respect to one (1) Mortgaged Property identified as “Eastlake RV Resort” on Annex A-1 to this free writing
prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan representing approximately 0.8% of the Initial Pool Balance, the sole member of the
borrower owns 22 manufactured homes and/or fixed location travel trailers (“Rentals”) at the Mortgaged Property. The
borrower and its sole member have entered into a master lease for the 22 pads on which the Rentals are located. The sole member,
as the master tenant, may add up to no more than 10% of all pads at the Mortgaged Property. The master lease is guaranteed by the
guarantors. If the Mortgaged Property achieves a 10% debt yield on pad income (not including the income from the master lease and
from the park owned homes and fixed location travel trailers), the guarantors are no longer required to personally guarantee the
master lease payment.
 

·In the case of one (1) mortgage loan identified as “U-Haul Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus,
representing approximately 4.3% of the Initial Pool Balance, 24 of the 105 Mortgaged Properties feature space that is rented by
affiliates of the borrower sponsor on long-term leases through 2037. These spaces generally include real estate rented to the operating
company from the self-storage facility in order to operate the truck rental business or for corporate purposes, including truck
and trailer repair shops, marketing company offices, third 
 

S-193
 
 

party retail centers, manufacturing shops and administrative offices.
The appraiser concluded that the space leased to these affiliates could be either leased to third party users or converted to additional
self-storage space. Revenues from these affiliated leases contributed $1,428,313 to the related UW NOI, which accounts for 4.8%
of the related UW NOI.
 

·With respect to one (1) Mortgaged Property identified as “University Studios” on Annex A-1 to this free writing
prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan representing approximately 0.6% of the Initial Pool Balance, one of the tenants at the
Mortgaged Property is a 2,500 square foot café that is owned and operated by the loan sponsors. The affiliated tenant pays
annual rent of approximately $75,000, which accounts for 5.9% of the related underwritten revenues.
 
In each of the above circumstances, we cannot
assure you that the terms of those leases are not inherently more beneficial to the tenant than similar leases to unaffiliated
third party tenants. See “Risk Factors—Certain Additional Risks Relating to Tenants” and “—Mortgaged
Properties Leased to Borrowers or Borrower Affiliated Entities Also Have Risks” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Expirations. Certain of the Mortgaged
Properties are subject to tenant leases that expire before the maturity date of the related mortgage loan. For tenant lease expiration
information in the form of a lease rollover chart relating to each of the top ten mortgage loans, see the related summaries attached
as Annex A-3 to this free writing prospectus. In addition, see Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus for tenant lease
expiration dates for the five (5) largest tenants at each Mortgaged Property. In addition, identified below are certain lease expirations
with respect to the retail, office, industrial and mixed-use Mortgaged Properties securing certain of the mortgage loans included
in the trust:
 

·Twenty-five (25) Mortgaged Properties identified as “Civic Opera Building”, “Palmer House Retail Shops”,
“Gateway Business Park”, “Frandor Shopping Center”, “The Outlet Shoppes at Gettysburg”, “Eastmont
Town Center”, “Chow Triple Net Retail Portfolio I”, “Emerson Pointe”, “Southwest Plaza”,
“Freeway Crossing” and “One Park Centre” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing eleven
(11) mortgage loans representing approximately 30.6% of the Initial Pool Balance, are each subject to tenant leases that are scheduled
to have a 50% or more, but less than 100% (based either on net rentable area or total underwritten rent) lease rollover prior to,
or in the same year as, the related maturity date or anticipated repayment date.
 

·Sixteen (16) Mortgaged Properties identified as “Park Place I & II Portfolio”, “New Center One Building”,
“North Miami Business Park”, “Town & Country Shopping Center”, “Falcon Gateway”, “Old
Stage Warehouse”, “780 Dedham Street”, “Prospect Industrial Center”, “Heritage Shopping Center”,
“International Design Center”, “CVS Portfolio”, “Bedford Square I & II”, “Sak’s Garage”
and “Chippewa Towne Centre” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing fourteen (14) mortgage loans
representing approximately 11.8% of the Initial Pool Balance, are each subject to tenant leases that are scheduled to have 100%
(based either on net rentable area or total underwritten rent) lease rollover prior to, or in the same year as, the related maturity
date or anticipated repayment date.
 
Terminations. Tenants under commercial
leases often have the right to terminate the related lease or abate or reduce the related rent for various reasons or upon various
conditions. See “Risk Factors—Risks of Lease Early Termination Options” in this free writing prospectus.
 

·Seventy-six (76) Mortgaged Properties identified as “Civic Opera Building”, “Palmer House Retail Shops”,
“Gateway Business Park”, “The Outlet Shoppes at Gettysburg”, “One Shell Square”, “Park

where one or more of the top five (5) tenants at such Mortgaged Property either has the right to terminate its lease during
the term of the loan, prior to the stated expiration of the full lease term and during the term of the related mortgage loan (either
at such tenant’s 
 

S-194
 
 

option or for reasons other than a landlord default under the applicable lease, including as a result of
the trigger of co-tenancy provisions) and/or the right to reduce such tenant’s total leased space or reduce the related rent
at the related Mortgaged Property pursuant to the related lease. See Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus and the footnotes
related thereto for additional information on the top five tenants at the related Mortgaged Properties.
 
Purchase Options, Rights
of First Refusal and Rights of First Offer
 
Tenants under commercial leases, franchisors,
property managers, ground lessors and others may have the right to purchase all or a portion of the related Mortgaged Property
under certain circumstances, including, in the event that the related borrower contemplates a sale of such Mortgaged Property.
See “Risk Factors—Options and Other Purchase Rights May Affect Value or Hinder Recovery with Respect to the Mortgaged
Properties” in this free writing prospectus and representation number 8 on Annex D-1 to this free writing prospectus
and the exceptions to that representation on Annex D-2 to this free writing prospectus. With respect to the Mortgaged Properties
securing the mortgage loans in the trust, we note in particular the following:
 

·In the case of eighty (80) Mortgaged Properties identified as “Hilton Suites Chicago Magnificent Mile”, “Civic
Opera Building”, “Hilton Atlanta Perimeter”, “Brunswick Portfolio”, “Residence Inn - Clifton
Park”, “Chow Triple Net Retail Portfolio I”, “Antelope Valley Partners” and “Behringer Tractor
Supply Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing eight (8) mortgage loans representing approximately
21.1% of the Initial Pool Balance, certain tenants, franchisors, property managers, ground lessors, developers or owners’
associations at such Mortgaged Properties or other parties have a purchase option or a right of first refusal or right of first
offer, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, to purchase all or a portion of the related Mortgaged Property in the event the
related borrower decides to sell the related Mortgaged Property or a portion thereof, as applicable. See “—Certain
Terms and Conditions of the Mortgage Loans—Releases of Individual Mortgaged Properties” in this free writing prospectus
 

·In the case of fifty-eight (58) Mortgaged Properties identified as “Brunswick Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this
free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan representing approximately 1.7% of the Initial Pool Balance, the tenants
under the master lease have the irrevocable option to purchase all of the Mortgaged Properties in the event the borrowers do not
consent to a proposed assignment of the master lease or the incurrence of additional debt by the tenants (to the extent that the
borrowers’ consent is required under the master lease for such actions). The tenants are required to purchase the Mortgaged Properties
for cash in the amount of the average annual rent for the next five years multiplied by a factor of 12.5, plus all costs incidental
to such purchase (including the payment of any prepayment fees). In the event of a substantial taking or condemnation of a Mortgaged
Property such that the Mortgaged Property is no longer suitable for use by the tenants, the tenants may terminate the master lease
with respect to the Mortgaged Property provided that they make an irrevocable offer to purchase the Mortgaged Property. In addition,
the tenants under the master lease may terminate the lease for any Mortgaged Property which has become uneconomical or unsuitable
for continued use in the tenants’ business. Under the master lease, the tenants are permitted to arrange for a sale of the Mortgaged
Property on behalf of the borrowers, with a purchase price of not less than the Mortgaged Property’s percentage of the portfolio
multiplied by the fixed annual rent for the next five years plus 12.5%. If the borrowers elect not to accept the sale, the master
lease will terminate for such Mortgaged Property and rent will be adjusted accordingly. The tenants are limited to seven (7) such
sales/terminations during the term of the master lease and the total amount of sales pursuant to this provision may not exceed
$25,000,000. Finally, provided no event of default under the master lease exists, if the borrowers receive a bona fide offer from
an unaffiliated third party to purchase any portion of the Mortgaged Property which offer borrower desires to accept, the master
lease grants the tenants a right of first refusal to acquire such property for cash or cash plus purchase money financing, provided
that the right of first refusal does not apply in certain circumstances (such as a mortgage foreclosure or a deed in lieu of foreclosure)
as further described in the master lease.

·In the case of two (2) Mortgaged Properties identified as “CVS Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus,
securing one (1) mortgage loan representing approximately 0.4% of the Initial Pool Balance, the related mortgage loan documents
provide for a ground lease buyout reserve of $150,000, which was held back at closing. An affiliate of the borrower is required
to execute the purchase option relating to the ground lease for the CVS Portfolio – CVS Pharmacy-Cortland Mortgaged Property
at any date prior to March 2018, or nine months prior to the expiration of the ground lease on November 30, 2018. In addition to
the buyout reserve, the lender collected an upfront reserve equal to one year’s annual ground rent payments, which will be
released upon completion of the borrower affiliate’s acquisition of the fee simple interest in the CVS Portfolio –
CVS Pharmacy-Cortland Mortgaged Property.
 
Additional Considerations
 
In the case of one (1) Mortgaged Property
identified as “One Shell Square” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan representing
approximately 3.1% of the Initial Pool Balance, the borrower was required to reserve $29,053,102 into a reserve for outstanding
tenant improvements and leasing commissions associated with fifteen (15) tenants at the Mortgaged Property including, without limitation,
the largest tenant at the Mortgaged Property, Shell Oil Company. Of the reserved amount, $24,465,897 and $2,666,648 are specifically
allocated to tenant improvements and leasing commissions, respectively, associated with the largest tenant’s lease.
 
With respect to two (2) Mortgaged Properties
identified as “Park Place I & II Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage
loan representing approximately 2.6% of the Initial Pool Balance, Williams Companies, Inc., the parent of the guarantor of Williams
Field Services Group, LLC, the sole tenant at the Park Place II property, which tenant occupies approximately 53% of the net rentable
space at the Mortgaged Properties, announced a business combination transaction with Energy Transfer Equity, L.P., which transaction
has been approved by the boards of directors of both entities. We cannot assure you that the business combination transaction will
take place or that it will not have a material adverse effect on the tenant or the Mortgaged Properties.
 
Assessments of Property Value
and Condition
 
Appraisals
 
For each Mortgaged Property, the related
mortgage loan seller obtained a current (within seven (7) months of the origination date of the mortgage loan) full narrative appraisal
conforming at least to the requirements of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (“FIRREA”).
See “Transaction Parties—The Sponsors and Mortgage Loan Sellers—JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association—JPMCB’s

In the case of one (1) Mortgaged Property
identified as “Hilton Suites Chicago Magnificent Mile” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1)
mortgage loan representing approximately 6.7% of the Initial Pool Balance, the appraiser provided an “as if complete”
hypothetical value of $112,400,000, dated as of July 7, 2015 for the Mortgaged Property, which assumes that the renovations associated
with the property improvement plan at the hotel have been completed. At origination of the mortgage loan, the borrower was required
to reserve $10,158,748 with the lender to complete the property improvement plan. The “as if complete” value of $112,400,000
results in a Cut-off Date LTV Ratio of 68.7%, and the “as-is” appraised value of $102,100,000 results in a Cut-off
Date LTV Ratio of 75.7%. See Annex A-1 and Annex A-3 in this free writing prospectus for additional information.

In the case of one (1) Mortgaged Property
identified as “Civic Opera Building” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan representing
approximately 6.5% of the Initial Pool Balance, the appraiser provided a “hypothetical market value assuming contractual
tenant improvements and free rent abatements are escrowed” of $220,000,000, dated as of June 2, 2015 for the Mortgaged Property,
which assumes that all contractual tenant improvement allowances and free rent (in the aggregate amount of $7,733,934) were escrowed
at origination of the mortgage loan. At origination of the mortgage loan, the borrower was required to reserve $3,000,000 into
the reserve for tenant improvements and leasing commissions, as well as separate reserves of $3,711,165 for outstanding free rent
and $2,407,592 for outstanding tenant improvements at the Mortgaged Property. The “hypothetical market value assuming contractual
tenant improvements and free rent abatements are escrowed” value of $220,000,000 results in a Cut-off Date LTV Ratio of 74.5%,
and the “as-is” appraised value of $214,000,000 results in a Cut-off Date LTV Ratio of 76.6%. See Annex A-1 and Annex
A-3 in this free writing prospectus for additional information.
 
In the case of one hundred and five (105)
Mortgaged Properties identified as “U-Haul Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1)
mortgage loan representing approximately 4.3% of the Initial Pool Balance, the appraiser provided a portfolio value for the Mortgaged
Properties which includes a premium for the value of selling the portfolio in its entirety. The Cut-off Date LTV Ratio based on
the portfolio value is 34.6%, and the Cut-off Date LTV Ratio based on the sum of the individual Mortgaged Property appraised values
of $424,700,000 is 37.3%. See Annex A-1 and Annex A-3 in this free writing prospectus for additional information.
 
In the case of one (1) Mortgaged Property
identified as “One Shell Square” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan representing
approximately 3.1% of the Initial Pool Balance, the appraiser provided a “market value subject to hypothetical condition”
value of $180,600,000, dated as of April 24, 2015 for the Mortgaged Property, which assumes that all outstanding tenant improvements,
leasing commissions, planned capital expenditures and free rent have been paid. At origination of the mortgage loan, the borrower
was required to reserve $29,053,102 for outstanding tenant improvements/leasing commissions, $11,357,584 for deferred maintenance
and $8,038 for free rent under the leases at the Mortgaged Property. The “market value subject to hypothetical condition”
value of $180,600,000 results in a Cut-off Date LTV Ratio of 69.8%, and the “as-is” appraised value of $138,000,000
results in a Cut-off Date LTV Ratio of 91.4%. See Annex A-1 and Annex A-3 in this free writing prospectus for additional information.
 
In the case of one (1) Mortgaged Property
identified as “Hilton Atlanta Perimeter” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan
representing approximately 2.6% of the Initial Pool Balance, the appraiser provided an “as if complete” hypothetical
value of $43,100,000, dated as of July 8, 2015 for the Mortgaged Property, which assumes that the renovations associated with the
property improvement plan at the hotel have been completed. At origination of the mortgage loan, the borrower was required to reserve
$7,757,641 with the lender to complete the renovation plan. The “as if complete” value of $43,100,000 results in a
Cut-off Date LTV Ratio of 70.0%, and the “as-is” appraised value of $35,100,000 results in a Cut-off Date LTV Ratio
of 86.0%. See Annex A-1 and Annex A-3 to this free writing prospectus for additional information.
 
In the case of three (3) Mortgaged Properties
identified as “Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage
loan representing approximately 2.2% of the Initial Pool Balance, the appraiser provided an “as-complete market value based
on a hypothetical condition” of $57,000,000 (corresponding to a Cut-off Date LTV Ratio of 67.5%) for the Mortgaged Properties,
which assumes a property improvement plan costing approximately $6,055,088 was completed across all three Mortgaged Properties
as of August 1, 2015. The related appraisals also reported an “as-is” value of $50,500,000 (corresponding to a Cut-off
Date LTV Ratio of 76.2%) that assumes the property improvement plan has not yet been completed but makes the assumption that it
will be completed during the first year of the projection period at a cost of approximately $6,055,088. The related franchisor
required the property improvement plans at the Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio Properties in connection with extending the franchise
agreements through 2035. The budgeted cost of the property improvement plans is $6,461,588, which was reserved at origination of
the mortgage loan. The “as-is”
 

S-197
 
 
values for the Hyatt Place Austin Mortgaged Property, the Hyatt Place San Antonio Mortgaged
Property and the Hyatt Place Dallas Mortgaged Property are $25,500,000, $13,000,000 and $12,000,000, respectively. See Annex A-1
and Annex A-3 to this free writing prospectus for additional information.
 
In the case of one (1) Mortgaged Property
identified as “Langhorne Shopping Center” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan
representing approximately 1.3% of the Initial Pool Balance, the appraiser provided a “prospective market value upon completion”
value of $20,175,000, dated as of September 1, 2016 for the Mortgaged Property, which assumes that the proposed expansion
at the Mortgaged Property is completed. At origination of the mortgage loan, the borrower was required to reserve $993,750 in the
tenant improvements and leasing commissions reserve to complete the expansion. The “prospective market value upon completion”
value of $20,175,000 results in a Cut-off Date LTV Ratio of 75.0%, and the “as-is” appraised value of $18,850,000 results
in a Cut-off Date LTV Ratio of 80.3%. See Annex A-1 and Annex A-3 to this free writing prospectus for additional information.
 
See “Risk Factors—Limitations
of Appraisals” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Engineering Reports
 
In connection with the origination of each
mortgage loan included in the trust, other than as identified below, the related mortgage loan seller or other originator obtained
an engineering report with respect to the related Mortgaged Property with an engineering report dated within twelve (12) months
of the Cut-off Date. See “Transaction Parties—The Sponsors and Mortgage Loan Sellers—JPMorgan Chase Bank,
National Association—JPMCB’s Underwriting Guidelines and Processes—Physical Assessment Report”,

Zoning and Building Code
Compliance and Condemnation
 
In connection with the origination of each
mortgage loan included in the trust, the related mortgage loan seller or other originator generally examined whether the use and
occupancy of the related real property collateral was in material compliance with zoning, land-use, building rules, regulations
and orders then applicable to that property. See “Transaction Parties—The Sponsors and Mortgage Loan Sellers—JPMorgan
Chase Bank, National Association—JPMCB’s Underwriting Guidelines and Processes—Zoning and Building Code Compliance”,

Commercial Mortgage Corporation—RCMC’s Underwriting Standards and Loan Analysis—Zoning and Building Code Compliance”
and “—RAIT Funding, LLC—RAIT’s Underwriting Guidelines and Processes” in this free writing
prospectus. For example, in this regard we note the following example:
 
With respect to one (1) Mortgaged Property
identified as “Civic Opera Building” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan representing
approximately 6.5% of the Initial Pool Balance, the Mortgaged Property has been designated as a historical landmark by the City
of Chicago and permits for certain types of alterations, improvements, demolitions, relocations or other work would require the
approval of the city commission for historical and architectural landmarks.
 
With respect to two (2) Mortgaged Properties
identified as “Shadow Hills Apartments” and “Summer View Apartments” on Annex A-1 to this free writing
prospectus, securing two (2) mortgage loans collectively representing approximately 1.4% of the Initial Pool Balance, each Mortgaged
Property is

subject to a notice of sub-standard condition issued by the City of Los Angeles Department of Housing and Development
with respect to the converted use from a storage space and mezzanine area to apartments for 13 units with respect to the Shadow
Hills Mortgaged Property and from a storage space and a recreation room to apartments for 3 units with respect to the Summer View
Apartments Mortgaged Property in violation of the Certificate of Occupancy. The loan documents require the borrower to use its
best efforts to obtain within three years of the closing date of the mortgage loan a clearance of such violation and release of
the notice by the City of Los Angeles. The mortgage loan is recourse to the guarantor if borrower fails to clear the existing violation
within three years of the closing date of the mortgage loan or if the City of Los Angeles commences any enforcement action against
the Mortgaged Property or borrower with respect to such existing violation.
 
With respect one (1) Mortgaged Property
identified as “Mustang Crossing Apartments“ on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage
loan representing approximately 0.9% of the Initial Pool Balance, the Mortgaged Property is subject to a Land Use Restrictive Agreement
(“LURA”), which requires a minimum of 35 units to be leased to residents that qualify as “lower income families”
(annual income not in excess of 80% of area household median) and a minimum of 20 units to be leased to residents that qualify
as “very low income families” (annual income not in excess of 50% of area household median). The LURA has a 40 year
term and expires in 2034.
 
With respect to one (1) Mortgaged Property
identified as “Brynn Marr Village” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan representing
approximately 0.5% of the Initial Pool Balance, the use of the Mortgaged Property as a multifamily property is a legal non-conforming
use. The Mortgaged Property is zoned for low density residential purposes, and in the event of a casualty of 50% or more of the
value of the Mortgaged Property, the borrower would be required to rebuild the Mortgaged Property to conform to current code requirements.
 
See “Risk Factors—Zoning
Compliance, Use Restrictions and Condemnation May Adversely Affect Property Value” in this free writing prospectus and
see representation number 26 in Annex D-1 and the identified exceptions to that representation in Annex D-2 to this
free writing prospectus.
 
Certain Terms and Conditions
of the Mortgage Loans
 
Each of the mortgage loans bears interest
at a mortgage rate (each, a “Mortgage Rate”) that will remain fixed for their remaining terms; provided,
however, that after the Anticipated Repayment Date, the interest rate on an ARD Loan will increase as described in this free
writing prospectus. See “—ARD Loans” in this free writing prospectus. The mortgage loans have due dates

As used in this free writing prospectus,
“grace period” is the number of days following the Due Date before a payment default would exist under each mortgage
loan and is based solely on the express terms of the respective mortgage loans. Various states may impose statutorily longer grace
periods.
 
In some cases, there are exceptions to the
strict operation of the grace period (or lack thereof), allowing a notice and cure right, for example, prior to acceleration of
the mortgage loan or in the event that the failure to make timely principal and interest payments is relatively infrequent.
 
All of the mortgage loans accrue interest
on the basis of the actual number of days in a month, assuming a 360-day year (“Actual/360 Basis”) (other than
with respect to one (1) mortgage loan identified as “The Outlet Shoppes at Gettysburg” on Annex A-1 to this free writing
prospectus, representing approximately 3.3% of the Initial Pool Balance, which accrues interest on the basis of a 360-day year
consisting of twelve 30-day months).

(1)See Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus for specific criteria applicable to the mortgage loans.
 

(2)Prepayments may occur (often without any yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium) in connection with a casualty at or
condemnation of the related mortgaged property and, if the casualty or condemnation is sufficiently material and/or if the insurance
proceeds or condemnation award is not released for restoration, some mortgage loans permit the related borrower to prepay the related
mortgage loan in full or up to a specified percentage of the allocated loan amount of the affected property to obtain the release
thereof.
 

(3)With respect to one (1) mortgage loan secured by the Mortgaged Properties identified as “U-Haul Portfolio” on Annex
A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing approximately 4.3% of the Initial Pool Balance, the mortgage loan fully amortizes
during the defeasance period and there is no open period.
 

S-200
 
 

(4)Includes fifty-eight (58) Mortgaged Properties securing one (1) mortgage loan identified as “Brunswick Portfolio”
on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing approximately 1.7% of the Initial Pool Balance, that permits the related
borrower to prepay a portion of the mortgage loan at any time (including during the lockout period) with the payment of a yield
maintenance premium in connection with the termination of the master lease as to any mortgaged property which the tenants under
the master lease deem uneconomical or unsuitable for further use in the tenants’ business. See “Description of the Mortgage
Pool—Mortgaged Property Considerations—Purchase Options, Rights of First Refusal and Rights of First Offer”
and “—Certain Terms and Conditions of the Mortgage Loans—Releases of Individual Mortgaged Properties”
in this free writing prospectus.
 
With respect to certain mortgage loans that
permit prepayment subject to yield maintenance, the “Yield Maintenance Charge” will generally, subject to variations,
be equal to the greater of (i) a specified percentage of the amount being prepaid and (ii) the present value, as of the
prepayment date, of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest (including any balloon payment) from the prepayment
date through the date specified in the related mortgage loan documents (which will generally be the maturity date, the Anticipated
Repayment Date or the first date on which the borrower can prepay without a yield maintenance charge) determined by discounting
such payments at a Discount Rate, less the amount of principal being prepaid. See Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus
for the specific prepayment restrictions for each mortgage loan.
 
The term “Discount Rate”
as used in the preceding paragraph will be as set forth in the related loan documents but will generally mean the yield on a U.S.
Treasury security that has the most closely corresponding maturity date to the maturity date, open prepayment date and/or Anticipated
Repayment Date or the remaining weighted average life, of the related mortgage loan plus, in certain circumstances, an additional
specified percentage and converted to a monthly equivalent yield (as described in the respective loan documents).
 
With respect to certain other
mortgage loans that permit prepayment subject to yield maintenance, the “Yield Maintenance Charge” will
generally, subject to certain variations, be an amount (in some cases, not less than 1.0% of the amount prepaid) equal to the
present value of a series of payments, each equal to the Interest Payment Differential and payable on each scheduled due date
over the remaining original term of the prepaid yield maintenance mortgage loan and, with respect to the principal balance of
the note due to be outstanding on such date, the stated maturity date, the Anticipated Repayment Date or the date preceding
the commencement of the open prepayment period, as applicable, discounted at the Reinvestment Yield as of the date of
prepayment for the number of months remaining from such date of prepayment to each scheduled due date through and including
the stated maturity date, the Anticipated Repayment Date or the date preceding the commencement of the open prepayment
period, as applicable.
 
The term “Interest Payment Differential”
with respect to any related prepaid yield maintenance mortgage loan will generally equal (i) the Mortgage Rate minus the Reinvestment
Yield, divided by (ii) 12, and multiplied by (iii) the outstanding principal balance of the prepaid yield maintenance
mortgage loan on the date of prepayment (if the prepayment date is a scheduled due date, after the application of the monthly payment
amount due); provided that the Interest Payment Differential will never be less than zero.
 
The term “Reinvestment Yield”
means with respect to any related prepaid yield maintenance mortgage loan, will generally equal, depending on the mortgage loan,
either: (a) the yield calculated by the related lender by the linear interpolation of the yields, “as reported in the
Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15-Selected Interest Rates under the heading U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Constant
Maturities” for the week ending prior to the date of prepayment, of U.S. Treasury Constant Maturities with maturity dates
(one longer or one shorter) most nearly approximating the loan maturity date or the Anticipated Repayment Date or the date preceding
the commencement of the open prepayment period, as applicable (and, as used in the second preceding paragraph, converted to a monthly
compounded nominal yield); or (b) the lesser of (i) the yield on the U.S. Obligations with the same maturity date as
the stated maturity date, the Anticipated Repayment Date or date preceding the commencement of the open prepayment period, as applicable,
of the prepaid yield maintenance mortgage loan or, if no such U.S. Obligations issue is available, then the interpolated yield
on the two U.S. Obligations issues (primary issues) with maturity dates (one prior to and one following) that are closest to the
stated maturity date, the Anticipated Repayment Date or the date preceding the commencement of the open prepayment period, 
 

S-201
 
 
as applicable,
of the prepaid yield maintenance mortgage loan or (ii) the yield on the U.S. Obligations with a term equal to the remaining
average life of the prepaid yield maintenance mortgage loan or, if no such U.S. Obligations are available, then the interpolated
yield on the two U.S. Obligations issues (primary issues) with terms (one prior to and one following) that are closest to the remaining
average life of the prepaid yield maintenance mortgage loan with each such yield being based on the bid price for such issue as
published in The Wall Street Journal on the date that is 14 days prior to the date of prepayment set forth in the related
borrower’s notice of repayment (or, if such bid price is not published on that date, the next preceding date on which such
bid price is so published) and converted to a monthly compounded nominal yield.
 
The term “U.S. Obligations”
means, in general, securities evidencing an obligation to timely pay principal and/or interest in a full and timely manner that
are (1) direct obligations of the United States of America for the payment of which its full faith and credit is pledged,
not subject to prepayment, call or early redemption, (2) certain other non-callable “government securities” as
defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(a)(8), as amended, or (3) such other instruments, if any, as set forth
in the related mortgage loan documents.
 
Yield Maintenance Charges and any prepayment
premiums are distributable as described in this free writing prospectus under “Description of the Certificates—Allocation
of Yield Maintenance Charges and Prepayment Premiums”.
 
The mortgage loans generally permit voluntary
prepayment without the payment of a Yield Maintenance Charge or any prepayment premium during an “open period” immediately
prior to and including the stated maturity date or Anticipated Repayment Date set forth in the following table:

(1)See Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus for specific criteria applicable to the mortgage loans.
 
Unless a mortgage loan is relatively near
its stated maturity date (or Anticipated Repayment Date), or unless the sale price or the amount of the refinancing of the related
Mortgaged Property is considerably higher than the current outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loan (due to an increase
in the value of the Mortgaged Property or otherwise) and depending on the interest rate environment at the time of prepayment,
the Yield Maintenance Charge or prepayment premium may offset entirely or render insignificant any economic benefit to be received
by a related borrower upon a refinancing or sale of its Mortgaged Property. The Yield Maintenance Charge or prepayment premium
provision of a mortgage loan creates an economic disincentive for the borrower to prepay its mortgage loan voluntarily and, accordingly,
the related borrower may elect not to prepay its mortgage loan. However, we cannot assure you that the imposition of a Yield Maintenance
Charge or prepayment premium will provide a sufficient disincentive to prevent a voluntary principal prepayment or sufficient compensation
to Certificateholders affected by a prepayment to offset the effects of such prepayment on the yield to Certificateholders.
 
Certain state laws limit the amounts that
a lender may collect from a borrower as an additional charge in connection with the prepayment of a mortgage loan. Certain mortgage
loans may require the payment of Yield Maintenance Charges or prepayment premiums in connection with a prepayment of the related
mortgage loan as a result of a casualty or condemnation. Certain other of the mortgage loans do not require the payment of Yield
Maintenance Charges or prepayment premiums in connection with a prepayment of the related mortgage loan with Insurance and Condemnation
Proceeds as a result of a
 

S-202
 
 
casualty or condemnation; provided that no event of default exists. In addition, certain of the
mortgage loans permit the related borrower, after a partial casualty or partial condemnation, to prepay the remaining principal
balance of the mortgage loan (after application of the related Insurance and Condemnation Proceeds to pay the principal balance
of the mortgage loan), which may in certain cases not be accompanied by any prepayment consideration; provided that (i) the
prepayment of the remaining balance is made within a specified period of time following the date of the application of proceeds
or award and/or (ii) no event of default exists. Furthermore, the enforceability, under the laws of a number of states, of
provisions providing for payments comparable to Yield Maintenance Charges or prepayment premiums upon an involuntary prepayment
is unclear. We cannot assure you that, at the time a Yield Maintenance Charge or prepayment premium is required to be made on a
mortgage loan in connection with an involuntary prepayment, the obligation to pay the Yield Maintenance Charge or prepayment premium
will be enforceable under applicable state law. See “Certain Legal Aspects of the Mortgage Loans” in this free
writing prospectus and “Certain Legal Aspects of Mortgage Loans—Default Interest and Limitations on Prepayments”
in the prospectus.
 
Certain of the mortgage loans may provide
for a recast of the amortization schedule and an adjustment of the scheduled debt service payments on the related mortgage loan
upon application of specified amounts of Insurance and Condemnation Proceeds, upon the release of individual properties securing
certain mortgage loans or upon application of certain holdbacks, if such holdbacks are not used for their specified purpose, to
pay the related unpaid principal balance. Such application of a holdback may or may not require a payment of a Yield Maintenance
Charge or prepayment premium based upon the amount of the principal being paid.
 
ARD Loans
 
One (1) mortgage loan identified as “Eastmont
Town Center” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus (the “ARD Loan”), representing approximately
2.5% of the Initial Pool Balance, provides that, if after a certain date (the “Anticipated Repayment Date”),
the borrower has not prepaid the applicable ARD Loan in full, any principal outstanding on that date will accrue interest at an
increased interest rate (the “Revised Rate”) rather than the applicable stated Mortgage Rate (the “Initial
Rate”). See Annex A-1 in this free writing prospectus for the Anticipated Repayment Date and Revised Rate for the
ARD Loan. After the Anticipated Repayment Date, the ARD Loan further requires that all cash flow available from the Mortgaged Property
after payment of the Periodic Payments required under the terms of the mortgage loan documents and all escrows and property expenses
required under the mortgage loan documents be used to accelerate amortization of principal (without payment of any yield maintenance
premium or prepayment charge) on the ARD Loan. While interest at the Initial Rate continues to accrue and be payable on a current
basis on an ARD Loan after its Anticipated Repayment Date, the payment of Excess Interest, to the extent actually collected, will
be deferred and will be required to be paid, with interest (to the extent permitted under applicable law and the mortgage loan
documents), only after the outstanding principal balance of the ARD Loan has been paid in full, at which time the Excess Interest
will be paid to the holders of the Class Z certificates.
 
Additionally, an account has been established
for the ARD Loan into which the tenants are required to directly deposit rents or other revenues from the related Mortgaged Property.
The foregoing feature is designed to increase the likelihood that the ARD Loan will be prepaid by the borrower on or about its
Anticipated Repayment Date. However, we cannot assure you that any ARD Loan will be prepaid on its Anticipated Repayment Date.
 
Defeasance; Collateral
Substitution; Property Releases
 
The terms of seventy (70) mortgage loans
identified as being subject to defeasance (or defeasance and other forms of prepayment protection) under the column heading “Prepayment
Provisions” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing approximately 64.8% of the Initial Pool Balance,
permit the applicable borrower on any due date after a specified period not less than two years from the Closing Date (or in the
case of any Serviced Whole Loans under such column heading, not less than the earlier of three years after origination or two years
after the latest securitization of any of the related Pari
 

S-203
 
 
Passu Companion Loans), provided that no event of default exists,
to obtain a release of all of a Mortgaged Property from the lien of the related Mortgage in exchange for a grant of a security
interest in certain U.S. government securities (a “Defeasance”). However, with respect to one (1) mortgage loan
secured by the Mortgaged Properties identified as “U-Haul Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus,
representing approximately 4.3% of the Initial Pool Balance, the mortgage loan fully amortizes during the Defeasance period. For
further information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Prepayments and Repurchases” and Annex A-1
to this free writing prospectus.
 
In general, the release is subject to certain
conditions, including, among other conditions, that the borrower:
 
(a)	pays or delivers to the
master servicer on any due date (the “Release Date”) (1) all interest accrued and unpaid on the principal
balance of the Mortgage Note to but not including the Release Date, (2) all other sums due under the mortgage loan and all
other loan documents executed in connection with the related mortgage loan, (3) funds to purchase direct non-callable obligations
of the United States of America or, in certain cases, other government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“Government Securities”), providing payments (x) on or prior
to all successive scheduled due dates from the Release Date to the related maturity date (or, in some cases, the first day
of the open period) including all outstanding principal and interest, and (y) in amounts at least equal to the scheduled payments
due on these dates under the mortgage loan or the related defeased amount of the mortgage loan in the case of a partial Defeasance
(including any balloon payment at maturity or anticipated repayment date, as applicable), and (4) any costs and expenses incurred
in connection with the purchase of the Government Securities; and
 
(b)	delivers a security agreement
granting the trust fund a first priority lien on the Government Securities purchased as substitute collateral and an opinion of
counsel relating to the enforceability of such security interest.
 
The existing borrower or, if the borrower
is not required to do so under the mortgage loan documents, the master servicer, will be responsible for purchasing the Government
Securities on behalf of the borrower at the borrower’s expense. Simultaneously with these actions, the applicable Mortgaged
Property or Properties will be released from the lien of the Mortgage and the pledged Government Securities (together with any
Mortgaged Property not released, in the case of a partial Defeasance) will be substituted as the collateral securing the mortgage
loan (although in some cases involving a partial Defeasance, the Government Securities and the remaining real property collateral
secure separate non-crossed notes).
 
In some cases, a successor borrower established
or designated by the existing borrower or by the originator (or, if the existing borrower is not required or permitted to do so
under the mortgage loan documents, established or designated by the master servicer) will assume all of the defeased obligations
of a borrower exercising a Defeasance option under a mortgage loan and the existing borrower will be relieved of all of the defeased
obligations under the mortgage loan. In other cases, the existing borrower will remain liable for all of the defeased obligations,
subject to the mortgage loan documents, after releasing the Mortgaged Property.
 
Although the collateral substitution provisions
related to Defeasance are not intended to be, and do not have the same effect on the Certificateholders as, a prepayment of the
related mortgage loan, a court could interpret the excess, if any, of the amount paid to purchase the Defeasance collateral over
the amount of the defeased debt, as being equivalent to an unenforceable Yield Maintenance Charge or prepayment premium. We make
no representation as to the enforceability of the Defeasance provisions of any mortgage loan.
 
In addition to the provisions described
above, certain mortgage loans permit partial Defeasances, partial releases and property substitutions as described below.
 

S-204
 
 
Releases of Individual
Mortgaged Properties
 
With respect to one (1) Mortgaged Property
identified as “Civic Opera Building” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan representing
approximately 6.5% of the Initial Pool Balance, the related mortgage loan documents provide that in the event the owner of the
theater parcel (which is not included in the collateral) notifies the related borrower of its election to exercise its property
exchange option to obtain the “option space” identified in the mortgage loan agreement pursuant to a reciprocal easement
agreement for the Mortgaged Property, the borrower is permitted to convey the “option space” to the theater parcel
owner and obtain the release of the “option space” from the lien of the loan documents, provided that, among
other conditions: (i) the borrower provides the plans, specifications and location of the space to be exchanged for the “option
space” and receives the lender’s consent, which may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; (ii) the borrower
delivers an updated legal description and survey for the Mortgaged Property; and (iii) the borrower delivers amendments to the
security documents and an endorsement to the title insurance policy.

day” within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(9) of the Code of the REMIC trust, subject to the satisfaction of conditions set
forth in the related mortgage loan documents, including but not limited to: (i) delivery of defeasance collateral in the amount

property from the lien of the security instrument in connection with a partial defeasance after the permitted defeasance date,
subject to the satisfaction of conditions set forth in the related loan documents, including: (i) defeasance of the portion of

(c) an amount which would result in the loan-to-value ratio for the remaining property being no greater than 70.0% and (d) an amount
which would result in the debt yield for the remaining property being not less than 10.0% and (ii) the delivery of an opinion of
counsel that the issuing entity will not fail to maintain its status as REMIC trust as a result of the release.
 
With respect to fifty-eight (58) Mortgaged
Properties identified as “Brunswick Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage
loan representing approximately 1.7% of the Initial Pool Balance, the related borrowers are permitted to release one or more Mortgaged
Properties in connection with certain rights of the master tenants to terminate the master lease as to a Mortgaged Property due
to a condemnation or a determination by the tenants that the Mortgaged Property has become uneconomical or unsuitable for continued
use in their business, at any time during the mortgage loan (including during the lockout period), upon certain terms and conditions
including, without limitation: (i) the partial prepayment of the Adjusted Release Amount (defined below); (ii) all of the conditions
for a termination of the master lease for the applicable Mortgaged Property in the master lease have been satisfied; and (iii)
the delivery of a REMIC opinion. If the resulting loan-to-value ratio exceeds 125% (excluding the value of personal property and
the business as a going concern), the borrowers must pay down the mortgage loan by the amount specified in the mortgage loan documents.
The “Adjusted Release Amount” for a sale of a Mortgaged Property (a) as the result of an economic abandonment

Other Releases
 
With respect to five (5) Mortgaged Properties
identified as “The Outlet Shoppes at Gettysburg”, “New Center One Building”, “Residence Inn - Clifton
Park”, “Langhorne Shopping Center” and “Best Buy Sanford, FL” on Annex A-1 to this free writing
prospectus, securing five (5) mortgage loans representing approximately 8.4% of the Initial Pool Balance, subject to the satisfaction
of conditions set forth in the related mortgage loan documents, including satisfaction of REMIC requirements, the related mortgage
loan documents permit, without any required partial prepayment or defeasance of the subject mortgage loan, a partial release of
an unimproved or minimally improved portion of real property collateral (which may have landscaping, parking or other non-income
generating improvements or minimal improvements such as a miniature golf course and merchant facilities). However, in some cases,
the property to be released may have material value even though it is currently unimproved or minimally improved.
 
“Due-on-Sale” and “Due-on-Encumbrance” Provisions
 
The mortgage loans contain “due-on-sale”
and “due-on-encumbrance” provisions that in each case, with limited exceptions, permit the holder of the Mortgage to
accelerate the maturity of the related mortgage loan if the borrower sells or otherwise transfers or encumbers the related Mortgaged
Property or upon the transfer or encumbrance of ownership interests in the related borrower or its equity owner(s) without the
consent of the holder of the mortgage loan; provided, however, that under the terms of many of the mortgage loans, this
consent may not be unreasonably withheld, and in some cases must be granted if certain conditions are met. Certain of the mortgage
loans permit transfers by the related borrower of the Mortgaged Property to purchasers who would then assume the related mortgage
loan subject to the reasonable acceptability of the transferee to the mortgagee and the satisfaction of certain conditions provided
in the related loan documents. Certain of the Mortgaged Properties have been, or may become, subject to additional financing. See
“—Additional Debt” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Exceptions to the “Due-On-Sale”
provisions may include, but are not limited to:
 

·transfers related to family and estate planning,
 

·transfers related to the death or physical or mental disability of holder,
 

·transfers of a passive interest or less than a controlling interest in the borrower,
 

·transfers to affiliates of, or persons otherwise related to, the borrower or transferor,
 

·transfers among existing members, partners, shareholders or beneficiary owners in the borrower or between holders of tenant-in-common
interests in the Mortgaged Property,
 

·transfers in connection with mergers, consolidations and similar transactions involving affiliated companies,
 

S-207
 
 

·transfers (including mergers, consolidations and similar transactions) involving publicly traded entities,
 

·transfers of stock listed on a nationally recognized stock exchange,
 

·transfers among affiliated borrowers with respect to any multi-property mortgage loans,
 

·transfers which consolidate tenant-in-common ownership into one or more surviving tenant-in-common borrowers,
 

·transfers related to conversions of a borrower entity form, including drop-down distributions or entity conversions resulting
from a borrower structured as (or converted to) a Delaware statutory trust and certain triggering conditions that may require or
necessitate such transfers,
 

·transfers of tenant-in-common interests or beneficial interests in a Delaware statutory trust to third parties, subject in
some cases to lender approval if such transfers are in excess of specified thresholds,
 

·transfers to a pre-approved person or entity or an entity controlled by a pre-approved person or entity,
 

·transfers to any person or entity so long as certain specified persons or entities, or persons or entities satisfying specified
criteria, remain in control or acquire control of the day to day operations of the borrower,
 

·transfers to certain qualifying entities, which entities generally are required to satisfy, or be under the control of other
entities that satisfy, specified criteria, such as net worth and/or experience related tests and satisfy conditions specified in
the mortgage loan documents but for which lender consent may not be required,
 

·transfers related to the foreclosure of existing or permitted mezzanine debt,
 

·transfers as to which a Rating Agency Confirmation is obtained, or
 

·other transfers customarily acceptable to prudent commercial and multifamily mortgage lending institutions with respect to
comparable property and transfers of a similar nature to the foregoing meeting the requirements of the mortgage loan documents.
 
The special servicer will determine, in
a manner consistent with the Servicing Standard, whether (a) to exercise any right it may have with respect to a mortgage
loan or related Companion Loan containing a “due-on-sale” clause (1) to accelerate the payments on that mortgage
loan, or (2) to withhold its consent to any sale or transfer, consistent with the Servicing Standard or (b) to waive
its right to exercise such rights; provided, however, that with respect to such waiver of rights, if (i) prior to the occurrence
and continuance of any Control Event, the special servicer has obtained the prior written consent (or deemed consent) of the
Directing Certificateholder (or after the occurrence and continuance of a Control Event, but prior to a Consultation Termination
Event, upon consultation with the Directing Certificateholder), and (iii) with respect to any mortgage loan (x) with
a Stated Principal Balance greater than or equal to $20,000,000, (y) with a Stated Principal Balance greater than or equal
to 5% of the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the mortgage loans then outstanding, and (z) together with all other mortgage
loans with which it is cross-collateralized or cross-defaulted or together with all other mortgage loans with the same or an affiliated
borrower, that is one of the ten largest mortgage loans outstanding (by Stated Principal Balance), a Rating Agency Confirmation
is received by the special servicer from the four NRSROs engaged by the depositor to rate the Offered Certificates (collectively,
the “Rating Agencies”) and confirmation from the applicable rating agencies that such action will not result
in the downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of its then current ratings of any securities related to a Serviced Pari Passu Companion
Loan (provided that such rating agency confirmation may be considered satisfied in the same manner as any Rating Agency
Confirmation may be considered satisfied with respect to the certificates as described in this free writing prospectus); provided,
however, that with respect to clauses (y) and (z) of this paragraph, such mortgage loan will also be required to have
a Stated Principal Balance of at least $10,000,000 for such Rating Agency Confirmation requirement to apply.
 

S-208
 
 
With respect to a mortgage loan with a “due-on-encumbrance”
clause, the special servicer will determine, in a manner consistent with the Servicing Standard, whether to (a) exercise any
right it may have with respect to a mortgage loan or any related Companion Loan containing a “due-on-encumbrance” clause
(1) to accelerate the payments thereon, or (2) to withhold its consent to the creation of any additional lien or other
encumbrance, consistent with the Servicing Standard or (b) waive its right to exercise such rights; provided that,
(i) the special servicer has obtained, prior to the occurrence and continuance of any Control Event and other than with respect
to an Excluded Loan, the prior written consent or the deemed consent of the Directing Certificateholder, and (ii)  the special
servicer has received a Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency if such mortgage loan (1) has an outstanding principal
balance that is greater than or equal to 2% of the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the mortgage loans or (2) has a loan-to-value
ratio greater than 85% (including any existing and proposed debt) or (3) has a debt service coverage ratio less than 1.20x
(in each case, determined based upon the aggregate of the Stated Principal Balance of the mortgage loan and related Companion Loan,
if any, and the principal amount of the proposed additional loan) or (4) is one of the ten largest mortgage loans (by Stated
Principal Balance) or (5) has a Stated Principal Balance over $20,000,000; provided, however, that with respect to
clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4), such mortgage loan must also have a Stated Principal Balance of at least $10,000,000 for such
Rating Agency Confirmation to apply.
 
Any Rating Agency Confirmations and any
similar confirmation from a rating agency with respect to any class of securities backed, wholly or partially, by any Serviced
Pari Passu Companion Loan described above will be at the related borrower’s expense, to the extent permitted by the related
mortgage loan documents; provided that to the extent the mortgage loan documents are silent as to who bears the costs of
any such confirmation, the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, is required to use reasonable efforts to have
the related borrower bear such costs and expenses. Unless determined to be nonrecoverable, any such costs not collected from the
related borrower will be required to be advanced as a Servicing Advance.
 
The existence of any additional indebtedness
may increase the difficulty of refinancing the related mortgage loan at its maturity date or Anticipated Repayment Date, as applicable,
and increase the possibility that reduced cash flow could result in deferred maintenance. Also, if the holder of the additional
debt has filed for bankruptcy or been placed in involuntary receivership, foreclosure of the related mortgage loan could be delayed.
See “Risk Factors—Additional Debt or the Ability To Incur Other Borrowings Entails Risk” and “Certain
Legal Aspects of the Mortgage Loans” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Hazard, Liability and
Other Insurance
 
The mortgage loans generally require that
each Mortgaged Property be insured by a hazard insurance policy in an amount (subject to an approved deductible, which may be a
large amount in the case of certain mortgage loans) at least equal to the lesser of (a) the outstanding principal balance
of the related mortgage loan and (b) 100% of the replacement cost of the improvements located on the related Mortgaged Property,
and if applicable, that the related hazard insurance policy contain appropriate endorsements or have been issued in an amount sufficient
to avoid the application of co-insurance and not permit reduction in insurance proceeds for depreciation; provided that
in the case of certain of the mortgage loans, the hazard insurance may be in such other amounts as was required by the applicable
mortgage loan seller and, in some cases, may be significantly less than the outstanding principal amount of the mortgage loan.
Moreover, with respect to certain of the mortgage loans insured for less than the full principal balance, applicable zoning ordinances
may prevent restoration of the use or prevent or limit rebuilding of the related Mortgaged Properties to their current condition
under certain circumstances. Certain mortgage loans permit a borrower to satisfy its insurance coverage requirement by permitting
its tenant to self-insure or permitting its tenant or a condominium association or a hotel franchiser to provide insurance for
its premises. In some cases, even where a tenant self-insures, a lease may be terminated based on a material casualty or condemnation,
particularly near the end of the lease term. In some cases, required insurance is provided under a blanket policy that also insures
properties that do not secure mortgage loans included in this securitization. See “Risk Factors—Risks Associated
with Blanket Insurance Policies or Self-Insurance” in this free writing prospectus.
 

S-209
 
 
In general, the standard form of hazard
insurance policy covers physical damage to, or destruction of, the improvements on the Mortgaged Property by fire, lightning, explosion,
smoke, windstorm and hail, riot or strike and civil commotion, subject to the deductibles, conditions and exclusions set forth
in each policy. Each mortgage loan generally also requires the related borrower to maintain general liability insurance against
claims for personal and bodily injury, death or property damage occurring on, in or about the related Mortgaged Property in an
amount generally equal to at least $1,000,000 per occurrence. Although the policies covering the Mortgaged Properties will be underwritten
by different insurers under different state laws in accordance with different applicable state forms, and therefore will not contain
identical terms and conditions, most policies typically do not cover any physical damage resulting from war, revolution, governmental
actions, floods and other water-related causes, earth movement (including earthquakes, landslides and mudflows), wet or dry rot,
vermin, domestic animals and certain other kinds of risks. Accordingly, a Mortgaged Property may not be insured for losses arising
from such causes unless the related Mortgage specifically requires, or permits the mortgagee to require, that coverage. Each mortgage
loan generally further requires the related borrower to maintain business interruption insurance in an amount not less than approximately
100% of the gross rental income from the related Mortgaged Property for not less than 12 months. In addition, some mortgage loans
permit the related borrower to satisfy its obligations to insure the related Mortgaged Property by relying on a tenant or condominium
association to obtain the insurance or permit a tenant to self-insure. See representation numbers 18 and 31 on Annex D-1
to this free writing prospectus and the exceptions to those representations on Annex D-2 to this free writing prospectus.
 
In general, the mortgage loans do not require
earthquake insurance. In particular, fifty-two (52) Mortgaged Properties identified as “U-Haul Portfolio – Inglewood”,
“U-Haul Portfolio – South Central”, “U-Haul Portfolio – Summer Ave”, “U-Haul Portfolio
– Milwaukie”, “U-Haul Portfolio – Gresham”, “U-Haul Portfolio – Midway”, “U-Haul

and “Summer Wind Apartments” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing or partially securing twenty-eight
(28) mortgage loans representing approximately 9.9% of the Initial Pool Balance by allocated loan amount, are located in an area
that is considered a high earthquake risk (seismic zone 3 or 4). These areas include, without limitation, all or parts of the States
of California, Arizona, Arkansas, Utah, Tennessee, Washington, Idaho, Missouri or Oregon. A seismic report was prepared with respect
to the Mortgaged Properties, and based on those reports, no Mortgaged Property has a probable maximum loss in excess of 19%.
 
See “Risk Factors—Availability
of Earthquake, Flood and Other Insurance” in this free writing prospectus for information regarding earthquake insurance
coverage.
 
With respect to hazard, liability and other
insurances required by the mortgage loans included in the trust, we note in particular the following:
 

·Several additional mortgage loans provide for waivers of, or other limitations on, the requirement to maintain terrorism insurance,
and/or permit a tenant to maintain the required insurance coverage with respect to the related Mortgaged Property or to self-insure
or allow for a deductible 
 

S-210
 
 

for such policy, which may be substantial in certain cases. With respect to two (2) Mortgaged Properties
identified as “Civic Opera Building” and “Waterstone Apartments” on Annex A-1 to this free writing
prospectus, securing two (2) mortgage loans representing approximately 9.2% of the Initial Pool Balance, the related mortgage loan
documents place a cap on the related borrower’s out-of-pocket cost for terrorism insurance premiums at two (2) times the
then-current premium for the property insurance policy on a stand-alone basis.
 

·With respect to four (4) Mortgaged Properties identified as “CVS Portfolio” and “Behringer Tractor Supply
Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing two (2) mortgage loans representing approximately 0.7%
of the Initial Pool Balance, each related borrower is permitted to rely on the insurance required by the related sole tenant in
accordance with the terms of its lease so long as no event of default exists under the applicable lease, which lease permits the
sole tenant to self-insure.
 

·With respect to fifteen (15) Mortgaged Properties identified as “Chow Triple Net Retail Portfolio I” on Annex A-1
to this free writing prospectus, securing one (1) mortgage loan representing approximately 1.3% of the Initial Pool Balance, provided
the tenants are paying insurance premiums and maintaining insurance at such mortgaged property set forth in the applicable lease,
the borrower is not obligated to maintain such insurance or to make monthly deposits into the tax and insurance escrow fund.

and 31 on Annex D-1 to this free writing prospectus and the exceptions to those representations on Annex D-2 to this
free writing prospectus.
 
Additional Mortgage Loan
Information
 
The tables presented in Annex A-2 set
forth certain anticipated characteristics of the mortgage loans and the Mortgaged Properties. For purposes of the information contained
in this free writing prospectus (including in Annexes A-1, Annex A-2 and Annex A-3), unless otherwise indicated, the Subordinate
Companion Loan is not reflected in this free writing prospectus and the term “mortgage loan” does not include any related
Subordinate Companion Loan. For purposes of the presentation of numbers and statistical information set forth in this free writing
prospectus, unless otherwise noted, all numbers and statistical information regarding the mortgage loans that are part of a Whole
Loan include any related Pari Passu Companion Loan(s), but exclude any related Subordinate Companion Loan. The sum in any column
in the tables presented in Annex A-2 to this free writing prospectus may not equal the indicated total due to rounding. The
descriptions in this free writing prospectus of the mortgage loans and the Mortgaged Properties are based upon the pool of mortgage
loans as it is expected to be constituted as of the close of business on the Closing Date, assuming that (1) all scheduled
principal and/or interest payments due on or before the Cut-off Date will be made and (2) there will be no principal prepayments
on or before the Cut-off Date.
 
Prior to the issuance of the certificates,
one or more mortgage loans (including mortgage loans specifically described in this free writing prospectus) may be removed from
the pool of mortgage loans as a result of prepayments, delinquencies, incomplete documentation or for any other reason, if the
depositor or the mortgage loan sellers deem the removal necessary, appropriate or desirable. A limited number of other mortgage
loans may be included in the pool of mortgage loans prior to the issuance of the certificates, unless including those mortgage
loans would materially alter the characteristics of the pool of mortgage loans as described in this free writing prospectus. The
depositor believes that the information set forth in this free writing prospectus will be representative of the characteristics
of the pool of mortgage loans as it will be constituted at the time the certificates are issued, although the range of Mortgage
Rates and maturities as well as other characteristics of the mortgage loans described in this free writing prospectus may vary.
 
With respect to mortgage loans secured by
more than one Mortgaged Property, the information presented in this free writing prospectus with respect to UW NCF Debt Yield,
UW NCF DSCR and LTV Ratios, as applicable, is the UW NCF Debt Yield, UW NCF DSCR or LTV Ratio of the mortgage loan
 

S-211
 
 
based on all
of the related Mortgaged Properties collectively. The UW NCF Debt Yield, UW NCF DSCR and LTV Ratio for any loan or allocated loan
amount comprising a portion of these mortgage loans will vary from the UW NCF Debt Yield, UW NCF DSCR and LTV Ratio shown. See
Annex A-1 for the UW NOI and UW NCF for each loan or allocated loan amount comprising these mortgage loans.
 
For purposes of the statistical information
in this free writing prospectus, with respect to each mortgage loan that is part of a Whole Loan, we generally present the LTV
Ratios, UW NCF DSCR and UW NCF Debt Yield per net rentable square foot, pad, room or unit, as applicable, in this free writing
prospectus in a manner that takes account of that mortgage loan and its related Pari Passu Companion Loan(s), but exclude any related
Subordinate Companion Loan. Other than as specifically noted, the LTV Ratios, UW NCF DSCR, UW NCF Debt Yield and the mortgage loan
rate information for each mortgage loan is presented in this free writing prospectus without regard to any other indebtedness (whether
or not secured by the related mortgaged property, ownership interests in the related borrower or otherwise) that currently exists
or that may be incurred by the related borrower or its owners in the future, in order to present statistics for the related mortgage
loan without combination with the other indebtedness.
 
Whenever percentages and other information
in this free writing prospectus are presented on the Mortgaged Property level rather than the mortgage loan level, the information
for mortgage loans secured by more than one Mortgaged Property (or within a group of cross-collateralized mortgage loans) is based
on allocated loan amounts as stated in Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus.
 
A current report on Form 8-K (the “Form 8-K”)
will be available to purchasers of the Offered Certificates contemporaneously with the filing of the final prospectus supplement
and will be filed, together with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the underwriting agreement and the Purchase Agreements, with
the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). If mortgage loans are removed from or added
to the pool of mortgage loans as set forth above, the removal or addition will be noted in the Form 8-K.
 
For a detailed presentation of certain characteristics
of the mortgage loans and the Mortgaged Properties on an individual basis, see Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus.
All of the numerical information included in this free writing prospectus is presented on an approximate basis and any sums presented
may not equal the indicated total due to rounding.
 
“Occupancy” means the
percentage of square feet, units, rooms, or pads, as the case may be, of a Mortgaged Property that were occupied or leased as of
or, in the case of certain properties, average units or rooms so occupied over a specified period ending on, a specified date (identified
on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus as the “Occupancy Date”). The Occupancy may have been obtained
from the borrower, as derived from the Mortgaged Property’s rent rolls, operating statements or appraisals or as determined
by a site inspection of such Mortgaged Property.
 
The “Underwritten Net Cash Flow
Debt Service Coverage Ratio” or “UW NCF DSCR” for any mortgage loan for any period, as presented in
this free writing prospectus, including the tables presented on Annex A-1 and Annex A-2 attached to this free writing
prospectus, is the ratio of Underwritten Net Cash Flow calculated for the related Mortgaged Property to the amount of total annual
debt service on such mortgage loan except that the Underwritten Net Cash Flow Debt Service Coverage Ratio for all partial interest-only
loans, if any, was calculated based on the first principal and interest payment required to be made into the trust fund during
the term of the loan. The Underwritten Net Cash Flow Debt Service Coverage Ratio for all interest-only loans were calculated based
on the sum of the first 12 interest payments following the Cut-off Date. With respect to any mortgage loan cross-collateralized
with other mortgage loans, the Underwritten Net Cash Flow Debt Service Coverage Ratio is the ratio of the Underwritten Net Cash
Flow calculated for the Mortgaged Properties related to the cross-collateralized group to the total annual debt service for all
of the mortgage loans in the cross-collateralized group. The Underwritten Net Cash Flow Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the mortgage
loan identified as “U-Haul Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus was calculated based on the average
of the first 12 principal and interest payments following the Cut-off Date listed on the assumed principal payment schedule set
forth on Annex F to this free writing prospectus.
 

S-212
 
 
The “Underwritten Net Operating
Income Debt Service Coverage Ratio” or “UW NOI DSCR” for any mortgage loan for any period, as presented
in this free writing prospectus, including the tables presented on Annex A-1 and Annex A-2 attached to this free writing
prospectus, is the ratio of Underwritten NOI calculated for the related Mortgaged Property to the amount of total annual debt service
on such mortgage loan except that the Underwritten Net Operating Income Debt Service Coverage Ratio for all partial interest-only
loans, if any, was calculated based on the first principal and interest payment required to be made into the trust fund during
the term of the loan. The Underwritten Net Operating Income Debt Service Coverage Ratio for all interest-only loans were calculated
based on the sum of the first 12 interest payments following the Cut-off Date. With respect to any mortgage loan cross-collateralized
with other mortgage loans, the Underwritten Net Operating Income Debt Service Coverage Ratio is the ratio of the Underwritten NOI
calculated for the Mortgaged Properties related to the cross-collateralized group to the total annual debt service for all of the
mortgage loans in the cross-collateralized group. The Underwritten Net Operating Income Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the mortgage
loan identified as “U-Haul Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus was calculated based on the average
of the first 12 principal and interest payments following the Cut-off Date listed on the assumed principal payment schedule set
forth on Annex F to this free writing prospectus.
 
The “UW NCF Debt Yield”
or “UW NCF DY” for any mortgage loan is calculated by dividing (x) the UW NCF for such mortgage loan by
(y) the Cut-off Date Balance for such mortgage loan. With respect to any mortgage loan cross-collateralized with other mortgage
loans, the UW NCF Debt Yield is calculated by dividing (x) the aggregate UW NCF of each mortgage loan comprising the cross-collateralized
group of mortgage loans by (y) the aggregate Cut-off Date Balance of such mortgage loans.
 
The “UW NOI Debt Yield”
or “UW NOI DY” for any mortgage loan is calculated by dividing (x) the UW NOI for such mortgage loan by
(y) the Cut-off Date Balance for such mortgage loan. With respect to any mortgage loan cross-collateralized with other mortgage
loans, the UW NOI Debt Yield is calculated by dividing (x) the aggregate UW NOI of each mortgage loan comprising the cross-collateralized
group of mortgage loans by (y) the aggregate Cut-off Date Balance of such mortgage loans.
 
The “UW NOI Debt Yield”
with respect to any class of certificates is calculated by dividing (x) the aggregate UW NOI for the pool of mortgage loans
by (y) the aggregate Certificate Balance of such class of certificates and all classes of certificates senior to such class
of certificates (or, in the case of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5 or Class A-SB
certificates, the aggregate Certificate Balances of such certificates). Although the UW NOI for the pool of mortgage loans is based
on an aggregate of the mortgage loans, excess cash flow available from any particular mortgage loan will not be available to support
any other mortgage loan.
 
The “Underwritten Net Cash Flow”
or “UW NCF” for any Mortgaged Property means the Underwritten NOI for such Mortgaged Property decreased by an
amount that the related mortgage loan seller has determined to be an appropriate allowance for average annual tenant improvements
and leasing commissions and/or replacement reserves for capital items based upon its underwriting guidelines.
 
“Underwritten NOI” or
“UW NOI” for any Mortgaged Property means the net operating income for such Mortgaged Property as determined
by the related mortgage loan seller in accordance with its underwriting guidelines for similar properties. Operating revenues from
a Mortgaged Property (“Effective Gross Income”) are generally calculated as follows: rental revenue is calculated
using actual rental rates or, in some cases, estimates in the appraisal, which are usually derived from historical results, but
which may include anticipated revenues from newly executed contracts, in some cases adjusted downward to market rates or upward
to account for contractual rent increases that are specified in a tenant’s lease or contract (as deemed appropriate by the
applicable mortgage loan seller in light of the circumstances), with vacancy rates equal to the related Mortgaged Property’s
historical rate, the market rate or an assumed vacancy rate (or that are effective in a lease renewal option period that a tenant
has orally indicated its intent to exercise as deemed appropriate by the applicable mortgage loan seller in light of the circumstances);
other revenue, such as parking fees, laundry fees and other income items are included only if supported by a trend and/or are likely
to be recurring. In some cases, the related mortgage loan seller included in the operating revenues rents otherwise payable by
a tenant in occupancy of its space but for the existence of an initial or periodic “free rent” period, reduced rent
period or a permitted rent
 

S-213
 
 
abatement, or rents payable by a tenant that is not in occupancy but has executed a lease, for which
(in any of the foregoing cases) the related mortgage loan seller may have reserved funds as deemed appropriate by the applicable
mortgage loan seller in light of the circumstances. Operating expenses generally reflect the related Mortgaged Property’s
historical expenses, adjusted in some cases to account for inflation, significant occupancy increases and a market rate management
fee. However, some operating expenses are based on the budget of the borrower or the appraiser’s estimate.
 
The Underwritten NOI for each Mortgaged
Property is calculated on the basis of numerous assumptions and subjective judgments, which, if ultimately proven erroneous, could
cause the actual operating income for such Mortgaged Property to differ materially from the Underwritten NOI set forth in this
free writing prospectus. Some assumptions and subjective judgments are related to future events, conditions and circumstances,
including future expense levels and the re-leasing of occupied space, which will be affected by a variety of complex factors over
which none of the trust, the depositor, the sponsors, the mortgage loan sellers, the master servicer, the special servicer, the
certificate administrator or the trustee has control. In some cases, the Underwritten NOI for any Mortgaged Property is higher,
and may be materially higher, than the actual annual net operating income for that Mortgaged Property, based on historical operating
statements. No guaranty can be given with respect to the accuracy of the information provided by any borrowers, or the adequacy
of the procedures used by a mortgage loan seller in determining the relevant operating information. See “Risk Factors—Risks
Relating to Underwritten Net Cash Flow” in this free writing prospectus. The mortgage loan amount used in this free writing
prospectus for purposes of calculating the loan-to-value ratios, debt service coverage ratios and debt yields for each Whole Loan
is the aggregate principal balance of the related mortgage loan and the related Pari Passu Companion Loan(s), but not any related
Subordinate Companion Loan. Further, in the case of three (3) Mortgaged Properties identified as “780 Dedham Street”,
“One Park Centre” and “International Design Center” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus,
securing three (3) mortgage loans, representing approximately 1.6% of the Initial Pool Balance by allocated loan amount, certain
tenants among the five (5) largest tenants (based on net rentable area leased) at the respective related Mortgaged Properties or
tenants, which in the aggregate constitute a significant portion of the Mortgaged Property, have executed leases but are not currently
fully occupying the related space and/or not paying full contractual rent and/or are entitled to periodic rent abatements (which
in some cases were not reserved for). In certain cases, the UW NOI includes rent from those tenants (without deduction for abated
rent) even though the related tenants are not paying full contractual rent or are paying reduced or no rent or will receive such
periodic rent abatements. In certain cases, the related lender has reserved funds for rent abatements and/or tenant build-outs
at the related space. We cannot assure you that any of those tenants will occupy its respective space and/or pay rent as required
under its respective lease. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Net Cash Flow and Certain Underwriting Considerations”
in this free writing prospectus, as well as Annex A-1 and “Description of Top Ten Mortgage Loans and Additional Mortgage
Loan Information” in Annex A-3 to this free writing prospectus, for additional information.
 
The amounts representing net operating income,
Underwritten NOI and Underwritten Net Cash Flow are not a substitute for or an improvement upon net income, as determined in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, as a measure of the results of the Mortgaged Property’s operations or a substitute
for cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as a measure
of liquidity. No representation is made as to the future cash flow of the Mortgaged Properties, nor are the net operating income,
Underwritten NOI and Underwritten Net Cash Flow set forth in this free writing prospectus intended to represent such future cash
flow.
 
The UW NCFs and UW NOIs used as a basis
for calculating the UW NCF DSCRs presented in this free writing prospectus, including the tables presented on Annex A-1 and
Annex A-2, were derived principally from operating statements obtained from the respective borrowers (the “Operating
Statements”) and appraiser’s estimates. With respect to mortgage loans secured by newly constructed or recently
acquired Mortgaged Properties, the UW NCFs used as a basis for calculating UW NCF DSCRs are derived principally from rent rolls,
tenant leases and the borrowers’ appraisers’ projected expense levels. In certain cases when the information is available,
UW NCFs for newly constructed or recently acquired Mortgaged Properties are based on historical data provided by the borrower.
The Operating Statements and rent rolls were not audited and in most cases were not prepared in accordance with
 

S-214
 
 
generally accepted
accounting principles. To increase the level of consistency between the Operating Statements and rent rolls, in some instances,
adjustments were made to such Operating Statements. As regards expenses, these adjustments were principally for real estate tax
and insurance expenses (e.g., adjusting for the payment of two years of expenses in one year), and to eliminate obvious
items not related to the operation of the Mortgaged Property. However, such adjustments were subjective in nature and may not have
been made in a uniform manner.
 
The tables presented in Annex A-2 that
are entitled “Cut-off Date LTV Ratios” and “Maturity Date LTV Ratios” set forth the range
of LTV Ratios of the mortgage loans as of the Cut-off Date and the stated maturity dates (or, if applicable, the Anticipated Repayment
Date), respectively, of the related mortgage loans, respectively. An “LTV Ratio” for any mortgage loan, as of
any date of determination, is a fraction, expressed as a percentage, the numerator of which is the scheduled principal balance
of the mortgage loan as of that date (assuming no defaults or prepayments on the mortgage loan prior to that date), and the denominator
of which is the “as-is” appraised value of the related Mortgaged Property or Mortgaged Properties, as applicable (or,
with respect to the Mortgaged Properties identified as “Hilton Suites Chicago Magnificent Mile”, “Civic Opera
Building”, “One Shell Square”, “Hilton Atlanta Perimeter”, “Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio”
and “Langhorne Shopping Center” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, the hypothetical appraised value
as described under “—Assessments of Property Value and Condition—Appraisals” in this free writing
prospectus) as determined by an appraisal of the Mortgaged Property obtained at or about the time of the origination of the related
mortgage loan. In the event that a mortgage loan is cross-collateralized with other mortgage loans, the LTV Ratio is the fraction,
expressed as a percentage, the numerator of which is the scheduled principal balance of all the mortgage loans in the cross-collateralized
group and the denominator of which is the aggregate of the appraised values of all the Mortgaged Properties related to the cross-collateralized
group. The LTV Ratio as of the related maturity date or, if applicable, the Anticipated Repayment Date, set forth in Annex A-2
was calculated based on the principal balance of the related mortgage loan on the related maturity date or Anticipated Repayment
Date, as the case may be, assuming all principal payments required to be made on or prior to the related maturity date or, if applicable,
the Anticipated Repayment Date, (in either case, not including the balloon payment) are made. In addition, because it is based
on the value of a Mortgaged Property determined as of loan origination, the information set forth in this free writing prospectus
in Annex A-1 and in Annex A-2 is not necessarily a reliable measure of the related borrower’s current equity in
each Mortgaged Property. In a declining real estate market, the appraised value of a Mortgaged Property could have decreased from
the appraised value determined at origination and the current actual LTV Ratio of a mortgage loan and the LTV Ratio at maturity
may be higher than its LTV Ratio at origination even after taking into account amortization since origination. See “Risk
Factors—Limitations of Appraisals” in this free writing prospectus.
 
The characteristics described above and
in Annex A-2, along with certain additional characteristics of the mortgage loans presented on a loan-by-loan basis, are set
forth in Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus. Certain additional information regarding the mortgage loans is set forth
in this free writing prospectus below under “Certain Legal Aspects of the Mortgage Loans” and “Transaction

As provided in the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, the custodian is required to review each Mortgage File within a specified period following its receipt of such Mortgage
File. If any of the above-
 

S-216
 
 
described documents is found during the course of such review to be missing from any Mortgage File or
defective, and in either case such omission or defect materially and adversely affects the value of the applicable mortgage loan,
the value of the related Mortgaged Property or the interests of the Certificateholders in the mortgage loan or Mortgaged Property,
the applicable mortgage loan seller, if it cannot deliver the document or cure the defect (other than omissions solely due to a
document not having been returned by the related recording office) within a period of 90 days (which, in certain circumstances,
may be extended to 180 days) following such mortgage loan seller’s receipt of notice thereof, will be obligated pursuant
to the applicable Purchase Agreement to (1) repurchase the affected mortgage loan within such 90-day period (or extended period)
for the Purchase Price or (2) substitute a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan (other than with respect to the Whole Loans
for which no substitution will be permitted) for such mortgage loan and pay a shortfall amount within such 90-day period (or extended
period). See “—Representations and Warranties; Repurchases and Substitutions” below.
 
The Pooling and Servicing Agreement requires
that the certificate administrator take the actions specified in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement necessary to maintain the
security interest of the trust in the mortgage loans. In addition, the custodian is required to maintain custody of the Mortgage
File for each mortgage loan.
 
Representations and Warranties;
Repurchases and Substitutions
 
In the related Purchase Agreement, it is
anticipated that each mortgage loan seller will make the representations and warranties set forth in Annex D-1 to this free
writing prospectus as of the Closing Date, or as of another date specifically provided in the representation and warranty, with
respect to each mortgage loan sold by that mortgage loan seller, subject to certain exceptions to such representations and warranties
set forth in Annex D-2 to this free writing prospectus.
 
In addition, the related Purchase Agreements
provide that, with respect to each Non-Serviced Whole Loan, if a “material document defect” exists under the related
Non-Serviced PSA, and the related seller repurchases the related Non-Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan(s) from the trust formed
under the applicable Non-Serviced PSA, such seller is required to repurchase the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan; provided,
however, that no such repurchase obligation will apply to any material document defect related solely to the promissory notes
for any related Pari Passu Companion Loans contained in a trust formed under the applicable Non-Serviced PSA.
 
Any disclosures in this free writing prospectus
that are contrary to the representations and warranties included in Annex D-1 should also be considered exceptions thereto.
 
If the related mortgage loan seller has
been notified of a breach of any of the representations and warranties included in Annex D-1 or of a document defect that
in any case materially and adversely affects the value of a mortgage loan, the value of the related Mortgaged Property or the interests
of the Certificateholders in the mortgage loan, and if the related mortgage loan seller cannot cure the breach or defect within
a period of 90 days following (x) except in the case of the succeeding clause (y), such mortgage loan seller’s
receipt of that notice or, (y) in the case of a breach or a defect that would cause the mortgage loan not to be a “qualified
mortgage” within the meaning of Code Section 860G(a)(3), but without regard to the rule of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(f)(2)
that causes a defective mortgage loan to be treated as a qualified mortgage, the earlier of (A) the mortgage loan seller’s
discovery of the breach or defect, or (B) discovery of such breach or defect by any other party identified in the Purchase
Agreement, provided the mortgage loan seller has received prompt written notice of such breach or defect (such 90-day period, the
“Initial Resolution Period”), then the related mortgage loan seller will be obligated pursuant to the related
Purchase Agreement (the relevant rights under which will be assigned, together with the mortgage loans sold thereunder, to the
trustee), to (a) repurchase the affected mortgage loan (or any related REO Loan) within the Initial Resolution Period (or
with respect to certain breaches or document defects, an extended cure period), at a price (the “Purchase Price”)
equal to the sum of (1) the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loan (or related REO Loan) (excluding, for such
purpose, any related Companion Loan, if applicable), as of the date of purchase, (2) all accrued and unpaid interest on the
mortgage loan (or the related REO Loan) (excluding, for such
 

S-217
 
 
purpose, any related Companion Loan, if applicable) at the related
Mortgage Rate in effect from time to time (excluding any portion of such interest that represents default interest or Excess Interest
on any ARD Loan), to, but not including, the due date immediately preceding the Determination Date for the Due Period of purchase,
(3) all related unreimbursed Servicing Advances plus accrued and unpaid interest on all related Advances at the Reimbursement
Rate, Special Servicing Fees (whether paid or unpaid) and any other additional trust fund expenses (except for Liquidation Fees)
in respect of the mortgage loan (or related REO Loan, if any) in the manner provided for under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
(4) solely in the case of a repurchase or substitution by a mortgage loan seller, all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses reasonably
incurred or to be incurred by the master servicer, the special servicer, the depositor, the certificate administrator or the trustee
in respect of the breach or document defect giving rise to the repurchase or substitution obligation, including any expenses arising
out of the enforcement of the repurchase or substitution obligation, including, without limitation, legal fees and expenses and
any additional trust expenses relating to such mortgage loan (or related REO Loan), and (5) Liquidation Fees, if any, payable with
respect to the affected mortgage loan (which will not include any Liquidation Fees if such affected mortgage loan is repurchased
prior to the expiration of the Extended Resolution Period), or (b) within 2 years following the Closing Date, substitute
a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan (other than with respect to the related Whole Loans, for which no substitution will be permitted)
and pay any shortfall amount equal to the difference between the Purchase Price of the mortgage loan calculated as of the date
of substitution and the scheduled principal balance of the Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan as of the due date in the month of
substitution; provided, however, that the applicable mortgage loan seller generally has an additional 90-day period (the
“Extended Resolution Period”) immediately following the expiration of the Initial Resolution Period to cure
the breach or defect (or, failing such cure, to repurchase the related mortgage loan or REO Loan (excluding any related Companion
Loan, if applicable) or, if applicable, substitute a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan as described below) (other than with respect
to the related Whole Loans, for which no substitution will be permitted) if it is diligently proceeding toward that cure, and has
delivered to the master servicer, the special servicer, the certificate administrator (who will promptly deliver a copy of such
officer’s certificate to the 17g-5 Information Provider), the trustee, the senior trust advisor and, prior to the occurrence
of a Consultation Termination Event, the Directing Certificateholder, an officer’s certificate that describes the reasons
that a cure was not effected within the Initial Resolution Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the actions specified in (a)
and (b) of the preceding sentence must be taken within 90 days following the earlier of the mortgage loan seller’s receipt
of notice or discovery of a breach or document defect, with no extension, if such breach or document defect would cause the mortgage
loan not to be a “qualified mortgage” within the meaning of Code Section 860G(a)(3). No delay in either the discovery
of a document defect or a breach of a representation or warranty on the part of any party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
in providing notice of such defect or breach will relieve the applicable mortgage loan seller of its obligation to repurchase the
related mortgage loan unless (i) the mortgage loan seller did not otherwise discover or have knowledge of such breach or defect,
(ii) such delay is the result of the failure by a party to the applicable Purchase Agreement or the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement to provide prompt notice as required by the terms of the applicable Purchase Agreement or the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
after such party has actual knowledge of such defect or breach (knowledge will not be deemed to exist by reason of the custodian’s
exception report) and (iii) such delay precludes the mortgage loan seller from curing such defect or breach. The master servicer
(in the case of non-Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans) or the special servicer (in the case of Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans)
will be required, for the benefit of the Certificateholders and the trustee, to enforce the obligations of the applicable mortgage
loan seller under the applicable Purchase Agreement.
 
A “Qualified Substitute Mortgage
Loan” is a substitute mortgage loan (other than with respect to the pari passu Whole Loans, for which no substitution
will be permitted) replacing a Mortgage Loan with respect to which a material breach or document defect exists that must, on the
date of substitution: (a) have an outstanding principal balance, after application of all scheduled payments of principal
and interest due during or prior to the month of substitution, whether or not received, not in excess of the Stated Principal Balance
of the deleted mortgage loan as of the due date in the calendar month during which the substitution occurs; (b) have a Mortgage
Rate not less than the Mortgage Rate of the deleted mortgage loan; (c) have the same due date and a grace period no longer
than that of the deleted mortgage loan; (d) accrue interest on the same basis as the deleted mortgage loan (for example, on
the
 

S-218
 
 
basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months); (e) have a remaining term to stated maturity not greater
than, and not more than two years less than, the remaining term to stated maturity of the deleted mortgage loan; (f) have
a then-current loan-to-value ratio equal to or less than the lesser of (i) the loan-to-value ratio for the deleted mortgage
loan as of the Closing Date and (ii) 75%, in each case using a “value” for the Mortgaged Property as determined
using an appraisal conducted by a member of the Appraisal Institute (“MAI”) prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the FIRREA; (g) comply (except in a manner that would not be adverse to the interests of the Certificateholders)
as of the date of substitution in all material respects with all of the representations and warranties set forth in the related
Purchase Agreement; (h) have an environmental report that indicates no material adverse environmental conditions with respect
to the related Mortgaged Property that will be delivered as a part of the related Mortgage File; (i) have a then-current DSCR
at least equal to the greater of (i) the original DSCR of the deleted mortgage loan as of the Closing Date and (ii) 1.25x;
(j) constitute a “qualified replacement mortgage” within the meaning of Code Section 860G(a)(4) as evidenced
by an opinion of counsel (provided at the applicable mortgage loan seller’s expense); (k) not have a maturity date or
an amortization period that extends to a date that is after the date two years prior to the Rated Final Distribution Date; (l) have
comparable prepayment restrictions to those of the deleted mortgage loan; (m) not be substituted for a deleted mortgage loan
unless the trustee and the certificate administrator have received a Rating Agency Confirmation from each of the Rating Agencies
(the cost, if any, of obtaining such Rating Agency Confirmation to be paid by the applicable mortgage loan seller); (n) have
been approved, so long as a Control Event has not occurred and is not continuing, by the Directing Certificateholder; (o) prohibit
Defeasance within two years of the Closing Date; (p) not be substituted for a deleted mortgage loan if it would result in
the termination of the REMIC status of the lower-tier REMIC (the “Lower-Tier REMIC”) or the upper-tier REMIC
(the “Upper-Tier REMIC”) (collectively, the “Trust REMICs”) or the imposition of tax on either
Trust REMIC other than a tax on income expressly permitted or contemplated to be imposed by the terms of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement as determined by an opinion of counsel; (q) have an engineering report that indicates no material adverse property
condition or deferred maintenance with respect to the related Mortgaged Property which will be delivered as a part of the related
servicing file; and (r) be current in the payment of all scheduled payments of principal and interest then due. In the event
that more than one mortgage loan is substituted for a deleted mortgage loan or mortgage loans, then (x) the amounts described
in clause (a) are required to be determined on the basis of aggregate principal balances and (y) each proposed substitute
mortgage loan must individually satisfy each of the requirements specified in clauses (b) through (r) of the preceding
sentence, except (z) the rates described in clause (b) above and the remaining term to stated maturity referred
to in clause (e) above are required to be determined on a weighted average basis, provided that no individual
Mortgage Rate (net of the Servicing Fee, the Certificate Administrator Fee and the Senior Trust Advisor Fee) may be lower than
the highest fixed Pass-Through Rate (not based on or subject to a cap equal to or based on the WAC Rate) of any Principal Balance
Certificates having a principal balance then outstanding. When a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan is substituted for a deleted
mortgage loan, the applicable mortgage loan seller will be required to certify that the mortgage loan meets all of the requirements
of the above definition and send the certification to the trustee the certificate administrator and, prior to the occurrence of
a Consultation Termination Event, the Directing Certificateholder.
 
The foregoing repurchase or substitution
obligation will constitute the sole remedy available to the Certificateholders and the trustee under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement for any uncured breach of any mortgage loan seller’s representations and warranties regarding the mortgage loans
or any uncured document defect; provided, however, that if any breach pertains to a representation or warranty that the
related mortgage loan documents or any particular mortgage loan document requires the related borrower to bear the costs and expenses
associated with any particular action or matter under such mortgage loan document(s), then the applicable mortgage loan seller
(or, Starwood Mortgage Capital LLC, Redwood Trust Inc. or RAIT Financial Trust or as applicable, as guarantor of the repurchase
and substitution obligations of Starwood Mortgage Funding II LLC, Redwood Commercial Mortgage Corporation and RAIT Funding,
LLC, respectively) will be required to cure such breach within the applicable cure period (as the same may be extended) by reimbursing
the trust for the reasonable amount of any such costs and expenses incurred by the master servicer, the special servicer, the certificate
administrator, the trustee or the trust fund that are incurred as a result of such breach and have not been reimbursed by the related
borrower; provided, further, that in the event any such costs and
 

S-219
 
 
expenses exceed $10,000, the applicable mortgage
loan seller (or its guarantor) will have the option to either repurchase or substitute for the related mortgage loan as provided
above or pay such costs and expenses. The applicable mortgage loan seller (or its guarantor) will remit the amount of these costs
and expenses and upon its making such remittance, the applicable mortgage loan seller (or its guarantor) will be deemed to have
cured the breach in all respects. The respective mortgage loan seller (or, Starwood Mortgage Capital LLC, Redwood Trust Inc. or
RAIT Financial Trust or as applicable, as guarantor of the repurchase and substitution obligations of Starwood Mortgage Funding II
LLC, Redwood Commercial Mortgage Corporation and RAIT Funding, LLC, respectively) will be the sole warranting party in respect
of the mortgage loans sold by that mortgage loan seller to the depositor, and none of its affiliates (other than the guarantor)
and none of the depositor, the master servicer, the special servicer, the other mortgage loan seller, the trustee, the certificate
administrator, the underwriters or any of their affiliates will be obligated to repurchase or replace any affected mortgage loan
in connection with a breach of the applicable mortgage loan seller’s representations and warranties or in connection with
a document defect if the applicable mortgage loan seller defaults on its obligation to do so. We cannot assure you that the applicable
mortgage loan seller (or its guarantor) will have sufficient resources to repurchase or replace a defective mortgage loan. If any
mortgage loan seller fails to fulfill such obligation, you could experience cash flow disruptions or losses on your certificates.
See “Transaction Parties—The Sponsors and Mortgage Loan Sellers” in this free writing prospectus. However,
the depositor will not include any mortgage loan in the pool of mortgage loans if anything has come to the depositor’s attention
prior to the Closing Date that causes it to believe that the representations and warranties, subject to the exceptions to the representations
and warranties, made by a mortgage loan seller (or its guarantor) regarding the mortgage loan will not be correct in all material
respects when made.

Except as set forth in the table above and
where noted below, the borrower is entitled to receive a disbursement of all cash remaining in the lockbox account after required
payment for debt service, agent fees, required reserves, and operating expenses, the agreements governing the lockbox accounts
provide that the borrower has no withdrawal or transfer rights with respect to the related lockbox account. The lockbox accounts
will not be assets of the trust.
 
“CMA Lockbox” or “CMA”
means that the related mortgage loan documents currently require tenants, or the related borrower (or its property manager), at
the related Mortgaged Property to pay rent or other income directly to the lockbox account; however, thereafter funds deposited
in such lockbox account are paid directly to the related borrower who pays debt service and funds all required escrow and reserve
accounts (including debt service) from amounts received. However, upon the occurrence of certain triggering events enumerated in
the related mortgage loan documents, the lockbox account converts to a Hard Lockbox.
 
“Springing Lockbox” means
that no lockbox account is currently in place and that the related borrower (or its property manager) is responsible for paying
debt service and funding all escrow and reserve accounts (including debt service); however, upon the occurrence of certain
triggering events enumerated in the related mortgage loan documents, the related borrower is required to implement either a Hard
Lockbox, Soft Lockbox or CMA Lockbox.
 

S-220
 
 
“Hard Lockbox” means
that the related mortgage loan documents currently require tenants (or its property manager) to pay rent or other income directly
to the lockbox account, with the funding of all required escrow and reserve accounts (including for debt service) derived directly
from such lockbox account.
 
“Soft Lockbox” means
that the related mortgage loan documents currently require the related borrower or the property manager at the related Mortgaged
Property to collect rents from tenants and pay all such rent directly to the lockbox account, with the funding of all required
escrow and reserve accounts (including for debt service) derived directly from such lockbox account.

JPMCB Securitization Program. The
following is a description of JPMCB’s commercial mortgage-backed securitization program.
 
JPMCB underwrites and originates mortgage
loans secured by commercial, multifamily and manufactured housing community properties for its securitization program. As sponsor,
JPMCB sells the loans it originates or acquires through commercial mortgage-backed securitizations. JPMCB, with its commercial
mortgage lending affiliates and predecessors, began originating commercial mortgage loans for securitization in 1994 and securitizing
commercial mortgage loans in 1995. As of December 31, 2014, the total amount of commercial mortgage loans originated and securitized
by JPMCB and its predecessors is in excess of $97.6 billion. Of that amount, approximately $85.5 billion has been securitized by
the depositor. In its fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, JPMCB originated approximately $13.1 billion of commercial mortgage
loans, of which approximately $10.5 billion were securitized by the depositor.
 
On May 30, 2008, JPMorgan Chase &
Co., the parent of JPMCB, merged with The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. As a result of such merger, Bear Stearns Commercial Mortgage,
Inc. (“BSCMI”) became a subsidiary of JPMCB. Subsequent to such merger, BSCMI changed its name to J.P. Morgan
Commercial Mortgage Inc. Prior to the merger, BSCMI was a sponsor of its own commercial mortgage-backed securitization program.
BSCMI, with its commercial mortgage lending affiliates and predecessors, began originating commercial mortgage loans in 1995 and
securitizing commercial mortgage loans in 1996. As of November 30, 2007, the total amount of commercial mortgage loans originated
by BSCMI was in excess of $60 billion, of which approximately $39 billion has been securitized. Of that amount, approximately $22
billion has been securitized by an affiliate of BSCMI acting as depositor. BSCMI’s annual commercial mortgage loan originations
grew from approximately $65 million in 1995 to approximately $1.0 billion in 2000 and to approximately $21.0 billion in 2007. After
the merger, only JPMCB continued to be a sponsor of commercial mortgage-backed securitizations.
 
The commercial mortgage loans originated,
co-originated or acquired by JPMCB include both fixed rate and floating rate loans and both smaller “conduit” loans
and large loans. JPMCB primarily originates loans secured by retail, office, multifamily, hospitality, industrial and self storage
properties, but also originates loans secured by manufactured housing communities, theaters, land subject to a ground lease and
mixed use properties. JPMCB originates loans in every state.
 

S-222
 
 
As a sponsor, JPMCB originates, co-originates
or acquires mortgage loans and, either by itself or together with other sponsors or loan sellers, initiates their securitization
by transferring the mortgage loans to a depositor, which in turn transfers them to the trust for the related securitization. In
coordination with its affiliate, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and other underwriters, JPMCB works with rating agencies, loan sellers,
subordinated debt purchasers and master servicers in structuring the securitization transaction. JPMCB acts as sponsor, originator
or loan seller both in transactions in which it is the sole sponsor and mortgage loan seller as well as in transactions in which
other entities act as sponsor and/or mortgage loan seller. Some of these loan sellers may be affiliated with underwriters on the
transactions.
 
Neither JPMCB nor any of its affiliates
acts as master servicer of the commercial mortgage loans in its securitizations. Instead, JPMCB sells the right to be appointed
master servicer of its securitized loans to rating-agency approved master servicers.
 
For a description of certain affiliations,
relationships and related transactions between the sponsor and the other transaction parties, see “Risk Factors—Potential
Conflicts of Interest” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Review
of JPMCB Mortgage Loans
 
Overview. JPMCB, in its capacity
as the sponsor of the JPMCB mortgage loans, has conducted a review of the JPMCB mortgage loans in connection with the securitization
described in this free writing prospectus. The review of the JPMCB mortgage loans was performed by a deal team comprised of real
estate and securitization professionals who are employees of JPMCB, or one or more of JPMCB’s affiliates, or, in certain
circumstances, are consultants engaged by JPMCB (the “JPMCB Deal
Team”). The review procedures described below were employed with respect to all of the JPMCB mortgage loans, except
that certain review procedures only were relevant to the large loan disclosures in this free writing prospectus, as further described
below. No sampling procedures were used in the review process.
 
Database. To prepare for securitization,
members of the JPMCB Deal Team updated its internal origination database of loan-level and property-level information relating
to each JPMCB mortgage loan. The database was compiled from, among other sources, the related mortgage loan documents, third party
appraisals (as well as environmental reports, engineering assessments and seismic reports, if applicable and obtained), zoning
reports, if applicable, evidence of insurance coverage or summaries of the same prepared by an outside insurance consultant, borrower
supplied information (including, but not limited to, rent rolls, leases, operating statements and budgets) and information collected
by JPMCB during the underwriting process. After origination or acquisition of each JPMCB mortgage loan, the JPMCB Deal Team updated
the information in the database with respect to such JPMCB mortgage loan based on updates provided by the related servicer relating
to loan payment status and escrows, updated operating statements, rent rolls and leasing activity, and information otherwise brought
to the attention of the JPMCB Deal Team.
 
A data tape (the “JPMCB
Data Tape”) containing detailed information regarding each JPMCB mortgage loan was created from the information
in the database referred to in the prior paragraph. The JPMCB Data Tape was used by the JPMCB Deal Team to provide the numerical
information regarding the JPMCB mortgage loans in this free writing prospectus.
 
Data Comparison and Recalculation.
JPMCB engaged a third party accounting firm to perform certain data comparison and recalculation procedures designed by JPMCB relating
to information in this free writing prospectus regarding the JPMCB mortgage loans. These procedures included:
 

·comparing the information in the JPMCB Data Tape against various source documents provided by JPMCB that are described above
under “—Database”;
 

·comparing numerical information regarding the JPMCB mortgage loans and the related Mortgaged Properties disclosed in this free
writing prospectus against the JPMCB Data Tape; and
 


S-223
 

 

·recalculating certain percentages, ratios and other formulae relating to the JPMCB mortgage loans disclosed in this free writing
prospectus.
 
Legal Review. JPMCB engaged various
law firms to conduct certain legal reviews of the JPMCB mortgage loans for disclosure in this free writing prospectus. In anticipation
of the securitization of each JPMCB mortgage loan, origination counsel prepared a loan and property summary that sets forth salient
loan terms and summarizes material deviations from material provisions of JPMCB’s standard form loan documents. In addition,
origination counsel for each JPMCB mortgage loan reviewed JPMCB’s representations and warranties set forth on Annex D-1 to
this free writing prospectus and, if applicable, identified exceptions to those representations and warranties.
 
Securitization counsel was also engaged
to assist in the review of the JPMCB mortgage loans. Such assistance included, among other things, (i) a review of sections of
the loan agreement relating to certain JPMCB mortgage loans marked against the standard form document, (ii) a review of the legal
data records referred to above relating to the JPMCB mortgage loans prepared by origination counsel, and (iii) a review of due
diligence questionnaires completed by the JPMCB Deal Team and origination counsel. Securitization counsel also reviewed the property
release provisions, if any, and condemnation provisions for each JPMCB mortgage loan for compliance with the REMIC Provisions.
 
Origination counsel and securitization counsel
also assisted in the preparation of the risk factors and mortgage loan summaries set forth in Annex A-3 to this free writing prospectus,
based on their respective reviews of pertinent sections of the related mortgage loan documents.
 
Other Review Procedures. On a case-by-case
basis as deemed necessary by JPMCB, with respect to any pending litigation that existed at the origination of any JPMCB mortgage
loan that is material and not covered by insurance, JPMCB requested updates from the related borrower, origination counsel and/or
borrower’s litigation counsel. JPMCB confirmed with the related servicer that there has not been recent material casualty
to any improvements located on real property that serves as collateral for JPMCB mortgage loans. In addition, if JPMCB became aware
of a significant natural disaster in the immediate vicinity of any Mortgaged Property securing a JPMCB mortgage loan, JPMCB obtained
information on the status of the Mortgaged Property from the related borrower to confirm no material damage to the Mortgaged Property.
 
The JPMCB Deal Team also consulted with
JPMCB personnel responsible for the origination of the JPMCB mortgage loans to confirm that the JPMCB mortgage loans were originated
or acquired in compliance with the origination and underwriting criteria described below under “—JPMCB’s Underwriting
Guidelines and Processes”, as well as to identify any material deviations from those origination and underwriting criteria.
See “—Exceptions to JPMCB’s Disclosed Underwriting Guidelines” below.
 
Findings and Conclusions. Based on
the foregoing review procedures, JPMCB determined that the disclosure regarding the JPMCB mortgage loans in this free writing prospectus
is accurate in all material respects. JPMCB also determined that the JPMCB mortgage loans were originated or acquired in accordance
with JPMCB’s origination procedures and underwriting criteria, except as described under
“—Exceptions to JPMCB’s Disclosed Underwriting Guidelines” below. JPMCB attributes to itself all
findings and conclusions resulting from the foregoing review procedures.
 
Review Procedures in the Event of a Mortgage
Loan Substitution. JPMCB will perform a review of any mortgage loan that it elects to substitute for a mortgage loan in the
pool in connection with material breach of a representation or warranty or a material document defect. JPMCB, and if appropriate
its legal counsel, will review the mortgage loan documents and servicing history of the substitute mortgage loan to confirm it
meets each of the criteria required under the terms of the related Purchase Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (the
“Qualification Criteria”). JPMCB will engage
a third party accounting firm to compare the Qualification Criteria against the underlying source documentation to verify the accuracy
of the review by JPMCB and to confirm any numerical and/or statistical information to be disclosed in any required filings under
the Exchange Act. Legal counsel will also be engaged by JPMCB to render any tax opinion required in connection with the substitution.

JPMCB’s
Underwriting Guidelines and Processes
 
JPMCB has developed guidelines establishing
certain procedures with respect to underwriting the mortgage loans originated or purchased by it. All of the mortgage loans sold
to the trust by JPMCB were generally underwritten in accordance with the guidelines below. In some instances, one or more provisions
of the guidelines were waived or modified by JPMCB at origination where it was determined not to adversely affect the related mortgage
loan originated by it in any material respect. The mortgage loans to be included in the trust were originated or acquired by JPMCB
generally in accordance with the commercial mortgage-backed securitization program of JPMCB. For a description of any material
exceptions to the underwriting guidelines in this free writing prospectus, see “—Exceptions to JPMCB’s Disclosed
Underwriting Guidelines” below.
 
Notwithstanding the discussion below, given
the differences between individual commercial Mortgaged Properties, the underwriting and origination procedures and the credit
analysis with respect to any particular commercial mortgage loan may significantly differ from one asset to another, and will be
driven by circumstances particular to that property, including, among others, its type, current and alternative uses, size, location,
market conditions, reserve requirements and additional collateral, tenants and leases, borrower identity, sponsorship, performance
history and/or other factors. However, except as described in the exceptions to the underwriting guidelines (see “—Exceptions
to JPMCB’s Disclosed Underwriting Guidelines”), the underwriting of the JPMCB mortgage loans will conform to the
general guidelines described below.
 
Property
Analysis. JPMCB performs or causes to be performed a site inspection to evaluate the location and quality of the related
Mortgaged Properties. Such inspection generally includes an evaluation of functionality, design, attractiveness, visibility and
accessibility, as well as location to major thoroughfares, transportation centers, employment sources, retail areas and educational
or recreational facilities. JPMCB assesses the submarket in which the property is located to evaluate competitive or comparable
properties as well as market trends. In addition, JPMCB evaluates the property’s age, physical condition, operating history,
lease and tenant mix, and management.
 
Cash
Flow Analysis. JPMCB reviews, among other things, historical operating statements, rent rolls, tenant leases and/or
budgeted income and expense statements provided by the borrower and makes adjustments in order to determine a debt service coverage
ratio, including taking into account the benefits of any governmental assistance programs. See “Description
of the Mortgage Pool—Additional Mortgage Loan Information” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Debt Service Coverage Ratio and Loan-to-Value
Ratio. The underwriting includes a calculation of the debt service coverage ratio and the loan-to-value ratio in connection
with the origination of each loan.
 
The debt service coverage ratio will generally
be calculated based on the ratio of the underwritten net cash flow from the property in question as determined by JPMCB and payments
on the loan based on actual principal and/or interest due on the loan. However, underwritten net cash flow is often a highly subjective
number based on a variety of assumptions regarding, and adjustments to, revenues and expenses with respect to the related real
property collateral. For example, when calculating the debt service coverage ratio for a multifamily or commercial mortgage loan,
annual net cash flow that was calculated based on assumptions regarding projected future rental income, expenses and/or occupancy
may be utilized. We cannot assure you that the foregoing assumptions made with respect to any prospective multifamily or commercial
mortgage loan will, in fact, be consistent with actual property performance. For specific discussions on the particular assumptions
and adjustments, see “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Net
Cash Flow and Certain Underwriting Considerations” and
Annex A-1 and Annex A-3 to this free writing prospectus. The loan-to-value ratio, in general, is the ratio, expressed as
a percentage, of the then-outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loan divided by the estimated value of the related property
based on an appraisal. In addition, with respect to certain mortgage loans, there
 


S-225
 

 
may
exist subordinate mortgage debt or mezzanine debt. Such mortgage loans will have a lower combined debt service coverage ratio
and/or a higher combined loan-to-value ratio when such subordinate or mezzanine debt is taken into account. Additionally, certain
mortgage loans may provide for interest only payments prior to maturity, or for an interest-only period during a portion of the
term of the mortgage loan.
 
Appraisal
and Loan-to-Value Ratio. For each Mortgaged Property, JPMCB obtains a current (within 6 months of the origination date
of the mortgage loan) full narrative appraisal conforming at least to the requirements of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery,
and Enforcement Act of 1989 (“FIRREA”). The appraisal
is based on the current use of the Mortgaged Property and must include an estimate of the then-current market value of the property
“as-is” in its then-current condition although in certain cases, JPMCB may also obtain a value on an “as-stabilized”
basis reflecting leases that have been executed but tenants have not commenced paying rent. JPMCB then determines the loan-to-value
ratio of the mortgage loan at the date of origination or, if applicable, in connection with its acquisition, in each case based
on the value set forth in the appraisal.
 
Evaluation
of Borrower. JPMCB evaluates the borrower and its principals with respect to credit history and prior experience as
an owner and operator of commercial real estate properties. The evaluation will generally include obtaining and reviewing a credit
report or other reliable indication of the borrower’s financial capacity; obtaining and verifying credit references and/or
business and trade references; and obtaining and reviewing certifications provided by the borrower as to prior real estate experience
and current contingent liabilities. Finally, although the mortgage loans generally are non-recourse in nature, in the case of certain
mortgage loans, the borrower and certain principals of the borrower may be required to assume legal responsibility for liabilities
as a result of, among other things, fraud, misrepresentation, misappropriation or conversion of funds and breach of environmental
or hazardous materials requirements. JPMCB evaluates the financial capacity of the borrower and such principals to meet any obligations
that may arise with respect to such liabilities.
 
Environmental
Site Assessment. Prior to origination, JPMCB either (i) obtains or updates an environmental site assessment (“ESA”)
for a Mortgaged Property prepared by a qualified environmental firm or (ii) obtains an environmental insurance policy for a Mortgaged
Property. If an ESA is obtained or updated, JPMCB reviews the ESA to verify the absence of reported violations of applicable laws
and regulations relating to environmental protection and hazardous materials or other material adverse environmental condition
or circumstance. In cases in which the ESA identifies conditions that would require cleanup, remedial action or any other response
estimated to cost in excess of 5% of the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loan, JPMCB either (i) determines that another
party with sufficient assets is responsible for taking remedial actions directed by an applicable regulatory authority or (ii)
requires the borrower to do one of the following: (A) carry out satisfactory remediation activities or other responses prior to
the origination of the mortgage loan, (B) establish an operations and maintenance plan, (C) place sufficient funds in escrow or
establish a letter of credit at the time of origination of the mortgage loan to complete such remediation within a specified period
of time, (D) obtain an environmental insurance policy for the Mortgaged Property, (E) provide or obtain an indemnity agreement
or a guaranty with respect to such condition or circumstance, or (F) receive appropriate assurances that significant remediation
activities or other significant responses are not necessary or required.
 
Certain of the mortgage loans may also have
environmental insurance policies. See “Description of the Mortgage
Pool—Certain Terms and Conditions of the Mortgage Loans—Hazard, Liability and Other Insurance” above.
 
Physical
Assessment Report. Prior to origination, JPMCB obtains a physical assessment report (“PAR”)
for each Mortgaged Property prepared by a qualified structural engineering firm. JPMCB reviews the PAR to verify that the property
is reported to be in satisfactory physical condition, and to determine the anticipated costs of necessary repair, replacement and
major maintenance or capital expenditure needs over the term of the mortgage loan. In cases in which the PAR identifies material
repairs or replacements needed immediately, JPMCB generally requires the borrower to carry out such repairs or replacements prior
to the origination of the mortgage loan, or, in many cases, requires the borrower to
 


S-226
 
 
place
sufficient funds in escrow at the time of origination of the mortgage loan to complete such repairs or replacements within not
more than twelve months. In certain instances, JPMCB may waive such escrows but require the related borrower to complete such
repairs within a stated period of time in the related mortgage loan documents.
 
Title
Insurance Policy. The borrower is required to provide, and JPMCB reviews, a title insurance policy for each Mortgaged
Property. The title insurance policy must meet the following requirements: (a) the policy must be written by a title insurer licensed
to do business in the jurisdiction where the Mortgaged Property is located; (b) the policy must be in an amount equal to the original
principal balance of the mortgage loan; (c) the protection and benefits must run to the mortgagee and its successors and assigns;
(d) the policy should be written on a standard policy form of the American Land Title Association or equivalent policy promulgated
in the jurisdiction where the Mortgaged Property is located; and (e) the legal description of the Mortgaged Property in the title
policy must conform to that shown on the survey of the Mortgaged Property, where a survey has been required.
 
Property
Insurance. The borrower is required to provide, and JPMCB reviews, certificates of required insurance with respect to
the Mortgaged Property. Such insurance may include: (1) commercial general liability insurance for bodily injury or death and property
damage; (2) a fire and extended perils insurance policy providing “special” form coverage including coverage against
loss or damage by fire, lightning, explosion, smoke, windstorm and hail, riot or strike and civil commotion; (3) if applicable,
boiler and machinery coverage; (4) if the Mortgaged Property is located in a flood hazard area, flood insurance; and (5) such other
coverage as JPMCB may require based on the specific characteristics of the Mortgaged Property.
 
Seismic Report. A seismic report
is required for all properties located in seismic zones 3 or 4.
 
Zoning and Building Code Compliance.
In connection with the origination of a multifamily or commercial mortgage loan, the originator will examine whether the use and
occupancy of the related real property collateral is in material compliance with zoning, land-use, building rules, regulations
and orders then applicable to that property. Evidence of this compliance may be in the form of one or more of the following: a
zoning report, legal opinions, surveys, recorded documents, temporary or permanent certificates of occupancy, letters from government
officials or agencies, title insurance endorsements, engineering or consulting reports and/or representations by the related borrower.
 
Escrow Requirements. JPMCB may require
borrowers to fund various escrows for taxes, insurance, capital expenses and replacement reserves, which reserves in many instances
will be limited to certain capped amounts. In addition, JPMCB may identify certain risks that warrant additional escrows or holdbacks
for items such as leasing-related matters, deferred maintenance, environmental remediation or unfunded obligations, which escrows
or holdbacks would be released upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions. Springing escrows may also be structured for identified
risks such as specific rollover exposure, to be triggered upon the non-renewal of one or more key tenants. Escrows are evaluated
on a case-by-case basis and are not required for all commercial mortgage loans originated by JPMCB. The typical required escrows
for mortgage loans originated by JPMCB are as follows:
 

·Taxes – An initial deposit and monthly escrow deposits equal to approximately 1/12th of the estimated annual property
taxes (based on the most recent property assessment and the current millage rate) are required to provide JPMCB with sufficient
funds to satisfy all taxes and assessments. JPMCB may waive this escrow requirement in certain circumstances, including, but not
limited to: (i) the Mortgaged Property is a single tenant property (or substantially leased to single tenant) and the tenant pays
taxes directly (or JPMCB may waive the escrow for a portion of the Mortgaged Property which is leased to a tenant that pays taxes
for its portion of the Mortgaged Property directly); or (ii) any Escrow/Reserve Mitigating Circumstances.
 

·Insurance – An initial deposit and monthly escrow deposits equal to approximately 1/12th of the estimated annual property
insurance premium are required to provide JPMCB with sufficient funds to pay all insurance premiums. JPMCB may waive this escrow
requirement in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to: (i) the borrower maintains a blanket insurance policy;
 


S-227
 

 


(ii)
the Mortgaged Property is a single tenant property (or substantially leased to single tenant) and the tenant maintains the property
insurance or self-insures (or may waive the escrow for a portion of the Mortgaged Property which is leased to a tenant that maintains
property insurance for its portion of the Mortgaged Property or self-insures); or (iii) any Escrow/Reserve Mitigating Circumstances.
  

·Replacement Reserves – Replacement reserves are generally calculated in accordance with the expected useful life of the
components of the property during the term of the mortgage loan. Annual replacement reserves are generally underwritten to the
suggested replacement reserve amount from an independent, third-party property condition or engineering report, or to certain minimum
requirements by property type. JPMCB may waive this escrow requirement in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to:
(i) the Mortgaged Property is a single tenant property (or substantially leased to single tenant) and the tenant repairs and maintains
the Mortgaged Property (or may waive the escrow for a portion of the Mortgaged Property which is leased to a tenant that repairs
and maintains its portion of the Mortgaged Property); or (ii) any Escrow/Reserve Mitigating Circumstances.
 

·Tenant Improvement/Lease Commissions – A tenant improvement/leasing commission reserve may be required to be funded either
at loan origination and/or during the related mortgage loan term and/or springing upon certain tenant events to cover certain anticipated
leasing commissions, free rent periods or tenant improvement costs which might be associated with re-leasing the space occupied
by such tenants. JPMCB may waive this escrow requirement in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to: (i) the Mortgaged
Property is a single tenant property (or substantially leased to single tenant), with a lease that extends beyond the loan term;
or (ii) any Escrow/Reserve Mitigating Circumstances.
 

·Deferred Maintenance – A deferred maintenance reserve may be required to be funded at loan origination in an amount equal
to 100% to 125% of the estimated cost of material immediate repairs or replacements identified in the property condition or engineering
report. JPMCB may waive this escrow requirement in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to: (i) the sponsor of the
borrower delivers a guarantee to complete the immediate repairs; (ii) the deferred maintenance items do not materially impact the
function, performance or value of the property; (iii) the deferred maintenance cost does not exceed $50,000; (iv) the Mortgaged
Property is a single tenant property (or substantially leased to single tenant), and the tenant is responsible for the repairs;
or (v) any Escrow/Reserve Mitigating Circumstances.
 

·Environmental Remediation – An environmental remediation reserve may be required at loan origination in an amount equal
to 100% to 125% of the estimated remediation cost identified in the environmental report. JPMCB may waive this escrow requirement
in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to: (i) the sponsor of the borrower delivers a guarantee agreeing to complete
the remediation; (ii) environmental insurance is in place or obtained; or (iii) any Escrow/Reserve Mitigating Circumstances.
 
JPMCB may determine that establishing any
of the foregoing escrows or reserves is not warranted in one or more of the following instances (collectively, the “Escrow/Reserve
Mitigating Circumstances”): (i) the amounts involved are de
minimis, (ii) JPMCB’s evaluation of the ability of the Mortgaged Property, the borrower or a holder of direct
or indirect ownership interests in the borrower to bear the subject expense or cost absent creation of an escrow or reserve, (iii)
based on the Mortgaged Property maintaining a specified debt service coverage ratio, (iv) JPMCB has structured springing escrows
that arise for identified risks, (v) JPMCB has an alternative to a cash escrow or reserve, such as a letter of credit or a guarantee
from the borrower or an affiliate of the borrower; (vi) JPMCB believes there are credit positive characteristics of the borrower,
the sponsor of the borrower and/or the Mortgaged Property that would offset the need for the escrow or reserve; or (vii) the reserves
are being collected and held by a third party, such as a management company, a franchisor, or an association.
 


S-228
 

 
Notwithstanding the foregoing discussion
under this caption “—JPMCB’s Underwriting Guidelines and Processes”, one or more of the mortgage
loans contributed to this securitization by JPMCB may vary from, or may not comply with, JPMCB’s underwriting guidelines
described above. In addition, in the case of one or more of the mortgage loans contributed to this securitization by JPMCB, JPMCB
may not have strictly applied these underwriting guidelines as the result of a case-by-case permitted exception based upon other
compensating or mitigating factors.
 
Exceptions
to JPMCB’s Disclosed Underwriting Guidelines
 
We have disclosed generally our underwriting
guidelines with respect to the mortgage loans. However, one or more of JPMCB’s mortgage loans may vary from the specific
JPMCB underwriting guidelines described above when additional credit positive characteristics are present as discussed above. In
addition, in the case of one or more of JPMCB’s mortgage loans, JPMCB may not have applied each of the specific underwriting
guidelines described above as the result of case-by-case permitted flexibility based upon other compensating factors. In certain
cases, we may have made exceptions and the underwriting of a particular mortgage loan did not comply with all aspects of the disclosed
criteria.
 
With respect to five (5) Mortgaged Properties
identified as “Hilton Suites Chicago Magnificent Mile”, “Civic Opera Building”, “One Shell Square”,
“Hilton Atlanta Perimeter” and “Langhorne Shopping Center” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus,
securing five (5) mortgage loans representing approximately 20.4% of the Initial Pool Balance, the respective Cut-off Date LTV
Ratio is based on a hypothetical appraised value of the related Mortgaged Property. The use of the hypothetical appraised values
represents an exception to the underwriting guidelines for JPMCB. JPMCB’s determination to include the mortgage loans notwithstanding
these exceptions was supported by the compensating factor that the assumptions underlying the hypothetical values had been reserved
for on the origination date. Accordingly, JPMCB believes that the hypothetical appraised values are the accurate reflection of
the Cut-off Date LTV Ratio for these mortgage loans and approved inclusion of these mortgage loans in this transaction. Certain
characteristics of the mortgage loans can be found in Annex A-1 and Annex A-3 to this free writing prospectus.
 
With respect to fifty-eight (58) Mortgaged
Properties, securing one (1) mortgage loan identified as “Brunswick Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus,
representing approximately 1.7% of the Initial Pool Balance, JPMCB agreed to waive the reserves for replacements to the extent
there is no cash sweep period in effect under the mortgage loan documents. The waiver of these reserves represents exceptions to
the underwriting guidelines for JPMCB. Based on the credit characteristics of the related sponsors and the debt service coverage
ratio/debt yield requirements for a cash sweep period, JPMCB approved inclusion of the mortgage loans in this transaction. Certain
characteristics of the mortgage loans can be found in Annex A-1 and Annex A-3 to this free writing prospectus.

(1)This column does not include
any previously-reported repurchase request or demand for which there has been no change in reporting status during this reporting
period from the status previously reported.


(2)The mortgage loan included
on this chart that was subject to a demand to repurchase or replace for breach of a representation and warranty was paid off during
the April 1, 2012 to June 30, 2012 reporting period. The outstanding principal balance reflected in the chart was calculated at
the time of payoff and the percentage of principal balance reflected in the chart was calculated by dividing the outstanding principal
balance by the total pool balance as of the immediately preceding trustee’s report. Such mortgage loan was originated by
Smith Barney Mortgage Capital Group, Inc. (“Smith Barney”) and sold to Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New
York (“MGT”). In connection with the securitization, MGT made the representations and warranties to the securitization
trust for such mortgage loan and, as a result, the demand to repurchase or replace such mortgage loan was made to MGT and Smith
Barney. JPMCB is the successor in interest to MGT.

Barclays Bank PLC
 
General
 
Barclays Bank PLC, a public limited company
registered in England and Wales under number 1026167 (“Barclays”), a sponsor and a mortgage loan seller, is
an affiliate of Barclays Capital Inc., one of the underwriters. The principal offices of Barclays in the United States are located
at 745 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019, telephone number (212) 412-4000.
 
Barclays’
Securitization Program
 
As a sponsor, Barclays originates or acquires
mortgage loans and initiates a securitization transaction by selecting the portfolio of mortgage loans to be securitized and transferring
those mortgage loans to a securitization depositor who in turn transfers those mortgage loans to the issuing entity. In selecting
a portfolio to be securitized, consideration is given to geographic concentration, property type concentration and rating agency
models and criteria. Barclays’ role also includes participation in the selection of third-party service providers such as
the master servicer, the special servicer, the trustee and the certificate administrator, and engaging the rating agencies. In
coordination with the underwriters for the related offering, Barclays works with rating agencies, investors, mortgage loan sellers
and servicers in structuring the securitization transaction.
 
Barclays has been engaged in commercial
mortgage loan securitization in the United States since 2004. The vast majority of commercial mortgage loans originated by Barclays
are intended to be either sold through securitization transactions in which Barclays acts as a sponsor or sold to third parties
in individual loan sale transactions. The following is a general description of the types of commercial mortgage loans that Barclays
originates for securitization:
 

·Fixed rate mortgage loans generally having maturities between five and ten years and secured by commercial real estate such
as office, retail, hospitality, multifamily, manufactured housing, healthcare, self storage and industrial properties. These loans
are primarily originated for the purpose of securitization.
 

·Floating rate loans generally having shorter maturities and secured by stabilized and non-stabilized commercial real estate
properties. These loans are primarily originated for securitization, though in certain cases only a senior interest in the loan
is intended to be securitized.
 

·Subordinate mortgage loans and mezzanine loans. These loans are generally not originated for securitization and are sold in
individual loan sale transactions.
 
In general, Barclays does not hold the loans
it originates until maturity.
 
Neither Barclays nor any of its affiliates
act as servicer of the commercial mortgage loans in its securitization transactions. Instead, Barclays contracts with other entities
to service the mortgage loans in the securitization transactions.
 
Barclays’ affiliates commenced selling
commercial mortgage loans into U.S. securitizations in 2004. During the period commencing in 2004 and ending on September 29, 2015,
Barclays’ affiliates were the loan sellers in approximately 55 commercial mortgage-backed securitization transactions. Approximately
$19.15 billion of the mortgage loans included in those transactions were originated or acquired by Barclays.
 


S-231
 
  
The following table sets forth information
with respect to originations and securitizations of fixed rate and floating rate commercial and multifamily mortgage loans by Barclays
affiliates for the years ending on December 31, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and for the period January 1, 2015

Review
of Barclays Mortgage Loans
 
Overview. Barclays has conducted
a review of the mortgage loans for which Barclays is a sponsor in this securitization (the “Barclays
Mortgage Loans”) in connection with the securitization described in this free writing prospectus. The review of
the Barclays Mortgage Loans was performed by a team comprised of real estate and securitization professionals at Barclays’
offices (the “Barclays Review Team”). The review procedures described below were employed with respect to all
of the Barclays Mortgage Loans. No sampling procedures were used in the review process.
 
Database. To prepare for securitization,
members of the Barclays Review Team created a database of loan-level and property-level information relating to each Barclays Mortgage
Loan. The database was compiled from, among other sources, the related loan documents, appraisals, environmental assessment reports,
property condition reports, seismic studies, zoning reports, insurance review summaries, borrower-supplied information (including,
but not limited to, rent rolls, leases, operating statements and budgets) and information collected by the Barclays Review Team
during the underwriting process. After origination of each Barclays Mortgage Loan, the Barclays Review Team updated the information
in the database with respect to such Barclays Mortgage Loan based on updates provided by the related servicer relating to loan
payment status and escrows, updated operating statements, rent rolls and leasing activity, and information otherwise brought to
the attention of the Barclays Review Team.
 
A data tape (the “Barclays Data
Tape”) containing detailed information regarding each Barclays Mortgage Loan was created from the information in the
database referred to in the prior paragraph. The Barclays Data Tape was used to provide the numerical information regarding the
Barclays Mortgage Loans in this free writing prospectus.
 
Data Comparison and Recalculation.
An affiliate of Barclays engaged a third party accounting firm to perform certain data comparison and recalculation procedures,
the nature, extent and timing of which were designed by Barclays, relating to information in this free writing prospectus regarding
the Barclays Mortgage Loans. These procedures included:
 

·comparing the information in the Barclays Data Tape against various source documents provided by Barclays that are described
above under “—Database”;
 


S-232
 

 

·comparing numerical information regarding the Barclays Mortgage Loans and the related Mortgaged Properties disclosed in this
free writing prospectus against the Barclays Data Tape; and
 

·recalculating certain percentages, ratios and other formulae relating to the Barclays Mortgage Loans disclosed in this free
writing prospectus.
 
Legal Review. Barclays and the other
originators of the Barclays Mortgage Loans engaged various law firms to conduct certain legal reviews of the Barclays Mortgage
Loans for disclosure in this free writing prospectus. In anticipation of the securitization of each Barclays Mortgage Loan, Barclays’
and the other originators’ origination counsel reviewed a form of securitization representations and warranties at origination
and, if applicable, identified exceptions to those representations and warranties. Barclays’ and the other originators’
origination and underwriting staff also performed a review of the representations and warranties.
 
Legal counsel was also engaged in connection
with this securitization to assist in the review of the Barclays Mortgage Loans. Such assistance included, among other things,
(i) a review of Barclays’ internal credit memorandum for each Barclays Mortgage Loan, (ii) a review of the representations
and warranties and exception reports referred to above relating to the Barclays Mortgage Loans prepared by origination counsel,
(iii) the review and assistance in the completion by the Barclays Review Team of a due diligence questionnaire relating to the
Barclays Mortgage Loans, and (iv) the review of certain loan documents with respect to the Barclays Mortgage Loans.
 
Other Review Procedures. With respect
to any material pending litigation of which Barclays was aware at the origination of any Barclays Mortgage Loan, Barclays requested
updates from the related borrower, origination counsel and/or borrower’s litigation counsel.
 
The Barclays Review Team, with the assistance
of counsel engaged in connection with this securitization, also reviewed the Barclays Mortgage Loans to determine whether any Barclays
Mortgage Loan materially deviated from the underwriting guidelines set forth under “—Barclays’ Underwriting
Guidelines and Processes”, “—Exceptions to Barclays’ Disclosed Underwriting Guidelines”
below.
 
Findings and Conclusions. Based on
the foregoing review procedures, Barclays determined that the disclosure regarding the Barclays Mortgage Loans in this free writing
prospectus is accurate in all material respects. Barclays also determined that the Barclays Mortgage Loans were originated in accordance
with Barclays’ origination procedures and underwriting criteria, respectively, except as described under “—Exceptions
to Barclays’ Disclosed Underwriting Guidelines” below. Barclays attributes to itself all findings and conclusions
resulting from the foregoing review procedures.
 
Review Procedures in the Event of a Mortgage
Loan Substitution. Barclays will perform a review of any mortgage loan that it elects to substitute for a mortgage loan in
the pool in connection with a material breach of a representation or warranty or a material document defect. Barclays, and if appropriate
its legal counsel, will review the mortgage loan documents and servicing history of the substitute mortgage loan to confirm it
meets each of the criteria required under the terms of the related Purchase Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
Barclays will engage a third party accounting firm to compare the Qualification Criteria against the underlying source documentation
to verify the accuracy of the review by Barclays and to confirm any numerical and/or statistical information to be disclosed in
any required filings under the Exchange Act. Legal counsel will also be engaged by Barclays to render any tax opinion required
in connection with the substitution.
 
Barclays’
Underwriting Guidelines and Processes
 
After review and participation in the pre-closing
due diligence and closing process by Barclays, each of the Barclays Mortgage Loans was generally originated in accordance with
the underwriting criteria described below. Each lending situation is unique, however, and the facts and circumstances surrounding
a particular mortgage loan, such as the quality and location of the real estate collateral, the sponsorship of the borrower and
the tenancy of the collateral, will impact the extent to which the general
 


S-233
 
 
guidelines
below are applied to that specific loan. These underwriting criteria are general, and we cannot assure you that every loan will
comply in all respects with the guidelines. For additional information with respect to exceptions to the underwriting guidelines,
see “—Exceptions to Barclays’ Disclosed Underwriting Guidelines” below. Barclays originates mortgage
loans principally for securitization.
 
General. Barclays originates commercial
mortgage loans from its headquarters in New York and its West Coast office. Barclays also originates and acquires loans pursuant
to table funding arrangements through third party origination platforms that have origination offices in additional locations.
Bankers at Barclays and at table funded lenders focus on sourcing, structuring, underwriting and performing due diligence on their
loans. Structured finance bankers work closely with the loans’ originators to ensure that the loans are suitable for securitization
and satisfy rating agency criteria. All mortgage loans, including those originated by table funded lenders, must be approved by
Barclays’ credit department, as described below under “—Loan
Approval”.
 
With respect to certain mortgage loans,
Barclays has delegated certain of its underwriting and origination functions to table funded lenders, subject to loan-by-loan oversight
and ultimate review and approval by Barclays’ professionals. These functions were all performed in substantial accordance
with the mortgage loan approval procedures described in this free writing prospectus. In all cases, mortgage loans are documented
on Barclays’ approved documentation.
 
Loan Analysis. Generally, Barclays
performs both a credit analysis and collateral analysis with respect to a loan applicant and the real estate that will secure a
mortgage loan. In general, the analysis of a borrower includes a review of anti-money laundering or OFAC checks, as well as background
checks and the analysis of its loan sponsor includes a review of money laundering and background checks, third-party credit reports,
bankruptcy and lien searches, general banking references and commercial mortgage related references. In general, the analysis of
the collateral includes a site visit and a review of the property’s historical operating statements (if available), independent
market research, an appraisal with an emphasis on rental and sales comparables, engineering and environmental reports, the property’s
historic and current occupancy, financial strengths of tenants, the duration and terms of tenant leases and the use of the property.
Each report is reviewed for acceptability by a real estate finance loan underwriter. The borrower’s and property manager’s
experience and presence in the subject market are also reviewed. Consideration is also given to anticipated changes in cash flow
that may result from changes in lease terms or market considerations.
 
Borrowers are generally required to be single
purpose entities although they are generally not required to be structured to reduce the possibility of becoming insolvent or bankrupt
unless the loan has a principal balance of greater than $20 million, in which case additional limitations including the requirement
that the borrower have at least one independent director are required.
 
Loan Approval. All mortgage loans
originated or table funded by Barclays must be approved by a credit committee. The credit committee may approve a mortgage loan
as recommended, request additional due diligence, modify the loan terms or decline a loan transaction.
 
Debt Service Coverage Ratio and LTV Ratio.
Barclays’ underwriting standards generally mandate minimum debt service coverage ratios and maximum loan-to-value ratios.
A loan-to-value generally based upon the appraiser’s determination of value as well as the value derived using a stressed
capitalization rate is considered. The debt service coverage ratio is based upon the underwritten net cash flow and is given particular
importance. However, notwithstanding such guidelines, in certain circumstances the actual debt service coverage ratios, loan-to-value
ratios and amortization periods for the mortgage loans originated by Barclays may vary from these guidelines.
 


S-234
 

 
Escrow Requirements. Generally, Barclays
requires most borrowers to fund escrows for expenses such as taxes and insurance, capital expenses and replacement reserves, in
some cases upon triggers. In the case of certain hotel loans, FF&E reserves may be held by the franchisor or manager rather
than the lender. Generally, the required escrows for mortgage loans originated or acquired by Barclays are as follows (see Annex
A-1 to this free writing prospectus for instances in which reserves were not taken):
 

·Taxes – Typically an initial deposit and monthly escrow deposits equal to 1/12th of the annual property taxes (based
on the most recent property assessment and the current millage rate) are required to provide the lender with sufficient funds to
satisfy all taxes and assessments. Barclays may waive this escrow requirement under appropriate circumstances including, but not
limited to, (i) where a tenant is required to pay the taxes directly, (ii) where there is institutional sponsorship or a high net
worth individual, or (iii) where there is a low loan-to-value ratio.
 

·Insurance – If the property is insured under an individual policy (i.e., the property is not covered by a blanket
policy), typically an initial deposit and monthly escrow deposits equal to 1/12th of the annual property insurance premium are
required to provide the lender with sufficient funds to pay all insurance premiums. Barclays may waive this escrow requirement
under appropriate circumstances, including, but not limited to, (i) where a property is covered by a blanket insurance policy maintained
by the borrower or loan sponsor, (ii) where there is institutional sponsorship or a high net worth individual, (iii) where an investment
grade or creditworthy tenant is responsible for paying all insurance premiums, or (iv) where there is a low loan-to-value ratio.
 

·Replacement Reserves – Replacement reserves are generally calculated in accordance with the expected useful life of the
components of the property during the term of the mortgage loan plus two years. Barclays relies on information provided by an independent
engineer to make this determination. Barclays may waive this escrow requirement under appropriate circumstances, including, but
not limited to, (i) where an investment grade or creditworthy tenant is responsible for replacements under the terms of its lease,
(ii) where there is institutional sponsorship or a high net worth individual, or (iii) where there is a low loan-to-value ratio.
 

·Completion Repair/Environmental Remediation – Typically, a completion repair or remediation reserve is required where
an environmental or engineering report suggests that such reserve is necessary. Upon funding of the applicable mortgage loan, Barclays
generally requires that at least 110% – 125% of the estimated costs of repairs or replacements be reserved and generally
requires that repairs or replacements be completed within a year after the funding of the applicable mortgage loan. Barclays may
waive this escrow requirement under appropriate circumstances, including, but not limited to, (i) where a secured creditor insurance
policy or borrower insurance policy is in place, (ii) where an investment grade or creditworthy party has agreed to take responsibility,
and pay, for any required repair or remediation or (iii) the amount recommended is de
minimis.
 

·Tenant Improvement/Lease Commissions – In most cases, various tenants have lease expirations within the mortgage loan
term. To mitigate this risk, special reserves may be required to be funded either at closing of the mortgage loan and/or during
the mortgage loan term to cover certain anticipated leasing commissions or tenant improvement costs which might be associated with
re-leasing the space occupied by such tenants. Barclays may waive this escrow requirement under appropriate circumstances, including,
but not limited to, (i) where there is institutional sponsorship or a high net worth individual, (ii) where tenant improvement
costs are the responsibility of tenants, (iii) where rents at the Mortgaged Property are considered to be sufficiently below market,
(iv) where no material leases expire within the mortgage loan term, or the lease roll is not concentrated or (v) where there is
a low loan-to-value ratio.
 

·For certain mortgage loans, Barclays requires reserves only upon the occurrence of certain trigger events, such as debt service
coverage ratios or tenant-specific tests or occurrences.
 


S-235
 

 

·Other Factors – Other factors that are considered in the origination of a commercial mortgage loan include current operations,
occupancy and tenant base.
 
Servicing. Interim servicing for
all loans originated or acquired by Barclays prior to securitization is typically performed by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association.
 
Exceptions
to Barclays’ Disclosed Underwriting Guidelines
 
None of the Barclays Mortgage Loans have
exceptions to the related underwriting guidelines set forth above.
 
Compliance
with Rule 15Ga-1 under the Exchange Act
 
Barclays has most recently filed a Form
ABS 15G on June 30, 2015 in connection with it being a securitizer of certain types of mortgage loans. Barclays’ Central
Index Key is 0000312070. It has no history of repurchases or repurchase requests required to be reported by Barclays under Rule
15Ga-1 under the Exchange Act, as amended, with respect to breaches of representations and warranties made by it as a sponsor of
commercial mortgage loan securitizations.
 
The information set forth under this sub-heading
has been provided by Barclays.
 
Neither Barclays Bank PLC nor any of its
affiliates will insure or guarantee distributions on the certificates. The Certificateholders will have no rights or remedies against
Barclays Bank PLC for any losses or other claims in connection with the certificates or the mortgage loans except in respect of
the repurchase and substitution obligations for material document defects or the material breaches of representations and warranties
made by Barclays Bank PLC in the related Purchase Agreement as described under “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Representations
and Warranties; Repurchases and Substitution” in this free writing prospectus.
 
From time to time, Barclays is involved
in civil legal proceedings and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of its securitization
business. Although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of such matters, Barclays has denied, or believes it has
meritorious defenses and will deny, liability in all significant cases pending against it in its capacity as sponsor or mortgage
loan seller, and intends to defend actively each such case.
 
Starwood Mortgage Funding
II LLC
 
General
 
Starwood Mortgage Funding II LLC (“SMF
II”) is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the state of Delaware and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Starwood Mortgage Capital LLC (“SMC” and, together with its subsidiaries, including SMF II, “Starwood”).
SMC is affiliated with LNR Property LLC, an international commercial real estate company specializing in property development,
specialty finance, asset management, investing and special servicing of CMBS loans. SMF II is a sponsor of, and a seller of certain

Barclays Bank PLC provides warehouse financing
to SMF II through a master repurchase facility. All of the Starwood Mortgage Loans, except the mortgage loan identified as “Best
Buy Sanford, FL” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing approximately 12.3% of the Initial Pool Balance,
are subject to that repurchase facility. Proceeds received by SMF II in connection with the sale of the SMF II Mortgage Loans to
the depositor will be applied, among other things, to reacquire the financed mortgage loans and to make payments to Barclays Bank
PLC as the repurchase agreement counterparty.
 


S-236
 

 
SMF II is an affiliate of LNR Partners,
LLC, the initial special servicer, and of LNR Securities Holdings, LLC (or its affiliate), which is expected to purchase the Class

between Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, which is the master servicer, the certificate administrator, the custodian, the
certificate registrar and the 17g-5 information provider, and SMF II, which is a sponsor and an originator, Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association acts as interim servicer with respect to some or all of the mortgage loans to be contributed to this securitization
by SMF II.
 
Starwood’s
Securitization Program
 
This is the 40th commercial mortgage
securitization to which Starwood is contributing loans; however, certain key members of the senior management team of SMC were
senior officers at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, Deutsche Bank Mortgage Capital, L.L.C., Wachovia Bank and Banc of America
Securities. These members of the senior management team have been active in the commercial mortgage securitization business since
1992, and have been directly and/or indirectly responsible for the origination and/or securitization of several billion dollars
of loans. Starwood securitized approximately $5.28 billion of commercial loans in its prior securitizations.
 
Starwood originates commercial mortgage
loans that are secured by retail shopping centers, office buildings, multifamily apartment complexes, hotels, mixed use, self storage
and industrial properties located in North America. Starwood’s securitization program generally provides fixed rate mortgage
loans having maturities between five and ten years. Additionally, Starwood may from time to time provide bridge/transitional loans,
mezzanine loans and preferred equity structures.
 
Review
of SMF II Mortgage Loans
 
Overview. SMF II has conducted a
review of the SMF II mortgage loans (the “SMF II Mortgage Loans”) in connection with the securitization described
in this free writing prospectus. The review of the SMF II Mortgage Loans was performed by a team comprised of real estate and securitization
professionals who are employees of Starwood or one or more of its affiliates (the “Starwood Review Team”). The
review procedures described below were employed with respect to all of the SMF II Mortgage Loans. No sampling procedures were used
in the review process.
 
Database. To prepare for securitization,
members of the Starwood Review Team created a database of loan-level and property-level information relating to each SMF II Mortgage
Loan. The database was compiled from, among other sources, the related mortgage loan documents, appraisals, environmental assessment
reports, property condition reports, seismic studies, zoning reports, insurance review summaries, borrower-supplied information
(including, but not limited to, rent rolls, leases, operating statements and budgets) and information collected by the Starwood
Review Team during the underwriting process. After origination of each SMF II Mortgage Loan, the Starwood Review Team updated the
information in the database with respect to such SMF II Mortgage Loan based on updates provided by the related servicer relating
to loan payment status and escrows, updated operating statements, rent rolls and leasing activity, and information otherwise brought
to the attention of the Starwood Review Team.
 
A data tape (the “SMF II Data Tape”)
containing detailed information regarding each SMF II Mortgage Loan was created from the information in the database referred to
in the prior paragraph. The SMF II Data Tape was used to provide the numerical information regarding the SMF II Mortgage Loans
in this free writing prospectus.
 
Data Comparison and Recalculation.
SMF II engaged a third party accounting firm to perform certain data comparison and recalculation procedures, the nature, extent
and timing of which were designed by SMF II, relating to information in this free writing prospectus regarding the SMF II Mortgage
Loans. These procedures included:
 


S-237
 

 

·comparing the information in the SMF II Data Tape against various source documents provided by SMF II that are described above
under “—Database”;
 

·comparing numerical information regarding the SMF II Mortgage Loans and the related Mortgaged Properties disclosed in this
free writing prospectus against the SMF II Data Tape; and
 

·recalculating certain percentages, ratios and other formulae relating to the SMF II Mortgage Loans disclosed in this free writing
prospectus.
 
Legal Review. Starwood engaged various
law firms to conduct certain legal reviews of the SMF II Mortgage Loans for disclosure in this free writing prospectus. In anticipation
of the securitization of each SMF II Mortgage Loan, Starwood’s origination counsel reviewed a form of securitization representations
and warranties at origination and, if applicable, identified exceptions to those representations and warranties. Starwood’s
origination and underwriting staff performed a similar review and prepared similar exception reports.
 
Legal counsel was also engaged in connection
with this securitization to assist in the review of the SMF II Mortgage Loans. Such assistance included, among other things, (i)
a review of Starwood’s internal credit memorandum for each SMF II Mortgage Loan, (ii) a review of the representations and
warranties and exception reports referred to above relating to the SMF II Mortgage Loans prepared by origination counsel, (iii)
the review and assistance in the completion by the Starwood Review Team of a due diligence questionnaire relating to the SMF II
Mortgage Loans, and (iv) the review of certain loan documents with respect to the SMF II Mortgage Loans.
 
Other Review Procedures. With respect
to any material pending litigation of which Starwood was aware at the origination of any SMF II Mortgage Loan, Starwood requested
updates from the related borrower, origination counsel and/or borrower’s litigation counsel.
 
The Starwood Review Team, with the assistance
of counsel engaged in connection with this securitization, also reviewed the SMF II Mortgage Loans to determine whether any SMF
II Mortgage Loan materially deviated from the underwriting guidelines set forth under “—SMF II’s Underwriting
Guidelines and Processes” below. See “—Exceptions to SMF II’s Disclosed Underwriting Guidelines”
below.
 
Findings and Conclusions. Based on
the foregoing review procedures, Starwood determined that the disclosure regarding the SMF II Mortgage Loans in this free writing
prospectus is accurate in all material respects. Starwood also determined that the SMF II Mortgage Loans were originated in accordance
with Starwood’s origination procedures and underwriting criteria, except as described below under
“—Exceptions to SMF II’s Disclosed Underwriting Guidelines” below. SMF II attributes to itself all
findings and conclusions resulting from the foregoing review procedures.
 
Review Procedures in the Event of a Mortgage
Loan Substitution. SMF II will perform a review of any mortgage loan that it elects to substitute for a mortgage loan in the
pool in connection with a material breach of a representation or warranty or a material document defect. SMF II, and if appropriate
its legal counsel, will review the mortgage loan documents of the substitute mortgage loan to confirm it meets each of the criteria
required under the terms of the related Purchase Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
SMF II’s
Underwriting Guidelines and Processes
 
Overview. Set forth below is a discussion
of certain general underwriting guidelines with respect to mortgage loans originated by Starwood for securitization.
 
Notwithstanding the discussion below, given
the unique nature of commercial mortgaged properties, the underwriting and origination procedures and the credit analysis with
respect to any particular commercial mortgage loan may significantly differ from one asset to another, and will be driven by circumstances
particular to that property, including, among others, the property type, current use, size, location, market conditions, reserve
requirements, additional collateral, tenant quality and lease terms,
 


S-238
 

 
borrower
identity, sponsorship, performance history and/or other factors. Therefore, this general description of SMF II’s origination
procedures and underwriting criteria is not intended as a representation that every commercial mortgage loan originated by it
complies entirely with all procedures and criteria set forth below. For important information about the circumstances that have
affected the underwriting of an SMF II Mortgage Loan in the mortgage pool, see the “Risk Factors” section of
this free writing prospectus, the other subsections of this “Transaction Parties—The Sponsors and Mortgage Loan
Sellers” section and “Annex D-2—Exceptions to Mortgage Loan Representations and Warranties”
in this free writing prospectus.
 
If a mortgage loan exhibits any one or more
of the following characteristics, variances from general underwriting/origination procedures described below may be considered
acceptable under the circumstances indicated: (i) low loan-to-value ratio; (ii) high debt service coverage ratio; (iii) experienced
property loan sponsor(s)/guarantor(s) with financial wherewithal; (iv) additional springing reserves; (v) cash flow sweeps; and
(vi) elements of recourse included in the mortgage loan.
 
Loan Analysis. Generally, both a
credit analysis and a collateral analysis are conducted with respect to each mortgage loan. The credit analysis of the borrower
generally includes a review of third-party credit reports and/or judgment, lien, bankruptcy and pending litigation searches. The
collateral analysis generally includes a review of, in each case to the extent available and applicable, the historical property
operating statements, rent rolls and certain significant tenant leases. The credit underwriting also generally includes a review
of third party appraisals, as well as environmental reports, engineering assessments, zoning reports and seismic reports, if applicable,
and obtained. Generally, a member of the mortgage loan underwriting team also conducts a site inspection to ascertain the overall
quality, functionality and competitiveness of the property, including its neighborhood and market, accessibility and visibility,
and to assess the tenancy of the property. The submarket in which the property is located is assessed to evaluate competitive or
comparable properties as well as market trends. Unless otherwise specified in this free writing prospectus, all financial, occupancy
and other information contained in this free writing prospectus is based on such information and we cannot assure you that such
financial, occupancy and other information remains accurate.
 
Loan Approval. All mortgage loans
originated by Starwood require approval by a loan credit committee which includes senior executives of SMC. The committee may approve
a mortgage loan as recommended, request additional due diligence prior to approval, approve it subject to modifications of the
loan terms or decline a loan transaction.
 
Debt Service Coverage Ratio and Loan-to-Value
Ratio. Generally, the debt service coverage ratio for mortgage loans originated by Starwood will be equal to or greater than
1.20x and the loan-to-value ratio for mortgage loans originated by Starwood will be equal to or less than 80%; provided, however,
that the underwriting guidelines provide that exceptions may be made when consideration is given to circumstances particular to
the mortgage loan, the related property, loan-to-value ratio, reserves or other factors. For example, Starwood may originate a
mortgage loan with a debt service coverage ratio below 1.20x based on, among other things, the amortization features of the mortgage
loan (for example, if the mortgage loan provides for relatively rapid amortization), the type of tenants and leases at the property,
the taking of additional collateral such as reserves, letters of credit and/or guarantees, Starwood’s judgment of improved
property and/or market performance and/or other relevant factors.
 
In addition, with respect to certain mortgage
loans originated by Starwood, there may exist subordinate debt secured by the related property and/or mezzanine debt secured by
direct or indirect ownership interests in the borrower. Such mortgage loans may have a lower debt service coverage ratio, and a
higher loan-to-value ratio, if such subordinate or mezzanine debt is taken into account. Also, certain mortgage loans may provide
for only interest payments prior to maturity, or for an interest-only period during a portion of the term of the mortgage loan.
The debt service coverage ratio guideline discussed above is calculated based on values determined at the origination of the mortgage
loan.
 
Additional Debt. Certain mortgage
loans originated by Starwood may have, or permit in the future, certain additional subordinate debt, whether secured or unsecured.
It is possible that an affiliate of Starwood may be the lender on that additional debt.
 


S-239
 

 
The debt service coverage ratios described
above will be lower based on the inclusion of the payments related to such additional debt and the loan-to-value ratios described
above will be higher based on the inclusion of the amount of any such additional debt.
 
Assessments of Property Condition.
As part of the underwriting process, the property assessments and reports described below generally will be obtained:
 

·Appraisals. Independent appraisals or an update of an independent appraisal is required in connection with the origination
of each mortgage loan. Starwood requires that the appraiser comply with and abide by Title XI of the Financial Institution Reform,
Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (although such act is not applicable to Starwood) and the Uniform Standards of Professional
Appraisal Practice.
 

·Environmental Assessment. Phase I environmental assessments that conform to the American Society for Testing and Materials
(ASTM) Standard E 1527-05 entitled, “Standard Practices for Environmental Site Assessment: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment
Process,” as may be amended from time to time, are performed on all properties. However, when circumstances warrant, an update
of a prior environmental assessment, a transaction screen or a desktop review may be utilized. Nevertheless, an environmental assessment
conducted at any particular real property collateral will not necessarily uncover all potential environmental issues.
 

·Depending on the findings of the initial environmental assessment, any of the following may be required: additional environmental
testing, such as a Phase II environmental assessment with respect to the subject real property collateral; an environmental insurance
policy; and/or a guaranty or reserves with respect to environmental matters.
 

·Property Condition Assessments. Inspections or updates of previously conducted inspections are conducted by independent
licensed engineers or architects or both for all properties in connection with the origination of a mortgage loan. The inspections
are conducted to inspect the exterior walls, roofing, interior construction, mechanical and electrical systems and general condition
of the site, buildings and other improvements located at a property. The resulting reports on some of the properties may indicate
a variety of deferred maintenance items and recommended capital expenditures. In some instances, repairs or maintenance are completed
before closing or cash reserves are established to fund the deferred maintenance or replacement items or both.
 

·Seismic Report. Generally, a seismic report is required for all properties located in seismic zones 3 or 4.
 

·Zoning and Building Code Compliance. With respect to each mortgage loan, Starwood will generally consider whether the
use and occupancy of the related real property collateral is in material compliance with zoning, land-use, building rules, regulations
and orders then applicable to that property. Evidence of this compliance may be in the form of one or more of the following: legal
opinions; surveys; recorded documents; temporary or permanent certificates of occupancy; letters from government officials or agencies;
title insurance endorsements; engineering or consulting reports; and/or representations by the related borrower.
 
However, the underwriting guidelines provide
that Starwood may, on a case-by-case basis, consider a loan secured by a property that does not conform to current zoning regulations
governing density, size, set-backs or parking for the property under certain circumstances including, but not limited to, when
(i) legislation or the local zoning or housing authority permits the improvements to be rebuilt to pre-damage use, size and density
in the event of partial or full destruction; and (ii) documentation of such permission is submitted in the form of legislation
or a variance letter or certificate of rebuildability from the zoning authority.
 
Escrow Requirements. Generally, Starwood
requires most borrowers to fund various escrows for taxes and insurance, capital expenses and replacement reserves. Generally,
the required escrows for mortgage loans originated by Starwood are as follows:
 


S-240
 

 

·Taxes – typically, an initial deposit and monthly escrow deposits equal to 1/12th of the annual property taxes (based
on the most recent property assessment and the current millage rate) are required to provide Starwood with sufficient funds to
satisfy all taxes and assessments, except that such escrows are not required in certain circumstances, including, but not limited
to, (i) if there is an institutional loan sponsor or high net worth individual loan sponsor, or (ii) if the related mortgaged property
is a single tenant property in which the related tenant is required to pay taxes directly.
 

·Insurance – if the property is insured under an individual policy (i.e., the property is not covered by a blanket
policy), typically an initial deposit and monthly escrow deposits equal to 1/12th of the annual property insurance premium are
required to provide Starwood with sufficient funds to pay all insurance premiums, except that such escrows are not required in
certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, (i) if the related borrower maintains a blanket insurance policy, or (ii)
if the related mortgaged property is a single tenant property and the related tenant self-insures.
 

·Replacement Reserves – replacement reserves are generally calculated in accordance with the expected useful life of the
components of the property during the term of the mortgage loan, except that such escrows are not required in certain circumstances,
including, but not limited to, if the related mortgaged property is a single tenant property and the related tenant is responsible
for all repairs and maintenance, including those required with respect to the roof and improvement structure.
 

·Completion Repair/Environmental Remediation – typically, a completion repair or remediation reserve is required where
an environmental or engineering report suggests that such reserve is necessary. Upon funding of the applicable mortgage loan, Starwood
generally requires that at least 125% of the estimated costs of repairs or replacements be reserved and generally requires that
repairs or replacements be completed within a year after the funding of the applicable mortgage loan, except that such escrows
are not required in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, (i) if the sponsor of the borrower delivers a guarantee
with respect to such matter, (ii) if the estimated cost of such repair or remediation does not materially impact the property’s
function, performance or value, or if the related mortgaged property is a single tenant property for which the tenant is responsible
for such repair or remediation or (iii) if environmental insurance is obtained or already in place.
 

·Tenant Improvement/Lease Commissions – in most cases, various tenants have lease expirations within the loan term. To
mitigate this risk, special reserves may be required to be funded either at closing of the mortgage loan and/or during the related
loan term to cover certain anticipated leasing commissions or tenant improvement costs which might be associated with re-leasing
the space occupied by such tenants, except that such escrows are not required in certain circumstances, including, but not limited
to, (i) if the related mortgaged property is a single tenant property and the related tenant’s lease extends beyond the loan
term, or (ii) where rent at the related mortgaged property is considered below market.
 
Furthermore, Starwood may accept an alternative
to a cash escrow or reserve from a borrower, such as a letter of credit or a guarantee from the borrower or an affiliate of the
borrower or periodic evidence that the items for which the escrow or reserve would have been established are being paid or addressed.
In some cases, Starwood may determine that establishing an escrow or reserve is not warranted given the amounts that would be involved
and Starwood’s evaluation of the ability of the property, the borrower or a holder of direct or indirect ownership interests
in the borrower to bear the subject expense or cost absent creation of an escrow or reserve.
 
For a description of the escrows collected
with respect to the SMF II Mortgage Loans, please see Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus.
 
Title Insurance Policy. The borrower
is required to provide, and Starwood or its origination counsel typically will review, a title insurance policy for each property.
The title insurance policies provided
 


S-241
 
 
typically
must meet the following requirements: (a) written by a title insurer licensed to do business in the jurisdiction where the mortgaged
property is located, (b) in an amount at least equal to the original principal balance of the mortgage loan, (c) protection and
benefits run to the mortgagee and its successors and assigns, (d) written on an American Land Title Association form or equivalent
policy promulgated in the jurisdiction where the mortgaged property is located and (e) if a survey was prepared, the legal description
of the mortgaged property in the title policy conforms to that shown on the survey.
 
Property Insurance. Starwood typically
requires the borrower to provide one or more of the following insurance policies: (1) commercial general liability insurance for
bodily injury or death and property damage; (2) an “All Risk of Physical Loss” policy; (3) if applicable, boiler and
machinery coverage; and (4) if the mortgaged property is located in a special flood hazard area where mandatory flood insurance
purchase requirements apply, flood insurance. In some cases, a sole tenant is responsible for maintaining insurance and, subject
to the satisfaction of rating conditions or net worth criteria, is allowed to self-insure against the risks.
 
Exceptions
to SMF II’s Disclosed Underwriting Guidelines
 
None of the SMF II Mortgage Loans have exceptions
to the applicable underwriting guidelines set forth above.
 
Servicing
 
Interim servicing for all loans originated
by Starwood prior to securitization is typically performed by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. In addition, primary servicing
is occasionally retained by certain mortgage brokerage firms under established sub-servicing agreements with Starwood, which firms
may continue primary servicing certain loans following the securitization closing date. Otherwise, servicing responsibilities are
transferred from the interim servicer to the master servicer of the securitization trust at the closing of the securitization.
From time to time, the interim servicer may retain primary servicing.
 
Compliance
with Rule 15Ga-1 under the Exchange Act
 
Starwood has no history as a securitizer
prior to February 2012. SMC most recently filed a Form ABS-15G on February 13, 2015. SMC’s Central Index Key is 0001548405.
Starwood has no demand, repurchase or replacement history to report as required by Rule 15Ga-1.
 
MC-Five Mile Commercial
Mortgage Finance LLC 
 
General
 
MC-Five Mile Commercial Mortgage Finance
LLC (“MC-Five Mile”) is a sponsor with respect to, and a seller of certain mortgage loans (the “MC-Five
Mile Mortgage Loans”) into, the securitization described in this free writing prospectus. MC-Five Mile is a limited liability
company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware.

Association acts as interim servicer with respect to certain of the mortgage loans to be contributed to this securitization by
MC-Five Mile.
 


S-242
 

 
MC-Five
Mile’s Securitization Program
 
MC-Five Mile underwrites and originates
mortgage loans secured by commercial or multifamily properties for its securitization program. As sponsor, MC-Five Mile sells fixed
rate first mortgage loans it originates through commercial mortgage-backed securitizations. This is MC-Five Mile’s twenty-first
securitization. In its prior securitizations, MC-Five Mile securitized mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance of approximately
$2.5 billion as of the cut-off date for such securitizations. MC-Five Mile was formed on July 12, 2012 and through various entities,
is a 50%/50% joint venture between MC Asset Management Holdings, LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corporation) and
Five Mile Capital Partners LLC.
 
Five Mile Capital Partners LLC was established
in 2003 and has over $2 billion of assets under management. Five Mile Capital Partners LLC specializes in investment opportunities
in commercial real estate, debt products, structured finance, asset-based lending and financial services private equity. MC Asset
Management Holdings, LLC is an alternative asset management firm that provides alternative investment products to global institutional
investors. MC Asset Management Holdings, LLC is a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corporation.
 
The commercial mortgage loans originated
or acquired by MC-Five Mile are fixed rate loans and include both smaller “conduit” loans and large loans. MC-Five
Mile primarily originates loans secured by retail, office, multifamily, hospitality, industrial and manufactured housing properties,
but also can originate loans secured by self storage properties, theaters, land subject to a ground lease and mixed use properties.
 
As a sponsor, MC-Five Mile originates or
acquires mortgage loans and, either by itself or together with other sponsors or loan sellers, intends to initiate their securitization
by transferring the mortgage loans to a depositor, which in turn transfers them to the trust for the related securitization. In
coordination with other underwriters, MC-Five Mile works with rating agencies, loan sellers, subordinated debt purchasers and master
servicers in structuring the securitization transaction. MC-Five Mile acts as sponsor, originator or loan seller in transactions
in which other entities act as sponsor and/or mortgage loan seller. Some of these loan sellers may be affiliated with underwriters
on the transactions.
 
Neither MC-Five Mile nor any of its affiliates
acts as master servicer of the commercial mortgage loans in its securitizations. Instead, MC-Five Mile sells the right to be appointed
master servicer of its securitized loans to rating-agency approved master servicers.
 
Review
of MC-Five Mile’s Mortgage Loans
 
Overview. MC-Five Mile conducted
a review of the MC-Five Mile Mortgage Loans in connection with the securitization described in this free writing prospectus. The
review of the MC-Five Mile Mortgage Loans was performed by a team comprised of real estate and securitization professionals who
are employees of MC-Five Mile or one of its affiliates (the “MC-Five Mile Deal Team”). The review procedures
described below were employed with respect to all of the MC-Five Mile Mortgage Loans, except that certain review procedures only
were relevant to the large loan disclosures in this free writing prospectus, as further described below. No sampling procedures
were used in the review process.
 
Database. To prepare for securitization,
members of the MC-Five Mile Deal Team created a database of loan level and property-level information relating to each MC-Five
Mile Mortgage Loan. The database was compiled from, among other sources, the related mortgage loan documents, third party reports,
zoning reports, if applicable, insurance policies or summaries of the same prepared by an outside insurance consultant, borrower
supplied information (including, but not limited to, rent rolls, leases, operating statements and budgets) and information collected
by MC-Five Mile during the underwriting process. After origination of each MC-Five Mile Mortgage Loan, the MC-Five Mile Deal Team
updated the information in the database with respect to the MC-Five Mile Mortgage Loan based on updates provided by the related
servicer relating to loan payment status and escrows, updated operating statements, rent rolls and leasing activity, and information
otherwise brought to the attention of the MC-Five Mile Deal Team.
 


S-243
 

 
A data tape (the “MC-Five Mile
Data Tape”) containing detailed information regarding each MC-Five Mile Mortgage Loan was created from the information
in the database referred to in the prior paragraph. The MC-Five Mile Data Tape was used by the MC-Five Mile Deal Team to provide
certain numerical information regarding the MC-Five Mile Mortgage Loans in this free writing prospectus.
 
Data Comparison and Recalculation.
MC-Five Mile engaged a third party accounting firm to perform certain data comparison and recalculation procedures designed by
MC-Five Mile, relating to information in this free writing prospectus regarding the MC-Five Mile Mortgage Loans. These procedures
included:
 
·       comparing certain information
in the MC-Five Mile Data Tape against various source documents provided by MC-Five Mile that are described above under “—Database”;
 
·       comparing numerical information
regarding the MC-Five Mile Mortgage Loans and the related Mortgaged Properties disclosed in this free writing prospectus against
the MC-Five Mile Data Tape; and
 
·       recalculating certain percentages,
ratios and other formulae relating to the MC-Five Mile Mortgage Loans disclosed in this free writing prospectus.
 
Legal Review. MC-Five Mile engaged
various law firms to conduct certain legal reviews of the MC-Five Mile Mortgage Loans for disclosure in this free writing prospectus.
In anticipation of the securitization of each MC-Five Mile Mortgage Loan, origination counsel assisted in the preparation of certain
due diligence questionnaires designed to identify material deviations from MC-Five Mile’s standard form loan documents. In
addition, origination counsel for each MC-Five Mile Mortgage Loan reviewed MC-Five Mile’s representations and warranties
set forth on Annex D-1 to this free writing prospectus and, if applicable, identified exceptions to those representations and warranties.
 
Securitization counsel was also engaged
to assist in the review of the MC-Five Mile Mortgage Loans. Such assistance included, among other things, (i) a review of sections
of the loan agreement relating to certain MC-Five Mile Mortgage Loans marked against the standard form document, (ii) a review
of a due diligence questionnaire completed by the MC-Five Mile Deal Team and (iii) the review of certain loan documents with respect
to the MC-Five Mile Mortgage Loans. Securitization counsel also reviewed the property release provisions, if any, for each MC-Five
Mile Mortgage Loan with multiple Mortgaged Properties for compliance with the REMIC Provisions of the Code.
 
Other Review Procedures. With respect
to any material pending litigation that existed at the origination of any MC-Five Mile Mortgage Loan, MC-Five Mile requested updates
from the related borrower, origination counsel and/or borrower’s litigation counsel. If MC-Five Mile became aware of a significant
natural disaster in the vicinity of any Mortgaged Property securing a MC-Five Mile Mortgage Loan, MC-Five Mile obtained information
on the status of the Mortgaged Property from the related borrower to confirm that no material damage to the Mortgaged Property
had occurred, or in the event that any such damage had occurred, that the Mortgaged Property was in adequate physical condition
(based on a report prepared by an independent licensed engineer or architect).
 
The MC-Five Mile Deal Team, with the assistance
of counsel engaged in connection with this securitization transaction, also reviewed the MC-Five Mile Mortgage Loans to determine
whether any MC-Five Mile Mortgage.
 
Loan materially deviated from the underwriting
guidelines set forth under “—The Sponsors and Mortgage Loan Sellers—MC-Five Mile Commercial Mortgage Finance
LLC” below. See “MC-Five Mile’s Underwriting Guidelines and Processes” below. See “—Exceptions
to MC-Five Mile’s Disclosed Underwriting Guidelines” below.
 
Findings and Conclusions. Based on
the foregoing review procedures, MC-Five Mile determined that the disclosure regarding the MC-Five Mile Mortgage Loans in this
free writing prospectus is accurate in all material respects. MC-Five Mile also determined that the MC-Five Mile Mortgage Loans
were originated in accordance with MC-Five Mile’s origination procedures and underwriting criteria. MC-Five Mile attributes
to itself all findings and conclusions resulting from the foregoing review procedures.

MC-Five
Mile’s Underwriting Guidelines and Processes
 
Overview. Set forth below is a discussion
of certain general underwriting guidelines and processes with respect to the mortgage loans originated by MC-Five Mile for securitization.
 
Notwithstanding the discussion below, given
the unique nature of commercial or multifamily mortgaged properties, the underwriting and origination procedures and the credit
analysis with respect to any particular commercial or multifamily mortgage loan may significantly differ from one asset to another,
and will be driven by circumstances particular to that property, including, among others, the property type, current and alternative
uses, size, location, market conditions, reserve requirements, additional collateral, tenant quality and lease terms, borrower
identity, sponsorship, performance history and/or other factors. Therefore, this general description of MC-Five Mile’s origination
procedures and underwriting criteria is not intended as a representation that every commercial mortgage loan originated by it complies
entirely with all procedures and criteria set forth below. For important information about the circumstances that have affected
the underwriting of particular MC-Five Mile Mortgage Loans, see the “Risk Factors” section of this free writing
prospectus, the other subsections of this “Transaction Parties—The Sponsors and Mortgage Loan Sellers”
section and “Annex D-2—Exceptions to Mortgage Loan Representations and Warranties” in this free writing
prospectus.
 
If a mortgage loan exhibits any one or more
of the following characteristics, variances from general underwriting/origination procedures described below may be considered
acceptable under the circumstances indicated: (i) low loan-to-value ratio; (ii) high debt service coverage ratio; (iii) experienced
property sponsor(s)/guarantor(s) with financial wherewithal; (iv) additional springing reserves; (v) cash flow sweeps; and (vi)
elements of recourse included in the mortgage loan.
 
Loan Analysis. Generally both a credit
analysis and a collateral analysis are conducted with respect to each mortgage loan. The credit analysis of the borrower generally
includes a review of third party credit reports and/or judgment, lien, bankruptcy and pending litigation searches, prior experience
as an owner and operator of commercial real estate properties and the borrower’s financial capacity. The collateral analysis
generally includes a review of, in each case to the extent available and applicable, the historical property operating statements,
rent rolls and certain significant tenant leases. The credit underwriting also generally includes a review of third party appraisals,
as well as environmental reports, engineering assessments and, if applicable, zoning reports and seismic reports. Generally, a
member of the loan underwriting team also conducts or causes a third party to conduct a site inspection to ascertain the overall
quality, functionality and competitiveness of the property, including its neighborhood and market, accessibility and visibility,
and to assess the tenancy of the property. Unless otherwise specified in this free writing prospectus, all financial, occupancy
and other information contained in this free writing prospectus is based on such information and we cannot assure you that such
financial, occupancy and other information remains accurate.
 
Loan Approval. All mortgage loans
originated by MC-Five Mile require approval by an investment committee which includes senior executives of Five Mile Capital Partners
LLC and MC Asset Management Holdings, LLC. The committee may approve a mortgage loan as recommended, request additional due diligence
prior to approval, approve it subject to modifications of the loan terms or decline the proposed loan.
 
Debt Service Coverage Ratio and Loan-to-Value
Ratio. The underwriting includes a calculation of debt service coverage ratio and loan-to-value ratio in connection with the
origination of each loan. MC-Five Mile’s underwriting guidelines generally require, without regard to any other debt, a debt
service coverage ratio (calculated for this purpose using a 30-year amortization schedule) of not less than 1.25x (or 1.20x for
multifamily properties) and a loan-to-value ratio of not more than 75%. MC-Five Mile may
 


S-245
 
 
originate
a mortgage loan with a debt service coverage ratio below 1.25x based on, among other things, the amortization features of the
mortgage loan, the type of tenants and leases at the property, the taking of additional collateral such as reserves, letters of
credit and/or guarantees, MC-Five Mile’s judgment of improved property and/or market performance and/or other relevant factors.
 
The debt service coverage ratio will generally
be calculated based on the ratio of the underwritten net cash flow from the property in question as determined by MC-Five Mile
and payments on the loan based on actual (or, in some cases, assumed) principal and/or interest due on the loan. However, underwritten
net cash flow is often a highly subjective number based on a variety of assumptions regarding, and adjustments to, revenues and
expenses with respect to the related real property collateral. For example, when calculating the debt service coverage ratio for
a multifamily or commercial mortgage loan, annual net cash flow that was calculated based on assumptions regarding projected future
rental income, expenses and/or occupancy may be utilized. We cannot assure you that the foregoing assumptions made with respect
to any prospective multifamily or commercial mortgage loan will, in fact, be consistent with actual property performance. As described
above, for the purpose of determining whether a mortgage loan’s debt service coverage ratio meets MC-Five Mile’s underwriting
criteria, the debt service coverage ratio is calculated based on a debt service payment using a 30-year amortization term, however
if a loan’s debt service coverage ratio is less than 1.25x because its debt service payment is calculated on an amortization
schedule less than 30 years but its debt service coverage ratio calculated using a 30-year amortization term is equal to or greater
than 1.25x, that loan meets MC-Five Mile’s underwriting criteria for debt service coverage ratio. The loan-to-value ratio,
in general, is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the then-outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loan divided by
the estimated value of the related property based on an appraisal.
 
Additional Debt. Certain mortgage
loans may have or permit in the future certain additional subordinate debt, whether secured or unsecured, and/or mezzanine. It
is possible that an affiliate of MC-Five Mile may be the lender on that additional debt.
 
The debt service coverage ratios described
above will be lower based on the inclusion of the payments related to such additional debt and the loan-to-value ratios described
above will be higher based on the inclusion of the amount of any such additional subordinate debt and/or mezzanine debt.
 
Mortgage Loan Terms. MC-Five Mile’s
underwriting guidelines generally require that the term of a mortgage loan be not less than five years and not more than ten years.
 
Assessments of Property Condition.
As part of the underwriting process, the property assessments and reports described below will typically be obtained:
 

·Appraisals. Independent appraisals or an update of an independent appraisal will generally be required in connection
with the origination of each mortgage loan. Each appraisal must meet the requirements of the “Uniform Standards of Professional
Appraisal Practice” as adopted by the Appraisal Standards Board of the Appraisal Foundation, or the guidelines in Title XI
of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989. The appraisal is based on the current use of the Mortgaged
Property and must include an estimate of the then-current market value of the property “as-is” in its then-current
condition although in certain cases, MC-Five Mile may also obtain a value on an “as-stabilized” basis reflecting leases
that have been executed but tenants have not commenced paying rent or on an “as-completed” basis reflecting completion
of capital improvements that are being undertaken at the Mortgaged Property. In some cases, however, the value of the subject real
property collateral may be established based on a cash flow analysis, a recent sales price or another method or benchmark of valuation.
MC-Five Mile then determines the loan-to-value ratio of the mortgage loan in each case based on the value set forth in the appraisal.
 

·Environmental Assessment. Phase I ESA that confirm with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard E
1527 05 entitled, “Standard Practices for Environmental Site Assessment: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process”,
are required with respect to the real property collateral for each mortgage loan as may be amended from time to time, are performed
on all properties. However, when circumstances warrant, an update of a prior environmental
 


S-246
 

 


assessment, a transaction screen or a desktop review may be utilized.
  Furthermore, an ESA conducted at any particular real property collateral will not necessarily
  cover all potential environmental issues.

 
Depending on the findings of the initial
environmental assessment additional environmental testing, such as a Phase II environmental assessment with respect to the subject
real property collateral may be required. In cases in which the ESA identifies conditions that would require cleanup, remedial
action or any other response, MC-Five Mile either (i) determines that another party with sufficient assets is responsible for taking
remedial actions directed by an applicable regulatory authority or (ii) requires the borrower to do one of the following: (A) carry
out satisfactory remediation activities or other responses prior to the origination of the mortgage loan, (B) establish an operations
and maintenance plan, (C) place sufficient funds in escrow or establish a letter of credit at the time of origination of the mortgage
loan to complete such remediation within a specified period of time, (D) obtain an environmental insurance policy for the Mortgaged
Property, (E) provide or obtain an indemnity agreement or a guaranty with respect to such condition or circumstance, or (F) receive
appropriate assurances that significant remediation activities or other significant responses are not necessary or required.
 

·Engineering Assessment. Inspections are conducted by independent licensed engineers or architects or both for all properties
in connection with the origination process. The inspections are conducted to assess the structure, exterior walls, roofing, interior
structure and/or mechanical and electrical systems and general condition of the site, buildings and other improvements located
at a property. The resulting report may identify deferred maintenance and/or recommended capital expenditures, corrections or replacements.
In cases in which the engineering assessment identifies material repairs or replacements needed immediately, MC-Five Mile generally
requires the borrower to carry out such repairs or replacements prior to the origination of the mortgage loan, or, in many cases,
requires the borrower to place sufficient funds in escrow at the time of origination of the mortgage loan to complete such repairs
or replacements within not more than twelve months. In certain instances, MC-Five Mile may waive such escrows but require the related
borrower to complete such repairs within a stated period of time in the related mortgage loan documents.
 

·Seismic Report. Generally, a seismic report is required for all properties located in seismic zones 3 or 4.
 
Title Insurance Policy. The borrower
is required to provide, and MC-Five Mile, or its counsel reviews, a title insurance policy for each Mortgaged Property. The title
insurance policy must meet the following requirements: (a) the policy must be written by a title insurer licensed to do business
in the jurisdiction where the Mortgaged Property is located; (b) the policy must be in an amount equal to the original principal
balance of the mortgage loan (or with respect to a mortgage loan secured by multiple Mortgaged Properties, an amount at least equal
to the allocated loan amount with respect to the title policy for each such Mortgaged Property); (c) the protection and benefits
must run to the mortgagee and its successors and assigns; (d) the policy should be written on a standard policy form of the American
Land Title Association or equivalent policy promulgated in the jurisdiction where the Mortgaged Property is located; and (e) the
legal description of the Mortgaged Property in the title policy must conform to that shown on the survey of the Mortgaged Property.
 
Property Insurance. Except in certain
instances where sole or significant tenants (which may include ground lease tenants) are required to obtain insurance or may self-insure,
the borrower is required to provide, and MC-Five Mile’s insurance consultant reviews, certificates of required insurance
with respect to the Mortgaged Property. Such insurance may include: (1) commercial general liability insurance for bodily injury
or death and property damage; (2) a fire and extended perils insurance policy providing “special” form coverage including
coverage against loss or damage by fire, lightning, explosion, smoke, windstorm and hail, riot or strike and civil commotion; (3)
if applicable, boiler and machinery coverage; (4) if the Mortgaged Property is located in a flood hazard area, flood insurance;
and (5) such other coverage as MC-Five Mile may require based on the specific characteristics of the Mortgaged Property.
 
Zoning and Building Code Compliance.
In connection with the origination of a multifamily or commercial mortgage loan, MC-Five Mile will examine whether the use and
occupancy of the related real
 


S-247
 
 
property
collateral is in material compliance with zoning, land-use, building rules, regulations and orders then applicable to that property.
Evidence of this compliance may be in the form of one or more of the following: a zoning report, legal opinions, surveys, recorded
documents, temporary or permanent certificates of occupancy, letters from government officials or agencies, title insurance endorsements,
engineering or consulting reports and/or representations by the related borrower.
 
In some cases, a Mortgaged Property may
constitute a legal non-conforming use or structure. In those cases, MC-Five Mile may require an endorsement to the title insurance
policy and/or the acquisition of law and ordinance insurance with respect to the particular non conformity unless it determines
that: (i) the non-conformity should not have a material adverse effect on the ability of the borrower to rebuild; or (ii) if the
improvements are rebuilt in accordance with currently applicable law, the value and performance of the property would be acceptable;
or (iii) any major casualty that would prevent rebuilding has a sufficiently remote likelihood of occurring; or (iv) a cash reserve,
a letter of credit or an agreement from a principal of the borrower is provided to cover losses.
 
Escrow Requirements. MC-Five Mile
generally requires borrowers to fund various escrows for taxes, insurance, capital expenses and replacement reserves, which reserves
may be limited to certain capped amounts. In addition, MC-Five Mile may identify certain risks that warrant additional escrows
or holdbacks for items such as leasing-related matters, deferred maintenance, environmental remediation or unfunded obligations,
which escrows or holdbacks would be released upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions. Springing escrows may also be structured
for identified risks such as specific rollover exposure, to be triggered upon the non-renewal of one or more key tenants. Escrows
are evaluated on a case-by-case basis and are not required for all commercial mortgage loans originated by MC-Five Mile. Generally,
the required escrows for mortgage loans originated by MC-Five Mile are as follows:
 

·Taxes—An initial deposit and monthly escrow deposits equal to approximately 1/12th of the estimated annual property taxes
(based on the most recent property assessment and the current mileage rate) are required to provide MC-Five Mile with sufficient
funds to satisfy all taxes and assessments. This escrow requirement may be waived by MC-Five Mile in certain circumstances, including,
but not limited to: (i) the Mortgaged Property is an institutional sponsor or high net worth individual sponsor or (ii) if the
related mortgaged property is a single tenant property (or substantially leased to a single tenant) and the tenant pays taxes directly
(or MC-Five Mile may waive the escrow for a portion of the Mortgaged Property which is leased to a tenant that pays taxes for its
portion of the Mortgaged Property directly); or (iii) any Escrow/Reserve Mitigating Circumstances (defined below).
 

·Insurance—Typically an initial deposit and monthly escrow deposits equal to approximately 1/12th of the estimated annual
property insurance premium are required to provide MC-Five Mile with sufficient funds to pay all insurance premiums. MC-Five Mile
may waive this escrow requirement in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to: (i) the borrower or its affiliates maintains
a blanket insurance policy; (ii) the Mortgaged Property is a single tenant property (or substantially leased to single tenant)
and the tenant maintains the property insurance or self-insures (or may waive the escrow for a portion of the Mortgaged Property
which is leased to a tenant that maintains property insurance for its portion of the Mortgaged Property or self-insures); or (iii)
any Escrow/Reserve Mitigating Circumstances.
 

·Replacement Reserves—Replacement reserves are generally calculated in accordance with the expected useful life of the
components of the property during the term of the mortgage loan. Annual replacement reserves are generally underwritten to the
suggested replacement reserve amount from an independent, third-party property condition or engineering report, or to certain minimum
requirements by property type. MC-Five Mile may waive this escrow requirement in certain circumstances, including, but not limited
to: (i) the Mortgaged Property is a single tenant property (or substantially leased to single tenant) and the tenant or another
third party is responsible for the repairs and maintenance of the Mortgaged Property (or may waive the escrow for a portion of
the Mortgaged Property which is leased to a tenant that repairs and maintains its portion of the Mortgaged Property); or (ii) any
Escrow/Reserve Mitigating Circumstances.
 


S-248
 

 

·Tenant Improvement/Lease Commissions—A tenant improvement/leasing commission reserve may be required to be funded either
at loan origination and/or during the related mortgage loan term and/or springing upon certain tenant events to cover certain anticipated
leasing commissions, free rent periods or tenant improvement costs which might be associated with re-leasing the space at the Mortgaged
Property. MC-Five Mile may waive this escrow requirement in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to: (i) the mortgaged
property is a single tenant property (or substantially leased to single tenant), with a lease that extends beyond the loan term;
(ii) the rent for the space in question is considered below market; or (iii) any Escrow/Reserve Mitigating Circumstances.
 

·Deferred Maintenance—A deferred maintenance reserve may be required to be funded at loan origination in an amount typically
equal to 125% of the estimated cost of material immediate repairs or replacements identified in the property condition or engineering
report. MC-Five Mile may waive this escrow requirement in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to: (i) the deferred
maintenance items do not materially impact the function, performance or value of the property; (ii) the deferred maintenance cost
does not exceed $50,000; (iii) a tenant (which may include a ground lease tenant) at the related Mortgaged Property or other third
party is responsible for the repairs; or (iv) any Escrow/Reserve Mitigating Circumstances.
 

·Environmental Remediation—An environmental remediation reserve may be required at loan origination in an amount typically
equal to 150% of the estimated remediation cost identified in the environmental report. MC-Five Mile may waive this escrow requirement
in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to: (i) environmental insurance is in place or obtained; (ii) a third party
unrelated to the borrower is identified as the responsible party; or (iii) any Escrow/Reserve Mitigating Circumstances.
 
MC-Five Mile may determine that establishing
any of the foregoing escrows or reserves is not warranted in one or more of the following instances (collectively, the “Escrow/Reserve
Mitigating Circumstances”): (i) the amounts involved are de minimis; (ii) the ability of the Mortgaged Property, the
borrower or a holder of direct or indirect ownership interests in the borrower to bear the subject expense or cost absent creation
of an escrow or reserve; (iii) based on the Mortgaged Property maintaining a specified debt service coverage ratio; (iv) MC-Five
Mile has structured springing escrows that arise for identified risks; (v) MC-Five Mile has an alternative to a cash escrow or
reserve, such as a letter of credit or a guarantee from the borrower or an affiliate of the borrower or periodic evidence that
the items for which the escrow or reserve would have been established are being paid or addressed; (vi) MC-Five Mile believes there
are credit positive characteristics of the borrower, the sponsor of the borrower and/or the Mortgaged Property that would offset
the need for the escrow or reserve; (vi) the reserves are being collected and held by a third party, such as a management company,
a franchisor, or an association; or (vii) a tenant or other third party has agreed to pay the subject cost or expense for which
the escrow or reserve would otherwise have been established.
 
For a description of the escrows collected
with respect to the MC-Five Mile Mortgage Loans, please see Annex A to this free writing prospectus.
 
Exceptions
to MC-Five Mile’s Disclosed Underwriting Guidelines 
 
None of the MC-Five Mile Mortgage Loans
have exceptions to the related underwriting criteria.
 
Servicing
 
Interim servicing for the loans originated
by MC-Five Mile prior to securitization is typically performed by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association. In some instances, interim
servicing for certain loans originated by MC-Five Mile is performed by Grandbridge Real Estate Capital LLC. Generally, servicing
responsibilities are transferred from the interim servicer to the master servicer of the securitization trust on the securitization
Closing Date. From time to time, the interim servicer may retain primary servicing.

Redwood Commercial Mortgage
Corporation
 
General
 
Redwood Commercial Mortgage Corporation,
a Delaware corporation formed in November 2009 (“RCMC”),
a sponsor and a mortgage loan seller, is indirectly wholly-owned by Redwood Trust, Inc. (“Redwood
Trust”), a Maryland corporation that was formed in April 1994 and commenced operations in August 1994. Redwood
Trust (NYSE: RWT) invests in, finances and manages real estate assets. The executive offices of RCMC are located at One Belvedere
Place, Suite 300, Mill Valley, California 94941. RCMC originates and acquires commercial real estate debt investments with a general
focus on stabilized income-producing properties.
 
RCMC’s
Securitization Program
 
This is the twenty-third commercial real
estate debt investment securitization to which RCMC is contributing commercial real estate debt investments. The commercial real
estate debt investments originated and acquired by RCMC may include mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, B notes, participation interests,
rake bonds, subordinate mortgage loans and preferred equity investments. The commercial real estate debt investments originated
or acquired by RCMC may be secured by or relate to commercial or multifamily properties. RCMC began originating commercial mortgage
loans for securitization in 2012. As of August 29, 2015, the total amount of commercial mortgage loans originated or acquired by
RCMC and contributed to securitizations is in excess of approximately $2,041,123,148.
 
The commercial mortgage loans RCMC primarily
originates are typically secured by retail, office, multifamily, hospitality, industrial and self-storage properties, but RCMC
also originates loans secured by manufactured housing communities, theaters, land subject to a ground lease, condominium units,
and mixed use properties.
 
Neither RCMC nor any of its affiliates acts
as master servicer of the commercial mortgage loans it contributes to securitizations.
 
Review
of the RCMC Mortgage Loans
 
Overview. RCMC has conducted a review
of the RCMC mortgage loans in connection with the securitization described in this free writing prospectus. The review of the RCMC
mortgage loans was performed by a team comprised of real estate and securitization professionals who are employees of RCMC or one
or more of its affiliates (the “RCMC Review Team”).
The review procedures described below were employed with respect to the RCMC mortgage loans. No sampling procedures were used in
the review process.
 
Database. To prepare for securitization,
members of the RCMC Review Team reviewed a database of loan-level and property-level information relating to the RCMC mortgage
loans. RCMC engaged a third party to assist in the preparation of the database, which was compiled from, among other sources, the
related mortgage loan documents, appraisal, environmental assessment report, property condition report, zoning reports, insurance
review summary, borrower-supplied information (including, but not limited to, rent rolls, leases, operating statements and budgets)
and information collected by the RCMC Review Team during the underwriting process. Prior to securitization of the RCMC mortgage
loans, the RCMC Review Team may have updated the information in the database with respect to the RCMC mortgage loans based on updates
provided by the related servicer relating to loan payment status and escrows, updated operating statements, rent rolls and leasing
activity, and information otherwise brought to the attention of the RCMC Review Team. Such updates, if any, were not intended to
be, and do not serve as, a re-underwriting of the RCMC mortgage loans.
 
A data tape (the “RCMC
Data Tape”) containing detailed information regarding the RCMC mortgage loans was created from the information
in the database referred to in the prior paragraph. The RCMC Data Tape was used to provide the numerical information regarding
the RCMC mortgage loans in this free writing prospectus.
 


S-250
 

 
Data Comparison and Recalculation.
RCMC engaged a third party accounting firm to perform certain data comparison and recalculation procedures designed by RCMC and
relating to information in this free writing prospectus regarding the RCMC mortgage loans. These procedures included:
 

·comparing the information in the RCMC Data Tape against various source documents provided by RCMC that are described above
under “—Database”;
 

·comparing numerical information regarding the RCMC mortgage loans and the related Mortgaged Properties disclosed in this free
writing prospectus against the RCMC Data Tape; and
 

·recalculating certain percentages, ratios and other formulae relating to the RCMC mortgage loans disclosed in this free writing
prospectus.
 
Legal Review. RCMC engaged legal
counsel to conduct certain legal reviews of the RCMC mortgage loans for disclosure in this free writing prospectus. In anticipation
of the securitization described in this free writing prospectus, RCMC’s origination counsel reviewed a form of securitization
representations and warranties at origination and, if applicable, identified exceptions to those representations and warranties.
RCMC’s origination and underwriting staff also performed a review of the representations and warranties.
 
Legal counsel was also engaged in connection
with this securitization to assist in the review of the RCMC mortgage loans. Such assistance included, among other things, (i)
a review of any of RCMC’s internal credit memoranda for the RCMC mortgage loans, (ii) a review of the representations and
warranties and exception reports referred to above relating to the RCMC mortgage loans prepared by origination counsel, (iii) the
review of, and assistance in the completion by the RCMC Review Team of, a due diligence questionnaire relating to the RCMC mortgage
loans and (iv) the review of certain loan documents with respect to the RCMC mortgage loans.
 
Other Review Procedures. The RCMC
Review Team, with the assistance of counsel engaged in connection with this securitization, also reviewed the RCMC mortgage loans
to determine whether it materially deviated from the underwriting guidelines set forth under “—RCMC’s Underwriting
Standards and Loan Analysis” and “—Underwriting Exceptions” below.
 
Findings and Conclusions. Based on
the foregoing review procedures, RCMC determined that the disclosure regarding the RCMC mortgage loans in this free writing prospectus
is accurate in all material respects. RCMC also determined that the RCMC mortgage loans were not originated with any material exceptions
from RCMC’s underwriting guidelines and procedures, except as described under “—Underwriting Exceptions”
below. RCMC attributes to itself all findings and conclusions resulting from the foregoing review procedures.
 
Review Procedures in the Event of a Mortgage
Loan Substitution. RCMC will perform a review of any mortgage loan that it elects to substitute for a mortgage loan in the
pool in connection with a material breach of a representation or warranty or a material document defect. RCMC, and if appropriate
its legal counsel, will review the mortgage loan documents and servicing history of the substitute mortgage loan to confirm it
meets each of the criteria required under the terms of the related Purchase Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
RCMC will engage a third party accounting firm to compare the Qualification Criteria against the underlying source documentation
to verify the accuracy of the review by RCMC and to confirm any numerical and/or statistical information to be disclosed in any
required filings under the Exchange Act. Legal counsel will also be engaged by RCMC to render any tax opinion required in
connection with the substitution.
 
RCMC’s
Underwriting Standards and Loan Analysis
 
Overview. RCMC is the originator
of six (6) mortgage loans. Generally, RCMC performed an underwriting analysis with respect to each mortgage loan applicant and
the related Mortgaged Property.
 
Set forth below is a discussion of certain
current general guidelines of RCMC generally applicable with respect to RCMC’s underwriting analysis of multifamily and commercial
real estate properties which
 


S-251
 

 
serve
as the direct or indirect source of repayment for commercial real estate debt originated by RCMC. All or a portion of the underwriting
guidelines described below may not be applied exactly as described below at the time a particular asset is originated by RCMC.
Notwithstanding the discussion below, given the unique nature of income-producing real properties, the underwriting and origination
procedures and analyses with respect to any particular asset may differ significantly from one asset to another, and will be driven
by circumstances particular to that property, including, among others, its type, current use, physical quality, size, environmental
condition, location, market conditions, capital reserve requirements and additional collateral, tenants and leases, borrower identity,
borrower sponsorship and/or performance history, and any other factors deemed material or pertinent by RCMC. Consequently, we
cannot assure you that the underwriting analysis with respect to any asset will conform to the general guidelines described herein.
 
Process and Loan Analysis. The underwriting
process for each RCMC investment is performed by a transaction team comprised of real estate professionals that typically includes
a loan originator and an underwriter subject to oversight by the members of the management team of RCMC. This team conducts a review
of the related real property, which typically includes an examination of some or all of the following information, among other
things, to the extent applicable and available: historical operating statements, rent rolls, certain tenant leases, real estate
tax information, insurance policies and/or schedules and third party reports pertaining to appraisal, physical condition and environmental
status. Each applicable report is reviewed for acceptability by RCMC or a third-party reviewer. The results of these reviews are
incorporated into RCMC’s underwriting analysis. In some cases, certain of these documents may not be required or may not
be reviewed due to the nature of the related real property. For instance, historical operating statements may not be available
with respect to real property with limited operating history or that has been recently acquired by its current owner. In addition,
rent rolls would not be examined for certain property types (e.g., hospitality properties), and executed tenant leases would
not be examined for certain property types (e.g., hospitality, self-storage, multifamily and manufactured housing community
properties) although the forms of leases would typically be reviewed for certain of these property types.
 
RCMC also performs an underwriting analysis
with respect to the borrower under each asset it originates. The underwriting analysis of the borrower may include a review of
third-party credit reports and reports resulting from judgment, lien or bankruptcy searches. Borrowers are generally required to
be single purpose entities (although exceptions may be made from time to time on a case-by-case basis) and, in some cases, other
structural requirements may be imposed on the borrower which are intended to reduce the likelihood of the borrower becoming involved
in a bankruptcy proceeding; however, we cannot assure you that any of these structural requirements will prevent a particular borrower
from becoming involved in a bankruptcy proceeding.
 
After the compilation and review of all
applicable documentation and other relevant considerations, the transaction team finalizes its detailed underwriting analysis of
the real property’s cash flow in a manner generally consistent with RCMC’s underwriting guidelines. Determinations
are also made regarding the implementation of appropriate transaction terms to address certain risks, which may result in the recommendation
of certain additional structural features. A credit committee memorandum is prepared which summarizes the above referenced information
and which is circulated to the credit committee for review.
 
Credit Approval. All assets originated
by RCMC must be approved by one or more specified internal committees. After a review of the credit committee package and a discussion
of the asset, a committee may approve a transaction as recommended, request additional due diligence, modify the transaction terms
or decline a transaction entirely.
 
Debt Service Coverage Ratio. The
repayment of an asset is typically primarily dependent upon the successful operation of the related underlying real property and
the ability of that property to generate income sufficient to make payments as required under the terms of the asset. Accordingly,
in connection with the origination of an asset, RCMC will analyze whether cash flow expected to be derived from the related real
property will be sufficient to make the required payments under that transaction over its expected term, taking into account, among
other things, revenues and expenses for, and other debt
 


S-252
 
 
currently
secured directly or indirectly by, or that in the future may be secured directly or indirectly by, the related real property.
The debt service coverage ratio is an important measure of the likelihood of default on a particular asset. In general, the debt
service coverage ratio at any given time is the ratio of—
 

·the amount of income, net of expenses, derived or expected to be derived from the related real property for a given period,
to
 

·the scheduled payments of principal, interest and required reserves during that given period on the subject asset and any other
loans that are secured by liens of senior or equal priority on, or otherwise have a senior or equal entitlement to be repaid from
the income generated by, the related real property.
 
However, the amount described in the first
bullet of the preceding sentence is often a highly subjective number based on a variety of assumptions regarding, and adjustments
to, revenues and expenses with respect to the related real property. Accordingly, based on such subjective assumptions and analysis,
we cannot assure you that the underwriting analysis of any particular asset will conform to the foregoing in every respect or to
any similar analysis which may be performed by other persons or entities. For example, when calculating the debt service coverage
ratio for a particular asset, RCMC may utilize net cash flow that was calculated based on assumptions regarding projected rental
income, expenses and/or occupancy, including, without limitation, one or more of the following:
 

·the assumption that a particular tenant at the related real property that has executed a lease, but has not yet taken occupancy
and/or has not yet commenced paying rent, will take occupancy and commence paying rent on a future date;
 

·the assumption that an unexecuted lease that is currently being negotiated or is out for signature with respect to a particular
tenant at the related real property will be executed and in place on a future date;
 

·the assumption that a portion of currently vacant and unleased space at the related real property will be leased at current
market rates and consistent with occupancy rates of comparable properties in the subject market;
 

·the assumption that certain rental income that is to be payable commencing on a future date under a signed lease, but where
the subject tenant is in an initial rent abatement or free rent period or has not yet taken occupancy, will be paid commencing
on such future date;
 

·assumptions regarding the probability of renewal or extension of particular leases and/or the re-leasing of certain space at
the related real property and the anticipated effect on capital and re-leasing expenditures;
 

·assumptions regarding the costs and expenses, including leasing commissions and tenant improvements, associated with leasing
vacant space or releasing occupied space at a future date;
 

·assumptions regarding the disruptions to revenue associated with leasing vacant space or releasing occupied space at a future
date;
 

·assumptions regarding the costs of future capital expenses, which may or may not be consistent with historical capital expenses
at the related real property;
 

·assumptions regarding future increases or decreases in expenses, or whether certain expenses are capital expenses or should
be treated as expenses which are not recurring; and
 

·various additional lease-up assumptions and other assumptions regarding the payment of rent not currently being paid.
 


S-253
 
 
We cannot assure you that the foregoing
assumptions made with respect to any asset or the related real property will, in fact, be consistent with actual property performance.
 
Generally, the debt service coverage ratio
for assets originated by RCMC, calculated as described above, will be subject to a minimum standard at origination; however, exceptions
may be made when consideration is given to circumstances particular to the asset, the related real property, the associated loan-to-value
ratio (as described below), reserves or other factors. For example, RCMC may originate an asset with a debt service coverage ratio
below the minimum standard at origination based on, among other things, the amortization features of the overall debt structure,
the type of tenants and leases at the related real property, the taking of additional collateral such as reserves, letters of credit
and/or guarantees, the profile of the borrower and its owners, RCMC’s judgment of improved property and/or market performance
in the future and/or other relevant factors.
 
Loan-to-Value Ratio. RCMC also looks
at the loan-to-value ratio of a prospective investment related to multifamily or commercial real estate as one of the factors it
takes into consideration in evaluating the likelihood of recovery if a property is liquidated following a default. In general,
the loan-to-value ratio of an asset related to multifamily or commercial real estate at any given time is the ratio, expressed
as a percentage, of:
 

·the then outstanding principal balance of the asset and any other loans that are secured (directly or indirectly) by liens
of senior or equal priority on the related real property, to
 

·the estimated value of the related real property based on an appraisal, a cash flow analysis, a recent sales price or another
method or benchmark of valuation.
 
Generally, the loan-to-value ratio for assets
originated by RCMC, calculated as described above, will be subject to a maximum standard at origination; however, exceptions may
be made when consideration is given to circumstances particular to the asset, the related real property, debt service coverage,
reserves or other factors. For example, RCMC may originate a multifamily or commercial real estate loan with a loan-to-value ratio
above the maximum standard at origination based on, among other things, the amortization features of the overall debt structure,
the type of tenants and leases at the related real property, the taking of additional collateral such as reserves, letters of credit
and/or guarantees, the profile of the borrower and its owners, RCMC’s judgment of improved property and/or market performance
in the future and/or other relevant factors.
 
Additional Debt. When underwriting
an asset, RCMC will take into account whether the related real property and/or direct or indirect interest in a related borrower
are encumbered by additional debt and will analyze the likely effect of that additional debt on repayment of the subject asset.
It is possible that RCMC or an affiliate will be the lender on that additional debt, and may either sell such debt to an unaffiliated
third party or hold it for investment or future sale.
 
The debt service coverage ratios at origination
described above under “—Debt Service Coverage Ratio” and the loan-to-value ratios at origination described
above under “—Loan-to-Value Ratio” may be significantly below the minimum standard and/or significantly
above the maximum standard, respectively, when calculated taking into account the existence of additional debt secured directly
or indirectly by equity interests in the related borrower.
 
Assessments of Property Condition.
As part of the underwriting process, RCMC will analyze the condition of the real property for a prospective asset. To aid in that
analysis, RCMC may, subject to certain exceptions, inspect or retain a third party to inspect the property and will in most cases
obtain the property reports described below.
 
Appraisal Report. RCMC will in most
cases require that the real property related to the asset be appraised by a state certified appraiser, an appraiser belonging to
the Appraisal Institute, a membership association of professional real estate appraisers, or an otherwise qualified appraiser,
who will prepare an appraisal report after completing certain diligence. The appraisal report may utilize one or more approaches
to value, such as: (i) cost approach, (ii) sale comparison approach and/or (iii) income
 


S-254
 
 
capitalization
approach. In addition, RCMC will generally require that those appraisal reports be conducted in accordance with the Uniform Standards
of Professional Appraisal Practices developed by The Appraisal Foundation, a not-for-profit organization established by the appraisal
profession. Furthermore, the appraisal report will usually include or be accompanied by a separate letter that includes a statement
by the appraiser that the guidelines in Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 were
followed in preparing the appraisal report. We cannot assure you that another person would not have arrived at a different valuation,
even if such person used the same general approach to, and the same method of valuing, the real property. Moreover, such appraisal
reports generally seek to establish the amount a typically motivated buyer would pay a typically motivated seller. Such amounts
could be significantly higher than the amount obtained from the sale of real property, particularly under a distress or liquidation
sale.
 
Environmental Report. RCMC may require
that an environmental consultant prepare a Phase I environmental report with respect to the real property related to the asset.
However, when circumstances warrant, RCMC may utilize an update of a prior environmental report, a transaction screen or a desktop
review. Alternatively, RCMC might forego an environmental report in limited circumstances, such as when it has obtained the benefits
of an environmental insurance policy or an environmental guarantee. Furthermore, an environmental report conducted at any particular
real property will not necessarily cover all potential environmental issues. For example, an analysis for radon and/or lead-based
paint will usually be conducted only at multifamily rental properties and only when RCMC or the environmental consultant believes
that special circumstances warrant such an analysis. Depending on the findings of the initial environmental report, RCMC may sometimes
require additional record searches or environmental testing, such as a Phase II environmental report with respect to the subject
real property. In certain cases, the Phase I or Phase II report with respect to the subject real property disclosed the existence
of, or potential for, adverse environmental conditions, including as a result of the activities of identified tenants, adjacent
property owners or previous owners of the subject real property. In certain such cases, the related borrowers were required to
establish operations and maintenance plans, monitor the real property, abate or remediate the condition and/or provide additional
security such as letters of credit, reserves or environmental insurance policies.
 
Engineering Report. In connection
with the origination process, RCMC generally requires that an engineering firm inspect the real property related to the asset to
assess and prepare a report regarding the structure, exterior walls, roofing, interior structure, mechanical systems and/or electrical
systems. It is important to note that such engineering reports are often based on, and limited to, information available through
visual inspection and that any such inspection will not necessarily reveal all potential issues. RCMC will generally consider the
engineering report in connection with determining the relevant terms of a transaction intended to address any recommended repairs,
corrections or replacements and any identified deferred maintenance. RCMC also often reviews such engineering reports in connection
with making a determination about the necessity for ongoing escrows for the continued maintenance of the real property based on
the conclusions of the applicable engineering report.
 
Seismic Report. If the real property
related to an asset consists of improvements located in California or in seismic zones 3 or 4, RCMC generally requires a seismic
report from an engineering firm to establish the probable maximum or bounded loss for the improvements at the property as a result
of an earthquake. Generally, if a seismic report concludes that the related real property is estimated to have a probably maximum
loss or scenario expected loss in excess of 20%, RCMC may require retrofitting of the improvements or that the borrower obtain
earthquake insurance if available at a commercially reasonable price. It should be noted, however, that because the seismic reports
may not necessarily have used the same assumptions in assessing probable maximum loss or scenario expected loss, it is possible
that some of the real properties that were considered unlikely to experience a probable maximum loss or scenario expected loss
in excess of 20% might have been the subject of a higher estimate had different assumptions been used.
 
Zoning and Building Code Compliance.
In connection with the origination of an asset related to multifamily or commercial real estate, RCMC will generally consider whether
the use and occupancy of the related real property is in material compliance with zoning, land-use, building rules, regulations
and orders then applicable to that property. Evidence of this compliance may be in the form of one or more of
 


S-255
 
 
the
following: zoning reports; legal opinions; surveys; recorded documents; temporary or permanent certificates of occupancy; letters
from government officials or agencies; title insurance endorsements; engineering or consulting reports; and/or representations
by the related borrower. In some cases, the real property may constitute a legal non-conforming use or structure. In such cases,
RCMC may require an endorsement to the title insurance policy and/or the acquisition of law and ordinance insurance with respect
to the particular non-conformity unless it determines that: (i) the non-conformity should not have a material adverse effect on
the ability of the borrower to rebuild, (ii) the real property, if permitted to be repaired or restored in conformity with current
law, would in RCMC’s judgment constitute adequate security, (iii) any major casualty that would prevent rebuilding has a
sufficiently remote likelihood of occurring, (iv) a variance or other similar change in applicable zoning restrictions is potentially
available, or the applicable governing entity is unlikely to enforce the related limitations, (v) casualty insurance proceeds
together with the value of any additional collateral are expected to be available in an amount estimated by RCMC to be sufficient
to pay off all relevant indebtedness in full, and/or (vi) a cash reserve, a letter of credit or an agreement imposing recourse
liability from a principal of the borrower is provided to cover losses.
 
Escrow Requirements. Based on its
analysis of the related real property, the borrower and the principals of the borrower, RCMC may require a borrower under an asset
related to multifamily or commercial real estate to fund various escrows for taxes and/or insurance, capital expenses, replacement
reserves, re-tenanting reserves, environmental remediation and/or other matters. RCMC conducts a case-by-case analysis to determine
the need for a particular escrow or reserve. Consequently, the underlying documents for some assets do not contain provisions requiring
the establishment of escrows and reserves, or only require the establishment of escrows and reserves in limited amounts and/or
circumstances. Furthermore, where escrows or reserves are required, RCMC may accept an alternative to a cash escrow or reserve
from a borrower, such as a letter of credit or a guarantee from the borrower or an affiliate of the borrower or periodic evidence
that the items for which the escrow or reserve would have been established are being paid or addressed. In some cases, RCMC may
determine that establishing an escrow or reserve is not warranted given the amounts that would be involved and RCMC’s evaluation
of the ability of the real property, the borrower or a holder of direct or indirect ownership interests in the borrower to bear
the subject expense or cost absent creation of an escrow or reserve.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing discussion
under “—RCMC’s Underwriting Standards and Loan Analysis” section, RCMC may originate or acquire,
and may have originated or acquired, real estate related loans and other investments that vary from, or do not comply with, RCMC’s

RAIT Funding, LLC
 
General
 
RAIT Funding, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (“RAIT”), is an operating subsidiary of RAIT Financial Trust (“RAIT Financial”),
a vertically integrated and internally managed real estate investment trust that originates and services commercial real estate
loans, manages and advises on commercial real estate-related assets and acquires commercial real estate assets. RAIT Financial
is headquartered at 2929 Arch Street, 17th Floor, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, and also has offices in New York, New York,
Charlotte, North Carolina and Chicago, Illinois.
 
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.
Barclays Bank PLC, a sponsor and mortgage loan seller, and an affiliate of Barclays Capital Inc., which is an underwriter of the
Offered Certificates and initial purchaser of the non-Offered Certificates, provides warehouse financing to an affiliate of RAIT,
through a repurchase facility. However, none of the mortgage loans that RAIT will transfer to the depositor are subject to that
repurchase facility.
 
RAIT’s Securitization Program.
RAIT Financial, through its operating subsidiaries, RAIT and RAIT Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“RAIT
Partnership”), originates commercial mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, other loans and preferred equity interests that
are collateralized by office buildings, retail shopping centers, multifamily apartment complexes and other properties located throughout
the United States of America. RAIT’s commercial mortgage securitization program generally provides fixed rate mortgage loans
having maturities between five and ten years. Additionally, RAIT Partnership provides bridge/transitional loans, mezzanine loans
and preferred equity structures.
 
Since 2011, RAIT, RAIT Partnership and their
affiliates directly or indirectly have contributed loans to fixed and floating rate commercial mortgage-backed securitization transactions.
RAIT and its affiliates, acting as sponsor and mortgage loan seller, securitized approximately $60,831,868, $96,296,175, $539,944,126,
$834,020,321 and $446,358,359 of multifamily and commercial mortgage loans in calendar years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and the six
months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. Key members of the RAIT management team were officers at JP Morgan Chase and Wachovia
Bank and have been involved in the commercial mortgage securitization business since 1997.
 
RAIT and its affiliates generally act either
as originator, mortgage loan seller and/or sponsor in the commercial mortgage securitizations in which they participate. In such
securitizations, there may be co-sponsors and/or other mortgage loan sellers or originators. In such securitizations, the mortgage
loans originated by RAIT or one of its affiliates are generally sold to a depositor, which in turn transfers such loans to an issuing
entity, which issues commercial mortgage pass-through certificates or similar securities that are in whole or part backed by the
cash flows from such mortgage loans.
 
Neither RAIT nor any of its affiliates or
subsidiaries will insure or guarantee distributions on the Certificates. The Certificateholders will have no rights or remedies
against RAIT or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries for any losses or other claims in connection with the certificates or the
Mortgage Loans, except with respect to the repurchase and substitution obligations for material document defects or the material
breaches of representations and warranties made by RAIT in the related Purchase Agreement, as described under “Description
of the Mortgage Pool—Representations and Warranties; Repurchases and Substitutions” in this free writing prospectus.

Review
of RAIT Mortgage Loans
 
Overview. RAIT has conducted a review
of the mortgage loans for which RAIT is a sponsor in this securitization (the “RAIT
Mortgage Loans”) in connection with the securitization described in this free writing prospectus. The review of
the RAIT Mortgage Loans was performed by a team comprised of real estate and securitization professionals who are employees of
RAIT Financial or one or more of its affiliates (the “RAIT Securitization Team”). The review procedures described
below were employed with respect to all of the RAIT Mortgage Loans. No sampling procedures were used in the review process.
 
Database. To prepare for securitization,
members of the RAIT Securitization Team created a database of loan-level and property-level information relating to each RAIT Mortgage
Loan. The database was compiled from, among other sources, the related RAIT Mortgage Loan documents, appraisals, environmental
assessment reports, property condition reports, seismic studies, zoning reports, insurance review summaries, borrower-supplied
information (including, but not limited to, rent rolls, leases, operating statements and budgets) and information collected by
the RAIT Securitization Team during the underwriting process. After origination of each RAIT Mortgage Loan, the RAIT Securitization
Team updated the information in the database with respect to such RAIT Mortgage Loan based on updates from RAIT Partnership’s
servicing group, or with respect to any RAIT Mortgage Loan being serviced by a third-party servicer, based on updates from such
third-party servicer, regarding loan payment status and escrows, updated operating statements, rent rolls and leasing activity,
and information otherwise brought to the attention of the RAIT Securitization Team.
 
A data tape (the “RAIT Data Tape”)
containing detailed information regarding each RAIT Mortgage Loan was created from the information in the database referred to
in the prior paragraph. The RAIT Data Tape was used to provide the numerical information regarding the RAIT Mortgage Loans in this
free writing prospectus.
 
Data Comparison and Recalculation.
RAIT engaged a third party accounting firm to perform certain data comparison and recalculation procedures, the nature, extent
and timing of which were designed by RAIT, relating to information in this free writing prospectus regarding the RAIT Mortgage
Loans. These procedures included:
 

·comparing the information in the RAIT Data Tape against various source documents provided by RAIT that are described above
under “—Database”;
 

·comparing numerical information regarding the RAIT Mortgage Loans and the related Mortgaged Properties disclosed in this free
writing prospectus against the RAIT Data Tape; and
 

·recalculating certain percentages, ratios and other formulae relating to the RAIT Mortgage Loans disclosed in this free writing
prospectus.
 
Legal Review. RAIT engaged various
law firms to conduct certain legal reviews of the RAIT Mortgage Loans for disclosure in this free writing prospectus. In anticipation
of the securitization of each RAIT Mortgage Loan, origination counsel reviewed a form of securitization representations and warranties
at origination and, if applicable, identified exceptions to those representations and warranties. In addition, origination counsel
for the RAIT Mortgage Loans completed due diligence questionnaires with respect to the RAIT Mortgage Loans. RAIT Financial’s
underwriting staff and in-house legal team performed a similar review of representations and warranties, and completed due diligence
questionnaires. Outside legal counsel was also engaged in connection with this securitization to assist in the review of the RAIT
Mortgage Loans. Such assistance included, among other things, (i) a review of RAIT’s asset summary reports for each RAIT
Mortgage Loan, (ii) a review of a compilation of the exception reports to the representations and warranties referred to above
relating to the RAIT Mortgage Loans, and (iii) a review of a compilation of the due diligence questionnaires relating to the RAIT
Mortgage Loans.
 
Other Review Procedures. With respect
to any material pending litigation related to the RAIT Mortgage Loans and of which RAIT Financial was aware at the origination
of any RAIT Mortgage Loan,
 


S-258
 
 
RAIT
Financial requested updates from the related borrower, origination counsel and/or borrower’s litigation counsel.
 
Findings and Conclusions. Based on
the foregoing review procedures, RAIT determined that the disclosure regarding the RAIT Mortgage Loans in this free writing prospectus
is accurate in all material respects. RAIT also determined that the RAIT Mortgage Loans were originated in accordance with RAIT’s
origination procedures and underwriting criteria, except as may be disclosed below under “—Exceptions to Disclosed
Underwriting Guidelines for Loans Originated by RAIT”. RAIT attributes to itself all findings and conclusions resulting
from the foregoing review procedures.
 
Review Procedures in the Event of a Mortgage
Loan Substitution. RAIT will perform a review of any mortgage loan that it elects to substitute for a mortgage loan in the
pool in connection with a material breach of a representation or warranty or a material document defect. RAIT, and if appropriate
its legal counsel, will review the mortgage loan documents and servicing history of the substitute mortgage loan to confirm it
meets each of the criteria required under the terms of the related Purchase Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
RAIT will engage a third party accounting firm to compare the Qualification Criteria against the underlying source documentation
to verify the accuracy of the review by RAIT and to confirm any numerical and/or statistical information to be disclosed in any
required filings under the Exchange Act. Legal counsel will also be engaged by RAIT to render any tax opinion required in
connection with the substitution.
 
RAIT’s
Underwriting Guidelines and Processes
 
General. RAIT and its affiliates
originate commercial mortgage loans from its headquarters in Philadelphia. All mortgage loans must be approved by RAIT Financial’s
management investment committee, as described under “—Loan Approval” below. For additional information
with respect to exceptions to the underwriting guidelines, see “—Exceptions to Disclosed Underwriting Guidelines
for Loans Originated by RAIT” below. Set forth below is a discussion of certain general underwriting guidelines with
respect to mortgage loans originated by RAIT or one of its affiliates for securitization.
 
Notwithstanding the discussion below, given
the unique nature of commercial properties, the underwriting and origination procedures and the credit analysis with respect to
any particular commercial mortgage loan may significantly differ from one asset to another and will be driven by circumstances
particular to that loan and related property, including, among others, the property type, current use, size, location, market conditions,
reserve requirements, additional collateral, tenant quality and lease terms, borrower identity, sponsorship, performance history
and/or other factors. If a mortgage loan exhibits any one or more of the following characteristics, variances from general underwriting/origination
procedures described below may, in some instances, be considered acceptable under the circumstances indicated: (i) low loan-to-value
ratio; (ii) high debt service coverage ratio; (iii) experienced sponsor(s)/guarantor(s) with financial wherewithal; (iv) additional
springing reserves; (v) cash flow sweeps; and (vi) elements of recourse included in the mortgage loan. Therefore, this general
description of RAIT’s origination procedures and underwriting criteria is not intended as a representation that every commercial
mortgage loan originated by it complies entirely with all procedures and criteria set forth below. For important information about
the circumstances that have affected the underwriting of Mortgage Loans in the mortgage pool originated by RAIT or one of its affiliates,
see the “Risk Factors” section of this free writing prospectus and “Annex D-2—Exceptions to Mortgage
Loan Representations and Warranties” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Loan Analysis. Generally, RAIT performs
both a credit analysis and collateral analysis with respect to a loan applicant and the real estate that will secure a mortgage
loan. In general, the analysis of a borrower includes a review of anti-money laundering or OFAC checks, as well as background checks
and the analysis of its loan sponsor includes a review of money laundering and background checks, third-party credit reports, bankruptcy
and lien searches, general banking references and commercial mortgage related references. In general, the analysis of the collateral
includes a site visit and a review of the property’s historical operating statements (if available), independent market research,
an appraisal with an emphasis on rental and sales comparables, engineering and environmental reports, the property’s historic
and current occupancy, financial strengths of tenants, the duration and terms of tenant
leases and 
 


S-259
 
 
the use of the property. Each report is reviewed for acceptability by a real estate finance loan underwriter. The borrower’s
and property manager’s experience and presence in the subject market are also reviewed. Consideration is also given to anticipated
changes in cash flow that may result from changes in lease terms or market considerations. Other factors that are considered in
the origination of a commercial mortgage loan include current operations, occupancy and tenant base.
 
Borrowers are generally required to be single
purpose entities although they are generally not required to be structured to limit the possibility of becoming insolvent or bankrupt
unless the loan has a principal balance of greater than $20 million, in which case additional limitations including the requirement
that the borrower have at least one independent director are required.
 
Loan Approval. All mortgage loans
originated by RAIT or one of its affiliates must be approved by a management investment committee of RAIT Financial. The credit
committee may approve a mortgage loan as recommended, request additional due diligence, modify the loan terms or decline a loan
transaction.
 
Debt Service Coverage Ratio and LTV Ratio.
RAIT’s underwriting standards generally mandate minimum debt service coverage ratios and maximum loan-to-value ratios. A
loan-to-value ratio is generally based upon the appraiser’s determination of value. The debt service coverage ratio is based
upon the underwritten net cash flow and is given particular importance. However, notwithstanding such guidelines, in certain circumstances
the actual debt service coverage ratios, loan-to-value ratios and amortization periods for the mortgage loans originated by RAIT
or one of its affiliates may vary from these guidelines.
 
In addition, with respect to certain mortgage
loans originated by RAIT or one of its affiliates, there may exist subordinate debt secured by the related property and/or mezzanine
debt secured by direct or indirect ownership interests in the related borrower. Such mortgage loans may have a lower debt service
coverage ratio and/or a higher loan-to-value ratio if such subordinate and/or mezzanine debt is taken into account.
 
Escrow Requirements. Generally, RAIT
requires most borrowers to fund various escrows for taxes and insurance, capital expenses and replacement reserves. Generally,
the required escrows for mortgage loans originated by RAIT or one of its affiliates are as follows:
 

·Taxes – Typically an initial deposit and monthly escrow deposits equal to 1/12th of the annual property taxes (based
on the most recent property assessment and the current millage rate) are required to provide the lender with sufficient funds to
satisfy all taxes and assessments. The originator may waive this escrow requirement under appropriate circumstances including,
but not limited to, where a tenant is required to pay the taxes directly.
 

·Insurance – If the property is insured under an individual policy (i.e., the property is not covered by a blanket
policy), typically an initial deposit and monthly escrow deposits equal to 1/12th of the annual property insurance premium are
required to provide the lender with sufficient funds to pay all insurance premiums. The originator may waive this escrow requirement
under appropriate circumstances, including, but not limited to, where a property is covered by a blanket insurance policy maintained
by the borrower or sponsor, or where a tenant is required to insure the property (which tenant insurance may include self-insurance
by the tenant).
 

·Replacement Reserves – Replacement reserves are generally calculated in accordance with the expected useful life of the
components of the property during the term of the mortgage loan plus two years. The originator relies on information provided by
an independent engineer to make this determination. The originator may waive this escrow requirement under appropriate circumstances,
including, but not limited to, where a tenant is responsible for replacements under the terms of its lease.
 

·Completion Repair/Environmental
Remediation – Typically, a completion repair or remediation reserve is required where an environmental or engineering report
suggests that such reserve is
 


S-260
 

 


necessary. Upon funding of the applicable mortgage loan, the
originator generally requires that at least 110% – 125% of the estimated costs of repairs or replacements be reserved and
generally requires that repairs or replacements be completed within a year after the funding of the applicable mortgage loan. The
originator may waive this escrow requirement under appropriate circumstances, including, but not limited to, (i) where an investment
grade party has agreed to take responsibility, and pay, for any required repair or remediation or (ii) the amount recommended is
de minimis.
  

·Tenant Improvement/Lease Commissions – In most cases, various tenants have lease expirations within the mortgage loan
term. To mitigate this risk, special reserves may be required to be funded either at closing of the mortgage loan and/or during
the mortgage loan term to cover certain anticipated leasing commissions or tenant improvement costs which might be associated with
re-leasing the space occupied by such tenants. The originator may waive this escrow requirement under appropriate circumstances,
including, but not limited to, (i) where rents at the mortgaged property are considered to be sufficiently below market, (ii) where
no material leases expire within the mortgage loan term, or the lease roll is not concentrated or (iii) where there is a low loan-to-value
ratio (i.e., 65% or less).
 
Interim Servicing. Except as stated
below, interim servicing for all loans originated by RAIT or one of its affiliates prior to securitization is typically performed
by RAIT Partnership. RAIT Financial, the parent company of RAIT Partnership, is rated on Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services’
Select Servicer List as a U.S. Commercial Mortgage Primary and special servicer and is also a rated Commercial Mortgage Primary
and special servicer by Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC (“Morningstar”). In some instances, interim servicing
for certain loans originated by RAIT and its affiliates is performed by another servicer, typically either Grandbridge Real Estate
Capital LLC or NorthMarq Capital, LLC. Generally, servicing responsibilities are transferred from the interim servicer to the master
servicer of the securitization trust at the closing of the securitization. From time to time, the interim servicer may retain primary
servicing after closing.
 
Exceptions
to Disclosed Underwriting Guidelines for Loans Originated by RAIT
 
None of the RAIT Mortgage Loans have exceptions
to the applicable underwriting guidelines set forth above.
 
Compliance
with Rule 15Ga-1 under the Exchange Act
 
RAIT most recently filed a Form ABS-15G
on February 12, 2015. RAIT’s Central Index Key is 0001587045. RAIT Partnership, an affiliate of RAIT, most recently filed
a Form ABS-15G on February 12, 2015. RAIT Partnership’s Central Index Key is 0001175134. With respect to the period from
and including July 1, 2012 to and including June 30, 2015, RAIT and RAIT Partnership have no demand, repurchase or replacement
history to report as required by Rule 15Ga-1 under the Exchange Act.
 
The Depositor
 
J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities
Corp., the depositor, is a Delaware corporation organized on September 19, 1994. The depositor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
JPMCB. The depositor maintains its principal office at 383 Madison Avenue, 31st Floor, New York, New York 10179. Its telephone
number is (212) 272-6858. The depositor does not have, nor is it expected in the future to have, any significant assets.
 
The depositor purchases commercial mortgage
loans and interests in commercial mortgage loans for the purpose of selling those assets to trusts created in connection with the
securitization of pools of assets and does not engage in any activities unrelated thereto. On the Closing Date, the depositor will
acquire the mortgage loans from each mortgage loan seller and will simultaneously transfer them, without recourse, to the trustee
for the benefit of the Certificateholders.
 


S-261
 

 
The depositor remains responsible under
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement for providing the master servicer, special servicer, certificate administrator and trustee
with certain information and other assistance requested by those parties and reasonably necessary to performing their duties under
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The depositor also remains responsible for mailing notices to the Certificateholders upon
the appointment of certain successor entities under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
The Trust
 
JPMBB Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust
2015-C32 (the “Issuing Entity”), will be a New
York common law trust, formed on the Closing Date pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
The only activities that the trust may perform
are those set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, which are generally limited to owning and administering the mortgage
loans and any REO Property, disposing of defaulted mortgage loans and REO Property, issuing the certificates, making distributions,
providing reports to Certificateholders and other activities described in this free writing prospectus. Accordingly, the trust
may not issue securities other than the certificates, or invest in securities, other than investing of funds in the Certificate
Account and other accounts maintained under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement in certain short-term permitted investments. The
trust may not lend or borrow money, except that the master servicer and the trustee may make Advances of delinquent monthly debt
service payments and Servicing Advances to the trust, but only to the extent it does not deem such Advances to be nonrecoverable
from the related mortgage loan; such Advances are intended to provide liquidity, rather than credit support. The Pooling and Servicing
Agreement may be amended as set forth under “Servicing of the
Mortgage Loans—Amendment” in this free writing prospectus. The trust administers the mortgage loans through
the trustee, the certificate administrator, the master servicer and the special servicer (and in the case of a Non-Serviced Mortgage
Loan, the related master servicer and special servicer under the related Non-Serviced PSA). A discussion of the duties of the trustee,
the certificate administrator, the master servicer and the special servicer, including any discretionary activities performed by
each of them, is set forth in this free writing prospectus under “Transaction Parties—The Trustee, “—The
Certificate Administrator”, “—The Master Servicer”, “—The Special Servicer”
and “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans”.
 
The only assets of the trust other than
the mortgage loans and REO Properties are the Certificate Account and other accounts maintained pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, the short-term investments in which funds in the Certificate Account and other accounts are invested. The trust has
no present liabilities, but has potential liability relating to ownership of the mortgage loans and any REO Properties and certain
other activities described in this free writing prospectus, and indemnity obligations to the trustee, the certificate administrator,
the depositor, the master servicer, the special servicer and the senior trust advisor. The fiscal year of the trust is the calendar
year. The trust has no executive officers or board of directors and acts through the trustee, the certificate administrator, the
master servicer and the special servicer.
 
The depositor is contributing the
mortgage loans to the trust. The depositor is purchasing the mortgage loans from the mortgage loan sellers, as described in
this free writing prospectus under “Description of the
Mortgage Pool—Sale of Mortgage Loans; Mortgage File Delivery” and “—Representations
and Warranties; Repurchases and Substitutions”.
 
The Trustee
 
Wilmington Trust, National Association (“WTNA”)
(formerly called M&T Bank, National Association) will act as trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders pursuant to the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement. WTNA is a national banking association with trust powers incorporated in 1995. WTNA’s principal
place of business is located at 1100 North Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19890. WTNA is an affiliate of Wilmington Trust
Company and both WTNA and Wilmington Trust Company are subsidiaries of Wilmington Trust Corporation. Since 1998, Wilmington Trust
Company has served as trustee in numerous asset-backed securities transactions. As of June 30, 2015, WTNA served as trustee on
over
 


S-262
 
 
1,500
mortgage-backed related securities transactions having an aggregate original principal balance in excess of $100 billion, of which
approximately 113 transactions were commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions having an aggregate original principal
balance of approximately $70 billion.
 
The parties to this transaction may maintain
banking and other commercial relationships with WTNA and its affiliates. In its capacity as trustee on commercial mortgage securitizations,
WTNA and its affiliates are generally required to make an advance if the related servicer or special servicer fails to make a required
advance. In the past three years, WTNA and its affiliates have not been required to make an advance on a commercial mortgage-backed
securities transaction. WTNA is subject to various legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.
WTNA does not believe that the ultimate resolution of any of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its services
as trustee. The foregoing information set forth under this sub-heading “—The Trustee” has been provided
by WTNA.
 
The Certificate Administrator
 
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells
Fargo Bank”) will act as the custodian and certificate administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Wells
Fargo Bank is a national banking association and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wells Fargo & Company. A diversified financial
services company, Wells Fargo & Company is a U.S. bank holding company with approximately $1.7 trillion in assets and approximately
265,000 employees as of December 31, 2014, which provides banking, insurance, trust, mortgage and consumer finance services throughout
the United States and internationally. Wells Fargo Bank provides retail and commercial banking services and corporate trust, custody,
securities lending, securities transfer, cash management, investment management and other financial and fiduciary services. The
transaction parties may maintain banking and other commercial relationships with Wells Fargo Bank and its affiliates. Wells Fargo
Bank maintains principal corporate trust offices at 9062 Old Annapolis Road, Columbia, Maryland 21045-1951 (among other locations)
and its office for certificate transfer services is located at Sixth Street and Marquette Avenue, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55479.
 
Under the terms of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, Wells Fargo Bank is responsible for securities administration, which includes pool performance calculations, distribution
calculations and related distributions to certificateholders and the preparation of monthly distribution reports. As certificate
administrator, Wells Fargo Bank is responsible for the preparation and filing of all REMIC and grantor trust tax returns on behalf
of the trust and to the extent required under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the preparation of monthly reports on Form 10-D,
certain current reports on Form 8-K and annual reports on Form 10-K that are required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on behalf of the Issuing Entity. Wells Fargo Bank has been engaged in the business of securities administration since
June 30, 1995, and in connection with commercial mortgage-backed securities since 1997. As of December 31, 2014, Wells Fargo Bank
was acting as securities administrator with respect to more than $171 billion of outstanding commercial mortgage-backed securities.
 
Wells Fargo Bank is acting as custodian
of the mortgage loan files pursuant and subject to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (and is acting as custodian of the mortgage
loan file (other than the Mortgage Note with respect to the related mortgage loan for any Non-Serviced Whole Loan under the related
Non-Serviced PSA). In that capacity, Wells Fargo Bank is responsible to hold and safeguard the mortgage notes and other contents
of the mortgage files on behalf of the trustee and the Certificateholders. Wells Fargo Bank maintains each mortgage loan file in
a separate file folder marked with a unique bar code to assure loan-level file integrity and to assist in inventory management.
Files are segregated by transaction or investor. Wells Fargo Bank has been engaged in the mortgage document custody business for
more than 25 years. Wells Fargo Bank maintains its commercial document custody facilities in Minneapolis, Minnesota. As of December
31, 2014, Wells Fargo Bank was acting as custodian of more than 116,000 commercial mortgage loan files.
 
Wells Fargo Bank serves or may have served
within the past two years as loan file custodian for various mortgage loans owned by one or more of the sponsors or an affiliate
of one or more of the
 


S-263
 
 
sponsors,
and one or more of those mortgage loans may be included in the trust. The terms of any custodial agreement under which those services
are provided by Wells Fargo Bank are customary for the mortgage-backed securitization industry and provide for the delivery, receipt,
review and safekeeping of mortgage loan files.
 
On June 18, 2014, a group of institutional
investors filed a civil complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, against Wells Fargo Bank, in
its capacity as trustee under 276 residential mortgage backed securities (“RMBS“)
trusts, which was later amended on July 18, 2014, to increase the number of trusts to 284 RMBS trusts. On November 24, 2014, the
plaintiffs filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the state court action without prejudice. That same day, a group of institutional
investors filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Wells Fargo
Bank, alleging claims against Wells Fargo Bank, in its capacity as trustee under 274 RMBS trusts (the “Complaint”).
In December 2014, the plaintiffs’ motion to voluntarily dismiss their original state court action was granted. As with the
prior state court action, the Complaint is one of six similar complaints filed contemporaneously against RMBS trustees (Deutsche
Bank National Trust Company, Citibank N.A., HSBC Bank USA, Bank of New York Mellon and U.S. Bank National Association) by a group
of institutional investor plaintiffs. The Complaint against Wells Fargo Bank alleges the trustee caused losses to investors and
asserts causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee’s alleged failure to (i) enforce repurchase obligations
of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, (ii) notify investors of alleged events of default
purportedly caused by breaches by mortgage loan servicers, and (iii) abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events
of default. Relief sought includes money damages in an unspecified amount, reimbursement of expenses and equitable relief. Other
cases alleging similar causes of action have been filed against Wells Fargo Bank and other trustees by RMBS investors in these
and other transactions.
 
There can be no assurances as to the outcome
of the litigation, or the possible impact of the litigation on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, Wells Fargo Bank denies
liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the
cause of losses to investors and that it has meritorious defenses, and it intends to contest the plaintiffs’ claims vigorously.
 
For a description of any material affiliations,
relationships and related transactions between the trustee, the certificate administrator, and the other transaction parties, see
“Certain Affiliations, Relationships and Related Transactions Involving Transaction Parties” in this free writing
prospectus.
 
The foregoing information set forth under
this sub-heading “—The Certificate Administrator” has been provided by Wells Fargo Bank.
 
As compensation for the performance of its
routine duties, the trustee and the certificate administrator will be paid a fee (collectively, the “Certificate Administrator
Fee”); provided that the Certificate Administrator Fee includes the trustee fee, and the certificate administrator
will pay the trustee fee to the trustee. The Certificate Administrator Fee will be payable monthly from amounts received in respect
of each mortgage loan (including any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and any REO Loan (other than the portion of an REO Loan related
to any Serviced Companion Loan), will be equal to the product of a rate equal to 0.00420% per
annum (the “Certificate Administrator Fee Rate”) and the Stated Principal Balance of such mortgage
loan or REO Loan, and will be calculated in the same manner as interest is calculated on such mortgage loan or REO Loan. The Certificate
Administrator Fee includes the trustee fee.
 
Each of the trustee and the certificate
administrator will at all times be, and will be required to resign if it fails to be, (i) a corporation, national bank, national
banking association or a trust company, organized and doing business under the laws of any state or the United States of America,
authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers and to accept the trust conferred under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, having a combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by federal

if the master servicer maintains a rating of at least “A” by DBRS); provided that the trustee will not become
ineligible to serve based on a failure to satisfy such rating requirements as long as it maintains a long-term unsecured debt
rating of no less than “Baa2” by Moody’s and “A-” by Fitch, and its short-term debt obligations

The trustee and the certificate administrator
make no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (other than as to it being a valid
obligation of the trustee and the certificate administrator), the certificates, the mortgage loans, this free writing prospectus
(other than as to the accuracy of the information provided by the trustee and the certificate administrator as set forth above)
or any related documents and will not be accountable for the use or application by or on behalf of the master servicer or the special
servicer of any funds paid to the master servicer or any special servicer in respect of the certificates or the mortgage loans,
or any funds deposited into or withdrawn from the certificate account or any other account by or on behalf of the master servicer
or any special servicer. The Pooling and Servicing Agreement provides that no provision of such agreement will be construed to
relieve the trustee and the certificate administrator from liability for their own negligent action, their own negligent failure
to act or their own willful misconduct or bad faith.
 
The Pooling and Servicing Agreement provides
that neither the trustee nor the certificate administrator, as applicable, will be liable for an error of judgment made in good
faith by a responsible officer of the trustee or the certificate administrator, unless it is proven that the trustee or the certificate
administrator, as applicable, was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts. In addition, neither the trustee nor the certificate
administrator, as applicable, will be liable with respect to any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good faith
in accordance with the direction of holders of certificates entitled to greater than 25% of the percentage interest of each affected
class, or of the aggregate Voting Rights of the certificates, relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding
for any remedy available to the trustee and the certificate administrator, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the
trustee and the certificate administrator, under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (unless a higher percentage of Voting Rights
is required for such action). In no event will the trustee or the certificate administrator be liable for any failure or delay
in the performance of its obligations under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement due to force majeure or acts of God; provided
that such failure or delay is not also a result of its own negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.
 
The trustee and the certificate administrator
and any director, officer, employee, representative or agent of the trustee and the certificate administrator, will be entitled
to indemnification by the trust fund, to the extent of amounts held in the Certificate Account or the Lower-Tier REMIC Distribution
Account from time to time, for any loss, liability, damages, claims or unanticipated expenses (including reasonable attorneys’
fees and expenses) arising out of or incurred by the trustee or the certificate administrator in connection with their participation
in the transaction and any act or omission of the trustee or the certificate administrator relating to the exercise and performance
of any of the powers and duties of the trustee and the certificate administrator (including in any capacities in which they serve,
e.g., paying agent, REMIC administrator, authenticating agent, certificate custodian, certificate registrar and 17g-5 Information
Provider) under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. However, the indemnification will not extend to any loss, liability or expense
that constitutes a specific liability imposed on the trustee or the certificate administrator pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, or to any loss, liability or expense incurred by reason of willful misconduct, bad faith or negligence on the part of
the trustee or the certificate administrator in the performance of their obligations and duties under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, or by reason of their negligent disregard of those obligations or duties, or as may arise from a breach of any representation
or warranty of the trustee or the certificate administrator made in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 


S-265
 

 
The certificate administrator will be the
REMIC administrator and the 17g-5 Information Provider.
 
Resignation and Removal of
the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator
 
The trustee and the certificate administrator
will be permitted at any time to resign from their obligations and duties under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement by giving written
notice (which notice will be posted to the certificate administrator’s website pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement)
to the depositor, the master servicer, the special servicer, the trustee or the certificate administrator, as applicable, all Certificateholders,
the senior trust advisor and the 17g-5 Information Provider (who will promptly post such notice to the 17g-5 Information Provider’s
website). Upon receiving this notice of resignation, the depositor will be required to use its reasonable best efforts to promptly
appoint a successor trustee or certificate administrator acceptable to the master servicer and, prior to the occurrence and continuance
of a Control Event, the Directing Certificateholder. If no successor trustee or certificate administrator has accepted an appointment
within 30 days after the giving of notice of resignation, the resigning trustee or certificate administrator, as applicable, may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor trustee or certificate administrator, as applicable.
 
If at any time the trustee or certificate
administrator ceases to be eligible to continue as trustee or certificate administrator, as applicable, under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, and fails to resign after written request therefor by the depositor or the master servicer, or if at any time the trustee
or certificate administrator becomes incapable of acting, or if certain events of, or proceedings in respect of, bankruptcy or
insolvency occur with respect to the trustee or certificate administrator, or if the trustee or certificate administrator fails
to timely publish any report to be delivered, published, or otherwise made available by the certificate administrator pursuant
to the pooling and servicing agreement, and such failure continues unremedied for a period of five (5) days, or if the certificate
administrator fails to make distributions required pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement, the depositor will be authorized
to remove the trustee or certificate administrator, as applicable, and appoint a successor trustee or certificate administrator.
In addition, holders of the certificates entitled to at least 75% of the Voting Rights may at any time, with or without cause,
remove the trustee or certificate administrator under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and appoint a successor trustee or certificate
administrator. In the event that holders of the certificates entitled to at least 75% of the Voting Rights elect to remove the
trustee or certificate administrator without cause and appoint a successor, the successor trustee or certificate administrator,
as applicable, will be responsible for all expenses necessary to effect the transfer of responsibilities from its predecessor.
 
Any resignation or removal of the trustee
or certificate administrator and appointment of a successor trustee or certificate administrator will not become effective until
acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee or certificate administrator, as applicable.
 
The Master Servicer
 
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells
Fargo”) will act as the master servicer for all of the mortgage loans to be deposited into the Issuing Entity and as
the primary servicer for the Serviced Companion Loans (in such capacity, the “Master
Servicer”). Wells Fargo is a national banking association organized under the laws of the United States of America,
and is a wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiary of Wells Fargo & Company. Wells Fargo is also the certificate administrator
and custodian. In addition, Wells Fargo is currently the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer and is expected to be the U-Haul Portfolio
Master Servicer and the initial U-Haul Portfolio Special Servicer. On December 31, 2008, Wells Fargo & Company acquired Wachovia
Corporation, the owner of Wachovia Bank, National Association (“Wachovia”),
and Wachovia Corporation merged with and into Wells Fargo & Company. On March 20, 2010, Wachovia merged with and into Wells
Fargo. Like Wells Fargo, Wachovia acted as master servicer of securitized commercial and multifamily mortgage loans and, following
the merger of the holding companies, Wells Fargo and Wachovia integrated their two servicing platforms under a senior management
team that is a combination of both legacy Wells Fargo managers and legacy Wachovia managers.

Wells Fargo may also enter into agreements
with certain firms to act as a primary servicer and to provide cashiering or non-cashiering sub-servicing on the mortgage loans
and the Serviced Companion Loans. Wells Fargo monitors and reviews the performance of sub-servicers appointed by it. Generally,
all amounts received by Wells Fargo on the mortgage loans and the Serviced Companion Loans will initially be deposited into a common
clearing account with collections on other mortgage loans serviced by Wells Fargo and will then be allocated and transferred to
the appropriate account as described in this free writing prospectus. On the day any amount is to be disbursed by Wells Fargo,
that amount is transferred to a common disbursement account prior to disbursement.


S-268
 
Wells Fargo (in its capacity as the master
servicer under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) will not have primary responsibility for custody services of original documents
evidencing the mortgage loans or the Serviced Companion Loans. On occasion, Wells Fargo may have custody of certain of such documents
as are necessary for enforcement actions involving the mortgage loans, the Serviced Companion Loans or otherwise. To the extent
Wells Fargo performs custodial functions as a servicer, documents will be maintained in a manner consistent with the Servicing
Standard.

The Special Servicer
LNR Partners, LLC (“LNR Partners”),
a Florida limited liability company and a subsidiary of LNR Property LLC (“LNR”), a Delaware limited liability
company, will initially be appointed as special servicer for the mortgage loans to be deposited into the issuing entity (and the
Serviced Companion Loans) (in such capacity, the “Special Servicer”). The principal executive offices of LNR
Partners are located at 1601 Washington Avenue, Suite 700, Miami Beach, Florida 33139 and its telephone number is (305)-695-5600.
LNR through its subsidiaries, affiliates
and joint ventures, is involved in the real estate finance, management and development business and engages in, among other activities:

·acquiring,
developing, repositioning, managing and selling commercial and multifamily residential real estate properties,
 
   


·investing
in high-yielding real estate loans, and
 
   


·investing
in, and managing as special servicer, unrated and non-investment grade rated commercial mortgage backed securities.

LNR Partners and its affiliates have
substantial experience in working out loans and in performing the other obligations of the special servicer as more particularly
described in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, including, but not limited to, processing borrower requests for lender consent
to assumptions, leases, easements, partial releases and expansion and/or redevelopment of the mortgaged properties. LNR Partners
and its affiliates have been engaged in the special servicing of commercial real estate assets for over 22 years. The number of
CMBS pools specially serviced by LNR Partners and its affiliates has increased from 46 in December 1998 to 153 as of June 30,
2015. More specifically, LNR Partners (and its predecessors in interest) acted as special servicer with respect to: (a) 84 domestic
CMBS pools as of December 31, 2001, with a then current face value in excess of $53 billion; (b) 101 domestic CMBS pools as of
December 31, 2002, with a then current face value in excess of $67 billion; (c) 113 domestic CMBS pools as of December 31, 2003,
with a then current face value in excess of $79 billion; (d) 134 domestic CMBS pools as of December 31, 2004, with a then current

LNR or one of its affiliates generally
seeks investments where it has the right to appoint LNR Partners as the special servicer. LNR Partners and its affiliates have
regional offices located across the country in Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, California, New York and North Carolina and in
England and Germany. As of June 30, 2015, LNR Partners had approximately 185 employees responsible for the special servicing of
commercial real estate assets. As of June 30, 2015, LNR Partners and its affiliates specially service a portfolio, which included
approximately 9,320 assets across the United States and various international properties with a then current face value of approximately
$124.8 billion, all of which are commercial real estate assets. Those commercial real estate assets include mortgage loans secured
by the same types of income producing properties as secure the mortgage loans backing the certificates issued by the trust. Accordingly,
the assets of LNR Partners and its affiliates may, depending upon the particular circumstances, including the nature and location
of such assets, compete with the mortgaged real properties securing the underlying mortgage loans for tenants, purchasers, financing
and so forth. LNR Partners does not service any assets other than commercial real estate assets.
LNR Partners maintains internal
and external watch lists, corresponds with master servicers on a monthly basis and conducts overall deal surveillance and shadow
servicing. LNR Partners has developed distinct strategies and procedures for working with borrowers on problem loans (caused by
delinquencies, bankruptcies or other breaches of the mortgage loan documents) designed to maximize value from the assets for the
benefit of the certificateholders. These strategies and procedures vary on a case by case basis, and include, but are not limited
to, liquidation of the underlying collateral, note sales, discounted pay-offs, and borrower negotiation or workout in accordance
with the Servicing Standard. Generally, four basic factors are considered by LNR Partners as part of its analysis and determination
of what strategies and procedures to utilize in connection with problem loans. They are (i) the condition and type of mortgaged
property, (ii) the borrower, (iii) the jurisdiction in which the mortgaged property is located and (iv) the actual terms, conditions
and provisions of the underlying loan documents. After each of these items is evaluated and considered, LNR Partners’ strategy
is guided by the servicing standard and all relevant provisions of the applicable pooling and servicing agreement pertaining to
specially serviced and REO mortgage loans.
LNR Partners has the highest ratings
afforded to special servicers by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services and is rated “CSS1-” by Fitch and has
been given a “Pass” rating by KBRA.
There have not been, during the past
three years, any material changes to the policies or procedures of LNR Partners in the servicing function it will perform under
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. LNR Partners has not engaged, and currently does not have any plans to engage, any sub-servicers
to perform on its behalf any of its duties with respect to this securitization transaction. LNR Partners does not believe that
its financial condition will have any adverse effect on the performance of its duties under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
and, accordingly, will not have any material impact on the mortgage pool performance or the performance of the certificates issued
by the trust. Generally, LNR Partners’ servicing functions under pooling and servicing agreements do not include collection
on the pool assets, however LNR Partners does maintain certain operating accounts with respect to REO mortgage loans in accordance
with the terms of the applicable pooling and servicing agreements and consistent with the servicing standard set forth in each
of such pooling and servicing agreements. LNR Partners does not have any material advancing obligations with respect to the CMBS
pools as to which it acts as special
 


S-271
 
 
servicer.
Generally, LNR Partners has the right, but not the obligation, to make property related servicing advances in emergency situations
with respect to CMBS pools as to which it acts as special servicer.
LNR Partners will not have primary
responsibility for custody services of original documents evidencing the mortgage loans. On occasion, LNR Partners may have custody
of certain of such documents as necessary for enforcement actions involving particular mortgage loans or otherwise. To the extent
that LNR Partners has custody of any such documents, such documents will be maintained in a manner consistent with the Servicing
Standard.
No securitization transaction involving
commercial or multifamily mortgage loans in which LNR Partners was acting as special servicer has experienced an event of default
as a result of any action or inaction by LNR Partners as special servicer. LNR Partners has not been terminated as servicer in
a commercial mortgage loan securitization, either due to a servicing default or to application of a servicing performance test
or trigger. In addition, there has been no previous disclosure of material noncompliance with servicing criteria by LNR Partners
with respect to any other securitization transaction involving commercial or multifamily mortgage loans in which LNR Partners was
acting as special servicer.
 
There are, to the actual current knowledge
of LNR Partners, no special or unique factors of a material nature involved in special servicing the particular types of assets
included in the subject securitization, as compared to the types of assets specially serviced by LNR Partners in other commercial
mortgage backed securitization pools generally, for which LNR Partners has developed processes and procedures which materially
differ from the processes and procedures employed by LNR Partners in connection with its special servicing of commercial mortgaged
backed securitization pools generally.
There are currently no legal proceedings
pending, and no legal proceedings known to be contemplated, by governmental authorities, against LNR Partners or of which any of
its property is the subject, that are material to the Certificateholders.
LNR Partners, the initial special servicer,
and LNR Securities Holdings, LLC (or its affiliate), the expected purchaser of the Class E, Class F, Class G, Class NR and
Class Z certificates, are also affiliates of Starwood Mortgage Funding II LLC, one of the sponsors and mortgage loan sellers.
LNR Partners is not an affiliate of the

advisor, any sponsor (other than SMF II), any originator (other than Starwood Mortgage Capital LLC) or any significant obligor.
LNR Partners, however, is an affiliate of Starwood Mortgage Funding II LLC, one of the sponsors, Starwood Mortgage Capital LLC,

Except as disclosed in this free writing
prospectus and except for LNR Partners acting as special servicer for this securitization transaction, an affiliate of LNR Partners
purchasing the Class E, Class F, Class G, Class NR and Class Z certificates, Starwood Mortgage Funding II LLC being one of

The information set forth under this
sub-heading “—The Special Servicer” has been provided by LNR Partners. None of the depositor, the underwriters,
the master servicer, the senior trust advisor, the trustee, the certificate administrator or any of their affiliates takes any
responsibility for this information or makes any representation or warranty as to its accuracy or completeness.
The special servicer will be required
to pay all expenses incurred in connection with its responsibilities under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (subject to reimbursement
as described in this free writing prospectus).
The special servicer may resign under
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement as described under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Certain Matters Regarding
the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Senior Trust Advisor and the Depositor” in this free writing prospectus.
The special servicer and various related
persons and entities will be entitled to be indemnified by the issuing entity for certain losses and liabilities incurred by the
special servicer as described under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Certain Matters Regarding the Master Servicer,
the Special Servicer, the Senior Trust Advisor and the Depositor” in this free writing prospectus.
Replacement of the Special Servicer
The special servicer may be removed,
and a successor special servicer appointed other than after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Control Event, by the
Directing Certificateholder (a) for cause at any time and (b) without cause if either (i) LNR Partners, LLC or its
affiliate is no longer the special servicer or (ii) LNR Securities Holdings, LLC or its affiliate owns less than 25% of the
Controlling Class certificates; provided that each Rating Agency provides a Rating Agency Confirmation. The reasonable fees
and out-of-pocket expenses of any such termination made by the Directing Certificateholder without cause will be paid by the holders
of the Controlling Class. With respect to any Non-Serviced Whole Loan, the related special servicer may be removed, and a successor
special servicer appointed by the related controlling holder or its designee (and not by the Directing Certificateholder for this
transaction) without cause or for cause at any time, to the extent set forth in the related Non-Serviced PSA and the related intercreditor
agreement for the related Non-Serviced Whole Loan.
After the occurrence and during the continuance
of a Control Event, upon (i) the written direction of holders of Principal Balance Certificates and Class EC certificates
evidencing not less than 25% of the Voting Rights (taking into account the application of any Appraisal Reductions to notionally
reduce the Certificate Balances) of the Principal Balance Certificates and Class EC certificates requesting a vote to replace
the special servicer with a new special servicer, (ii) payment by such holders to the certificate administrator of the reasonable
fees and expenses (including any legal fees and any Rating Agency fees and expenses) to be incurred by the certificate administrator
in connection with administering such vote (which fees and expenses will not be additional trust fund expenses), and (iii) delivery
by such holders to the certificate administrator and the trustee of Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency (such Rating
Agency Confirmation will be obtained at the expense of those holders of certificates requesting such vote), the certificate administrator
will be required to post notice of the same on the certificate administrator’s website and concurrently by mail and conduct
the solicitation of votes of all certificates in such regard, which such vote must occur within 180 days of the posting of such
notice. Upon the written direction of holders of Principal Balance Certificates and Class EC certificates evidencing at least
75% of a Certificateholder Quorum of certificates, the trustee will be required to terminate all of the rights and obligations
of the special servicer under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and appoint the successor special servicer designated by such
Certificateholders; provided such successor special servicer is a Qualified Replacement Special Servicer, subject to indemnification,
right to outstanding fees, reimbursement of Advances and other rights set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, which survive
such termination. The certificate administrator will include on each Statement to Certificateholders a statement that each Certificateholder
may access such notices via the certificate administrator’s website and that each Certificateholder may register to receive
electronic mail notifications when such notices are posted thereon. A “Certificateholder Quorum” means, in connection


S-273
 
 
with any
solicitation of votes in connection with the replacement of the special servicer described above, the holders of certificates
evidencing at least 75% of the aggregate Voting Rights (taking into account the application of realized losses and the application
of any Appraisal Reductions to notionally reduce the Certificate Balance of the certificates) of all Principal Balance Certificates
and Class EC certificates on an aggregate basis.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
special servicer is a Borrower Party with respect to any mortgage loan or Serviced Whole Loan (any such mortgage loan or Serviced
Whole Loan, an “Excluded Special Servicer Loan”), the special servicer will be required to resign as special
servicer of that Excluded Special Servicer Loan. Prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Control Event, if the applicable
Excluded Special Servicer Loan is not also an Excluded Loan, the Directing Certificateholder or the Controlling Class Representative
on its behalf will be required to select a successor special servicer that is not a Borrower Party in accordance with the terms
of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (the “Excluded Special Servicer”) for the related Excluded Special Servicer
Loan. After the occurrence and during the continuance of a Control Event or if at any time the applicable Excluded Special Servicer
Loan is also an Excluded Loan, the resigning special servicer will be required to select the related Excluded Special Servicer.
The special servicer will not have any liability with respect to the actions or inactions of the applicable Excluded Special Servicer
or with respect to the identity of the applicable Excluded Special Servicer so long as the selected Excluded Special Servicer is
a Qualified Replacement Special Servicer. It will be a condition to any such appointment that (i) the Rating Agencies confirm
that the appointment would not result in a qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of any of their then-current ratings of the certificates
and the equivalent from each NRSRO hired to provide ratings with respect to any class of securities backed, wholly or partially,
by any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, (ii) the applicable Excluded Special Servicer is a Qualified Replacement Special
Servicer and (iii) the applicable Excluded Special Servicer delivers to the depositor and any applicable depositor of any other
securitization, if applicable, that contains a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, the information, if any, required pursuant to
Item 6.02 of the Form 8-K regarding itself in its role as Excluded Special Servicer.
If at any time the special servicer is
no longer a Borrower Party with respect to an Excluded Special Servicer Loan, (1) the related Excluded Special Servicer will be
required to resign, (2) the related mortgage loan or Serviced Whole Loan will no longer be an Excluded Special Servicer Loan, (3)
the special servicer will become the special servicer again for such related mortgage loan or Serviced Whole Loan and (4) the special
servicer will be entitled to all special servicing compensation with respect to such mortgage loan or Serviced Whole Loan earned
during such time on and after such mortgage loan or Serviced Whole Loan is no longer an Excluded Special Servicer Loan.
The applicable Excluded Special Servicer
will be required to perform all of the obligations of the special servicer for the related Excluded Special Servicer Loan and will
be entitled to all special servicing compensation with respect to such Excluded Special Servicer Loan earned during such time as
the related mortgage loan or Serviced Whole Loan is an Excluded Special Servicer Loan.
A “Qualified Replacement Special
Servicer” is a replacement special servicer that (i) satisfies all of the eligibility requirements applicable to
special servicers in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, (ii) is not an affiliate of the senior trust advisor, (iii) is
not obligated to pay the senior trust advisor (x) any fees or otherwise compensate the senior trust advisor in respect of
its obligations under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and (y) for the appointment of the successor special servicer or the
recommendation by the senior trust advisor for the replacement special servicer to become the special servicer, (iv) is not
entitled to receive any compensation from the senior trust advisor other than compensation that is not material and is unrelated
to the senior trust advisor’s recommendation that such party be appointed as the replacement special servicer, (v) is
not entitled to receive any fee from the senior trust advisor for its appointment as successor special servicer, in each case,
unless expressly approved by 100% of the Certificateholders, (vi) is not a special servicer that has been cited by Moody’s
as having servicing concerns as the sole or material factor in any qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings (or placement
on “watch status” in contemplation of a ratings downgrade or withdrawal) of securities in a transaction serviced by
the applicable servicer prior to the time of determination, (vii) currently has a special servicer rating of at least “CSS3”
from Fitch, (viii) is not a special servicer that has


S-274
 
 
been cited
by DBRS as having servicing concerns as the sole or a material factor in any qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings
(or placement on “watch status” in contemplation of a ratings downgrade or withdrawal) of securities in a transaction
serviced by the applicable servicer prior to the time of determination and (ix) is not a special servicer that has been cited
by KBRA as having servicing concerns as the sole or material factor in any qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings
(or placement on “watch status” in contemplation of a ratings downgrade or withdrawal) of securities in a transaction
serviced by the applicable servicer prior to the time of determination.
In addition, after the occurrence of
a Consultation Termination Event, if the senior trust advisor determines that the special servicer is not performing its duties
as required under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or is otherwise not acting in accordance with the Servicing Standard, the
senior trust advisor will have the right to recommend the replacement of the special servicer. In such event, the senior trust
advisor will be required to deliver to the trustee and the certificate administrator, with a copy to the special servicer, a written
recommendation detailing the reasons supporting its position (along with relevant information justifying its recommendation) and
recommending a suggested replacement special servicer. The certificate administrator will be required to notify each Certificateholder
of the recommendation and post it on the certificate administrator’s internet website, and to conduct the solicitation of
votes with respect to such recommendation. The senior trust advisor’s recommendation to replace the special servicer must
be confirmed by an affirmative vote of holders of Principal Balance Certificates and Class EC certificates evidencing at least
a majority of the aggregate Voting Rights (taking into account the application of any Appraisal Reductions to notionally reduce
the respective Certificate Balances) of all Principal Balance Certificates and Class EC certificates on an aggregate basis.
In the event the holders of such Principal Balance Certificates and Class EC certificates elect to remove and replace the
special servicer, the certificate administrator will be required to receive a Rating Agency Confirmation from each of the Rating
Agencies at that time. In the event the certificate administrator receives a Rating Agency Confirmation from each of the Rating
Agencies (and the successor special servicer agrees to be bound by the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement), the trustee
will then be required to terminate all of the rights and obligations of the special servicer under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
and to appoint the successor special servicer approved by the Certificateholders, provided such successor special servicer
is a Qualified Replacement Special Servicer, subject to the terminated special servicer’s rights to indemnification, payment
of outstanding fees, reimbursement of Advances and other rights set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement which survive
termination. The reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses associated with obtaining such Rating Agency Confirmations and administering
the vote of the applicable holders of the Principal Balance Certificates and Class EC certificates and the senior trust advisor’s
identification of a Qualified Replacement Special Servicer will be an additional trust fund expense.
In any case, the trustee will notify
the outgoing special servicer promptly of the effective date of its termination. Any replacement special servicer recommended by
the senior trust advisor must be a Qualified Replacement Special Servicer.
It will be a condition to the appointment
of a replacement special servicer that the successor special servicer delivers to the depositor and any applicable depositor of
any other securitization that contains a Serviced Companion Loan, any information regarding itself in its role as successor special
servicer required in connection with a filing on Form 8-K in relation to such replacement and that the depositor and any applicable
depositor of any other securitization that contains a Serviced Companion Loan has filed any required notices on Form 8-K related
to such replacement. The depositor and any applicable depositor of any other securitization that contains a Serviced Companion
Loan will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly complete any such filings required on Form 8-K related to such replacement
and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement will provide that the replacement special servicer and the Directing Certificateholder
will be a third party beneficiary of each such depositor’s obligations.

the outstanding
principal balance of the related mortgage loan or Serviced Whole Loan on the closing date of the related modification, extension,
waiver or amendment (after giving effect to such modification, extension, waiver or amendment) with respect to any mortgage loan
or Serviced Whole Loan.
The Servicing Fee is calculated on the
Stated Principal Balance of the mortgage loans (including the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans), the related Serviced Companion Loans
and any REO Loan (other than any portion of such REO Loan related to a Non-Serviced Companion Loan) in the same manner as interest
is calculated on the mortgage loans, the related Serviced Companion Loans or REO Loan. The Servicing Fee for each mortgage loan
is included in the Administrative Cost Rate listed for that mortgage loan on Annex A-1. Any Servicing Fee Rate calculated
on an Actual/360 Basis will be recomputed on the basis of twelve 30-day months, assuming a 360-day year (“30/360
Basis”) for purposes of calculating the Net Mortgage Rate.
Pursuant to the terms of the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement, Wells Fargo will be entitled to retain a portion of the Servicing Fee with respect to each mortgage loan
and, to the extent provided for in the related intercreditor agreement, each Companion Loan it is responsible for servicing notwithstanding
any termination or resignation of Wells Fargo as master servicer; provided that Wells Fargo may not retain any portion of
the Servicing Fee to the extent that portion of the Servicing Fee is required to appoint a successor master servicer. In addition,
Wells Fargo will have the right to assign and transfer its rights to receive that retained portion of its Servicing Fee to another
party.
The master servicer will be required
to pay all expenses incurred in connection with its responsibilities under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (subject to reimbursement
as described in this free writing prospectus), including all fees of any subservicers retained by it.
The principal compensation to be paid
to the special servicer in respect of its special servicing activities will be the Special Servicing Fee, the Workout Fee and the
Liquidation Fee.
Each of the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans
is serviced under the related Non-Serviced PSA (including those occasions under the applicable Non-Serviced PSA when the servicing
of the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan has been transferred from the master servicer under the related Non-Serviced PSA to the
special servicer under such Non-Serviced PSA). Accordingly, in its capacity as the special servicer under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, the special servicer will not be entitled to receive any special servicing compensation for the Non-Serviced Mortgage
Loans. Only the related special servicer under the related Non-Serviced PSA will be entitled to special servicing compensation
on the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan.
The “Special Servicing Fee”
will accrue with respect to each Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and REO Loan on a loan-by-loan basis at a rate equal to the greater
of a per annum rate of 0.25000% and the per annum rate that would result in a special servicing fee of $3,500 for
the related month (the “Special Servicing Fee Rate”) calculated on the basis of the Stated Principal Balance
of the related mortgage loan and Serviced Companion Loan (including any REO Loan), and in the same manner as interest is calculated
on the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans, and will be payable monthly, first from Liquidation Proceeds, Insurance and
Condemnation Proceeds, and collections in respect of the related REO Property or Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and then
from general collections on all the mortgage loans and any REO Properties in the trust fund. The Non-Serviced Whole Loans will
each be subject to a similar special servicing fee pursuant to the related Non-Serviced PSA. For further detail, see “Servicing
of the Mortgage Loans—Servicing of the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan”, “—Servicing of the U-Haul
Portfolio Mortgage Loan” and “—Servicing of the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan and the Brunswick Portfolio
Mortgage Loan” in this free writing prospectus.
The “Workout Fee”
will generally be payable with respect to each Corrected Mortgage Loan and will be calculated by application of a “Workout
Fee Rate” of 1.0% to each collection of interest and principal (including scheduled payments, prepayments, balloon payments,
and payments at maturity) received on the Corrected Mortgage Loan for so long as it remains a Corrected Mortgage Loan; provided,
however, that after receipt by the special servicer of Workout Fees with respect to such Corrected Mortgage Loan in an amount
equal to $25,000, any Workout Fees in excess of such amount will be reduced by the


S-281
 
 
Excess
Modification Fee Amount; provided, further, however, that in the event the Workout Fee collected over the
course of such workout calculated at the Workout Fee Rate is less than $25,000, then the special servicer will be entitled to
an amount from the final payment on the related Corrected Mortgage Loan (including a Serviced Companion Loan, if applicable) that
would result in the total Workout Fees payable to the special servicer in respect of that Corrected Mortgage Loan (including a
Serviced Companion Loan, if applicable) to be $25,000. The “Excess Modification Fee Amount” with respect to
either the master servicer or the special servicer, any Corrected Mortgage Loan and any particular modification, waiver, extension
or amendment with respect to such Corrected Mortgage Loan that gives rise to the payment of a Workout Fee, is an amount equal
to the aggregate of any Excess Modification Fees paid by or on behalf of the related borrower with respect to the related mortgage
loan (including the related Serviced Companion Loan, unless prohibited under the related intercreditor agreement) and received
and retained by the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, as compensation within the prior 12 months of such
modification, waiver, extension or amendment, but only to the extent those fees have not previously been deducted from a Workout
Fee or Liquidation Fee. Each of the Non-Serviced Whole Loans is subject to a similar workout fee pursuant to the related Non-Serviced
PSA. For further detail, see “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Servicing of the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan”,
“—Servicing of the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan” and “—Servicing of the One Shell Square
Mortgage Loan and the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan” in this free writing prospectus.
The Workout Fee with respect to any Corrected
Mortgage Loan will cease to be payable if the Corrected Mortgage Loan again becomes a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan but will
become payable again if and when the mortgage loan (including a Serviced Companion Loan, if applicable) again becomes a Corrected
Mortgage Loan. The Workout Fee with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan that becomes a Corrected Mortgage Loan will
be reduced by any Excess Modification Fees paid by or on behalf of the related borrower with respect to a related mortgage loan
or REO Loan and received by the special servicer as compensation within the prior 12 months, but only to the extent those fees
have not previously been deducted from a Workout Fee or Liquidation Fee; provided, however, that no Workout Fee will be
less than $25,000 in the aggregate with respect to each mortgage loan.
If the special servicer is terminated
(other than for cause) or resigns, it will retain the right to receive any and all Workout Fees payable with respect to a mortgage
loan or Companion Loan that became a Corrected Mortgage Loan during the period that it acted as special servicer and remained a
Corrected Mortgage Loan at the time of that termination or resignation, except that such Workout Fees will cease to be payable
if the Corrected Mortgage Loan again becomes a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan. The successor special servicer will not be entitled
to any portion of those Workout Fees. If the special servicer resigns or is terminated (other than for cause), it will receive
any Workout Fees payable on Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans for which the resigning or terminated special servicer had determined
to grant a forbearance or cured the event of default through a modification, restructuring or workout negotiated by the special
servicer and evidenced by a signed writing, but which had not as of the time the special servicer resigned or was terminated become
a Corrected Mortgage Loan solely because the borrower had not made three consecutive timely Periodic Payments and which subsequently
becomes a Corrected Mortgage Loan as a result of the borrower making such three consecutive timely Periodic Payments.
A “Liquidation Fee”
will be payable to the special servicer with respect to each Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Property (except with respect
to the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans) as to which the special servicer (a) receives a full, partial or discounted payoff from
the related borrower or (b) receives any Liquidation Proceeds or Insurance and Condemnation Proceeds. The Liquidation Fee
for each Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan will be payable from, and will be calculated by application of a “Liquidation
Fee Rate” of 1.0% to the related payment or proceeds; provided that the Liquidation Fee with respect to any Specially
Serviced Mortgage Loan will be reduced by the amount of any Excess Modification Fees paid by or on behalf of the related borrower
with respect to the related mortgage loan (including a Serviced Companion Loan, if applicable) or REO Property and received by
the special servicer as compensation within the prior 12 months, but only to the extent those fees have not previously been deducted
from a Workout Fee or Liquidation Fee; provided, however, that no Liquidation Fee will be less than $25,000. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary described above, no Liquidation Fee will be payable based upon, or out of, Liquidation Proceeds received
in connection with (i) the repurchase of, or


S-282
 
 
substitution
for, any mortgage loan by a mortgage loan seller for a breach of representation or warranty or for defective or deficient mortgage
loan documentation within the time period (or extension of such time period) provided for such repurchase or substitution if such
repurchase or substitution occurs prior to the termination of the Extended Resolution Period, (ii) the purchase of any
Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan that is subject to mezzanine indebtedness by the holder of the related mezzanine loan within
90 days following the date of such holder’s purchase option first becoming exercisable during the period prior to such mortgage
loan becoming a Corrected Mortgage Loan, (iii) the purchase of all of the mortgage loans and REO Properties in connection
with an optional termination of the trust fund, (iv) with respect to a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, (A) a repurchase
of such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan by the applicable mortgage loan seller for a breach of representation or warranty or
for defective or deficient mortgage loan documentation under the pooling and servicing agreement for the trust that owns such
Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan within the time period (or extension of such time period) provided for such repurchase if such
repurchase occurs prior to the termination of the extended resolution period provided in such pooling and servicing agreement
or (B) a purchase of such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan by an applicable party to a pooling and servicing agreement
pursuant to a clean-up call or similar liquidation of another securitization entity, (v) the purchase of any Specially Serviced
Mortgage Loan by the special servicer or its affiliate (except if such affiliate purchaser is the Directing Certificateholder
or its affiliate; provided, however, that if prior to a Control Event, such affiliated Directing Certificateholder or its
affiliate purchases any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan within 90 days after the special servicer delivers to such Directing
Certificateholder for approval the initial asset status report with respect to such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, the special
servicer will not be entitled to a liquidation fee in connection with such purchase by the Directing Certificateholder or its
affiliates) or (vi) if a mortgage loan or the Serviced Whole Loan becomes a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan only because
of an event described in clause (1) of the definition of “Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan” under the heading
“Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—General” in this free writing prospectus and the related Liquidation
Proceeds are received within 90 days following the related maturity date as a result of the related mortgage loan or the Serviced
Whole Loan being refinanced or otherwise repaid in full. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a liquidation fee is
not payable due to the application of any of clauses (i) through (vi) above, the special servicer may still collect and retain
a liquidation fee and similar fees from the related borrower to the extent provided for in, or not prohibited by, the related
mortgage loan documents. The Non-Serviced Whole Loans will be or are expected to be subject to a similar liquidation fee pursuant
to the related Non-Serviced PSA. For further detail, see “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Servicing of the Civic
Opera Building Mortgage Loan”, “—Servicing of the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan” and “—Servicing
of the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan and the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan” in this free writing prospectus. The
special servicer may not receive a Workout Fee and a Liquidation Fee with respect to the same proceeds collected on a mortgage
loan.
The special servicer will also be entitled
to additional servicing compensation in the form of (i) 100% of Excess Modification Fees related to modifications, waivers,
extensions or amendments of any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans, (ii) 100% of assumption fees and other related fees as
further described in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, received with respect to the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans
and 100% of assumption application fees and similar items received with respect to (x) Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans
and (y) mortgage loans that are not Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans for which the assumptions are processed by the special servicer,
(iii) 100% of waiver, consent and earnout fees on any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or certain other similar fees
paid by the related borrower, (iv) a specified percentage of all Excess Modification Fees and assumption fees, consent fees,
earnout fees and certain other similar fees received with respect to all mortgage loans (including the Serviced Companion Loans,
to the extent not prohibited by the related intercreditor agreements, if applicable) (excluding any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan)
that are not Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and for which the special servicer’s processing, consent or approval is required,
and (v) 50% of all fees related to Major Decisions and Special Servicer Decisions with respect to non-Specially Serviced Mortgage
Loans. The special servicer will also be entitled to late payment charges and default interest paid by the borrowers and accrued
while the related mortgage loans (including the related Serviced Companion Loan, if applicable, and to the extent not prohibited
by the related intercreditor agreement) were Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and that are not needed to pay interest on Advances
or certain additional trust fund expenses with respect to the related mortgage loan (including the related Serviced Companion


S-283
 
 
Loan,
if applicable, to the extent not prohibited by the related intercreditor agreement) since the Closing Date. The special servicer
also is authorized but not required to invest or direct the investment of funds held in the REO Account in Permitted Investments,
and the special servicer will be entitled to retain any interest or other income earned on those funds and will bear any losses
resulting from the investment of these funds, except as set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
Although the master servicer and the
special servicer are each required to service and administer the pool of mortgage loans in accordance with the Servicing Standard
above and, accordingly, without regard to their rights to receive compensation under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, additional
servicing compensation in the nature of assumption and modification fees may under certain circumstances provide the master servicer
or the special servicer, as the case may be, with an economic disincentive to comply with this standard.
The Pooling and Servicing Agreement will
provide that, with respect to each Distribution Date, the special servicer must deliver or cause to be delivered to the master
servicer within two (2) business days following the Determination Date, and the master servicer must deliver, to the extent it
has received, to the certificate administrator, without charge and on the same day as the master servicer is required to deliver
the CREFC® investor reporting package for such Distribution Date, an electronic report which discloses and contains
an itemized listing of any Disclosable Special Servicer Fees received by the special servicer or any of its affiliates with respect
to such Distribution Date, provided that no such report will be due in any month during which no Disclosable Special Servicer
Fees were received.
“Disclosable Special Servicer
Fees” means, with respect to any mortgage loan or REO Property (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans or any related
REO Properties), any compensation and other remuneration (including, without limitation, in the form of commissions, brokerage
fees, rebates, or as a result of any other fee-sharing arrangement) received or retained by the special servicer or any of its
affiliates that is paid by any person (including, without limitation, the Issuing Entity, any mortgagor, any manager, any guarantor
or indemnitor in respect of a mortgage loan and any purchaser of any mortgage loan or REO Property) in connection with the disposition,
workout or foreclosure of any mortgage loan, the management or disposition of any REO Property, and the performance by the special
servicer or any such affiliate of any other special servicing duties under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, other than (1) any
Permitted Special Servicer/Affiliate Fees and (2) any compensation to which the special servicer is entitled pursuant to the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
“Permitted Special Servicer/Affiliate
Fees” means any commercially reasonable treasury management fees, banking fees, title agency fees, insurance commissions
or fees and appraisal fees received or retained by the special servicer or any of its affiliates in connection with any services
performed by such party with respect to any mortgage loan, any Serviced Whole Loan or REO Property.
The Pooling and Servicing Agreement will
provide that the special servicer and its affiliates will be prohibited from receiving or retaining any compensation or any other
remuneration (including, without limitation, in the form of commissions, brokerage fees, rebates, or as a result of any other fee-sharing
arrangement) from any person (including, without limitation, the trust fund, any mortgagor, any property manager, any guarantor
or indemnitor) in respect of a mortgage loan and any purchaser of any mortgage loan or any REO Property in connection with the
disposition, workout or foreclosure of any mortgage loan, the management or disposition of any REO Property, or the performance
of any other special servicing duties under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, other than as expressly provided for in the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement; provided that such prohibition will not apply to Permitted Special Servicer/Affiliate Fees.
As and to the extent described in this
free writing prospectus under “Description of the Certificates—Advances”, the master servicer, the special
servicer and the trustee, as applicable, will be entitled to receive interest on Advances, which will be paid contemporaneously
with the reimbursement of the related Advance.
Each of the master servicer and the special
servicer will be required to pay its overhead and any general and administrative expenses incurred by it in connection with its
servicing activities under the


S-284
 
 
Pooling
and Servicing Agreement. Neither the master servicer nor the special servicer will be entitled to reimbursement for any expenses
incurred by it except as expressly provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The master servicer will be responsible for
all fees payable to any sub-servicers. See “Description of the Certificates—Distributions—Method, Timing
and Amount” in this free writing prospectus.
The master servicer and the special servicer
may delegate certain of their servicing obligations in respect of the mortgage loans, and any related Companion Loan serviced thereby
to one or more third-party sub-servicers; provided that the master servicer and the special servicer, as applicable, will
remain obligated under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. A sub-servicer may be an affiliate of the depositor, the master servicer
or the special servicer. Each sub-servicing agreement between the master servicer or special servicer and a sub-servicer (a “Sub-Servicing
Agreement”) will generally be required to provide that (i) if for any reason the master servicer or special servicer,
as applicable, is no longer acting in that capacity, the trustee or any successor master servicer or special servicer, as applicable,
may assume or terminate such parties’ rights and obligations under such Sub-Servicing Agreement and (ii) the sub-servicer
will be in default under such Sub-Servicing Agreement and such Sub-Servicing Agreement will be terminated (following the expiration
of any applicable grace period) if the sub-servicer fails (A) to deliver by the due date any Exchange Act reporting items
required to be delivered to the master servicer pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or such Sub-Servicing Agreement
or to the master servicer under any other pooling and servicing agreement that the depositor is a party to, or (B) to perform
in any material respect any of its covenants or obligations contained in such Sub-Servicing Agreement regarding creating, obtaining
or delivering any Exchange Act reporting items required in order for any party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to perform
its obligations under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or under the Exchange Act reporting requirements of any other pooling
and servicing agreement that the depositor is a party to. The master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, will be required
to monitor the performance of sub-servicers retained by it and will have the right to remove a sub-servicer retained by it at any
time it considers removal to be in the best interests of Certificateholders. However, no sub-servicer will be permitted under any
Sub-Servicing Agreement to make material servicing decisions, such as loan modifications or determinations as to the manner or
timing of enforcing remedies under the mortgage loan documents, without the consent of the master servicer or special servicer,
as applicable.
Generally, the master servicer will be
solely liable for all fees owed by it to any sub-servicer retained by the master servicer, without regard to whether the master
servicer’s compensation pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement is sufficient to pay those fees. Each sub-servicer
will be required to be reimbursed by the master servicer for certain expenditures which such sub-servicer makes, generally to the
same extent the master servicer would be reimbursed under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
If a borrower prepays a mortgage loan
or any Serviced Companion Loan in whole or in part, after the due date but on or before the Determination Date in any calendar
month, the amount of interest (net of related Servicing Fees and any Excess Interest) accrued on such prepayment from such due
date to, but not including, the date of prepayment (or any later date through which interest accrues) will, to the extent actually
collected (without regard to any prepayment premium or yield maintenance charge actually collected) constitute a “Prepayment
Interest Excess”. Conversely, if a borrower prepays a mortgage loan, or any Serviced Companion Loan in whole or in part
after the Determination Date (or, with respect to each mortgage loan or Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable, with a due date
occurring after the related Determination Date, the related due date) in any calendar month and does not pay interest on such prepayment
through the following due date, then the shortfall in a full month’s interest (net of related Servicing Fees and any Excess
Interest) on such prepayment will constitute a “Prepayment Interest Shortfall”. Prepayment Interest Excesses
(to the extent not offset by Prepayment Interest Shortfalls or required to be paid as Compensating Interest Payments) collected
on the mortgage loans and the Serviced Companion Loans will be retained by the master servicer as additional servicing compensation.
The master servicer will be required
to deliver all Compensating Interest Payments (other than any Compensating Interest Payment described below that is allocable to
a Serviced Companion Loan) to the


S-285
 
 
certificate
administrator for deposit in the Distribution Account on each Master Servicer Remittance Date, without any right of reimbursement
therefor.
With respect to each mortgage loan (other
than the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans) and any related Serviced Companion Loan, a “Compensating Interest Payment”
means an amount as of any Distribution Date equal to the lesser of:
                          
(i)    the aggregate amount of Prepayment Interest
Shortfalls incurred in connection with voluntary principal prepayments received in respect of the mortgage loans and any related
Serviced Companion Loan (in each case other than a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or a mortgage loan or any related Serviced
Companion Loan on which the special servicer allowed a prepayment on a date other than the applicable Due Date) for the related
Distribution Date, and
                         
(ii)    the aggregate of (A) that portion
of the Servicing Fees for such Distribution Date that is, in the case of each mortgage loan, Pari Passu Companion Loan and REO
Loan for which such Servicing Fees are being paid for such Due Period, calculated at a rate of 0.00250% per annum, (B) all
Prepayment Interest Excesses received by the master servicer during such Due Period with respect to the mortgage loans (and, so
long as a Serviced Whole Loan is serviced under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion
Loan) subject to such prepayment and (C) to the extent earned on principal prepayments, net investment earnings payable to
the master servicer for such Due Period received by the master servicer during such Due Period with respect to the mortgage loan
or any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, as applicable, subject to such prepayment. In no event will the rights of the
Certificateholders to the offset of the aggregate Prepayment Interest Shortfalls be cumulative.
If a Prepayment Interest Shortfall occurs
with respect to a mortgage loan as a result of the master servicer allowing the related borrower to deviate (a “Prohibited
Prepayment”) from the terms of the related mortgage loan documents regarding principal prepayments (other than (v) the
Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans, (w) subsequent to a default under the related mortgage loan documents or if the mortgage loan is a
Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, (x) pursuant to applicable law or a court order or otherwise in such circumstances where the
master servicer is required to accept such principal prepayment in accordance with the Servicing Standard, (y) at the request or
with the consent of the special servicer or, so long as a Control Event has not occurred or is not continuing, and with respect
to the mortgage loans other than an Excluded Loan, the Directing Certificateholder or (z) in connection with the payment of any
insurance proceeds or condemnation awards), then for purposes of calculating the Compensating Interest Payment for the related
Distribution Date, master servicer will pay, without regard to clause (ii) above, the aggregate amount of Prepayment Interest Shortfalls
with respect to such mortgage loan otherwise described in clause (i) above in connection with such Prohibited Prepayments.
Compensating Interest Payments with respect
to the Serviced Whole Loans will be allocated among the related mortgage loan and the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan,
pro rata, in accordance with their respective principal amounts.

the Pentalpha Surveillance system in connection with the services provided by the Pentalpha group of companies.
Pentalpha Surveillance and its affiliates
have been engaged by individual securitization trusts, financial institutions, institutional investors as well as agencies of the
U.S. Government. As of August 31, 2015, Pentalpha Surveillance has acted as operating advisor or trust advisor in approximately
73 commercial mortgage-backed securitizations with an aggregate initial unpaid principal balance of approximately $82 billion since
October 2010.
Pentalpha Surveillance is not an affiliate
of the Issuing Entity, the depositor, the sponsors, the mortgage loan sellers, the trustee, the certificate administrator, the
master servicer, the special servicer, the directing certificateholder or any “originators” (within the meaning of

to the trust.
From time to time, Pentalpha Surveillance
may be a party to lawsuits and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. However, there are currently
no legal proceedings pending, and no legal proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities, against Pentalpha
Surveillance or of which any of its property is the subject, that would have a material adverse effect on Pentalpha Surveillance’s
business or its ability to serve as senior trust advisor pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or that is material to
the holders of the certificates.
The foregoing information set forth in
this free writing prospectus concerning the senior trust advisor under this heading “The Senior Trust Advisor”
has been provided by the senior trust advisor.
Description
of the Certificates
General
The certificates will be issued pursuant
to a pooling and servicing agreement, among the depositor, the master servicer, the special servicer, the trustee, the certificate
administrator and the senior trust advisor (the “Pooling and Servicing Agreement”) and will represent in the
aggregate the entire beneficial ownership interest in JPMBB Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2015-C32, which will be a trust
fund consisting of, among other things: (1) the mortgage loans and all payments under and proceeds of the mortgage loans received
after the Cut-off Date (exclusive of payments of principal and/or interest due on or before the Cut-off Date and interest relating
to periods prior to, but due after, the Cut-off Date); (2) any REO Property but, with respect to any Whole Loan, only to the
extent of the trust fund’s interest in such Whole Loan; (3) those funds or assets as from time to time are deposited
in the Certificate Account, the Distribution Accounts (including any sub-accounts), the Interest Reserve Account, the Gain-on-Sale
Reserve Account, the Excess Interest Distribution Account or the REO Account (such accounts collectively, the “Securitization
Accounts”) (but, with respect to any Whole Loan, only to the extent of the trust fund’s interest in such Whole
Loan), if established; (4) the rights of the mortgagee under all insurance policies with respect to its mortgage loans; and
(5) certain rights of the depositor under the Purchase Agreement relating to mortgage loan document delivery requirements
and the representations and warranties of each mortgage loan seller regarding the mortgage loans it sold to the depositor.


S-287
 
The depositor’s Commercial Mortgage
Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2015-C32 will consist of the following classes: the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3,
Class A-4, Class A-5 and Class A-SB certificates (collectively, with the Class A-S certificates, the “Class A
Certificates”), the Class X-A, Class X-B, Class X-C and Class X-D certificates (collectively, the “Class X
Certificates”), and the Class A-S, Class B, Class C, Class EC, Class D, Class E, Class F,
Class G, Class NR, Class R and Class Z certificates. The Class A Certificates (other than the Class A-S
certificates) and the Class X Certificates are referred to collectively in this free writing prospectus as the “Senior
Certificates”. The Class A-S, Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E, Class F, Class G
and Class NR certificates are referred to collectively in this free writing prospectus as the “Subordinate Certificates”.
The Class R certificates are sometimes referred to in this free writing prospectus as the “Residual Certificates”.
The Senior Certificates and the Subordinate Certificates are collectively referred to in this free writing prospectus as the “Regular
Certificates”. The Class A Certificates and the Subordinate Certificates are collectively referred to in this free
writing prospectus as the “Principal Balance Certificates”. The Senior Certificates (other than the Class X-C
and Class X-D certificates) and the Class A-S, Class B, Class C, Class EC and Class D certificates are also
referred to in this free writing prospectus as the “Offered Certificates”. The Class A-S, Class B
and Class C certificates are collectively referred to in this free writing prospectus as the “Exchangeable Certificates”.
The “Certificate Balance”
of any class of Principal Balance Certificates and the Class EC certificates, as applicable, outstanding at any time represents
the maximum amount that its holders are entitled to receive as distributions allocable to principal from the cash flow on the mortgage
loans and the other assets in the trust fund. On each Distribution Date, the Certificate Balance of each class of Principal Balance
Certificates will be reduced by any distributions of principal actually made on, and any Collateral Support Deficit actually allocated
to, that class of Principal Balance Certificates on that Distribution Date. On each Distribution Date, the Certificate Balance
of each class of Principal Balance Certificates will be increased by any Certificate Deferred Interest allocated to such class
of Principal Balance Certificates and, with respect to any class of Principal Balance Certificates that has unreimbursed Collateral
Support Deficit allocated to such class, the Certificate Balance of such class may be increased by the amount of any recoveries
of Nonrecoverable Advances, up to the unreimbursed Collateral Support Deficit for such class, allocated in accordance with the
distribution priorities described under “—Distributions—Priority” below. The initial Certificate
Balance of each class of offered Principal Balance Certificates is expected to be the balance set forth on the cover of this free
writing prospectus.
The initial Certificate Balances of the
Class A-S, Class B and Class C certificates represent the principal balance of such Classes without giving effect
to any exchange and conversion for Class EC certificates. The initial Certificate Balance of the Class EC certificates
shown on the front cover represents the maximum principal balance of such Class that could be issued in an exchange and conversion.
In the event that no Exchangeable Certificates are converted to Class EC certificates, the Certificate Balance of the Class EC
certificates would be equal to zero. Any exchange of (i) a portion of the Exchangeable Certificates will be deemed to result (other
than for federal income tax purposes) in a conversion and reduction, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, of a proportionate share of
each related component class of the Exchangeable Certificates, and a conversion and increase, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, of
the Certificate Balance of the Class EC certificates, and (ii) any amount of the Class EC certificates will be deemed
to result (other than for federal income tax purposes) in a conversion and reduction, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, of the Certificate
Balance of the Class EC certificates converted, and a conversion and increase, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, of a proportionate
share of the related Certificate Balances of each class of certificates that are components of the Exchangeable Certificates.
For purposes of determining the Controlling
Class under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and for the exercise of certain Voting Rights as described in this free writing
prospectus, the Certificate Balance of each class of Principal Balance Certificates (other than the Class A-1, Class A-2,
Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5 and Class A-SB certificates) will be notionally reduced by its share of Appraisal Reductions allocated
as described in “—Appraisal Reductions” below. Appraisal Reductions allocated to the Exchangeable Certificates
will reduce the Voting Rights of the Class EC certificates as described in “Description of the Certificates—Voting
Rights” in this free writing prospectus.


S-288
 
The Residual Certificates will not have
a Certificate Balance or entitle their holders to distributions of principal or interest.
The Class X Certificates will not
have Certificate Balances, nor will they entitle their holders to distributions of principal, but the Class X Certificates
will represent the right to receive distributions of interest in an amount equal to the aggregate interest accrued on their respective
notional amounts (each, a “Notional Amount”). The Notional Amount of the Class X-A certificates will equal
the aggregate of the Certificate Balances of the Class A Certificates outstanding from time to time (determined without giving
effect to any exchange and conversion of any Class A-S certificates for Class EC certificates). The initial Notional
Amount of the Class X-A certificates will be approximately $855,381,000. The Notional Amount of the Class X-B certificates
will equal the Certificate Balance of the Class B certificates outstanding from time to time (determined without giving effect
to any exchange and conversion of any Class B certificates for Class EC certificates). The initial Notional Amount of
the Class X-B certificates will be approximately $57,408,000. The Notional Amount of the Class X-C certificates will
equal the Certificate Balance of the Class C certificates outstanding from time to time (determined without giving effect
to any exchange and conversion of any Class C certificates for Class EC certificates). The initial Notional Amount of the Class X-C
certificates will be approximately $99,029,000. The Notional Amount of the Class X-D certificates will equal the Certificate
Balance of the Class D certificates outstanding from time to time. The initial Notional Amount of the Class X-D certificates
will be approximately $50,232,000.
The Class Z certificates will not
have a Certificate Balance nor will they entitle their holders to distributions of principal, but the Class Z certificates
will represent the right to receive Excess Interest received on the ARD Loan.
The Offered Certificates (other than
the Class X-A and Class X-B certificates) will be maintained and transferred in book-entry form and issued in denominations
of $10,000 initial Certificate Balance, and integral multiples of $1 in excess of $10,000 and, with respect to the Class X-A
and Class X-B certificates, will be issued, maintained and transferred only in minimum denominations of authorized initial
Notional Amount of not less than $1,000,000, and in integral multiples of $1 in excess of $1,000,000. The “Percentage
Interest” evidenced by any certificate (other than the Residual Certificates and the Class Z certificates) is equal to
its initial denomination as of the Closing Date, in the case of the Exchangeable Certificates after giving effect to any exchange
and conversion for Class EC certificates, divided by the initial Certificate Balance or Notional Amount of the class to which
it belongs. With respect to the Class EC certificates, the percentage interest is equal to the denomination of such certificate
divided by the initial Certificate Balance as of the Closing Date of the Exchangeable Certificates exchanged and converted for
such Class EC certificates.
The Offered Certificates will initially
be represented by one or more global certificates registered in the name of the nominee of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”).
The depositor has been informed by DTC that DTC’s nominee will be Cede & Co. No person acquiring an interest in
the Offered Certificates (this person, a “Certificate Owner”) will be entitled to receive an Offered Certificate
in fully registered, certificated form, a definitive certificate, representing its interest in that class, except as set forth
under “—Book-Entry Registration and Definitive Certificates” below. Unless and until definitive certificates
are issued, all references to actions by holders of the Offered Certificates will refer to actions taken by DTC upon instructions
received from Certificate Owners through its participating organizations (together with Clearstream Banking, société
anonyme (“Clearstream”) and Euroclear Bank, as operator of the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”)
participating organizations, the “Participants”), and all references in this free writing prospectus to payments,
notices, reports and statements to holders of the Offered Certificates will refer to payments, notices, reports and statements
to DTC or Cede & Co., as the registered holder of Offered Certificates, for distribution to Certificate Owners through
DTC and its Participants in accordance with DTC procedures.
A “Certificateholder”
is the person in whose name a certificate is registered in the certificate register or any beneficial owner thereof; provided,
however, that solely for the purposes of giving any consent, approval, waiver or taking any action pursuant to the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement, any certificate registered in the name of or beneficially owned by the master servicer, the special servicer
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Excluded Special Servicer), the trustee, the certificate administrator, the


S-289
 
 
depositor,
any mortgage loan seller, a manager of a Mortgaged Property, a borrower or any affiliate of any of such persons will be deemed
not to be outstanding (provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, any Controlling Class certificates owned by an Excluded
Controlling Class Holder will not be deemed to be outstanding as to such Excluded Controlling Class Holder solely with respect
to any related Excluded Controlling Class Loan; and provided, further, that any Controlling Class certificates owned
by the special servicer or an affiliate thereof will not be deemed to be outstanding as to the special servicer or such affiliate
solely with respect to any related Excluded Special Servicer Loan), and the Voting Rights to which it is entitled will not be
taken into account in determining whether the requisite percentage of Voting Rights necessary to effect any such consent, approval,
waiver or take any such action has been obtained; provided, however, the foregoing restrictions will not apply in the case
of the master servicer, the special servicer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Excluded Special Servicer), the trustee,
the certificate administrator, the depositor, any mortgage loan seller or any affiliate of any of such persons unless such consent,
approval or waiver sought from such party would in any way increase its compensation or limit its obligations in the named capacities
under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or waive a Servicer Termination Event; provided, further, however,
that so long as there is no Servicer Termination Event with respect to the master servicer or the special servicer, the master
servicer and the special servicer or such affiliate of either will be entitled to exercise such Voting Rights with respect to
any issue which could reasonably be believed to adversely affect such party’s compensation or increase its obligations or
liabilities under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement; and provided, further, however, that such restrictions
will not apply to the exercise of the special servicer’s, the master servicer’s or any mortgage loan seller’s
rights, if any, or any of their or their affiliates’ rights as a member of the Controlling Class.
Until definitive certificates are issued,
interests in any class of Offered Certificates will be transferred on the book-entry records of DTC and its Participants.
Exchanges of Exchangeable
Certificates and Class EC Certificates
Exchanges
The Certificate Balances of the Class A-S,
Class B and Class C certificates represent the principal balance of such classes without giving effect to any exchange
and conversion for Class EC certificates. The initial Certificate Balance of the Class EC certificates represents the
maximum principal balance of such class that could be issued in an exchange and conversion for all of the Exchangeable Certificates.
In the event that no Exchangeable Certificates are converted to Class EC certificates, the Certificate Balance of the Class EC
certificates would be equal to zero. Any exchange of (i) a portion of the Exchangeable Certificates will be deemed to result
(other than for federal income tax purposes) in a conversion and reduction, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, of a proportionate share
of each related component class of the Exchangeable Certificates for, and an increase, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, of the Certificate
Balance of the Class EC certificates, and (ii) any amount of the Class EC certificates will be deemed to result
(other than for federal income tax purposes) in a conversion and reduction, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, of the Certificate Balance
of the Class EC certificates converted and an increase, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, of a proportionate share of the related
Certificate Balances of each class of certificates that are components of the Exchangeable Certificates.
Holders of Exchangeable Certificates
may surrender their certificates to the certificate administrator and the certificate administrator will be required to convert
those Exchangeable Certificates for a like amount of Class EC certificates. Similarly, holders of the Class EC certificates
may surrender their certificates to the certificate administrator and the certificate administrator will be required to convert
those certificates for a like amount of the related Classes of Exchangeable Certificates.
The Class EC certificates represent
an interest in a grantor trust for tax purposes only, and do not represent an interest in an entity other than the issuing entity
and such grantor trust is not a separate legal entity. No investor in Exchangeable Certificates or Class EC certificates will
be entitled to redeem their certificates for any portion of the mortgage loans or any other assets included in the Issuing Entity
or for any other consideration.


S-290
 
Exchangeable Certificates in the Exchange
Proportion may be exchanged and converted for Class EC certificates and Class EC certificates may be exchanged and converted
for all three classes of Exchangeable Certificates, in each case, in whole or in part. This process may occur repeatedly. In the
event that the Certificate Balance of any class of Exchangeable Certificates is reduced to zero as a result of any such class being
paid all interest and principal in full and reimbursements of Collateral Support Deficits, exchanges and conversions will no longer
be permissible. With respect to any exchange and conversion, all three classes of Exchangeable Certificates will be required in
order to exchange and convert such Exchangeable Certificates to Class EC certificates and Class EC certificates can be
exchanged and converted to all three classes of Exchangeable Certificates, such conversion being calculated using the initial Certificate
Balances of the individual certificates being exchanged and converted (rather than the outstanding Certificate Balance), in each
case, in the applicable Exchange Proportion. This Exchange Proportion is based on the initial Certificate Balances of the classes
(rather than the outstanding Certificate Balances). The aggregate Certificate Balance of the certificates (with each class rounded
down to the nearest whole dollar) received after an exchange and conversion, immediately after the exchange and conversion, must
equal the aggregate Certificate Balance of the certificates (with each class rounded down to the nearest whole dollar) surrendered
for exchange and conversion immediately prior to such exchange and conversion. Each class of Exchangeable Certificates exchanged
and converted or received in any exchange and conversion must be at least the minimum denomination as described under “Description
of the Certificates—General” in this free writing prospectus. In addition, the depositor will have the right to
make or cause exchanges on the Closing Date pursuant to instructions delivered to the certificate administrator on the Closing
Date.
 
The “Exchange Proportion”
is as follows:
 
Class A-S:	24.82749010110330%	                             Class EC	100.00000000000000%
 
Class B:	27.58620689655170%
 
Class C:	47.58630300234500%
The Class EC certificates will only
receive distributions of interest and principal and other amounts that are allocated to the Exchangeable Certificates exchanged
for and converted to such Class EC certificates. Any Collateral Support Deficits or other shortfalls, including as a result
of Appraisal Reduction Events, allocated to Exchangeable Certificates that were exchanged for and converted to Class EC certificates
will be borne by such Class EC certificates and any recoveries of such amounts will be paid to such Class EC certificates.
In addition, any Appraisal Reductions that would otherwise be allocated to individually reduce any class of Exchangeable Certificates
will be allocated to the Class EC certificates.
For a discussion of the federal income
tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Class EC certificates, see “Material Federal
Income Tax Consequences—Taxation of the Class EC Certificates” in this free writing prospectus.
Procedures and Fees
If a Certificateholder wishes to convert
Exchangeable Certificates for Class EC certificates, or Class EC certificates for Exchangeable Certificates, such Certificateholder
must notify the certificate administrator by e-mail at cts.cmbs.bond.admin@wellsfargo.com no later than three (3) business days
prior to the proposed date of such exchange and conversion (the “Exchange Date”). The Exchange Date can be any
business day other than the first or last business day of the month, subject to satisfaction of the certificate administrator and
the restrictions set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. In addition, the Certificateholder must provide notice on the
Certificateholder’s letterhead, which notice must carry a medallion stamp guarantee and set forth the following information:
the CUSIP numbers of the Exchangeable Certificates or Class EC certificates to be exchanged and converted and the Class EC
certificates or Exchangeable Certificates to be received, the Class Certificate Balance of the Exchangeable Certificates or
the Class EC certificates to be exchanged and converted, the Certificateholder’s DTC participant number, if applicable
and the proposed Exchange Date. The


S-291
 
 
Certificateholder
will utilize the “deposit and withdrawal system” at DTC to affect the exchange and conversion of the certificates.
The principal and interest entitlements
of the certificates received must equal the entitlements of the certificates surrendered. The notice of exchange will become irrevocable
on the 2nd business day before the proposed Exchange Date.
In connection with each exchange, the
Certificateholder may be required to pay certain fees charged by DTC and such fees must be received by the certificate administrator
prior to the exchange date or such exchange will not be effected. The first distribution on an Exchangeable Certificate or Class EC
certificates will be made in the month following the month of exchange to the Certificateholder of record as of the applicable
Record Date for such certificate. Neither the certificate administrator nor the depositor will have any obligation to ensure the
availability of the applicable certificates to accomplish any exchange.
Book-Entry Registration and
Definitive Certificates
General. Certificateholders may
hold their certificates through DTC (in the United States) or Clearstream or Euroclear (in Europe) if they are Participants in
that system, or indirectly through organizations that are Participants in those systems. Clearstream and Euroclear will hold omnibus
positions on behalf of the Clearstream Participants and the Euroclear Participants, respectively, through customers’ securities
accounts in Clearstream’s and Euroclear’s names on the books of their respective depositories (collectively, the “Depositories”)
which in turn will hold those positions in customers’ securities accounts in the Depositories’ names on the books of
DTC. DTC is a limited purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within
the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the
meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to Section 17A of
the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its Participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities
transactions between Participants through electronic computerized book-entries, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement
of certificates. Participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations (“Direct
Participants”). Indirect access to the DTC system also is available to others (such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust
companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant), either directly or indirectly (“Indirect
Participants”).
Transfers between DTC Participants will
occur in accordance with DTC rules. Transfers between Clearstream Participants and Euroclear Participants will occur in accordance
with their applicable rules and operating procedures.
Cross-market transfers between persons
holding directly or indirectly through DTC, on the one hand, and directly through Clearstream Participants or Euroclear Participants,
on the other, will be effected in DTC in accordance with DTC rules on behalf of the relevant European international clearing system
by its Depository; however, these cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to the relevant European
international clearing system by the counterparty in that system in accordance with its rules and procedures. If the transaction
complies with all relevant requirements, Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will then deliver instructions to the Depository
to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf.
Because of time-zone differences, it
is possible that credits of securities in Clearstream or Euroclear as a result of a transaction with a DTC Participant will be
made during the subsequent securities settlement processing, dated the business day following the DTC settlement date, and those
credits or any transactions in those securities settled during this processing will be reported to the relevant Clearstream Participant
or Euroclear Participant on that business day. Cash received in Clearstream or Euroclear as a result of sales of securities by
or through a Clearstream Participant or a Euroclear Participant to a DTC Participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement
date but, due to time-zone differences, may be available in the relevant Clearstream or Euroclear cash account only as of the business
day following settlement in DTC.


S-292
 
Certificate Owners that are not Direct
or Indirect Participants but desire to purchase, sell or otherwise transfer ownership of, or other interests in, the Offered Certificates
may do so only through Direct and Indirect Participants. In addition, Certificate Owners will receive all distributions of principal
of and interest on the Offered Certificates from the certificate administrator through DTC and its Direct and Indirect Participants.
Accordingly, Certificate Owners may experience delays in their receipt of payments, since those payments will be forwarded by the
certificate administrator to Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. DTC will forward those payments to its Participants, which
thereafter will forward them to Indirect Participants or beneficial owners of Offered Certificates. Except as otherwise provided
under “—Reports to Certificateholders; Certain Available Information” below, Certificate Owners will not
be recognized by the trustee, the certificate administrator, the special servicer or the master servicer as holders of record of
Certificates and Certificate Owners will be permitted to receive information furnished to Certificateholders and to exercise the
rights of Certificateholders only indirectly through DTC and its Direct and Indirect Participants.
Under the rules, regulations and procedures
creating and affecting DTC and its operations (the “Rules”), DTC is required to make book-entry transfers of
the Offered Certificates among Participants and to receive and transmit distributions of principal of, and interest on, the Offered
Certificates. Direct and Indirect Participants with which Certificate Owners have accounts with respect to the Offered Certificates
similarly are required to make book-entry transfers and receive and transmit the distributions on behalf of their respective Certificate
Owners. Accordingly, although Certificate Owners will not possess physical certificates evidencing their interests in the Offered
Certificates, the Rules provide a mechanism by which Certificate Owners, through their Direct and Indirect Participants, will receive
distributions and will be able to transfer their interests in the Offered Certificates.
Because DTC can only act on behalf of
Participants, who in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants and certain banks, the ability of Certificateholders to pledge
the certificates to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC system, or to otherwise act with respect to the certificates,
may be limited due to the lack of a physical certificate for the certificates.
DTC has advised the depositor that it
will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of an Offered Certificate under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement only
at the direction of one or more Participants to whose accounts with DTC the Offered Certificates are credited. DTC may take conflicting
actions with respect to other undivided interests to the extent that those actions are taken on behalf of Participants whose holdings
include the undivided interests.
Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream
have implemented the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in global certificates among Participants
of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or to continue to comply with the foregoing procedures,
and the foregoing procedures may be discontinued at any time.
None of the depositor, the underwriters,
the master servicer, the special servicer, the trustee or the certificate administrator will have any liability for any actions
taken by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, their respective Direct or Indirect Participants or their nominees, including, without
limitation, actions for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in
the Offered Certificates held by Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records
relating to that beneficial ownership interest. The information in this free writing prospectus concerning DTC, Clearstream and
Euroclear and their book-entry systems has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but the depositor takes no responsibility
for the accuracy or completeness of the information.
Definitive Certificates. Definitive
certificates will be issued to Certificate Owners or their nominees, respectively, rather than to DTC or its nominee, only under
the limited conditions set forth under “—Book-Entry Registration and Definitive Certificates” in the prospectus.
Upon the occurrence of certain events,
as described in the prospectus under “—Book-Entry Registration and Definitive Certificates”, the certificate
administrator is required to notify, through DTC, Direct Participants who have ownership of Offered Certificates as indicated on
the records of DTC of the


S-293
 
 
availability
of definitive certificates. Upon surrender by DTC of the global certificates representing the Offered Certificates and upon receipt
of instructions from DTC for re-registration, the certificate administrator will reissue the Offered Certificates as definitive
certificates issued in the respective Certificate Balances or Notional Amount, as applicable, owned by individual Certificate
Owners, and thereafter the trustee, the certificate administrator, the special servicer, the master servicer and the senior trust
advisor will recognize the holders of those definitive certificates as Certificateholders under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
For additional information regarding
DTC and Certificates maintained on the book-entry records of DTC, see “—Book-Entry Registration and Definitive Certificates”
in the prospectus.
List of Certificateholders
Upon the written request of any Certificateholder,
which is required to include a copy of the communication the Certificateholder proposes to transmit, that has provided an Investor
Certification, which such request is made for purposes of communicating with other holders of certificates of the same series with
respect to their rights under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or the certificates, the certificate registrar or other specified
person will, within 10 business days after receipt of such request afford such Certificateholder (at such Certificateholder’s
sole cost and expense) access during normal business hours to the most recent list of Certificateholders related to the class of
certificates.
Distributions
Method, Timing and Amount. Distributions
on the certificates are required to be made by the certificate administrator, to the extent of available funds as described in
this free writing prospectus, on the 4th business day following each Determination Date (each, a “Distribution
Date”). The “Determination Date” will be the 11th day of each calendar month (or, if the
11th calendar day of that month is not a business day, then the business day immediately succeeding such 11th
calendar day) commencing in November 2015. All distributions (other than the final distribution on any certificate) are required
to be made to the Certificateholders in whose names the certificates are registered at the close of business on each Record Date.
With respect to any Distribution Date, the “Record Date” will be the last business day of the month preceding
the month in which that Distribution Date occurs. These distributions are required to be made by wire transfer in immediately available
funds to the account specified by the Certificateholder at a bank or other entity having appropriate facilities therefor, if the
Certificateholder has provided the certificate administrator with written wiring instructions no less than five business days
prior to the related Record Date (which wiring instructions may be in the form of a standing order applicable to all subsequent
distributions) or otherwise by check mailed to the Certificateholder. The final distribution on any certificate is required to
be made in like manner, but only upon presentation and surrender of the certificate at the location that will be specified in a
notice of the pendency of the final distribution. All distributions made with respect to a class of certificates will be allocated
pro rata among the outstanding certificates of that class based on their respective Percentage Interests.
The master servicer is required to establish
and maintain, or cause to be established and maintained, one or more accounts and subaccounts (collectively, the “Certificate
Account”) as described in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The Certificate Account may be maintained with the master
servicer, special servicer or any mortgage loan seller or with a depository institution that is an affiliate of any of the foregoing
or the depositor; provided that any such entity must comply with certain standards set forth in the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement. The master servicer is required to deposit in the Certificate Account on a daily basis (and in no event later than the
second business day following receipt of properly identified funds) all payments and collections due after the Cut-off Date and
other amounts received or advanced with respect to the mortgage loans (including, without limitation, all proceeds (the “Insurance
and Condemnation Proceeds”) received under any hazard, title or other insurance policy that provides coverage with respect
to a Mortgaged Property or the related mortgage loan in connection with the full or partial condemnation of a Mortgaged Property
(other than proceeds applied to the restoration of the Mortgaged Property or released to the related borrower in accordance with
the Servicing Standard (or, if applicable, a special servicer) and/or the terms and conditions of the related Mortgage) and all
other


S-294
 
 
amounts
received and retained in connection with the liquidation of any mortgage loan that is defaulted and any related defaulted Companion
Loans or property acquired by foreclosure or otherwise (the “Liquidation Proceeds”)) together with the net
operating income (less reasonable reserves for future expenses) derived from the operation of any REO Properties, and will be
permitted to make withdrawals therefrom as set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
collections on the Whole Loans will be limited to the portion of such amounts that are payable to the holder of the related mortgage
loan included in the trust pursuant to the related intercreditor agreement.
The certificate administrator is required
to establish and maintain accounts (the “Lower-Tier REMIC Distribution Account”, the “Upper-Tier REMIC
Distribution Account”, the “Class EC Distribution Account” and the “Excess Interest
Distribution Account”, each of which may be sub-accounts of a single account (collectively, the “Distribution
Account”)), in its own name on behalf of the trustee and for the benefit of the Certificateholders. On each Distribution
Date, the certificate administrator is required to apply amounts on deposit in the Upper-Tier REMIC Distribution Account (which
will include all funds that were remitted by the master servicer from the Certificate Account plus, among other things, any P&I
Advances less amounts, if any, distributable to the Class R and Class Z certificates as set forth in the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement generally to make distributions of interest and principal from the Available Distribution Amount to the Certificateholders
as described in this free writing prospectus. Each of the Certificate Account and the Distribution Accounts will conform to certain
eligibility requirements set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
The certificate administrator is required
to establish and maintain an account (the “Interest Reserve Account”) which may be a sub-account of the Distribution
Account, in its own name on behalf of the trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders (other than the holders of the Class
Z certificates). On the Master Servicer Remittance Date occurring each February and on any Master Servicer Remittance Date occurring
in any January which occurs in a year that is not a leap year (in each case, unless the related Distribution Date is the final
Distribution Date), the certificate administrator will be required to deposit amounts remitted by the master servicer or P&I
Advances made on the related mortgage loans into the Interest Reserve Account during the related interest period, in respect of
the mortgage loans that accrue interest on an Actual/360 Basis (collectively, the “Withheld Loans”), in an amount
equal to one day’s interest at the Net Mortgage Rate for each such Withheld Loan on its Stated Principal Balance and
as of the Distribution Date in the month preceding the month in which the Master Servicer Remittance Date occurs, to the extent
a Periodic Payment or P&I Advance or other deposit is made in respect of the mortgage loans (all amounts so deposited in any
consecutive January (if applicable) and February, “Withheld Amounts”). On the Master Servicer Remittance
Date occurring each March (or February, if the related Distribution Date is the final Distribution Date), the certificate
administrator will be required to withdraw from the Interest Reserve Account an amount equal to the Withheld Amounts from the preceding
January (if applicable) and February, if any, and deposit that amount into the Lower-Tier REMIC Distribution Account.
The certificate administrator is required
to establish and maintain an account (the “Class EC Distribution Account”), which may be a sub-account
of the Distribution Account, in its own name on behalf of the trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Class EC certificates.
The certificate administrator is required
to establish and maintain an account (the “Excess Interest Distribution Account”), which may be a sub-account
of the Distribution Account, in the name of the trustee for the benefit of the holders of the Class Z certificates. Prior to the
applicable Distribution Date, the master servicer is required to remit to the certificate administrator for deposit into the Excess
Interest Distribution Account an amount equal to the Excess Interest received by the master servicer on or prior to the related
Determination Date.
The certificate administrator may be
required to establish and maintain an account (the “Gain-on-Sale Reserve Account”), which may be a sub-account
of the Distribution Account, in its own name on behalf of the trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders. To the extent
that gains (or, with respect to any Whole Loan, the portion of such amounts that are payable to the holder of the related mortgage
loan included in the trust pursuant to the related intercreditor agreement) realized on sales of Mortgaged Properties, if


S-295
 
 
any, are
not used to offset Collateral Support Deficits previously allocated to the certificates, such gains will be held and applied to
offset future Collateral Support Deficits, if any.
The master servicer is authorized but
not required to direct the investment of funds held in the Certificate Account in U.S. government securities and other obligations
that are acceptable to each of the Rating Agencies (“Permitted Investments”). The master servicer will be entitled
to retain any interest or other income earned on such funds and the master servicer will be required to bear any losses resulting
from the investment of such funds, as provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The certificate administrator is authorized
but not required to direct the investment of funds held in the Lower-Tier REMIC Distribution Account, the Upper-Tier REMIC Distribution
Account, the Interest Reserve Account, the related companion distribution account, the Class EC Distribution Account, the
Excess Interest Distribution Account and the Gain-on-Sale Reserve Account in Permitted Investments. The certificate administrator
will be entitled to retain any interest or other income earned on such funds and the certificate administrator will be required
to bear any losses resulting from the investment of such funds, as provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
The Available Distribution Amount.
The aggregate amount available for distribution to holders of the certificates (other than the Class Z certificates) on each Distribution
Date (the “Available Distribution Amount”) will, in general, equal the sum of the following amounts (without
duplication):
(a)	the aggregate amount of
all cash received on the mortgage loans (in the case of any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, only to the extent received by the trust
pursuant to the applicable Non-Serviced PSA governing the servicing of the related Non-Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan(s) and/or
the related intercreditor agreement for the applicable Non-Serviced Whole Loan) and any REO Property that is on deposit in the
Certificate Account (in each case, exclusive of any amount on deposit in or credited to any portion of the Certificate Account
that is held for the benefit of the holder of any related Companion Loan), the Distribution Account and, without duplication, the
REO Account (in each case, exclusive of any amount on deposit in or credited to any portion of the REO Account that is held for
the benefit of the holder of any related Companion Loan), as of the Master Servicer Remittance Date, exclusive of (without duplication):
(1)                
all scheduled payments of principal and/or interest, including any balloon payments (the “Periodic Payments”),
collected but due on a Due Date subsequent to the related Due Period, excluding interest relating to periods prior to, but due
after, the Cut-off Date;
(2)                
all unscheduled payments of principal (including prepayments), unscheduled interest, Liquidation Proceeds, Insurance and
Condemnation Proceeds and other unscheduled recoveries received subsequent to the related Determination Date (or, with respect
to voluntary prepayments of principal of each mortgage loan with a Due Date occurring after the related Determination Date, subsequent
to the related Due Date) allocable to the mortgage loans;
(3)                
all amounts in the Certificate Account that are due or reimbursable to any person other than the Certificateholders;
(4)                
with respect to each Withheld Loan and any Distribution Date occurring in each February and in any January occurring
in a year that is not a leap year (unless such Distribution Date is the final Distribution Date), the related Withheld Amount to
the extent those funds are on deposit in the Certificate Account;
(5)                
Excess Interest allocable to the mortgage loans (which is separately distributed only to the Class Z certificates);
(6)                
all Yield Maintenance Charges and prepayment premiums;
(7)                
all amounts deposited in the Certificate Account, the Lower-Tier REMIC Distribution Account and, without duplication, the
REO Account in error; and


S-296
 
(8)                
any late payment charges or accrued interest on a mortgage loan allocable to the default interest rate for such mortgage
loan, to the extent permitted by law, as more particularly defined in the related mortgage loan documents, excluding any interest
calculated at the Mortgage Rate for the related mortgage loan;
(b)	all P&I Advances made
by the master servicer or the trustee, as applicable, with respect to the Distribution Date (net of certain amounts that are due
or reimbursable to persons other than the Certificateholders) (See “—Distributions” in this free writing
prospectus); and
(c)	with respect to the Distribution
Date occurring in each March (or February, if such Distribution Date is the final Distribution Date), the related Withheld
Amounts as required to be deposited in the Lower-Tier REMIC Distribution Account pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
The “Due Period” for
each Distribution Date and any mortgage loan (including any Companion Loan) will be the period commencing on the day immediately
following the Due Date for such mortgage loan (including any Companion Loan) in the month preceding the month in which that Distribution
Date occurs or the date that would have been the Due Date if such mortgage loan (including any Companion Loan) had a Due Date in
such preceding month and ending on and including the Due Date for such mortgage loan (including any related Companion Loan) occurring
in the month in which that Distribution Date occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the last day of a Due Period
(or applicable grace period) is not a business day, any Periodic Payments received with respect to the mortgage loans (including
any Companion Loan) relating to such Due Period on the business day immediately following such day will be deemed to have been
received during such Due Period and not during any other Due Period.
“Due Date” means,
with respect to each mortgage loan (including any Companion Loan), the date on which scheduled payments of principal, interest
or both are required to be made by the related borrower.

to the Class E certificates, in reduction of their Certificate Balance, an amount equal to the Principal Distribution Amount
(or the portion of it remaining after distributions on the Class A Certificates, Class B certificates, Class C certificates
(and, if any exchange for the Class EC certificates has occurred, the Class EC certificates) and Class D certificates
on that Distribution Date), until the Certificate Balance of the Class E certificates is reduced to zero;
Eighteenth, to the Class E

S-299
 
Twenty-first, to the Class F
certificates, until all amounts of Collateral Support Deficit previously allocated to the Class F certificates, but not previously

Twenty-eighth, to the Class R certificates,
the amount, if any, of the Available Distribution Amount remaining in the Lower-Tier REMIC Distribution Account and Upper-Tier
REMIC Distribution Account with respect to that Distribution Date.
The “Cross-Over Date”
means the Distribution Date on which the Certificate Balances of the Subordinate Certificates (calculated without giving effect
to any exchange of the Exchangeable Certificates for Class EC certificates) have all been reduced to zero as a result of the
allocation of Collateral Support Deficits to those certificates.
Reimbursement of previously allocated
Collateral Support Deficit will not constitute distributions of principal for any purpose and will not result in an additional
reduction in the Certificate Balance of the class of certificates in respect of which a reimbursement is made.
Distributions on the Class EC
Certificates. If Class A-S, Class B and Class C certificates are exchanged and converted for Class EC certificates,
the Class EC certificates received in such exchange and conversion will be entitled to receive on each Distribution Date distributions
equal to the aggregate amount of Interest Distribution Amounts, Accrued Interest From Recoveries, Principal Distribution Amounts,
Yield Maintenance Charges and reimbursements of Collateral Support Deficits and other amounts that would otherwise be distributable
to the Exchangeable Certificates that were exchanged and converted for such Class EC certificates. Similarly, any such converted
Class EC certificates will be allocated the aggregate amount of Collateral Support Deficits, Prepayment Interest Shortfalls
and other interest shortfalls (including those resulting from Appraisal Reduction Events) that would otherwise be 


S-300
 
 
allocated
to the Exchangeable Certificates that were exchanged and converted for such Class EC certificates.
Pass-Through Rates. The interest
rate (the “Pass-Through Rate”) applicable to each class of certificates (other than the Class R and Class Z
certificates) for any Distribution Date will equal the rates set forth below:
The Pass-Through Rate on the Class A-1
certificates will be a per annum rate equal to ●%.
The Pass-Through Rate on the Class A-2
certificates will be a per annum rate equal to ●%.
The Pass-Through Rate on the Class A-3
certificates will be a per annum rate equal to ●%.
The Pass-Through Rate on the Class A-4
certificates will be a per annum rate equal to ●%.
The Pass-Through Rate on the Class A-5
certificates will be a per annum rate equal to ●%.
The Pass-Through Rate on the Class A-SB
certificates will be a per annum rate equal to ●%.
The Pass-Through Rate on the Class A-S
certificates will be a per annum rate equal to ●%.
The Pass-Through Rate on the Class B
certificates will be a per annum rate equal to ●%.
The Pass-Through Rate on the Class C
certificates will be a per annum rate equal to ●%.
The Pass-Through Rate on the Class D
certificates will be a per annum rate equal to ●%.
The Pass-Through Rate on the Class E
certificates will be a per annum rate equal to ●%.
The Pass-Through Rate on the Class F
certificates will be a per annum rate equal to ●%.
The Pass-Through Rate on the Class G
certificates will be a per annum rate equal to ●%.
The Pass-Through Rate on the Class NR
certificates will be a per annum rate equal to ●%.
The Pass-Through Rate applicable to the
Class X-A certificates for the initial Distribution Date will equal approximately [●]%
per annum. The Pass-Through Rate for the Class X-A certificates for any Distribution Date will equal the excess, if
any of (a) the WAC Rate for the related Distribution Date, over (b) the weighted average of the Pass-Through Rates on
the Class A Certificates for such Distribution Date, weighted on the basis of their respective Certificate Balances (calculated
without giving effect to any exchange and conversion of any Class A-S certificates for Class EC certificates) immediately
prior to that Distribution Date.
The Pass-Through Rate applicable to the
Class X-B certificates for the initial Distribution Date will equal approximately [●]%
per annum. The Pass-Through Rate for the Class X-B certificates for any Distribution Date will equal the excess, if
any of (a) the WAC Rate for the related Distribution Date, over (b) the Pass-Through Rate on the Class B certificates
for such Distribution Date.
The Pass-Through Rate applicable to the
Class X-C certificates for the initial Distribution Date will equal approximately [●]%
per annum. The Pass-Through Rate for the Class X-C certificates for any Distribution Date will equal the excess, if
any of (a) the WAC Rate for the related Distribution Date, over (b) the Pass-Through Rate on the Class C certificates for
such Distribution Date.
The Pass-Through Rate applicable to the
Class X-D certificates for the initial Distribution Date will equal approximately [●]%
per annum. The Pass-Through Rate for the Class X-D certificates for any Distribution Date will equal the excess, if
any of (a) the WAC Rate for the related Distribution Date, over (b) the Pass-Through Rate on the Class D certificates for
such Distribution Date.


S-301
 
The Class EC certificates will not
have a Pass-Through Rate, but will receive the sum of the interest that would otherwise be distributable on the Class A-S,
Class B and Class C certificates that have been converted in an exchange for such Class EC certificates. The effective
pass-through rate applicable to the Class EC certificates for the initial Distribution Date is approximately ●%
per annum.
The Class Z certificates will not
have a Pass-Through Rate or be entitled to distributions in respect of interest other than Excess Interest, if any, with respect
to the ARD Loan.
The “WAC Rate” with
respect to any Distribution Date is equal to the weighted average of the applicable Net Mortgage Rates of the mortgage loans as
of the first day of the related Due Period, weighted on the basis of their respective Stated Principal Balances as of the first
day of such Due Period (after giving effect to any payments received during any applicable grace period).
The “Net Mortgage Rate”
for each mortgage loan or any REO Loan (other than the portion of an REO Loan related to any related Companion Loan)
is equal to the related Mortgage Rate in effect from time to time (without regard to any increase in the interest rate of any ARD
Loan after the related Anticipated Repayment Date), less the related Administrative Cost Rate; provided, however, that
for purposes of calculating Pass-Through Rates, the Net Mortgage Rate for any mortgage loan will be determined without regard to
any modification, waiver or amendment of the terms of the related mortgage loan, whether agreed to by the master servicer, the
special servicer or resulting from a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding involving the related borrower. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, for mortgage loans that do not accrue interest on a 30/360 Basis, then, solely for purposes of calculating the Pass-Through
Rate on the Regular Certificates, the Net Mortgage Rate of any mortgage loan for any one-month period preceding a related due date
will be the annualized rate at which interest would have to accrue in respect of the mortgage loan on the basis of a 360-day year
consisting of twelve 30-day months in order to produce the aggregate amount of interest actually required to be paid in respect
of the mortgage loan during the one-month period at the related Net Mortgage Rate; provided, however, that with respect
to each Withheld Loan, the Net Mortgage Rate for the one-month period (1) prior to the due dates in January and February in
any year which is not a leap year or in February in any year which is a leap year (in either case, unless
the related Distribution Date is the final Distribution Date) will be determined exclusive of Withheld Amounts, and (2) prior
to the due date in March (or February, if the related Distribution Date is the final Distribution Date), will be determined
inclusive of Withheld Amounts for the immediately preceding February and January, as applicable.
“Administrative Cost Rate”
as of any date of determination and with respect to any mortgage loan will be a per annum rate equal to the sum of the Servicing
Fee Rate, the Certificate Administrator Fee Rate (which such fee rate accounts for the trustee fee), the Senior Trust Advisor Fee
Rate and the CREFC® Intellectual Property Royalty License Fee Rate.
“CREFC® Intellectual
Property Royalty License Fee” with respect to each mortgage loan and REO Loan (other than the portion of an REO
loan related to any Companion Loan) and for any Distribution Date is the amount accrued during the related Interest Accrual Period
at the CREFC® Intellectual Property Royalty License Fee Rate on the Stated Principal Balance of such mortgage loan
or REO Loan as of the close of business on the Distribution Date in such Interest Accrual Period; provided that such
amounts will be computed for the same period and on the same interest accrual basis respecting which any related interest payment
due or deemed due on the related mortgage loan or REO Loan is computed and will be prorated for partial periods. For the avoidance
of doubt, the CREFC® Intellectual Property Royalty License Fee will be deemed payable by the master servicer from
the Lower-Tier REMIC or Grantor Trust, as applicable. The CREFC® Intellectual Property Royalty License Fee is a
fee payable to CREFC® for a license to use the CREFC® Investor Reporting Package in connection with
the servicing and administration, including delivery of periodic reports to the Certificateholders, of the trust pursuant to the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement. No CREFC® Intellectual Property Royalty License Fee will be paid on any Companion
Loan.
“CREFC® Intellectual
Property Royalty License Fee Rate” with respect to each mortgage loan is a rate equal to 0.00050% per annum.


S-302
 
“Mortgage Rate” with
respect to any mortgage loan or any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan is the per annum rate at which interest
accrues on the mortgage loan or the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan as stated in the related Mortgage Note without giving
effect to any default rate or an increased interest rate.
“Excess Interest”
with respect to the ARD Loan is the interest accrued at the Revised Rate in respect of such ARD Loan in excess of the
interest accrued at the Initial Rate, plus any related interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law and the related
mortgage loan documents.
Interest Distribution Amount.
Interest will accrue for each class of certificates (other than the Class EC and Class R certificates) during the related
Interest Accrual Period. The “Interest Distribution Amount” of any class of Regular Certificates for any Distribution
Date is an amount equal to the sum of (a) all Distributable Certificate Interest in respect of that class of certificates
for that Distribution Date and, to the extent not previously paid, for all prior Distribution Dates, and (b) any Accrued Interest
From Recoveries for such class of certificates to the extent not previously paid, for all prior Distribution Dates. If Exchangeable
Certificates are converted in an exchange for Class EC certificates, all Interest Distribution Amounts that would otherwise
be distributable to such converted Exchangeable Certificates will be distributed to such Class EC certificates, without duplication.
“Accrued Interest From Recoveries”
in respect of each Distribution Date and any class of Principal Balance Certificates that had an increase to its Certificate Balance
as a result of the trust fund’s recovery of Nonrecoverable Advances that were previously reimbursed to the master servicer
or the trustee, as applicable, from general principal collections, is an amount equal to interest at the Pass-Through Rate applicable
to that class for the applicable Interest Accrual Periods on the amount of such increase to its Certificate Balance accrued from
the Distribution Date on which the related Collateral Support Deficit was allocated to such class as a result of the reimbursement
of Nonrecoverable Advances from the trust (whether such Collateral Support Deficit was allocated as a result of the initial allocation
of such Collateral Support Deficit or as a result of further allocations of Collateral Support Deficits unrelated to such initial
allocations) to, but not including, the Distribution Date on which the Certificate Balance was so increased. If Exchangeable Certificates
are converted in an exchange for Class EC certificates, all amounts of Accrued Interest From Recoveries that would otherwise
be allocable to such converted Exchangeable Certificates will be deemed allocable to such Class EC certificates, without duplication.
The “Interest Accrual Period”
in respect of each class of Regular Certificates for each Distribution Date will be the calendar month prior to the month in which
that Distribution Date occurs and will be calculated on a 30/360 Basis.
The “Distributable Certificate
Interest” in respect of each class of Regular Certificates for each Distribution Date is equal to one month’s interest
at the Pass-Through Rate applicable to that class of certificates on that Distribution Date accrued for the related Interest Accrual
Period on the related Certificate Balance or Notional Amount, as the case may be, outstanding immediately prior to that Distribution
Date, other than in the case of the Class X Certificates, reduced, to not less than zero, by (a) such class of certificates’
allocable share of the aggregate of any Prepayment Interest Shortfalls (calculated as described below) resulting from any principal
prepayments made on the mortgage loans during the related Due Period that are not covered by the master servicer’s Compensating
Interest Payment for the related Distribution Date (the aggregate of the Prepayment Interest Shortfalls that are not so covered,
as to the related Distribution Date, the “Net Aggregate Prepayment Interest Shortfall”) and (b) any Certificate
Deferred Interest allocated to such class of certificates with respect to such Distribution Date. If Exchangeable Certificates
are converted in an exchange for Class EC certificates, all amounts of Distributable Certificate Interest that would otherwise
by allocable to such converted Exchangeable Certificates will be deemed allocable to such Class EC certificates.
The portion of the Net Aggregate Prepayment
Interest Shortfall for any Distribution Date that is allocable to each class of Principal Balance Certificates will equal the product
of (a) the Net Aggregate Prepayment Interest Shortfall, multiplied by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is equal
to the Interest Distribution Amount (without regard to the allocation of such Prepayment Interest Shortfalls for such Distribution
Date) in respect of that class of certificates for the related Distribution Date, and the


S-303
 
 
denominator
of which is equal to the aggregate Interest Distribution Amount (without regard to the allocation of such Prepayment Interest
Shortfalls for such Distribution Date) in respect of all classes of Principal Balance Certificates for the related Distribution
Date. If any Exchangeable Certificates are converted in an exchange for Class EC certificates, the aggregate amount of Net
Aggregate Prepayment Interest Shortfalls in respect of such converted Exchangeable Certificates with respect to any Distribution
Date will be deemed Net Aggregate Prepayment Interest Shortfalls of the Class EC certificates, without duplication.
The “Certificate Deferred Interest”
for each Distribution Date with respect to any class of Principal Balance Certificates is equal to the amount of Mortgage Deferred
Interest allocated to such class of certificates (in the case of the Principal Balance Certificates, in reverse sequential order).
If any Exchangeable Certificates are converted in an exchange for Class EC certificates, the aggregate amount of Certificate
Deferred Interest in respect of such converted Exchangeable Certificates with respect to any Distribution Date will be deemed Certificate
Deferred Interest of the Class EC certificates, without duplication.
As of any Due Date and for any mortgage
loan that has been modified to (i) reduce the rate at which interest is paid currently below the Mortgage Rate and (ii) capitalize
the amount of such interest reduction (such capitalized interest, “Mortgage Deferred Interest”) the excess,
if any, of (a) interest accrued on the Stated Principal Balance of the related mortgage loan during the one-month interest
accrual period set forth in the related Mortgage Note at the related Mortgage Rate over (b) the interest portion of the related
monthly payment, as so modified or reduced, or, if applicable, the interest portion of the Assumed Scheduled Payment due on such
Due Date.
Principal Distribution Amount.
The “Principal Distribution Amount” for any Distribution Date with respect to the Principal Balance Certificates
is an amount equal to the sum of the following amounts: (a) the Principal Shortfall for that Distribution Date, (b) the
Scheduled Principal Distribution Amount for that Distribution Date and (c) the Unscheduled Principal Distribution Amount for
that Distribution Date; provided that the Principal Distribution Amount for any Distribution Date will be reduced, to not
less than zero, by the amount of any reimbursements of (A) Nonrecoverable Advances, with interest on such Nonrecoverable Advances
at the Reimbursement Rate that are paid or reimbursed from principal collections on the mortgage loans in a period during which
such principal collections would have otherwise been included in the Principal Distribution Amount for such Distribution Date and
(B) Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts paid or reimbursed from principal collections on the mortgage loans in a period
during which such principal collections would have otherwise been included in the Principal Distribution Amount for such Distribution
Date (provided that, in the case of clauses (A) and (B) above, if any of the amounts that were reimbursed from
principal collections on the mortgage loans are subsequently recovered on the related mortgage loan, such recovery will increase
the Principal Distribution Amount for the Distribution Date related to the period in which such recovery occurs). If Exchangeable
Certificates are converted in an exchange for Class EC certificates, all amounts of principal that would otherwise be distributable
to such converted Exchangeable Certificates will be deemed allocable to and will be distributable to such Class EC certificates,
without duplication.
The “Scheduled Principal Distribution
Amount” for each Distribution Date will equal the aggregate of the principal portions of (a) all Periodic Payments
(excluding balloon payments) with respect to the mortgage loans due during or, if and to the extent not previously received or
advanced and distributed to Certificateholders on a preceding Distribution Date, prior to the related Due Period and all Assumed
Scheduled Payments with respect to the mortgage loans for the related Due Period, in each case to the extent paid by the related
borrower as of the related Determination Date (or, with respect to each mortgage loan with a Due Date occurring, or a grace period
ending, after the related Determination Date, the related Due Date or, last day of such grace period, as applicable, to the extent
received by the master servicer as of the business day preceding the Master Servicer Remittance Date) or advanced by the master
servicer or the trustee, as applicable, and (b) all balloon payments with respect to the mortgage loans to the extent received
on or prior to the related Determination Date (or, with respect to each mortgage loan with a Due Date occurring, or a grace period
ending, after the related Determination Date, the related Due Date or, last day of such grace period, as applicable, to the extent
received by the master


S-304
 
 
servicer
as of the business day preceding the Master Servicer Remittance Date), and to the extent not included in clause (a) above.
The Scheduled Principal Distribution Amount from time to time will include all late payments of principal made by a borrower with
respect to the mortgage loans, including late payments in respect of a delinquent balloon payment, received by the times described
above in this definition, except to the extent those late payments are otherwise available to reimburse the master servicer or
the trustee, as the case may be, for prior Advances, as described above.
The “Unscheduled Principal Distribution
Amount” for each Distribution Date will equal the aggregate of the following: (a) all prepayments of principal received
on the mortgage loans as of the Determination Date; and (b) any other collections (exclusive of payments by borrowers) received
on the mortgage loans and any REO Properties on or prior to the related Determination Date whether in the form of Liquidation Proceeds,
Insurance and Condemnation Proceeds, net income, rents, and profits from REO Property or otherwise, that were identified and applied
by the master servicer as recoveries of previously unadvanced principal of the related mortgage loan; provided that all
such Liquidation Proceeds and Insurance and Condemnation Proceeds will be reduced by any unpaid Special Servicing Fees, Liquidation
Fees, accrued interest on Advances and other additional trust fund expenses incurred in connection with the related mortgage loan,
thus reducing the Unscheduled Principal Distribution Amount.
The “Assumed Scheduled Payment”
for any Due Period and with respect to any mortgage loan that is delinquent in respect of its balloon payment, any REO Loan (excluding,
for purposes of any P&I Advances, the portion allocable to any related Companion Loan, if applicable) is an amount equal to
the sum of (a) the principal portion of the Periodic Payment that would have been due on such mortgage loan or REO Loan on
the related Due Date based on the constant payment required by such related Mortgage Note or the original amortization schedule
of the mortgage loan (as calculated with interest at the related Mortgage Rate), if applicable, assuming the related balloon payment
has not become due, after giving effect to any reduction in the principal balance occurring in connection with a default or a bankruptcy
modification (or similar proceeding), and (b) interest on the Stated Principal Balance of that mortgage loan or REO Loan (excluding,
for purposes of any P&I Advances, the portion allocable to any related Companion Loan, if applicable) at its Mortgage Rate
(net of the applicable rate at which the Servicing Fee is calculated).
For purposes of the foregoing definition
of Principal Distribution Amount, the term “Principal Shortfall” for any Distribution Date means the amount,
if any, by which (1) the Principal Distribution Amount for the prior Distribution Date exceeds (2) the aggregate amount
distributed in respect of principal on the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5, Class A-SB,
Class A-S certificates (and, with respect to exchanged portions of the Class A-S certificates, passed through to the
Class EC certificates), Class B (and, with respect to exchanged portions of the Class B certificates, passed through
to the Class EC certificates), Class C (and, with respect to exchanged portions of the Class C certificates, passed
through to the Class EC certificates), Class D, Class E, Class F, Class G and Class NR certificates
on the preceding Distribution Date. There will be no Principal Shortfall on the first Distribution Date. If Exchangeable Certificates
are converted in an exchange for Class EC certificates, all Principal Shortfalls that would otherwise be distributable to
such converted Exchangeable Certificates will be deemed allocable to such Class EC certificates, without duplication.
The “Class A-SB Planned
Principal Balance” for any Distribution Date is the balance shown for such Distribution Date in the table set forth in
Annex E to this free writing prospectus. Such balances were calculated using, among other things, certain weighted average
life assumptions. See “Yield and Maturity Considerations—Weighted Average Life” in this free writing prospectus.
Based on such assumptions, the Certificate Balance of the Class A-SB certificates on each Distribution Date would be expected
to be reduced to the balance indicated for such Distribution Date in the table set forth in Annex E to this free writing prospectus.
We cannot assure you, however, that the mortgage loans will perform in conformity with our assumptions. Therefore, we cannot assure
you that the balance of the Class A-SB certificates on any Distribution Date will be equal to the balance that is specified
for such Distribution Date in the table.
Certain Calculations with Respect
to Individual Mortgage Loans. The Stated Principal Balance of each mortgage loan outstanding at any time represents the principal
balance of the mortgage loan ultimately due and payable to the Certificateholders. The “Stated Principal Balance”
of each mortgage


S-305
 
 
loan will
initially equal its Cut-off Date Balance and, on each Distribution Date, will be reduced by the amount of principal payments received
from the related borrower or advanced for such Distribution Date and any insurance and/or condemnation proceeds received and attributable
to principal, but increased by any Mortgage Deferred Interest added to the principal balance of any such mortgage loan. The Stated
Principal Balance of a mortgage loan may also be reduced in connection with any modification of such mortgage loan under the terms
of the Pooling And Servicing Agreement or in connection with any forced reduction of its actual unpaid principal balance imposed
by a court presiding over a bankruptcy proceeding in which the related borrower is the debtor. See “Certain Legal Aspects
of the Mortgage Loans” in this free writing prospectus. If any mortgage loan is paid in full or the mortgage loan (or
any Mortgaged Property acquired in respect of the mortgage loan) is otherwise liquidated, then, as of the first Distribution Date
that follows the end of the Due Period in which that payment in full or liquidation occurred and notwithstanding that a loss may
have occurred in connection with any liquidation, the Stated Principal Balance of the mortgage loan will be zero. With respect
to any Companion Loan on any date of determination, the Stated Principal Balance will equal the unpaid principal balance
of such Companion Loan as of such date. With respect to any Whole Loan on any date of determination, the Stated Principal
Balance of such Whole Loan will be the sum of the Stated Principal Balance of the related mortgage loan and each related
Companion Loan on such date.
For purposes of calculating distributions
on, and allocations of, Collateral Support Deficit to the certificates, as well as for purposes of calculating the Servicing Fee
and Certificate Administrator Fee payable each month, each REO Property (including any REO Property with respect to any Non-Serviced
Mortgage Loan held pursuant to the related Non-Serviced PSA) will be treated as if there exists with respect to such REO Property
an outstanding mortgage loan and, if applicable, each related Companion Loan (an “REO Loan”), and all references
to mortgage loan, Companion Loan and pool of mortgage loans in this free writing prospectus, when used in that context, will
be deemed to also be references to or to also include, as the case may be, any REO Loans. Each REO Loan will generally be
deemed to have the same characteristics as its actual predecessor mortgage loan (including any related Companion Loan), including
the same fixed Mortgage Rate (and, accordingly, the same Net Mortgage Rate) and the same unpaid principal balance and Stated Principal
Balance. Amounts due on the predecessor mortgage loan (including any related Companion Loan) including any portion of it payable
or reimbursable to the master servicer, the special servicer, the senior trust advisor, the certificate administrator or the trustee,
as applicable, will continue to be “due” in respect of the REO Loan; and amounts received in respect of the related
REO Property, net of payments to be made, or reimbursement to the master servicer or special servicer for payments previously advanced,
in connection with the operation and management of that property, generally will be applied by the master servicer as if received
on the predecessor mortgage loan or any related Companion Loan.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
with respect to each Serviced Whole Loan, no amounts relating to the related REO Property or REO Loan allocable to any related
Companion Loan will be available for amounts due to the Certificateholders or to reimburse the trust, other than in the limited
circumstances related to Servicing Advances, indemnification payments, Special Servicing Fees and other reimbursable expenses related
to such Serviced Whole Loan incurred with respect to such Serviced Whole Loan in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement.
Excess Interest. On each Distribution
Date, the certificate administrator is required to distribute any Excess Interest received with respect to the ARD Loan on
or prior to the Determination Date to the holders of the Class Z certificates. Excess Interest will not be available to make distributions
to any other class of certificates or to provide credit support for other classes of certificates or offset any interest shortfalls
or to pay any other amounts to any other party under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
Application Priority of Mortgage Loan Collections.
Absent express provisions in the related loan documents (including any related intercreditor agreement), other than with respect
to the application of Liquidation Proceeds, all amounts collected by or on behalf of the trust in respect of a mortgage loan in
the form of payments from the related borrower or Insurance and Condemnation Proceeds under the mortgage loan or proceeds (other
than Liquidation Proceeds) with respect to any REO Loan (exclusive of


S-306
 
 
amounts
payable to any related Companion Loan pursuant to the terms of the related intercreditor agreement) will be applied in the
following order of priority:
first, as a reimbursement first,
to the trustee and second to the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, for any outstanding Advances related
to such mortgage loan or REO Loan (including Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts that have not been reimbursed to the master
servicer or the special servicer, as applicable) and interest thereon as provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and unpaid
servicing compensation and related additional trust fund expenses;
second, as a recovery of the accrued
and unpaid interest on such mortgage loan or REO Loan, that has not been the subject of a P&I Advance, at the related Mortgage
Rate in effect from time to time through the end of the related Interest Accrual Period, less any Appraisal Reduced Interest;
third, as a recovery of Unliquidated
Advances, and, without duplication, principal of such mortgage loan or REO Loan then due and owing, in each case, that were
paid from collections on the mortgage loans and resulted in principal distributed to the Certificateholders being reduced as a
result of the first proviso in the definition of “Principal Distribution Amount”;
fourth, as a recovery of Nonrecoverable
Advances;
fifth, to the extent not previously
allocated pursuant to clause first, as a recovery of principal of such mortgage loan then due and owing, including
by reason of acceleration of such mortgage loan following a default thereunder (or, if the mortgage loan has been liquidated, as
a recovery of principal to the extent of its entire remaining unpaid principal balance);
sixth, as a recovery of Appraisal
Reduced Interest; and
seventh, in accordance with the
Servicing Standard, as a recovery of any other amounts due and owing on such mortgage loan, including, without limitation, late
payment charges and default interest and Yield Maintenance Charges;
provided that payments or proceeds received with respect
to any partial release of a Mortgaged Property or any portion of a Mortgaged Property (including pursuant to a condemnation) at
a time when the loan-to-value ratio of the related mortgage loan or Whole Loan, as applicable, exceeds 125% (based solely on the
value of the real property, and excluding the value of personal property and going concern value, if any) must be applied to reduce
the principal balance of the mortgage loan or the Whole Loan, as applicable, in the manner permitted by the REMIC Provisions; provided,
further, that if any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan and any related Companion Loan comprising a Whole Loan becomes
an REO Loan, the treatment of the foregoing amounts with respect to such Non-Serviced Whole Loan will be subject to the terms
of the related intercreditor agreement and the related Non-Serviced PSA, in that order; provided, further, that with
respect to each mortgage loan related to any Serviced Whole Loan, amounts collected with respect to any Serviced Whole Loan will
be allocated first, pursuant to the terms of the related intercreditor agreement and then, any amounts allocated
to the related Serviced Mortgage Loan will be subject to application as described above.
Liquidation Proceeds in respect of each
mortgage loan or REO Loan (exclusive of amounts payable to a Companion Loan pursuant to the terms of the related intercreditor
agreement) will be applied in the following order of priority:
first, as a reimbursement first,
to the trustee and second, to the master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, for any outstanding Advances related
to such mortgage loan or REO Loan (including Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts that have not been reimbursed to the master
servicer or the special servicer, as applicable) and interest thereon as provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and unpaid
servicing compensation, liquidation expenses and related additional trust fund expenses;


S-307
 
second, as a recovery of accrued
and unpaid interest on such mortgage loan or REO Loan that has not been the subject of a P&I Advance, at the related Mortgage
Rate in effect from time to time through the end of the related Interest Accrual Period, less any Appraisal Reduced Interest;
third, as a recovery of Unliquidated
Advances, and, without duplication, principal of such mortgage loan or REO Loan then due and owing, in each case, that were
paid from collections on the mortgage loans and resulted in principal distributed to the Certificateholders being reduced as a
result of the first proviso in the definition of “Principal Distribution Amount”;
fourth, as a recovery of Nonrecoverable
Advances;
fifth, as a recovery of principal
of such mortgage loan to the extent of its entire unpaid principal balance;
sixth, as a recovery of Appraisal
Reduced Interest; and
seventh, in accordance with the
Servicing Standard, as a recovery of any other amounts due and owing on such mortgage loan including, without limitation, late
payment charges and default interest and Yield Maintenance Charges.
Any Liquidation Proceeds in respect of
each such mortgage loan or REO Loan in excess of the related outstanding balance will first be applied to offset any Prepayment
Interest Shortfalls allocated to the Principal Balance Certificates, in sequential order and then to offset any realized losses
allocated to the Principal Balance Certificates, in sequential order. Any Liquidation Proceeds remaining after such applications
will be distributed to the Class R certificates.
With respect to the Non-Serviced Whole
Loan, amounts collected with respect to such Non-Serviced Whole Loan will be subject to the terms of the related intercreditor
agreement and the Non-Serviced PSA, in that order. With respect to each mortgage loan related to a Serviced Whole Loan, amounts
collected with respect to the related Serviced Whole Loan will be allocated first, pursuant to the terms of the related
intercreditor agreement and then, any amounts allocated to the related Serviced Mortgage Loan will be subject to application
as described above.
“Unliquidated Advances”
are any Advances that have been previously reimbursed, as between the party that made the Advance(s) under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, on the one hand, and the trust fund, on the other, as part of a Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount but that have not
been recovered from the related borrower or otherwise from collections on or the proceeds of the mortgage loan or REO Property
in respect of which the Advance(s) were made.
“Appraisal Reduced Interest”
is accrued and unpaid interest at the related Mortgage Rate that is not advanced by the master servicer or the trustee solely due
to the application of Appraisal Reductions as described under “—Advances” in this free writing prospectus.
Allocation of Yield Maintenance
Charges and Prepayment Premiums
On each Distribution Date, Yield Maintenance
Charges, if any, collected in respect of the mortgage loans during the related Due Period will be required to be distributed by
the certificate administrator to the holders of each class of Regular Certificates in the following manner: (1) pro rata,
among (v) the group (the “YM Group A”) of the Class A Certificates and the Class X-A certificates,
(w) the group (the “YM Group B”) of the Class B certificates and the Class X-B certificates, (x) the group
(the “YM Group C”) of the Class C certificates and the Class X-C certificates, (y) the group (the “YM
Group D”)) of Class D certificates and the Class X-D certificates and (z) the group (the “YM Group E”
and, collectively with the YM Group A, the YM Group B, the YM Group C and the YM Group D, the “YM Groups”) of
the Class E certificates, the Class F certificates, the Class G certificates and the Class NR certificates, based upon the aggregate
of principal distributed to the classes of Principal Balance Certificates in each YM Group on such Distribution Date (calculated
without giving effect to any exchange and conversion of Class A-S, Class B and Class C certificates for Class EC
certificates), and (2) among the classes of certificates in


S-308
 
 
each YM
Group, in the following manner: (i) with respect to each YM Group other than the YM Group E, (A) the holders of each class of
Principal Balance Certificates in such YM Group will be entitled to receive on each Distribution Date an amount of Yield Maintenance
Charges equal to the sum, for all mortgage loan prepayments, of the product of (a) a fraction whose numerator is the amount
of principal distributed to such class on such Distribution Date and whose denominator is the total amount of principal distributed
to all of the Principal Balance Certificates in that YM Group representing principal payments in respect of the mortgage loans
on such Distribution Date (in each case, calculated without giving effect to any exchange and conversion of Exchangeable Certificates
for Class EC certificates), (b) the Base Interest Fraction for the related principal prepayment and such class of Principal
Balance Certificates, and (c) the Yield Maintenance Charges collected during the related Due Period and allocated to such
YM Group (in each case, without giving effect to any exchange and conversion of the Exchangeable Certificates for Class EC
certificates); provided, however, that in the case of any exchange and conversion of portions of Exchangeable Certificates,
amounts that would otherwise have been distributable to such exchanged Exchangeable Certificate had they not been exchanged will
be distributed to the Class EC certificates and (B) any Yield Maintenance Charges allocated to such YM Group collected
during the related Due Period remaining after such distributions will be distributed to the class of Class X Certificates
in such YM Group, and (ii) with respect to the YM Group E, the holders of each class of Principal Balance Certificates in such
YM Group will be entitled to receive on each Distribution Date an amount of Yield Maintenance Charges equal to the sum, for all
mortgage loan prepayments, of the product of (a) a fraction whose numerator is the amount of principal distributed to such class
on such Distribution Date and whose denominator is the total amount of principal distributed to all of the classes comprising
YM Group E on such Distribution Date, and (b) the Yield Maintenance Charges collected during the related Due Period and allocated
to such YM Group. If there is more than one such class of certificates entitled to distributions of principal on any particular
Distribution Date on which Yield Maintenance Charges relating to the mortgage loans are distributable, the aggregate amount of
such Yield Maintenance Charges will be allocated among all such classes of certificates up to, and on a pro rata basis
in accordance with, their respective entitlements thereto in accordance with the first sentence of this paragraph.
The “Base Interest Fraction”
with respect to any principal prepayment on any mortgage loan and with respect to any Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3,
Class A-4, Class A-5, Class A-SB, Class A-S, Class B, Class C and Class D certificates is a
fraction (A) whose numerator is the greater of zero and the difference between (i) the Pass-Through Rate on such class
of certificates, and (ii) the Discount Rate used in calculating the Yield Maintenance Charge with respect to such principal
prepayment and (B) whose denominator is the greater of zero and the difference between (i) the Mortgage Rate on the related
mortgage loan (or with respect to any mortgage loan that is part of a Serviced Whole Loan, the Mortgage Rate of such Serviced Whole
Loan) and (ii) the Discount Rate used in calculating the Yield Maintenance Charge with respect to such principal prepayment;
provided, however, that (1) under no circumstances will the Base Interest Fraction be greater than one or less than
zero, (2) if such Discount Rate is greater than or equal to the Mortgage Rate on the related mortgage loan or the Serviced
Whole Loans, as applicable, and is greater than or equal to the Pass-Through Rate on such class of certificates, then the Base
Interest Fraction will equal zero, and (3) if the Discount Rate is greater than or equal to the Mortgage Rate on such mortgage
loan or the Serviced Whole Loans, as applicable, and is less than the Pass-Through Rate on such class of certificates, then the
Base Interest Fraction will be one.
No Yield Maintenance Charge will be distributed
to the holders of the Class R or Class Z certificates.
As described above, if Exchangeable Certificates
are converted in exchange for Class EC certificates, any Yield Maintenance Charges that otherwise would have been distributable
to such converted Exchangeable Certificates had they not been converted will be distributed to such Class EC certificates.
For a description of Yield Maintenance
Charges, see “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Certain Terms and Conditions of the Mortgage Loans” in
this free writing prospectus and “Certain Legal Aspects of Mortgage Loans—Default Interest and Limitations on Prepayments”
in the prospectus.

Assumed Final Distribution
Date; Rated Final Distribution Date
 
The “Assumed Final Distribution
Date” with respect to any class of certificates is the Distribution Date on which the aggregate Certificate Balance or
Notional Amount of that class of certificates would be reduced to zero based on the assumptions set forth below. The Assumed Final
Distribution Date with respect to each class of Offered Certificates will in each case be as follows:
 



Class Designation

 

Assumed Final 
Distribution
Date 

Class A-1	
 
April 2020

Class A-2	
 
October 2020

Class A-3	
 
September 2022

Class A-4	
 
August 2025

Class A-5	
 
September 2025

Class A-SB	
 
June 2025

Class X-A	
 
September 2025

Class X-B	
 
October 2025

Class A-S	
 
September 2025

Class B	
 
October 2025

Class C	
 
October 2025

Class EC	
 
October 2025

Class D	
 
October 2025

 
The Assumed Final Distribution Dates set
forth above were calculated without regard to any delays in the collection of balloon payments and without regard to delinquencies,
defaults or liquidations. Accordingly, in the event of defaults on the mortgage loans, the actual final Distribution Date for one
or more classes of the Offered Certificates may be later, and could be substantially later, than the related Assumed Final Distribution
Date(s).
 
In addition, the Assumed Final Distribution
Dates set forth above were calculated on the basis of a 0% CPR prepayment rate and the Modeling Assumptions. Since the rate of
payment (including prepayments) of the mortgage loans may exceed the scheduled rate of payments, and could exceed the scheduled
rate by a substantial amount, the actual final Distribution Date for one or more classes of the Offered Certificates may be earlier,
and could be substantially earlier, than the related Assumed Final Distribution Date(s). The rate of payments (including prepayments)
on the mortgage loans will depend on the characteristics of the mortgage loans, as well as on the prevailing level of interest
rates and other economic factors, and we cannot assure you as to actual payment experience.
 
The “Rated Final Distribution Date”
for each class of Offered Certificates will be the Distribution Date in November 2048. See “Ratings” in this
free writing prospectus.
 
Subordination; Allocation
of Collateral Support Deficit
 
The rights of holders of the Subordinate
Certificates and Class EC certificates to receive distributions of amounts collected or advanced on the mortgage loans will
be subordinated, to the extent described in this free writing prospectus, to the rights of holders of the Senior Certificates.
Moreover, to the extent described in this free writing prospectus:
 

·the rights of the holders of the Class NR certificates will be subordinated to the rights of the holders of the Class G
certificates,
 

·the rights of the holders of the Class G and Class NR certificates will be subordinated to the rights of the holders
of the Class F certificates,
 

·the rights of the holders of the Class F, Class G and Class NR certificates will be subordinated to the rights
of the holders of the Class E certificates,
 

S-310
 
 

·the rights of the holders of the Class E, Class F, Class G and Class NR certificates will be subordinated
to the rights of the holders of the Class D certificates,
 

·the rights of the holders of the Class D, Class E, Class F, Class G and Class NR certificates will
be subordinated to the rights of the holders of the Class C certificates (and, to the extent any Exchangeable Certificates
have been converted in an exchange for Class EC certificates, to any related portion of the Class EC certificates),
 

·the rights of the holders of the Class C (and, to the extent any Exchangeable Certificates have been converted in an exchange
for Class EC certificates, any related portion of the Class EC certificates), Class D, Class E, Class F,
Class G and Class NR certificates will be subordinated to the rights of the holders of the Class B certificates
(and, to the extent any Exchangeable Certificates have been converted in an exchange for Class EC certificates, to any related
portion of the Class EC certificates),
 

·the rights of the holders of the Class B (and, to the extent any Exchangeable Certificates have been converted in an exchange
for Class EC certificates, any related portion of the Class EC certificates), Class C (and, to the extent any Exchangeable
Certificates have been converted in an exchange for Class EC certificates, any related portion of the Class EC certificates),
Class D, Class E, Class F, Class G and Class NR certificates will be subordinated to the rights of the
holders of the Class A-S certificates (and, to the extent any Exchangeable Certificates have been converted in an exchange
for Class EC certificates, to any related portion of the Class EC certificates), and
 

·the rights of the holders of the Class A-S (and, to the extent any Exchangeable Certificates have been converted in an
exchange for Class EC certificates, any related portion of the Class EC certificates), Class B (and, to the extent
any Exchangeable Certificates have been converted in an exchange for Class EC certificates, any related portion of the Class EC
certificates), Class C (and, to the extent any Exchangeable Certificates have been converted in an exchange for Class EC
certificates, any related portion of the Class EC certificates), Class D, Class E, Class F, Class G and
Class NR certificates will be subordinated to the rights of the holders of the Senior Certificates.
 
This subordination is intended to enhance
the likelihood of timely receipt by the holders of the Senior Certificates of the full amount of all interest payable in respect
of the Senior Certificates on each Distribution Date, and the ultimate receipt by the holders of the Class A Certificates
(other than the Class A-S certificates) of principal in an amount equal to, in each case, the entire Certificate Balance of
the Class A Certificates (other than the Class A-S certificates). Similarly, but to decreasing degrees, this subordination
is also intended to enhance the likelihood of timely receipt by the holders of more senior classes of Subordinate Certificates
(including the Class EC certificates with respect to the components representing more senior Exchangeable Certificates) of
the full amount of interest payable in respect of those classes of certificates on each Distribution Date, and the ultimate receipt
by the holders of more senior classes of Subordinate Certificates (including the Class EC certificates with respect to the
components representing more senior Exchangeable Certificates) of principal equal to the entire Certificate Balance of each of
those classes as compared with more junior classes of Subordinate Certificates (including the Class EC certificates with respect
to the components representing more junior Exchangeable Certificates).
 
The protection afforded to the holders of
more senior classes of Subordinate Certificates (including the Class EC certificates with respect to the components representing
more senior Exchangeable Certificates) by means of the subordination of more junior classes of Subordinate Certificates (including
the Class EC certificates with respect to the components representing more junior Exchangeable Certificates) will be accomplished
by the application of the Available Distribution Amount on each Distribution Date in accordance with the order of priority described
under “—Distributions” above and by the allocation of Collateral Support Deficits in the manner described
below. No other form of credit support will be available for the benefit of the holders of the Offered Certificates.
 

S-311
 
 
On or after the Cross-Over Date, allocation
of principal will be made to the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5 and Class A-SB
certificates that are still outstanding, pro rata, without regard to the Class A-SB Planned Principal Balance, until
their Certificate Balances have been reduced to zero. Prior to the Cross-Over Date, allocation of principal on any Distribution
Date will be made first, to the Class A-SB certificates until their Certificate Balance has been reduced to the Class A-SB
Planned Principal Balance for the related Distribution Date, second, to the Class A-1 certificates until their Certificate
Balance has been reduced to zero, third, to the Class A-2 certificates, until their Certificate Balance has been reduced
to zero, fourth, to the Class A-3 certificates, until their Certificate Balance has been reduced to zero, fifth,
to the Class A-4 certificates until their Certificate Balance has been reduced to zero, sixth, to the Class A-5
certificates until their Certificate Balance has been reduced to zero, and seventh, to the Class A-SB certificates
until their Certificate Balance has been reduced to zero.
 
Allocation to the Class A-1, Class A-2,
Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5 and Class A-SB certificates, for so long as they are outstanding, of the entire
Principal Distribution Amount for each Distribution Date will have the effect of reducing the aggregate Certificate Balance of
the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5 and Class A-SB certificates at a proportionately
faster rate than the rate at which the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the pool of mortgage loans will decline. Therefore,
as principal is distributed to the holders of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5
and Class A-SB certificates, the percentage interest in the trust evidenced by the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3,
Class A-4, Class A-5 and Class A-SB certificates will be decreased (with a corresponding increase in the percentage
interest in the trust evidenced by the Subordinate Certificates), thereby increasing, relative to their respective Certificate
Balances, the subordination afforded to the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5 and
Class A-SB certificates by the Subordinate Certificates.
 
Following retirement of the Class A-1,
Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5 and Class A-SB certificates, the successive allocation on each
Distribution Date of the remaining Principal Distribution Amount to the Class A-S certificates (and, with respect to converted
portions of the Class A-S certificates, passed through to the Class EC certificates), the Class B certificates (and,
with respect to converted portions of the Class B certificates, passed through to the Class EC certificates), the Class C
certificates (and, with respect to converted portions of the Class C certificates, passed through to the Class EC certificates),
the Class D certificates, the Class E certificates, the Class F certificates, the Class G certificates and
the Class NR certificates, in that order, for so long as they are outstanding, will provide a similar, but diminishing benefit
to those certificates (other than to Class NR certificates) as to the relative amount of subordination afforded by the outstanding
classes of certificates with later sequential designations.
 
On each Distribution Date, immediately following
the distributions to be made to the Certificateholders on that date and the allocation of Certificate Deferred Interest for such
date, the certificate administrator is required to calculate the amount, if any, by which (i) the aggregate Stated Principal
Balance (for purposes of this calculation only, the aggregate Stated Principal Balance will not be reduced by the amount of principal
payments received on the mortgage loans that were used to reimburse the master servicer, the special servicer or the trustee from
general collections of principal on the mortgage loans for Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts, to the extent those amounts are
not otherwise determined to be Nonrecoverable Advances) of the mortgage loans, including any REO Loans (but in each case, excluding
any Companion Loan) expected to be outstanding immediately following that Distribution Date is less than (ii) the then aggregate
Certificate Balance of the Principal Balance Certificates (calculated without regard to any exchange and conversion of the Exchangeable
Certificates for Class EC certificates) after giving effect to distributions of principal on that Distribution Date and the
allocation of Certificate Deferred Interest (any such deficit, a “Collateral Support Deficit”). The certificate
administrator will be required to allocate any Collateral Support Deficit among the respective classes of Principal Balance Certificates
in the following order: to the Class NR certificates, Class G certificates, Class F certificates, Class E certificates,
Class D certificates, Class C certificates (without regard to the exchange and conversion of the Exchangeable Certificates
for Class EC certificates), Class B certificates (without regard to the exchange and conversion of the Exchangeable Certificates
for Class EC certificates) and Class A-S certificates (without regard to the exchange and conversion of the Exchangeable
Certificates for Class EC certificates), and in each case in respect of and until the remaining Certificate Balance of that
class of
 

S-312
 
 
certificates has been reduced to zero. Following the reduction of the Certificate Balances of all classes of Subordinate
Certificates and Class EC certificates to zero, the certificate administrator will be required to allocate the Collateral Support
Deficit among the classes of Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5 and Class A-SB
certificates, pro rata without regard to the Class A-SB Planned Principal Balance (based upon their respective Certificate
Balances), until the remaining Certificate Balances of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5
and Class A-SB certificates have been reduced to zero. Any Collateral Support Deficit allocated to a class of certificates
will be allocated among the respective certificates of such class in proportion to the Percentage Interests evidenced by the respective
certificates.
 
Mortgage loan losses and Collateral Support
Deficits will not be allocated to the Class R or Class Z certificates and will not be directly allocated to the Class X Certificates.
However, the Notional Amounts of the classes of Class X Certificates may be reduced if the related classes of Principal Balance
Certificates are reduced by such loan losses or such Collateral Support Deficits.
 
In the event that all or a portion of the
Exchangeable Certificates are converted in an exchange for the Class EC certificates, such Class EC certificates will
be entitled to the sum of the principal and interest and other amounts otherwise distributable to the Class A-S, Class B
and Class C certificates that are converted in an exchange for such Class EC certificates and will similarly be allocated
the Collateral Support Deficit and other shortfalls otherwise allocable to the Class A-S, Class B and Class C certificates
that are converted in an exchange for such Class EC certificates. As a result, the Class EC certificates will have the
benefit of the subordination afforded the underlying Exchangeable Certificates and will be subject to the corresponding risks and
limitations that subordination of a related component class of Exchangeable Certificates entails.
 
In general, Collateral Support Deficits
with respect to the Offered Certificates could result from the occurrence of: (1) losses and other shortfalls on or in respect
of the mortgage loans, including as a result of defaults and delinquencies on the related mortgage loans, Nonrecoverable Advances
made in respect of the mortgage loans, the payment to the special servicer of any compensation as described in “Transaction
Parties—Servicing and Other Compensation and Payment of Expenses” in this free writing prospectus, and the payment
of interest on Advances and certain servicing expenses; and (2) certain unanticipated, non-mortgage loan specific expenses
of the trust fund, including certain reimbursements to the certificate administrator or trustee as described under “Transaction
Parties—The Trustee” or “—The Certificate Administrator”, as applicable, in this free
writing prospectus, and certain federal, state and local taxes, and certain tax-related expenses, payable out of the trust fund
as described under “Material Federal Income Tax Consequences” in this free writing prospectus and “Material
Federal Income Tax Consequences—Federal Income Tax Consequences for REMIC Certificates” in the prospectus. Accordingly,
the allocation of Collateral Support Deficit as described above will constitute an allocation of losses and other shortfalls experienced
by the trust fund.
 
A class of certificates will be considered
outstanding until its Certificate Balance or Notional Amount is reduced to zero (without regard to the exchange and conversion
of the Exchangeable Certificates for Class EC certificates); provided that in any event the Class Z certificates will
be considered outstanding so long as holders of such certificates are entitled to receive Excess Interest. However, notwithstanding
a reduction of its Certificate Balance to zero, reimbursements of any previously allocated Collateral Support Deficits are required
thereafter to be made to a class of Principal Balance Certificates in accordance with the payment priorities set forth in “—Distributions—Priority”
above.
 
Advances
 
Advances are intended to maintain a regular
flow of scheduled interest and principal payments to holders of the class or classes of certificates entitled thereto, and are
not credit support for the certificates and will not act to guarantee or insure against losses on the mortgage loans or otherwise.
On the business day immediately preceding each Distribution Date (the “Master Servicer Remittance Date”), the
master servicer will be obligated, unless determined to be nonrecoverable as described below, to make advances (each, a “P&I
Advance”) out of its own funds or, subject to the replacement of those funds as
 

S-313
 
 
provided in the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, certain funds held in the Certificate Account that are not required to be part of the Available Distribution Amount
for that Distribution Date, in an amount equal to (but subject to reduction as described below) the aggregate of: (1) all
Periodic Payments (net of any applicable Servicing Fees), other than balloon payments, that were due on the mortgage loans (including
the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans) and any REO Loan (other than any portion of an REO Loan related to a Companion Loan)
during the related Due Period and not received as of the business day preceding the Master Servicer Remittance Date; and (2) in
the case of each mortgage loan delinquent in respect of its balloon payment as of the Master Servicer Remittance Date (including
any REO Loan (other than any portion of an REO Loan related to a Companion Loan) as to which the balloon payment would
have been past due), an amount equal to its Assumed Scheduled Payment. The master servicer’s obligations to make P&I
Advances in respect of any mortgage loan (including the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans) or REO Loan (other than any portion of
a REO Loan related to a Companion Loan) will continue, except if a determination as to non-recoverability is made, through
and up to liquidation of the mortgage loan or disposition of the REO Property, as the case may be. However, no interest will accrue
on any P&I Advance made with respect to a mortgage loan unless the related Periodic Payment is received after the related Due
Date has passed and any applicable grace period has expired or if the related Periodic Payment is received after the Determination
Date but on or prior to the Master Servicer Remittance Date. To the extent that the master servicer fails to make a P&I Advance
that it is required to make under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the trustee will be required to make the required P&I
Advance in accordance with the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
Neither the master servicer nor the trustee
will be required to make a P&I Advance for a balloon payment, default interest, late payment charges, Yield Maintenance Charges,
prepayment premiums or Excess Interest or with respect to any Companion Loan.
 
If an Appraisal Reduction has been made
with respect to any mortgage loan (or, in the case of a Non-Serviced Whole Loan, an appraisal reduction has been made in accordance
with the related Non-Serviced PSA and the master servicer has notice of such Appraisal Reduction) and such mortgage loan experiences
subsequent delinquencies, then the interest portion of any P&I Advance in respect of that mortgage loan for the related Distribution
Date will be reduced (there will be no reduction in the principal portion, if any, of such P&I Advance) to equal the product
of (x) the amount of the interest portion of the P&I Advance for that mortgage loan for the related Distribution Date
without regard to this sentence, and (y) a fraction, expressed as a percentage, the numerator of which is equal to the Stated
Principal Balance of that mortgage loan immediately prior to the related Distribution Date, net of the related Appraisal Reduction
(or, in the case of any Whole Loan, the portion of such Appraisal Reduction allocated to the related mortgage loan), if any, and
the denominator of which is equal to the Stated Principal Balance of that mortgage loan immediately prior to the related Distribution
Date. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, the Periodic Payment due on the maturity date for a balloon loan will
be the Assumed Scheduled Payment for the related Distribution Date.
 
In no event will either the master servicer
or the trustee be required to make a P&I Advance with respect to any Companion Loan.
 
In addition to P&I Advances, the master
servicer will also be obligated (subject to the limitations described in this free writing prospectus), to make advances (“Servicing
Advances” and, collectively with P&I Advances, “Advances”) in connection with the servicing and
administration of any mortgage loan or any Whole Loan (other than the Non-Serviced Whole Loans), as applicable, in respect
of which a default, delinquency or other unanticipated event has occurred or is reasonably foreseeable, or, in connection with
the servicing and administration of any Mortgaged Property or REO Property, in order to pay delinquent real estate taxes, assessments
and hazard insurance premiums and to cover other similar costs and expenses necessary to preserve the priority of or enforce the
related mortgage loan documents or to protect, lease, manage and maintain the related Mortgaged Property. To the extent that the
master servicer fails to make a Servicing Advance that it is required to make under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the
trustee has received notice or otherwise has actual knowledge of this failure, the trustee will be required to make the required
Servicing Advance in accordance with the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 

S-314
 
 
The special servicer will have no obligation
to make any Servicing Advances; provided, that in an urgent or emergency situation requiring the making of a Servicing Advance,
the special servicer may make such Servicing Advance, and the master servicer will be required to reimburse the special servicer
for such Advance (with interest on that Advance) within a specified number of days as set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
unless such Advance is determined to be nonrecoverable by the master servicer in its reasonable judgment (in which case it will
be reimbursed out of the collection account). Once the special servicer is reimbursed, the master servicer will be deemed to have
made such Servicing Advance as of the date made by the special servicer, and will be entitled to reimbursement with interest on
that Advance in accordance with the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
The master servicer, the special servicer
or the trustee, as applicable, will be entitled to recover (a) any Servicing Advance made out of its own funds from any amounts
collected in respect of a mortgage loan (or, consistent with the related intercreditor agreement, a Serviced Whole Loan) as to
which such Servicing Advance was made, and (b) any P&I Advance made out of its own funds from any amounts collected in
respect of a mortgage loan as to which such P&I Advance was made, whether in the form of late payments, Insurance and Condemnation
Proceeds, Liquidation Proceeds or otherwise from the related mortgage loan (“Related Proceeds”). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of the master servicer, the special servicer or the trustee will be obligated to make any Advance that it determines
in its reasonable judgment would, if made, not be recoverable (including interest on the Advance) out of Related Proceeds (a “Nonrecoverable
Advance”).
 
Each of the master servicer, the special
servicer and the trustee will be entitled to recover any Advance by it that it subsequently determines to be a Nonrecoverable Advance
out of general funds relating to the mortgage loans on deposit in the Certificate Account (first from principal collections
and then from any other collections). The master servicer and trustee will be entitled to rely conclusively on any non-recoverability
determination of the special servicer but such determination will not be binding on the master servicer or the trustee. Amounts
payable in respect of each Companion Loan pursuant to the related intercreditor agreement will not be available for distributions
on the certificates or for the reimbursement of Nonrecoverable Advances of principal or interest with respect to the related mortgage
loan, but will be available, in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and related intercreditor agreement, for the
reimbursement of any Servicing Advances with respect to the related Serviced Whole Loan. If a Servicing Advance by the master servicer
or special servicer (or trustee, as applicable) on a Serviced Whole Loan becomes a Nonrecoverable Advance and the master servicer,
the special servicer or the trustee, as applicable, is unable to recover such amounts from related proceeds or the related Companion
Loan, as applicable, the master servicer, the special servicer or the trustee (as applicable) will be permitted to recover such
Nonrecoverable Advance (including interest thereon) out of general funds on deposit in the Certificate Account.
 
If the funds in the Certificate Account
relating to the mortgage loans allocable to principal on the mortgage loans are insufficient to fully reimburse the party entitled
to reimbursement, then such party as an accommodation may elect, on a monthly basis, at its sole option and discretion to defer
reimbursement of the portion that exceeds such amount allocable to principal (in which case interest will continue to accrue on
the unreimbursed portion of the advance) for a time as required to reimburse the excess portion from principal for a consecutive
period up to 12 months (provided that, with respect to any mortgage loan other than an Excluded Loan, any such deferral
exceeding 6 months will require, prior to the occurrence and continuance of any Control Event, the consent of the Directing Certificateholder)
and any election to so defer will be deemed to be in accordance with the Servicing Standard; provided that no such deferral
may occur at any time to the extent that amounts otherwise distributable as principal are available for such reimbursement.
 

S-315
 
 
In connection with a potential election
by the master servicer or the trustee to refrain from the reimbursement of all or a portion of a particular Nonrecoverable Advance
during the one month collection period ending on the related Determination Date for any Distribution Date, the master servicer
or the trustee will be authorized to wait for principal collections on the mortgage loans to be received until the end of such
collection period before making its determination of whether to refrain from the reimbursement of all or a portion of a particular
Nonrecoverable Advance; provided, however, that if, at any time the master servicer or the trustee, as applicable, elects,
in its sole discretion, not to refrain from obtaining such reimbursement or otherwise determines that the reimbursement of a Nonrecoverable
Advance during a one month collection period will exceed the full amount of the principal portion of general collections deposited
in the Certificate Account for such Distribution Date, then the master servicer or the trustee, as applicable, will be required
to use its reasonable efforts to give the 17g-5 Information Provider 15 days’ notice of such determination for posting
on the 17g-5 Information Provider’s website, unless extraordinary circumstances make such notice impractical, and thereafter
will be required to deliver copies of such notice to the Rating Agencies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, failure to give such notice
will in no way affect the master servicer’s or the trustee’s election whether to refrain from obtaining such reimbursement.
 
Each of the master servicer, the special
servicer and the trustee will be entitled to recover any Advance that is outstanding at the time that a mortgage loan is modified
but is not repaid in full by the borrower in connection with such modification but becomes an obligation of the borrower to pay
such amounts in the future (such Advance, together with interest on that Advance, a “Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount”)
out of principal collections on the mortgage loans in the Certificate Account.
 
Any amount that constitutes all or a portion
of any Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount may in the future be determined to constitute a Nonrecoverable Advance and thereafter
will be recoverable as any other Nonrecoverable Advance.
 
In addition, the special servicer may, at
its option (with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, in consultation with, prior to the occurrence of a Consultation
Termination Event, the Directing Certificateholder) make a determination in accordance with the Servicing Standard that any P&I
Advance or Servicing Advance, if made, would be a Nonrecoverable Advance, and if it makes such a determination, must deliver to
the master servicer (and, with respect to a Serviced Mortgage Loan, to any master servicer or special servicer under the pooling
and servicing agreement governing any trust into which the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan is deposited, and, with
respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, the related master servicer under the related Non-Serviced PSA), the certificate administrator,
the trustee, the senior trust advisor and the 17g-5 Information Provider notice of such determination, which determination may
be conclusively relied upon by, but will not be binding upon, the master servicer and the trustee; however, the special
servicer will have no such obligation to make an affirmative determination that any P&I Advance or Servicing Advance is, or
would be, recoverable, and in the absence of a determination by the special servicer that such an Advance is nonrecoverable, each
such decision will remain with the master servicer or the trustee, as applicable. If the special servicer makes a determination
that only a portion, and not all, of any previously made or proposed P&I Advance or Servicing Advance is nonrecoverable, the
master servicer and the trustee will have the right to make its own subsequent determination that any remaining portion of any
such previously made or proposed P&I Advance or Servicing Advance is nonrecoverable. With respect to any Non-Serviced Whole
Loan, if any servicer in connection with a securitization of any related Non-Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan determines
that a P&I Advance with respect to such related Non-Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, if made, would be nonrecoverable, such
determination will not be binding on the master servicer and the trustee as it relates to any proposed P&I Advance with respect
to the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan. Similarly, with respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, if the master servicer or
the special servicer determines that any P&I Advance with respect to such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, if made, would be nonrecoverable,
such determination will not be binding on the related master servicer and related trustee as it relates to any proposed P&I
Advance with respect to any related Non-Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan. In making such non-recoverability determination, such
person will be entitled to consider (among other things): (a) the obligations of the borrower under the terms of the related
mortgage loan or Companion Loan, as applicable, as it may have been modified, (b) the related
 

S-316
 
 
Mortgaged Properties in their
“as-is” or then-current conditions and occupancies, as modified by such party’s assumptions regarding the possibility
and effects of future adverse change with respect to such Mortgaged Properties, (c) estimated future expenses, and (d) estimated
timing of recoveries, and will be entitled to give due regard to the existence of any Nonrecoverable Advances which, at the time
of such consideration, the recovery of which are being deferred or delayed by the master servicer, in light of the fact that Related
Proceeds are a source of recovery not only for the Advance under consideration but also a potential source of recovery for such
delayed or deferred Advance. In addition, any such person may update or change its recoverability determinations (but not reverse
any other person’s determination that an Advance is nonrecoverable) at any time and may obtain at the expense of the trust
any analysis, appraisals or market value estimates or other information for such purposes. Absent bad faith, any non-recoverability
determination described in this paragraph will be conclusive and binding on the Certificateholders, and may be conclusively relied
upon by, but is not binding upon, the master servicer and the trustee. The master servicer and the trustee will be entitled to
rely conclusively on any non-recoverability determination of the special servicer. Nonrecoverable Advances will represent a portion
of the losses to be borne by the Certificateholders.
 
No P&I Advances will be made by the
master servicer or the trustee with respect to delinquent amounts in respect of monthly payments or the balloon payments due
on any Companion Loan. No Servicing Advances will be made with respect to any Serviced Whole Loan if the related mortgage
loan is no longer part of the trust or if such Serviced Whole Loan is no longer serviced by the trust and no Servicing Advances
will be made for the Non-Serviced Whole Loan. Any requirement of the master servicer or the trustee to make an Advance in the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement is intended solely to provide liquidity for the benefit of the Certificateholders and not as credit support
or otherwise to impose on any such person the risk of loss with respect to one or more mortgage loans or the related Companion
Loan.
 
In connection with its recovery of any Advance,
each of the master servicer, the special servicer and the trustee will be entitled to be paid, out of any amounts relating to the
mortgage loans then on deposit in the Certificate Account, interest at the Prime Rate (the “Reimbursement Rate”)
accrued on the amount of the Advance from the date made to, but not including, the date of reimbursement. Neither the master servicer
nor the trustee will be entitled to interest on P&I Advances that accrues before the related due date has passed and any applicable
grace period has expired. The “Prime Rate” will be the prime rate, for any day, set forth in The Wall Street
Journal, New York edition.
 
Each Statement to Certificateholders furnished
or made available by the certificate administrator to the Certificateholders will contain information relating to the amounts of
Advances made with respect to the related Distribution Date. See “—Reports to Certificateholders; Certain Available
Information” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Appraisal Reductions
 
After an Appraisal Reduction Event has occurred
with respect to a mortgage loan (other than the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans), any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan or
Serviced Whole Loan, an Appraisal Reduction is required to be calculated. An “Appraisal Reduction Event” will
occur on the earliest of:
 
(1)     120 days after an uncured
delinquency (without regard to the application of any grace period), other than any uncured delinquency in respect of a balloon
payment, occurs in respect of the mortgage loan or a related Companion Loan, as applicable;
 
(2)     the date on which a reduction
in the amount of Periodic Payments on the mortgage loan or related Companion Loan, as applicable, or a change in any other material
economic term of the mortgage loan or related Companion Loan, as applicable, (other than an extension of its maturity), becomes
effective as a result of a modification of the related mortgage loan or related Companion Loan, as applicable, by the special servicer;
 
(3)     30 days after the date
on which a receiver has been appointed for the Mortgaged Property;
 

S-317
 
 
(4)     30 days after the date
on which a borrower declares bankruptcy (and not otherwise dismissed within such time);
 
(5)     60 days after the date
on which an involuntary petition of bankruptcy is filed with respect to the borrower if not dismissed within such time;
 
(6)     90 days after an uncured
delinquency occurs in respect of a balloon payment with respect to such mortgage loan or related Companion Loan, except where a
refinancing is anticipated within 120 days after the maturity date of the mortgage loan and related Companion Loan in which
case 120 days after such uncured delinquency; and
 
(7)     immediately after a mortgage
loan or related Companion Loan becomes an REO Loan; provided, however, that the 30-day period referenced in clauses
(3) and (4) above will not apply if the related mortgage loan is a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan.
 
No Appraisal Reduction Event may occur at
any time when the aggregate Certificate Balance of all classes of certificates (other than the Class A-1, Class A-2,
Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5 and Class A-SB certificates) has been reduced to zero.
 
The “Appraisal Reduction”
for any Distribution Date and for any mortgage loan (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), any Serviced Companion Loan or
any Serviced Whole Loan as to which any Appraisal Reduction Event has occurred, will be an amount, calculated by the special
servicer (and, with respect to any mortgage loan other than an Excluded Loan, prior to the occurrence of a Consultation Termination
Event, in consultation with the Directing Certificateholder and, after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Control Event,
in consultation with the senior trust advisor), as of the first Determination Date that is at least 10 business days following
the date the special servicer receives an appraisal or conducts a valuation described below, equal to the excess of (a) the
Stated Principal Balance of that mortgage loan or Serviced Whole Loan, as the case may be, over (b) the excess of (1) the
sum of (x) 90% of the appraised value of the related Mortgaged Property as determined (A) by one or more MAI appraisals
obtained by the special servicer with respect to that mortgage loan (together with any other mortgage loan cross-collateralized
with such mortgage loan) or Serviced Whole Loan with an outstanding principal balance equal to or in excess of $2,000,000
(the costs of which will be paid by the master servicer as an Advance), or (B) by an internal valuation performed by the special
servicer with respect to any mortgage loan (together with any other mortgage loan cross-collateralized with such mortgage loan)
or Serviced Whole Loan with an outstanding principal balance less than $2,000,000, minus with respect to any MAI appraisals
such downward adjustments as the special servicer may make (without implying any obligation to do so) based upon its review of
the appraisals and any other information it deems relevant, and (y) all escrows, letters of credit and reserves in respect
of that mortgage loan or Serviced Whole Loan as of the date of calculation over (2) the sum as of the Due Date occurring
in the month of the date of determination of (x) to the extent not previously advanced by the master servicer or the trustee,
all unpaid interest due on that mortgage loan or Serviced Whole Loan at a per annum rate equal to the Mortgage Rate,
(y) all P&I Advances on the related mortgage loan and all Servicing Advances on the related mortgage loan or Serviced
Whole Loan not reimbursed from the proceeds of such mortgage loan or Serviced Whole Loan and interest on those Advances
at the Reimbursement Rate in respect of that mortgage loan or Serviced Whole Loan, and (z) all currently due and unpaid real
estate taxes and assessments, insurance premiums and ground rents, unpaid Special Servicing Fees and all other amounts due and
unpaid with respect to such mortgage loan or Serviced Whole Loan (which tax, premiums, ground rents and other amounts have
not been the subject of an Advance by the master servicer, the special servicer or the trustee, as applicable).
 
Each Serviced Whole Loan will be treated
as a single mortgage loan for purposes of calculating an Appraisal Reduction with respect to the mortgage loan and Companion Loan that
comprise such Serviced Whole Loan. Any Appraisal Reduction in respect of any Serviced Whole Loan will be allocated in accordance
with the related intercreditor agreement or, if no allocation is specified in the related intercreditor agreement, then, pro
rata, between the related Serviced Mortgage Loan and the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan based upon their
respective Stated Principal Balances.
 

S-318
 
 
The special servicer will be required to
order an appraisal or conduct a valuation, promptly upon the occurrence of an Appraisal Reduction Event (other than with respect
to the Non-Serviced Whole Loans). On the first Determination Date occurring on or after the tenth business day following the receipt
of the MAI appraisal or the completion of the valuation, the special servicer will be required to calculate and report to the master
servicer, the trustee, the certificate administrator, the senior trust advisor and, with respect to any mortgage loan other than
an Excluded Loan, prior to the occurrence of any Consultation Termination Event, the Directing Certificateholder, the Appraisal
Reduction, taking into account the results of such appraisal or valuation and receipt of information requested by the special servicer
from the master servicer reasonably necessary to calculate the Appraisal Reduction. Such report will also be forwarded by the master
servicer (or the special servicer if the related mortgage loan is a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan), to the extent the related
Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan has been included in a securitization transaction, to the master servicer of such securitization
into which the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan has been sold, or to the holder of any related Serviced Pari Passu
Companion Loan by the master servicer (or the special servicer if the related mortgage loan is a Specially Serviced Mortgage
Loan). In the event that the special servicer has not received any required MAI appraisal within 60 days after the Appraisal
Reduction Event (or, in the case of an appraisal in connection with an Appraisal Reduction Event described in clauses (1)
and (6) of the definition of Appraisal Reduction Event above, within 120 days (in the case of clause (1)) or 90 or 120 days
(in the case of clause (6)), respectively, after the initial delinquency for the related Appraisal Reduction Event), the amount
of the Appraisal Reduction will be deemed to be an amount equal to 25% of the current Stated Principal Balance of the related mortgage
loan (or Serviced Whole Loan) until an MAI appraisal is received by the special servicer. The Appraisal Reduction is calculated
as of the first Determination Date that is at least ten (10) business days after the special servicer’s receipt of such MAI
appraisal. The master servicer will provide (via electronic delivery) the special servicer with any information in its possession
that is reasonably required to determine, redetermine, calculate or recalculate any Appraisal Reduction pursuant to its definition
using reasonable efforts to deliver such information within four business days of the special servicer’s reasonable request
(which request is required to be made promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) business days, after the special servicer’s
receipt of the applicable appraisal or preparation of the applicable internal valuation); provided, however, that the special
servicer’s failure to timely make such a request will not relieve the master servicer of its obligation to use reasonable
efforts to provide such information to the special servicer within four (4) business days following the special servicer’s
reasonable request. The master servicer will not calculate Appraisal Reductions.
 
As a result of calculating one or more Appraisal
Reductions (and, in the case of any Whole Loan, to the extent allocated in the related mortgage loan), the amount of any required
P&I Advance will be reduced, which will have the effect of reducing the amount of interest available to the most subordinate
class of certificates then outstanding (i.e., first to the Class NR certificates, then to the Class G
certificates, then to the Class F certificates, then to the Class E certificates, then to the Class D
certificates, then to the Class C certificates (without giving effect to any exchange of the Exchangeable Certificates
for Class EC certificates), then to the Class B certificates (without giving effect to any exchange of the Exchangeable
Certificates for Class EC certificates) and then to the Class A-S certificates (without giving effect to any exchange
of the Exchangeable Certificates for Class EC certificates)). The Class EC certificates will be entitled to receive the
sum of the interest otherwise distributable on the portion of Exchangeable Certificates that have been converted in an exchange
for such Class EC certificates. As a result, any reduction in the amount of interest distributable to any converted Exchangeable
Certificates due to the reduction of any P&I Advance described above will reduce the amount of interest distributable to the
Class EC certificates. See “—Advances” above.
 
With respect to each mortgage loan (other
than the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans) and each Serviced Whole Loan as to which an Appraisal Reduction Event has occurred (unless
the mortgage loan or Serviced Whole Loan has remained current for three consecutive Periodic Payments, and with respect to
which no other Appraisal Reduction Event has occurred with respect to that mortgage loan during the preceding three months (for
such purposes taking into account any amendment or modification of such mortgage loan, any related Serviced Companion Loan or
Serviced Whole Loan)), the special servicer is required (i) within 30 days of each annual anniversary of the related Appraisal
Reduction Event and
 

S-319
 
 
(ii) upon its determination that the value of the related Mortgaged Property has materially changed, to
order an appraisal (which may be an update of a prior appraisal), the cost of which will be paid by the master servicer as a Servicing
Advance (or to the extent it would be a Nonrecoverable Advance, an expense of the trust paid out of the collection account), or
to conduct an internal valuation, as applicable. Based upon the appraisal or valuation and receipt of information reasonably requested
by the special servicer from the master servicer necessary to calculate the Appraisal Reduction, the special servicer is required
to determine or redetermine, as applicable, and report to the master servicer, the trustee, the certificate administrator, the
senior trust advisor and, with respect to any mortgage loan other than an Excluded Loan prior to the occurrence of a Consultation
Termination Event, the Directing Certificateholder, the calculated or recalculated amount of the Appraisal Reduction with respect
to the mortgage loan or Serviced Whole Loan, as applicable. Such report will also be forwarded to the holder of any related Companion
Loan by the master servicer (or the special servicer if the related mortgage loan is a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan).
With respect to any mortgage loan other than an Excluded Loan, prior to the occurrence of a Consultation Termination Event, the
special servicer will consult with the Directing Certificateholder, with respect to any appraisal, valuation or downward adjustment
in connection with an Appraisal Reduction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the special servicer will not be required to obtain an
appraisal or valuation with respect to a mortgage loan, any related Serviced Companion Loan or Serviced Whole Loan that
is the subject of an Appraisal Reduction Event to the extent the special servicer has obtained an appraisal or valuation with respect
to the related Mortgaged Property within the 12-month period prior to the occurrence of the Appraisal Reduction Event. Instead,
the special servicer may use the prior appraisal or valuation in calculating any Appraisal Reduction with respect to the mortgage
loan, any related Serviced Companion Loan or Serviced Whole Loan, provided that the special servicer is not aware of
any material change to the Mortgaged Property that has occurred that would affect the validity of the appraisal or valuation.
 
Each Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan is
subject to the provisions in the related Non-Serviced PSA relating to appraisal reductions that are similar, but not necessarily
identical, to the provisions described above. The existence of an appraisal reduction under the applicable Non-Serviced PSA in
respect of any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan will proportionately reduce the master servicer’s or the trustee’s,
as the case may be, obligation to make P&I Advances on that Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan and will generally have the effect
of reducing the amount otherwise available for distributions to the Certificateholders. Pursuant to the Non-Serviced PSA, the Non-Serviced
Mortgage Loan will be treated as a single mortgage loan for purposes of calculating an appraisal reduction amount with respect
to the loans that comprise such Non-Serviced Whole Loan. Any appraisal reduction calculated with respect to any Non-Serviced Whole
Loan will generally be allocated first, to the related Subordinate Companion Loan, if any, and then, pro rata, between the
related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan and the related Non-Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan(s), based upon their respective
Stated Principal Balances.
 
Any mortgage loan (other than any Non-Serviced
Mortgage Loan), any related Serviced Companion Loan or any Serviced Whole Loan previously subject to an Appraisal Reduction
that becomes a Corrected Mortgage Loan, and with respect to which no other Appraisal Reduction Event has occurred and is continuing,
will no longer be subject to an Appraisal Reduction. Any Appraisal Reduction in respect of a Non-Serviced Whole Loan will
be calculated by the applicable party under and in accordance with and pursuant to the terms of the applicable Non-Serviced PSA.
 
For purposes of determining the Controlling
Class, Appraisal Reductions allocated to a related mortgage loan will be allocated to each class of Principal Balance Certificates
in reverse sequential order to notionally reduce the Certificate Balance until the related Certificate Balances of each such class
is reduced to zero (i.e., first to the Class NR certificates, then to the Class G certificates,
then to the Class F certificates, then to the Class E certificates, then to the Class D certificates,
then to the Class C certificates (determined without giving effect to any exchange of the Exchangeable Certificates
for Class EC certificates), then to the Class B certificates (determined without giving effect to any exchange
of the Exchangeable Certificates for Class EC certificates) and then to the Class A-S certificates (determined
without giving effect to any exchange of the Exchangeable Certificates for Class EC certificates)). With respect to any Appraisal
Reduction calculated for purposes of determining the
 

S-320
 
 
Controlling Class, the appraised value of the related Mortgaged Property will
be determined on an “as-is” basis.
 
Any Control Eligible Certificates, the Certificate
Balance of which (taking into account the application of any Appraisal Reductions to notionally reduce the Certificate Balance
of such class) has been reduced to less than 25% of its initial Certificate Balance, is referred to as an “Appraised-Out
Class”. The holders of the majority (by Certificate Balance) of an Appraised-Out Class will have the right, at their
sole expense, to require the special servicer to order a second appraisal of any mortgage loan (or Serviced Whole Loan) for which
an Appraisal Reduction Event has occurred (such holders, the “Requesting Holders”). The special servicer will
use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that such appraisal is delivered within 30 days from receipt of the Requesting Holders’
written request and will ensure that such appraisal is prepared on an “as-is” basis by an MAI appraiser. Upon receipt
of such second appraisal, the special servicer will be required to determine, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, whether,
based on its assessment of such second appraisal, any recalculation of the applicable Appraisal Reduction is warranted and, if
so warranted will recalculate such Appraisal Reduction based upon such second appraisal and receipt of information requested by
the special servicer from the master servicer as described above. If required by any such recalculation, the applicable Appraised-Out
Class will be reinstated as the Controlling Class and each other Appraised-Out Class will, if applicable, have its related Certificate
Balance notionally restored to the extent required by such recalculation of the Appraisal Reduction.
 
Any Appraised-Out Class for which the Requesting
Holders are challenging the special servicer’s Appraisal Reduction determination may not exercise any direction, control,
consent and/or similar rights of the Controlling Class until such time, if any, as such class is reinstated as the Controlling
Class; the rights of the Controlling Class will be exercised by the most senior Control Eligible Certificates, if any, during such
period.
 
With respect to each Non-Serviced Mortgage
Loan, the related directing certificateholder will be subject to provisions similar to those described above. See “Servicing
of the Mortgage Loans—Servicing of the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan”, “—Servicing of the U-Haul
Portfolio Mortgage Loan” and “—Servicing of the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan and the Brunswick Portfolio
Mortgage Loan” in this free writing prospectus.

account balances for each of the Securitization Accounts (for the applicable period) in each Form 10-D filed on behalf of the Issuing
Entity.

The certificate administrator will not make
any representations or warranties as to the accuracy or completeness of any report, document or other information made available

for the preparation of tax returns on behalf of the trust and the preparation of monthly reports on Form 10-D (based
on information included in each monthly Statement to Certificateholders and other information provided by other transaction parties)
and annual reports on Form 10-K and certain other reports on Form 8-K that are required to be filed with the SEC on behalf

The Pooling and Servicing Agreement will
require the master servicer, subject to certain restrictions (including execution and delivery of a confidentiality agreement)
set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, to provide certain of the reports or, in the case of the master servicer and
the Controlling Class Certificateholder, access to the reports available as set forth above, as well as certain other information
received by the master servicer, to any Privileged Person so identified by a Certificate Owner or an underwriter, that requests
reports or information. However, the master servicer will be permitted to require payment of a sum sufficient to cover the reasonable
costs and expenses of providing copies of these reports or information (which such amounts in any event are not reimbursable as
additional trust fund expenses), except that, other than for extraordinary or duplicate requests, prior to the occurrence of a
Consultation Termination Event, the Directing Certificateholder will be entitled to reports and information free of charge. Except
as otherwise set forth in this paragraph, until the time definitive certificates are issued, notices and statements required to
be mailed to holders of certificates will be available to Certificate Owners of certificates only to the extent they are forwarded
by or otherwise available through DTC and its Participants. Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Participants,
and by Participants to Certificate Owners, will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory
requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Except as otherwise set forth in this paragraph, the master servicer, the special
servicer, the trustee, the certificate administrator and the depositor are required to recognize as Certificateholders only those
persons in whose names the
 

S-330
 
 
certificates are registered on the books and records of the certificate registrar. The initial registered
holder of the certificates will be Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC.
 
Voting Rights
 
At all times during the term of the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement, the voting rights for the certificates (the “Voting Rights”) will be allocated among
the respective classes of certificateholders as follows: (1) 2% in the case of the Class X Certificates, allocated pro
rata, based upon their respective Notional Amounts as of the date of determination and (2) in the case of any other class
of Regular Certificates (other than the Class X Certificates), a percentage equal to the product of 98% and a fraction, the
numerator of which is equal to the aggregate Certificate Balance (and solely in connection with certain votes relating to the replacement
of the special servicer and senior trust advisor as described in this free writing prospectus, taking into account any notional
reduction in the Certificate Balance for Appraisal Reductions allocated to the certificates) of the class (without giving effect
to any exchange of the Exchangeable Certificates to Class EC certificates), in each case, determined as of the prior Distribution
Date, and the denominator of which is equal to the aggregate Certificate Balance (and solely in connection with certain votes relating
to the replacement of the special servicer and the senior trust advisor as described in this free writing prospectus, taking into
account any notional reduction in the Certificate Balance for Appraisal Reductions allocated to the certificates) of the Regular
Certificates (other than the Class X Certificates and without giving effect to any exchange of the Exchangeable Certificates
to Class EC certificates), each determined as of the prior Distribution Date. None of the Class R or Class Z certificates
will be entitled to any Voting Rights. Voting Rights allocated to a class of Certificateholders will be allocated among the Certificateholders
in proportion to the Percentage Interests evidenced by their respective certificates. In addition, if Exchangeable Certificates
are exchanged for Class EC certificates, Certificateholders of such Class EC certificates will be entitled to exercise
the Voting Rights that would otherwise be allocated to the Exchangeable Certificates converted for such Class EC certificates.
Solely for purposes of giving any consent, approval or waiver pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, none of the master
servicer, the special servicer, the trustee, the certificate administrator, the depositor, or any mortgage loan seller or any of
their affiliates will be entitled to exercise any Voting Rights with respect to any certificates registered in its name, if the
consent, approval or waiver would in any way increase its compensation or limit its obligations in the named capacities or waive
a Servicer Termination Event under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement; provided, however, that so long as there is no Servicer
Termination Event with respect to the master servicer or the special servicer, the master servicer and the special servicer or
such affiliate of either will be entitled to exercise such Voting Rights with respect to any issue which could reasonably be believed
to adversely affect such party’s compensation or increase its obligations or liabilities under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement; provided, further, however, that the restrictions will not apply to the exercise of the special
servicer’s, the master servicer’s or any mortgage loan seller’s rights, if any, or any of their affiliates, as
a member of the Controlling Class.
 
Termination; Retirement of
Certificates
 
The obligations created by the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement will terminate upon payment (or provision for payment) to all Certificateholders of all amounts held by the
certificate administrator on behalf of the trustee and required to be paid on the Distribution Date following the earlier of (1) the
final payment (or related Advance) or other liquidation of the last mortgage loan and REO Property (as applicable) subject to the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, (2) the voluntary exchange of all the then-outstanding certificates (other than the Class Z
and Class R certificates) for the mortgage loans remaining in the trust (provided, however, that (a) the Class A-1,
Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5, Class A-SB, Class A-S, Class B, Class C, Class EC,
Class D, Class X-A, Class X-B, Class X-C and Class X-D certificates are no longer outstanding, (b) there is only one
holder (or multiple holders acting unanimously) of the then-outstanding certificates (other than the Class Z and Class R certificates)
and (c) the master servicer consents to the exchange) or (3) the purchase or other liquidation of all of the assets of
the trust fund as described below by the holders of the Controlling Class, the special servicer, the master servicer or the holders
of the Class R certificates, in that order of priority. Written notice of termination of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement will
be given by the certificate administrator to each Certificateholder and the 17g-5 Information Provider (who will promptly post
such notice to the 17g-5
 

S-331
 
 
Information Provider’s website). The final distribution will be made only upon surrender and cancellation
of the certificates at the office of the certificate registrar or other location specified in the notice of termination.
 
The holders of the Controlling Class, the
special servicer, the master servicer and the holders of the Class R certificates (in that order) will have the right to purchase
all of the assets of the trust fund. This purchase of all the mortgage loans and other assets in the trust fund is required to
be made at a price equal to (a) the sum of (1) the aggregate Purchase Price of all the mortgage loans (exclusive of REO
Loans) then included in the trust fund, (2) the appraised value of the trust fund’s portion of all REO Properties then
included in the trust fund (which fair market value for any REO Property may be less than the Purchase Price for the corresponding
REO Loan), as determined by an appraiser selected by the special servicer and approved by certain classes of certificates, (3)
the reasonable out of pocket expenses of the master servicer and the special servicer related to such purchase, unless the master
servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, is the purchaser, less (b) solely in the case where the master servicer is
exercising such purchase right, the aggregate amount of unreimbursed Advances and unpaid Servicing Fees remaining outstanding and
payable solely to the master servicer (which items will be deemed to have been paid or reimbursed to the master servicer in connection
with such purchase) and (4) if the Mortgaged Property secures a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan and is an REO Property under the
terms of the applicable Non-Serviced PSA, the pro rata portion of the fair market value of the related property, as determined
by the related special servicer in accordance with clauses (2) and (3) above. This purchase will effect early retirement
of the then-outstanding certificates, but the rights of the holders of the Controlling Class, the special servicer, the master
servicer or the holders of the Class R certificates to effect the termination is subject to the requirements that the then aggregate
Stated Principal Balance of the pool of mortgage loans be less than (or, in the case of clause (ii) below, less than or equal to)
the greater of (i) 1% of the Initial Pool Balance or (ii) if the mortgage loan identified on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus
as “U-Haul Portfolio” is an asset of the trust fund, the product of (x) a percentage that is calculated by dividing
the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage loan identified on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus as “U-Haul
Portfolio” on the date that is the 10-year anniversary from the start-up date of the trust by the Initial Pool Balance and
(y) the Initial Pool Balance; provided, however, that this termination right will not be exercisable at the percentage threshold
specified in clause (ii) above earlier than the Distribution Date in October 2025. The voluntary exchange of certificates (other
than the Class R and Class Z certificates), for the remaining mortgage loans is not subject to the 1% limit but is limited to each
such class of outstanding certificates being held by one Certificateholder (or group of Certificateholders acting unanimously)
who must voluntarily participate.
 
On the applicable Distribution Date, the
aggregate amount paid by the holders of the Controlling Class, the special servicer, the master servicer or the holders of the
Class R certificates, as the case may be, for the mortgage loans and other applicable assets in the trust fund, together with all
other amounts on deposit in the Certificate Account and not otherwise payable to a person other than the Certificateholders, will
be applied generally as described above under “—Distributions—Priority” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Any optional termination by the holders
of the Controlling Class, the special servicer, the master servicer or the holders of the Class R certificates would result in
prepayment in full of the applicable certificates and would have an adverse effect on the yield of the Class X certificates,
because a termination would have an effect similar to a principal prepayment in full of the mortgage loans and, as a result, investors
in the Class X Certificates and any other certificates purchased at premium might not fully recoup their initial investment.
See “Yield and Maturity Considerations” in this free writing prospectus.

Servicing
of the Mortgage Loans
 
General
 
The servicing and administration of the
mortgage loans (excluding the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans), the Serviced Companion Loans and any related REO Properties will be
governed by the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The Civic Opera Building Whole Loan will be serviced under the pooling and servicing
agreement related to the JPMBB Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2015-C31 securitization in a manner similar to the servicing
of the mortgage loans under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Each of the One Shell Square Whole Loan and the Brunswick Portfolio
Whole Loan will be serviced under the pooling and servicing agreement related to the JPMBB Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust
2015-C30 securitization in a manner similar to the servicing of the mortgage loans under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The
U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan is expected to be serviced under the trust and servicing agreement entered into in connection with
the private CMBS securitization that is expected to govern the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan in a manner similar to the servicing
of the mortgage loans under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
The following summaries describe certain
provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement relating to the servicing and administration of the mortgage loans (excluding
the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans), the Serviced Companion Loans and any related REO Properties. The Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans
and any related REO Property will be serviced in accordance with the related Non-Serviced PSA by the related master servicer and
the related special servicer and according to the servicing standards provided for in the related Non-Serviced PSA, which require,
among other things, that the related master servicer and related special servicer attempt to maximize recovery on all portions
of such Non-Serviced Whole Loan. Except where the context otherwise indicates (such as with respect to P&I Advances), discussions
in this free writing prospectus (in this section or in each other section of this free writing prospectus) regarding the servicing
and administration of the mortgage loans should be deemed to include the servicing and administration of the Serviced Whole Loans
but do not include the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans and any related REO Property, unless otherwise specifically stated. In connection
with the servicing and administration of a Serviced Whole Loan pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and
the related intercreditor agreement, the master servicer and the special servicer will be entitled to servicing compensation, without
duplication, with respect to the related Companion Loan as well as the related mortgage loan consistent with and not prohibited
by the related intercreditor agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The summaries do not purport to be complete and
are subject, and qualified in their entirety by reference, to the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and any related
intercreditor agreement and the terms of the applicable Non-Serviced PSA related to the related Non-Serviced Whole Loan. Reference
is made to the prospectus for additional information regarding the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement relating to the
servicing and administration of the mortgage loans and any REO Properties, provided that the information in this free writing
prospectus supersedes any contrary information set forth in the prospectus. See “Description of the Pooling Agreements”
in the prospectus.
 
The master servicer (directly or through
one or more sub-servicers) and the special servicer (directly or through one or more sub-servicers) will be required to service
and administer the mortgage loans for which it is responsible. The master servicer and the special servicer may delegate and/or
assign some or all of its servicing obligations and duties with respect to some or all of the mortgage loans to one or more third-party
sub-servicers (although the master servicer and the special servicer, as applicable, will remain primarily responsible for the
servicing of those mortgage loans). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the special servicer may not enter into any Sub-Servicing Agreement
which provides for the performance by third parties of any or all of its obligations under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
without, with respect to any mortgage loan other than an Excluded Loan, prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Control Event,
the consent of the Directing Certificateholder, except to the extent necessary for the special servicer to comply with applicable
regulatory requirements.
 
The master servicer and the special servicer
will each be required to service and administer the mortgage loans (excluding the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans), Serviced Whole
Loans and REO
 

S-333
 
 
Properties (other than any REO Property related to a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), for which it is responsible in
accordance with applicable law, the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the mortgage loan documents, and in the case
of a Serviced Whole Loan or any related mezzanine loan, the terms of the related intercreditor agreement and, to the extent consistent
with the foregoing, in accordance with the higher of the following standards of care: (1) the same manner in which, and with
the same care, skill, prudence and diligence with which the master servicer and the special servicer service and administer similar
mortgage loans for other third-party portfolios, and (2) the same care, skill, prudence and diligence with which the master
servicer or special servicer services and administers similar mortgage loans owned by the master servicer and the special servicer,
in either case, with a view to the maximization of timely recovery of principal and interest on a net present value basis on the
mortgage loans or Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and any related Serviced Companion Loans, as applicable, and the best interests
of the trust and the Certificateholders (and, in the case of a Serviced Whole Loan, the holder of the related Serviced Companion
Loan (as a collective whole), taking into account the pari passu nature of the related Serviced Companion Loan) as determined
by the master servicer or the special servicer, as the case may be, in its reasonable judgment, in either case giving due consideration
to the customary and usual standards of practice of prudent, institutional multifamily and commercial mortgage loan servicers,
but without regard to any conflict of interest arising from:
 
(A)   any relationship that
the master servicer or special servicer, or any of its affiliates may have with the related borrower or any borrower affiliate,
any mortgage loan seller or any other party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement;
 
(B)   the ownership of any certificate
or, if applicable, any related mezzanine loan or any related Companion Loan by the master servicer or special servicer or any of
its affiliates;
 
(C)   any obligation to make
advances;
 
(D)   the master servicer’s
or special servicer’s right to receive, or adequacy of, compensation for its services and reimbursement for its costs under
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or with respect to any particular transaction;
 
(E)   the ownership, servicing
or management for others of any other mortgage loans, subordinate interests, subordinate debt, mezzanine loans or Mortgaged Properties
by the master servicer or special servicer;
 
(F)   any option to purchase
any mortgage loan or the related Companion Loan it may have; and
 
(G)  any debt that the master
servicer or special servicer or any of its affiliates has extended to any borrower or any of its affiliates (the foregoing, collectively
referred to as the “Servicing Standard”).
 
The master servicer and the special servicer
will be required to act in accordance with the Servicing Standard with respect to any action required to be taken regarding a Non-Serviced
Mortgage Loan pursuant to their respective obligations under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
The master servicer will generally be responsible
initially for the servicing and administration of each of the mortgage loans (other than the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans) and each
Serviced Whole Loan. The master servicer will be required to transfer its servicing responsibilities to the special servicer with
respect to any mortgage loan (including any related Companion Loan) or Serviced Whole Loan for which the master servicer is responsible
for servicing:
 
(1)   as to which a payment
default has occurred at its original maturity date, or, if the original maturity date has been extended, at its extended maturity
date; and in the case of a balloon payment, if the balloon payment is delinquent and the related borrower has not provided the
special servicer, within 60 days of the related maturity date, with a written and fully executed (subject only to customary final
closing conditions) written commitment for refinancing from an acceptable lender reasonably satisfactory in form and substance
to the special servicer (and the special servicer will promptly forward such commitment to the master servicer), which provides
that such refinancing will
 

S-334
 
 
occur within 120 days of such related maturity date, provided that the mortgage loan (including
any related Companion Loan) will become a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan immediately if the related borrower fails to diligently
pursue such financing or to pay any Assumed Scheduled Payment on the related due date (subject to any applicable grace period)
at any time before the refinancing or, if such refinancing does not occur, the related mortgage loan (including any related Companion
Loan) will become a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan at the end of such 120-day period (or for such shorter period beyond
the date on which the related balloon payment was due within which the refinancing is scheduled to occur pursuant to the commitment
for refinancing or on which such commitment terminates);
 
(2)   as to which any Periodic
Payment (other than a balloon payment or other payment due at maturity) is more than 60 days delinquent (unless, prior to such
Periodic Payment becoming more than 60 days delinquent, in the case of a Serviced Whole Loan or a mortgage loan with an associated
mezzanine loan, the holder of the related Companion Loan or mezzanine debt cures such delinquency);
 
(3)   as to which the borrower
has entered into or consented to bankruptcy, appointment of a receiver or conservator or a similar insolvency proceeding, or the
borrower has become the subject of a decree or order for that proceeding (provided that if the appointment, decree or order
is stayed or discharged, or the case dismissed within 60 days that mortgage loan (including any related Companion Loan) will not
be considered a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan during that period), or the related borrower has admitted in writing its
inability to pay its debts generally as they become due;
 
(4)   as to which the master
servicer or special servicer has received notice of the foreclosure or proposed foreclosure of any lien other than the Mortgage
on the Mortgaged Property;
 
(5)   as to which, in the judgment
of the master servicer or special servicer (and, in the case of the special servicer, with respect to any mortgage loan other than
an Excluded Loan, unless a Control Event has occurred and is continuing, with the consent of the Directing Certificateholder),
as applicable, a payment default is imminent or reasonably foreseeable and is not likely to be cured by the borrower within 60
days;
 
(6)   as to which a default
that the master servicer or special servicer has notice (other than a failure by the related borrower to pay principal or interest)
and which the master servicer or special servicer (and, in the case of the special servicer, with respect to any mortgage loan
other than an Excluded Loan, unless a Control Event has occurred and is continuing, with the consent of the Directing Certificateholder)
determines, in its good faith reasonable judgment, may materially and adversely affect the interests of the Certificateholders
(and, with respect to any Serviced Whole Loan, the interest of the Certificateholders and the holders of the related Serviced Companion
Loan, as a collective whole (taking into account the pari passu nature of such Serviced Companion Loan), has occurred and
remains unremediated for the applicable grace period specified in the mortgage loan or related Companion Loan documents, other
than in certain circumstances the failure to maintain terrorism insurance (or if no grace period is specified for events of default
that are capable of cure, 60 days); or
 
(7)   as to which the master
servicer or special servicer (and, in the case of the special servicer, with respect to any mortgage loan other than an Excluded
Loan, unless a Control Event has occurred and is continuing, with the consent of the Directing Certificateholder) determines that
(i) a default (other than as described in clause (5) above) under the mortgage loan or related Companion Loan is
imminent or reasonably foreseeable, (ii) such default will materially impair the value of the corresponding Mortgaged Property
as security for the mortgage loan or related Companion Loan (if any) or otherwise materially adversely affect the interests
of Certificateholders (and, with respect to a Serviced Whole Loan, the interest of the Certificateholders and the holders of the
related Serviced Companion Loan as a collective whole (taking into account the pari passu nature of such Serviced Companion
Loan), and (iii) the default will continue unremedied for the applicable cure period under the terms of the mortgage loan
or related Companion Loan, as applicable, or, if no cure period is specified and the default is capable of being cured, for 30 days
(provided that such 30-day grace
 

S-335
 
 
period does not apply to a default that gives rise to immediate acceleration without application
of a grace period under the terms of the mortgage loan or related Companion Loan); provided that any determination that
a special servicing transfer event has occurred under this clause (7) with respect to any mortgage loan or related Companion
Loan solely by reason of the failure (or imminent failure) of the related borrower to maintain or cause to be maintained insurance
coverage against damages or losses arising from acts of terrorism may only be made by the special servicer (and with respect to
any mortgage loan other than an Excluded Loan, unless a Control Event has occurred and is continuing, with the consent of the Directing
Certificateholder) as described under “—Maintenance of Insurance” below.
 
However, the master servicer will be required
to continue to (w) receive payments on the mortgage loans (and any related Serviced Companion Loan) (including amounts collected
by the special servicer), (x) make certain calculations with respect to the mortgage loans and any related Serviced Companion Loan,
(y) make remittances and prepare certain reports to the Certificateholders with respect to the mortgage loans and any related Serviced
Companion Loan and (z) receive the Servicing Fee in respect of the mortgage loans (including any related Serviced Companion
Loan, if applicable) at the Servicing Fee Rate. If the related Mortgaged Property is acquired in respect of any mortgage loan (and
any related Serviced Companion Loan) (upon acquisition, an “REO Property”) whether through foreclosure, deed-in-lieu
of foreclosure or otherwise, the special servicer will continue to be responsible for its operation and management. The mortgage
loans (other than the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans) and any related Serviced Companion Loans as to which a special servicing transfer
event has occurred and is continuing are referred to in this free writing prospectus collectively as the “Specially Serviced
Mortgage Loans”. If any Serviced Companion Loan becomes a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, then the related mortgage
loan will also become a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan. If any mortgage loan becomes a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, then
the related Serviced Companion Loan will also become a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan. Neither the master servicer nor the
special servicer will have any responsibility for the performance of the other of its duties under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
Any mortgage loan (excluding any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans), that is or becomes a cross-collateralized mortgage loan and is cross-collateralized
with a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan will become a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan.
 
If any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan,
in accordance with its original terms or as modified in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, becomes performing
for at least three consecutive Periodic Payments (provided that no additional event of default is foreseeable in the reasonable
judgment of the special servicer and no other event or circumstance exists that causes such mortgage loan or Companion Loan to
otherwise constitute a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan), the special servicer will be required to return servicing of such Specially
Serviced Mortgage Loan (a “Corrected Mortgage Loan”) to the master servicer.
 
The special servicer will be required to
prepare a report (an “Asset Status Report”) for each mortgage loan (other than the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans)
and, if applicable, any Serviced Whole Loan that becomes a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan not later than 60 days after the servicing
of such mortgage loan is transferred to the special servicer. Each Asset Status Report will be required to be delivered to the
Directing Certificateholder (but only prior to the occurrence of a Consultation Termination Event), the senior trust advisor (but
only after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Control Event), the certificate administrator, the master servicer, the
trustee and the 17g-5 Information Provider and, with respect to any related Serviced Companion Loan, to the extent such related
Serviced Companion Loan has been included in a securitization transaction, to the master servicer of such securitization into which
such related Serviced Companion Loan has been sold or, if such related Serviced Companion Loan has not been included in a securitization
transaction, to the holders of the related Serviced Companion Loan. After it receives such report, the 17g-5 Information Provider
will be required to post such report to the 17g-5 Information Provider’s website. Prior to the occurrence and continuance
of a Control Event, if the Directing Certificateholder does not disapprove an Asset Status Report within ten business days,
the special servicer will be required to implement the recommended action as outlined in the Asset Status Report. In addition,
with respect to any mortgage loan other than an Excluded Loan, prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Control Event, the
Directing Certificateholder may object to any Asset
 

S-336
 
 
Status Report within ten business days of receipt; provided, however,
that the special servicer will be required to implement the recommended action as outlined in the Asset Status Report if it makes
a determination in accordance with the Servicing Standard that the objection is not in the best interest of all the Certificateholders.
If, prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Control Event, the Directing Certificateholder disapproves the Asset Status Report
and the special servicer has not made the affirmative determination described above, the special servicer will be required to revise
the Asset Status Report as soon as practicable thereafter, but in no event later than 30 days after the disapproval. Prior to the
occurrence and continuance of a Control Event, the special servicer will be required to revise the Asset Status Report until the
Directing Certificateholder fails to disapprove the revised Asset Status Report as described above, until the Directing Certificateholder’s
approval is no longer required or until the special servicer makes a determination that the objection is not in the best interests
of the Certificateholders.
 
In addition, the special servicer will be
required to deliver a summary of each Final Asset Status Report (which may be the Final Asset Status Report without the data or
supporting information referred to in the definition of “Final Asset Status Report”) in accordance with the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement and any related intercreditor agreement, to the certificate administrator. Upon receipt of such summary,
the certificate administrator will be required to post such summary on its website.
 
A “Final Asset Status Report”,
with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, means each related Asset Status Report, together with such other data or
supporting information provided by the special servicer to the Directing Certificateholder which does not include any communication
(other than the related Asset Status Report) between the special servicer and Directing Certificateholder with respect to such
Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan; provided that, with respect to any mortgage loan other than an Excluded Loan, no Asset
Status Report will be considered to be a Final Asset Status Report unless, prior to a Control Event, the Directing Certificateholder
has either finally approved of and consented to the actions proposed to be taken in connection therewith, or has exhausted all
of its rights of approval or consent or has been deemed to have approved or consented to such action or the Asset Status Report
is otherwise implemented by the special servicer in accordance with the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
After the occurrence and during the continuance
of a Control Event but prior to the occurrence of a Consultation Termination Event, each of the Directing Certificateholder (other
than with respect to an Excluded Loan) and the senior trust advisor will be entitled to consult with the special servicer and propose
alternative courses of action and provide other feedback in respect of any Asset Status Report. After the occurrence of a Consultation
Termination Event, the Directing Certificateholder will have no right to consult with the special servicer with respect to the
Asset Status Reports and the special servicer will only be obligated to consult with the senior trust advisor with respect to any
Asset Status Reports as described above. The special servicer may choose to revise the Asset Status Reports as it deems reasonably
necessary in accordance with the Servicing Standard to take into account any input and/or recommendations of the senior trust advisor
or the Directing Certificateholder during the applicable periods described above, but is under no obligation to follow any particular
recommendation of the senior trust advisor or the Directing Certificateholder.
 
The Directing Certificateholder
 
Except as described in this free writing
prospectus regarding the mortgage loans, prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Control Event, the Directing Certificateholder
will be entitled to advise (1) the special servicer, with respect to all Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans other than an Excluded
Loan, (2) the special servicer, with respect to non-Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans other than an Excluded Loan, as to all
matters for which the master servicer must obtain the consent or deemed consent of the special servicer relating to a Major Decision
and (3) the special servicer, with respect to all mortgage loans other than an Excluded Loan for which an extension of maturity
is being considered by the special servicer or by the master servicer, subject to consent or deemed consent of the special servicer.
 

S-337
 
 
Except as otherwise described in the succeeding
paragraphs below, (a) the master servicer, solely to the extent it is permitted to take any of the following actions as provided
for in the first proviso following the Major Decisions listed below will not be permitted to take any of the following actions
(each, a “Major Decision”) unless it has obtained the consent of the special servicer and (b) with respect
to any mortgage loan (other than the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans and an Excluded Loan) and any Serviced Whole Loan, prior
to the occurrence and continuance of a Control Event, the special servicer will not be permitted to consent to the master servicer’s
taking any of the following actions, nor will the special servicer itself be permitted to take any of the following actions, as
to which the Directing Certificateholder has objected in writing within ten business days (or thirty (30) days with respect
to clause (x) below) after receipt of the written recommendation and analysis (provided that if such written objection
has not been received by the special servicer, within such ten-business-day (or 30-day) period, the Directing Certificateholder
will be deemed to have approved such action):
 
(i)     any proposed or actual
foreclosure upon or comparable conversion (which may include acquisitions of an REO Property) of the ownership of properties securing
such of the mortgage loans as come into and continue in default;
 
(ii)    any modification, consent
to a modification or waiver of any monetary term (other than late fees and default interest) or material non-monetary term (including,
without limitation, the timing of payments and acceptance of discounted payoffs) of a mortgage loan or any extension of the maturity
date of such mortgage loan;
 
(iii)   any sale of a Defaulted
Mortgage Loan and any related defaulted Companion Loan or REO Property (other than in connection with the termination
of the trust as described under “Description of the Certificates—Termination; Retirement of Certificates”
in this free writing prospectus) for less than the applicable Mortgage Loan Repurchase Price;
 
(iv)   any determination to
bring an REO Property into compliance with applicable environmental laws or to otherwise address hazardous material located at
an REO Property;
 
(v)    any release of collateral
or any acceptance of substitute or additional collateral for a mortgage loan or any consent to either of the foregoing, other than
if required pursuant to the specific terms of the related mortgage loan and for which there is no lender discretion;
 
(vi)   any waiver of a “due-on-sale”
or “due-on-encumbrance” clause with respect to a mortgage loan or any consent to such a waiver or consent to a transfer
of the Mortgaged Property or interests in the borrower or consent to the incurrence of additional debt, other than any such transfer
or incurrence of debt as may be effected without the consent of the lender under the related loan agreement;
 
(vii)   any property management
company changes (with respect to a mortgage loan with a principal balance greater than $2,500,000) or franchise changes (with respect
to a mortgage loan for which the lender is required to consent or approve under the mortgage loan documents);
 
(viii)  releases of any material
amounts from any escrows, reserve accounts or letters of credit held as performance escrows or reserves, other than those required
pursuant to the specific terms of the related mortgage loan and for which there is no lender discretion (and other than those that
are Special Servicer Decisions);
 
(ix)   any acceptance of an
assumption agreement or any other agreement permitting a transfer of interests in a borrower or guarantor releasing a borrower
or guarantor from liability under a mortgage loan other than pursuant to the specific terms of such mortgage loan and for which
there is no lender discretion;
 
(x)    any determination of
an Acceptable Insurance Default;
 

S-338
 
 
(xi)	  any exercise of a material
remedy with respect to a mortgage loan following a default or event of default of such mortgage loan;
 
(xii)	 any modification, consent
to a modification or waiver of any material term of any intercreditor or similar agreement related to a mortgage loan, or any action
to enforce rights with respect thereto; and
 
(xiii)	 any consent to incurrence
of additional debt by a borrower or mezzanine debt by a direct or indirect parent of a borrower, to the extent the mortgagee’s
approval is required under the related mortgage loan documents;
 
provided, however, that notwithstanding
the foregoing, the master servicer and the special servicer may mutually agree as contemplated in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
that the master servicer will process and obtain the prior consent of the special servicer with respect to any of the matters listed
in the foregoing clauses (i) through (xiii) with respect to any non-Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, and, whether processed by
the master servicer or not, with respect to a Major Decision, the master servicer and special servicer shall each be entitled to
50% of any Excess Modification Fees and assumption, consent and earnout fees (other than the assumption application fees and defeasance
fees) paid in connection with such matters (see “—Modification, Waivers and Amendments” in this free writing
prospectus); provided, further, that in the event that the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable,
determines that immediate action with respect to the foregoing matters (or any other matter requiring consent of the Directing
Certificateholder prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Control Event in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (or any matter
requiring consultation with the Directing Certificateholder or the senior trust advisor)) is necessary to protect the interests
of the Certificateholders (and, with respect to a Serviced Whole Loan, the interest of the Certificateholders and the holders of
the related Serviced Companion Loan), as a collective whole (taking into account the subordinate or pari passu nature of
any Companion Loans), the master servicer or the special servicer, as the case may be, may take any such action without waiting
for the Directing Certificateholder’s response (or without waiting to consult with the Directing Certificateholder or the
senior trust advisor, as the case may be); provided that the special servicer or master servicer, as applicable provides
the Directing Certificateholder (or the senior trust advisor, if applicable) with prompt written notice following such action including
a reasonably detailed explanation of the basis for such action. The special servicer is not required to obtain the consent of the
Directing Certificateholder for any of the foregoing actions upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Control Event;
provided, however, that after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Control Event, but prior to the occurrence
of a Consultation Termination Event, the special servicer will be required to consult with the Directing Certificateholder in connection
with any Major Decision not relating to an Excluded Loan (and such other matters that are subject to consultation rights of
the Directing Certificateholder pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) and to consider alternative actions recommended
by the Directing Certificateholder in respect of such Major Decision. In the event the special servicer receives no response from
the Directing Certificateholder within 10 days following its written request for input on any required consultation, the special
servicer will not be obligated to consult with the Directing Certificateholder on the specific matter; provided, however,
that the failure of the Directing Certificateholder to respond will not relieve the special servicer from consulting with the Directing
Certificateholder on any future matters with respect to the applicable mortgage loan or any other mortgage loan. With respect to
any Excluded Special Servicer Loan (that is not also an Excluded Loan), if any, the Directing Certificateholder (prior to the occurrence
and continuance of a Control Event) will be required to select an Excluded Special Servicer with respect to such Excluded Special
Servicer Loan. After the occurrence and during the continuance of a control event or if at any time the applicable Excluded Special
Servicer Loan is also an Excluded Loan, the resigning special servicer will be required to select the related Excluded Special
Servicer.
 
In addition, after the occurrence and during
the continuance of a Control Event, the special servicer will also be required to consult with the senior trust advisor in connection
with any Major Decision (and such other matters that are subject to consultation rights of the senior trust advisor pursuant to
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) and to consider alternative actions recommended by the senior trust advisor in respect of
such Major Decision; provided that such consultation is on a non-binding basis. In
 

S-339
 
 
the event the special servicer receives
no response from the senior trust advisor within 10 days following the later of (i) its written request for input on any required
consultation and (ii) delivery of all such additional information reasonably requested by the senior trust advisor related
to the subject matter of such consultation, the special servicer will not be obligated to consult with the senior trust advisor
on the specific matter; provided, however, that the failure of the senior trust advisor to respond will not relieve the
special servicer from consulting with the senior trust advisor on any future matters with respect to the applicable mortgage loan
or any other mortgage loan. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this free writing prospectus, with respect to
any Excluded Loan (regardless of whether a Control Event has occurred and is continuing), the special servicer or the related Excluded
Special Servicer, as applicable, will be required to consult with the senior trust advisor, on a non-binding basis, in connection
with the related transactions involving proposed Major Decisions and consider alternative actions recommended by the senior trust
advisor, in respect thereof, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement for consulting
with the senior trust advisor.
 
In addition, with respect to any mortgage
loan other than an Excluded Loan, unless a Control Event has occurred and is continuing, the Directing Certificateholder may direct
the special servicer to take, or to refrain from taking, other actions with respect to a mortgage loan, as the Directing Certificateholder
may reasonably deem advisable; provided that the special servicer will not be required to take or refrain from taking any
action pursuant to instructions or objections from the Directing Certificateholder that would cause it to violate applicable law,
the related mortgage loan documents, any related intercreditor agreement, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, including the Servicing
Standard, or the REMIC Provisions, or expose the master servicer, the special servicer, the certificate administrator, the senior
trust advisor, the trust fund or the trustee to liability, or materially expand the scope of responsibilities of the master servicer
or the special servicer, as applicable, under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or cause the master servicer or the special servicer,
as applicable, to act, or fail to act, in a manner which in the reasonable judgment of the master servicer or the special servicer,
as applicable, is not in the best interests of the Certificateholders (and, with respect to a Serviced Whole Loan, subject to the
rights of the holders of the related Serviced Companion Loan as described under “Description of the Mortgage Pool—The
Whole Loans” in this free writing prospectus).
 
With respect to each Non-Serviced Whole
Loan, the Directing Certificateholder will not be entitled to exercise the above-described rights, but such rights, or rights substantially
similar to those rights, will be exercisable by the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Controlling Holder; provided that
nothing precludes the Directing Certificateholder from consulting with the related special servicer, regardless of whether such
Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Controlling Holder is entitled to exercise such rights. See “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Servicing
of the Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan”, “—Servicing of the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan”
and “—Servicing of the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan and the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan” in this
free writing prospectus.
 
The “Directing Certificateholder”
will generally be the Controlling Class Certificateholder (or its representative) selected by more than 50% of the Controlling
Class Certificateholders, by Certificate Balance, as determined by the certificate registrar from time to time; provided,
however, that (1) absent that selection, or (2) until a Directing Certificateholder is so selected or (3) upon
receipt of a notice from a majority of the Controlling Class Certificateholders, by Certificate Balance, that a Directing
Certificateholder is no longer designated, the Controlling Class Certificateholder that owns the largest aggregate Certificate
Balance of the Controlling Class (or its representative) will be the Directing Certificateholder; provided, however, that
in the case of this clause (3), then (A) (i) the holder of the largest percentage in excess of 25% that sends notice of the election
of a Directing Certificateholder will be entitled to so appoint a Directing Certificateholder or (ii) if no such holder sends notice
pursuant to clause (i) then (1) the certificate administrator will provide notice thereof to LNR Securities Holdings, LLC, each
party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and each Controlling Class Certificateholder substantially in the form provided in
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, requesting a certification from an authorized representative of LNR Securities Holdings, LLC
that LNR Securities Holdings, LLC or its affiliate owns at least 25% of the Certificate Balance of the Controlling Class and (2)
for as long as LNR Securities Holdings, LLC or its affiliate owns at least 25% of such class of certificates as confirmed to the
certificate administrator in such certification then such entity will be the Directing Certificateholder or (B) in
 

S-340
 
 
the event no
one holder owns the largest aggregate Certificate Balance of the Controlling Class and a Directing Certificateholder is not determined
through the operation of clause (A) above, then there will be no Directing Certificateholder until appointed in accordance with
the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The certificate administrator and the other parties to the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement will be entitled to assume that the identity of the Directing Certificateholder has not changed until such parties receive
written notice of a replacement of the Directing Certificateholder from a party holding the requisite interest in the Controlling
Class, or the resignation of the then-current Directing Certificateholder. If a party asserts it is the holder of the largest aggregate
Certificate Balance of the Controlling Class under clause (3) of the definition of Directing Certificateholder pursuant to the
required procedures in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the certificate administrator will deliver notice to the other holders
of the Controlling Class of the assertion. Provided another party holding an equal or larger aggregate Certificate Balance of the
Controlling Class does not provide a notice within 30 days after delivery of the required notice, the party making the original
assertion will become the Directing Certificateholder until replaced by another party pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, it being acknowledged that prior to the expiration of such 30-day period, the master servicer, the certificate
administrator, the special servicer, the trustee and the senior trust advisor will be required to proceed as if there is no Directing
Certificateholder. After the occurrence and during the continuance of a Control Event, the Directing Certificateholder will only
retain its consultation rights to the extent specifically provided for in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. See “Description
of the Certificates—Appraisal Reductions” in this free writing prospectus. The initial Directing Certificateholder
is expected to be LNR Securities Holdings, LLC (or its affiliate).
 
With respect to any Excluded Loan, the Directing
Certificateholder or any Controlling Class Certificateholder will not have any consent or consultation rights with respect to the
servicing of such Excluded Loan and a Control Event and Consultation Termination Event will be deemed to have occurred with respect
to an Excluded Loan.
 
A “Controlling Class Certificateholder”
is each holder (or Certificate Owner, if applicable) of a certificate of the Controlling Class as determined by the certificate
registrar from time to time, upon request by any party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
The “Controlling Class”
will be as of any time of determination the most subordinate class of Control Eligible Certificates then outstanding that has an
aggregate Certificate Balance, as notionally reduced by any Appraisal Reductions allocable to such class, at least equal to 25%
of the initial Certificate Balance of that class; provided that if at any time the principal balances of the certificates
other than the Control Eligible Certificates have been reduced to zero as a result of the allocation of principal payments on the
mortgage loans, then the Controlling Class will be the most subordinate class among the Control Eligible Certificates that has
an aggregate principal balance greater than zero without regard to any Appraisal Reductions. A “Consultation Termination
Event” will occur when there is no class of Control Eligible Certificates that has a then-outstanding Certificate
Balance at least equal to 25% of the initial Certificate Balance of that class, in each case, without regard to the application
of any Appraisal Reductions. Upon the occurrence of a Consultation Termination Event, no class of certificates will act as the
Controlling Class and the Directing Certificateholder will have no rights under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to consent
or consult with the master servicer or special servicer. The Controlling Class as of the Closing Date will be the Class NR
certificates.
 
The “Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan
Controlling Holder”, with respect to any Non-Serviced Whole Loan will be the “directing certificateholder”,
“controlling class representative” or similar party under the applicable Non-Serviced PSA.
 
The master servicer, the special servicer,
the senior trust advisor, the certificate administrator, the trustee or any Certificateholder may request that the certificate
registrar determine which class of certificates is the then-current Controlling Class and the certificate registrar must thereafter
provide such information to the requesting party. The depositor, the trustee, the certificate administrator, the master servicer,
the special servicer, the senior trust advisor and, prior to the occurrence of a Consultation Termination Event, the Directing
Certificateholder, may request that the certificate registrar provide, and the certificate registrar must so provide, a list of
the holders (or Certificate Owners, if applicable) of the
 

S-341
 
 
Controlling Class. The trustee, the certificate administrator, the master
servicer, the special servicer and the senior trust advisor may each rely on any such list so provided.
 
Subject to the provisions in the definition
of “Directing Certificateholder”, in the event that no Directing Certificateholder has been appointed or identified
to the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, and the master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, has
attempted to obtain such information from the certificate administrator and no such entity has been identified to the master servicer
or the special servicer, as applicable, then until such time as the new Directing Certificateholder is identified, the master servicer
or the special servicer, as applicable, will have no duty to consult with, provide notice to, or seek the approval or consent of
any such Directing Certificateholder as the case may be.
 
The “Control Eligible Certificates”
will be any of the Class E, Class F, Class G and Class NR certificates.
 
A “Control Event” will
occur when the Class E certificates have a Certificate Balance (taking into account the application of any Appraisal
Reductions to notionally reduce the Certificate Balance of such class) of less than 25% of the initial Certificate Balance of that
class, but prior to any time the principal balances of the certificates other than the Control Eligible Certificates have been
reduced to zero as a result of the allocation of principal payments on the mortgage loans.
 
Subject to the provisions in the definition
of “Controlling Class”, after the occurrence of a Consultation Termination Event, the Directing Certificateholder will
have no consultation rights under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and will have no right to receive any notices, reports or
information (other than notices, reports or information required to be delivered to all Certificateholders) or any other rights
as Directing Certificateholder. However, the Directing Certificateholder will maintain the right to exercise its Voting Rights
for the same purposes as any other Certificateholder under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
Neither the master servicer nor the special
servicer will be required to take or to refrain from taking any action pursuant to instructions from the Directing Certificateholder,
or because of any failure to approve an action by any such party, or because of an objection by any such party that would cause
either the master servicer or the special servicer to violate applicable law, the related loan documents, the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement (including the Servicing Standard), any related intercreditor agreements or the REMIC Provisions.
 
The master servicer and the special servicer
may resign under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement at any time if continuing to perform their respective servicing duties would
cause it to be in violation of any applicable law. The master servicer or the special servicer may generally resign at any time
so long as it provides a replacement meeting the requirements in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and that is otherwise acceptable
to the Rating Agencies. Except as limited by certain conditions described under “Transaction Parties—Replacement
of the Special Servicer” in this free writing prospectus, the special servicer may generally be replaced, prior to the
occurrence and continuance of a Control Event (a) for cause at any time and (b) without cause if either (i) LNR Partners, LLC or
its affiliate is no longer the special servicer or (ii) LNR Securities Holdings, LLC or its affiliate owns less than 25% of the
Controlling Class, by the Directing Certificateholder so long as, among other things, the Directing Certificateholder provides
a replacement special servicer that meets the requirements of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and is acceptable to the Rating
Agencies. After the occurrence and during the continuance of a Control Event, the special servicer may be replaced with a new special
servicer generally (x) upon the written direction of holders of Principal Balance Certificates and Class EC certificates evidencing
not less than 25% of the Voting Rights (taking into account the application of any Appraisal Reductions to notionally reduce the
respective Certificate Balances) of the Principal Balance Certificates and Class EC certificates requesting a vote to replace the
special servicer with a new special servicer and (y) the written direction of holders of Principal Balance Certificates evidencing
at least 75% of a Certificateholder Quorum of Certificates. See “Transaction Parties—Replacement of the Special
Servicer” in this free writing prospectus.
 

S-342
 
 
Additionally, either of the master servicer
or the special servicer, as the case may be, may be replaced by the depositor, the trustee, or Certificateholders representing
at least 25% of Voting Rights in the event that a Servicer Termination Event under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement occurs with
respect to such entity. In the event that either the master servicer or the special servicer resigns or is replaced and no replacement
is otherwise provided for, the trustee is required to immediately take the place of such resigning master servicer or such resigning
special servicer unless the trustee is prohibited by any applicable law from serving in such capacity. The Certificateholders will
receive notification from the certificate administrator or the master servicer, as applicable, in any case in which a master servicer
or special servicer resigns or is replaced. See “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Servicer Termination Events”
in this free writing prospectus.
 
Limitation on Liability of
Directing Certificateholder
 
The Directing Certificateholder (and, with
respect to any Non-Serviced Whole Loan, the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Controlling Holder) will not be liable to the trust
fund or the Certificateholders for any action taken, or for refraining from the taking of any action for errors in judgment. However,
the Directing Certificateholder will not be protected against any liability to the Controlling Class Certificateholders that
would otherwise be imposed by reason of willful misconduct, bad faith or negligence in the performance of duties or by reason of
reckless disregard of obligations or duties owed to the Controlling Class Certificateholders.
 
Each Certificateholder acknowledges and
agrees, by its acceptance of its certificates, that the Directing Certificateholder (and, with respect to any Non-Serviced Whole
Loan, the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Controlling Holder):
 
(a)	  may have special relationships
and interests that conflict with those of holders of one or more classes of certificates;
 
(b)	  may act solely in the
interests of the holders of the Controlling Class (or, with respect to any Non-Serviced Whole Loan, the related Non-Serviced Mortgage
Loan Controlling Holder);
 
(c)	  does not have any liability
or duties to the holders of any class of certificates other than the Controlling Class (or, with respect to any Non-Serviced Whole
Loan, the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Controlling Holder);
 
(d)	  may take actions that
favor the interests of the holders of the Controlling Class (or, with respect to any Non-Serviced Whole Loan, the related Non-Serviced
Mortgage Loan Controlling Holder) over the interests of the holders of one or more other classes of certificates; and
 
(e)	  will have no liability
whatsoever (other than to a Controlling Class Certificateholder) for having so acted as set forth in (a) – (d) above,
and no Certificateholder may take any action whatsoever against the Directing Certificateholder (or the related Non-Serviced Mortgage
Loan Controlling Holder) or any director, officer, employee, agent or principal thereof for having so acted.
 
The taking of, or refraining from taking,
any action by the master servicer or the special servicer in accordance with the direction of or approval of the Directing Certificateholder,
which does not violate the terms of any mortgage loan, any law or the accepted servicing practices or the provisions of the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement or any intercreditor agreements, will not result in any liability on the part of the master servicer or
the special servicer.
 
Generally, the holders of any Companion
Loan and their respective designees (e.g. any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan Controlling Holder and/or Subordinate Companion
Loan holder) will have limitations on liability with respect to actions taken in connection with the related mortgage loan similar
to the limitations of the Directing Certificateholder described above.
 

S-343
 
 
The Senior Trust Advisor
 
General Obligations. After the occurrence
and during the continuance of a Control Event, the senior trust advisor will generally review the special servicer’s operational
practices in respect of Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans to formulate an opinion as to whether or not those operational practices
generally satisfy the Servicing Standard with respect to the resolution and/or liquidation of the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans.
In addition, after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Control Event, the senior trust advisor will consult on a non-binding
basis with the special servicer with regard to certain matters with respect to its servicing of the Specially Serviced Mortgage
Loans to the extent set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and described in this free writing prospectus.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the senior
trust advisor will generally have no obligations or consultation rights under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement for this transaction
with respect to any Non-Serviced Whole Loan (each of which will be serviced pursuant to the related Non-Serviced PSA) or any related
REO Properties. However, Pentalpha Surveillance LLC is the senior trust advisor under the JPMBB 2015-C31 pooling and servicing
agreement, and, in such capacity, has certain obligations and consultation rights with respect to the Civic Opera Building whole
loan that are substantially similar to those of the senior trust advisor under the pooling and servicing agreement for this transaction.
Pentalpha Surveillance LLC is also the senior trust advisor under the JPMBB 2015-C30 pooling and servicing agreement, and, in such
capacity, has certain obligations and consultation rights with respect to the One Shell Square whole loan and the Brunswick Portfolio
whole loan that are substantially similar to those of the senior trust advisor under the pooling and servicing agreement for this
transaction. However, there will be no senior trust advisor with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan. See “Risk
Factors—Potential Conflicts of Interest—Special Servicer May Be Directed to Take Actions” and “Description
of the Mortgage Pool—The Whole Loans—The Civic Opera Building Whole Loan”, “—The U-Haul Portfolio
Whole Loan”, “—The One Shell Square Whole Loan” and “—The Brunswick Portfolio
Whole Loan” in this free writing prospectus.
 
In addition, in the event that the only
mortgage loan (or REO loan) that remains in the trust is the mortgage loan identified as “U-Haul Portfolio” on Annex
A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing 4.3% of the Initial Pool Balance, the senior trust advisor may resign as senior
trust advisor. A replacement senior trust advisor will not be engaged in the event the senior trust advisor elects to resign under
these circumstances.
 
The senior trust advisor will act solely
as a contracting party to the extent set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and described in this free writing prospectus,
and will have no fiduciary duty to any party. The senior trust advisor’s duties will be limited to its specific duties under
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and the senior trust advisor will have no duty or liability to any particular class of certificates
or any Certificateholder. The senior trust advisor is not the special servicer or a sub-servicer and will not be charged with changing
the outcome on any particular Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan. By purchasing a certificate, potential investors acknowledge and
agree that there could be multiple strategies to resolve any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and that the goal of the senior trust
advisor’s participation is to provide additional input relating to the special servicer’s compliance with the Servicing
Standard in making its determinations as to which strategy to execute. The senior trust advisor’s review of information (other
than a Final Asset Status Report and information accompanying such report) or interaction with the special servicer related to
any specific Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan is only to provide background information to support the senior trust advisor’s
duties following a servicing transfer, if needed, or to allow more meaningful interaction with the special servicer. Potential
investors should note that the senior trust advisor is not an “advisor” for any purpose other than as specifically
set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and is not an advisor to any person, including without limitation any Certificateholder.
For the avoidance of doubt, the senior trust advisor is not an “investment adviser” within the meaning of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. See “Risk Factors—Your Lack of Control Over the Trust Can Adversely Impact Your
Investment” in this free writing prospectus.
 
In order to maintain the senior trust advisor’s
familiarity with the mortgage loans, the senior trust advisor is required to promptly review all information available to Privileged
Persons on the certificate administrator’s website related to Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and certain information available
to
 

S-344
 
 
Privileged Persons on the certificate administrator’s website related to mortgage loans on the CREFC® watch
list report prepared monthly by the master servicer and each Final Asset Status Report. The special servicer will be required to
deliver to the senior trust advisor each Final Asset Status Report. In addition, prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Control
Event, the special servicer will forward any Appraisal Reduction and net present value calculations used in the special servicer’s
determination of what course of action to take in connection with the workout or liquidation of a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan
to the senior trust advisor after they have been finalized and the senior trust advisor will review such calculations but will
not opine on or take any affirmative action with respect to such Appraisal Reduction calculations and/or net present value calculations.
Prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Control Event, the senior trust advisor’s obligations will be limited to the
review described in this paragraph and generally will not involve an assessment of specific actions of the special servicer and,
in any event, will be subject to limitations set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and described in this free writing
prospectus.
 
Prior to the occurrence and continuance
of a Control Event, the senior trust advisor will have no specific involvement with respect to servicing transfers, collateral
substitutions, assignments, insurance policies, borrower substitutions, lease changes and other similar actions that the special
servicer may perform under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
At all times, the senior trust advisor will
be obligated to keep confidential any Privileged Information received from the special servicer or Directing Certificateholder
in connection with the Directing Certificateholder’s exercise of any rights under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (including,
without limitation, in connection with any Asset Status Report) or otherwise in connection with the transaction, except under the
circumstances described below. As used in this free writing prospectus, “Privileged Information” means (i) any
correspondence between the Directing Certificateholder and the special servicer related to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan
(other than with respect to an Excluded Loan) or the exercise of the Directing Certificateholder’s consent or consultation
rights under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, (ii) any strategically sensitive information that the special servicer has
reasonably determined could compromise the trust fund’s position in any ongoing or future negotiations with the related borrower
or other interested party and (iii) information subject to attorney-client privilege.
 
The senior trust advisor will not disclose
any Privileged Information to any person (including any Certificateholders which are not then holders of Control Eligible Certificates),
other than to the other parties to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, to the extent expressly required by the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement (which parties, in turn, will not without the prior written consent of the special servicer and the Directing Certificateholder,
disclose such information to any other person), except to the extent that (a) such Privileged Information becomes generally
available and known to the public other than as a result of disclosure directly or indirectly by such parties, (b) it is reasonable
and necessary for such parties to do so in working with legal counsel, auditors, taxing authorities or other governmental agencies,
(c) such Privileged Information was already known to such party and not otherwise subject to a confidentiality obligation
or (d) such disclosure is required by applicable law, as evidenced by an opinion of counsel (which will be an expense of the
trust) delivered to the master servicer, the senior trust advisor, the certificate administrator, the special servicer, the Directing
Certificateholder and the trustee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the senior trust advisor will be permitted to share Privileged
Information with its affiliates and any subcontractors of the senior trust advisor that agree in writing to be bound by the same
confidentiality provisions applicable to the senior trust advisor.
 
The senior trust advisor, its affiliates
and any of its members, managers, directors, officers, employees or agents will be entitled to indemnification by the trust fund
against any loss, liability or expense incurred in connection with any legal or administrative action or claim that relates to
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or the certificates (including, without limitation, any action or claim arising from, or relating
to, a recommendation by the senior trust advisor to replace the special servicer); provided that such indemnification will
not extend to any loss, liability or expense incurred by reason of the senior trust advisor’s bad faith, willful misconduct
or negligence in the performance of its obligations or duties under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 

S-345
 
 
The senior trust advisor may not make any
investment in any class of certificates; provided, however, that such prohibition will not apply to (i) riskless principal
transactions effected by a broker-dealer affiliate of the senior trust advisor or (ii) investments by an affiliate of the
senior trust advisor if the senior trust advisor and such affiliate maintain policies and procedures that (A) segregate personnel
involved in the activities of the senior trust advisor under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement from personnel involved in such
affiliate’s investment activities and (B) prevent such affiliate and its personnel from gaining access to information
regarding the trust fund and the senior trust advisor and its personnel from gaining access to such affiliate’s information
regarding its investment activities.
 
Annual Report. After the occurrence
and during the continuance of a Control Event, based on the senior trust advisor’s review of any Assessment of Compliance,
Attestation Report, Asset Status Report and other information (other than any communications between the Directing Certificateholder
and the special servicer that would be Privileged Information) delivered to the senior trust advisor by the special servicer, including
each Asset Status Report delivered during the prior calendar year, the senior trust advisor will (if any mortgage loans were Specially
Serviced Mortgage Loans in the prior calendar year) prepare an annual report to be provided to the 17g-5 Information Provider (and
made available through the 17g-5 Information Provider’s website) and the certificate administrator for the benefit of the
Certificateholders (and made available through the certificate administrator’s website) within 120 days of the end of the
prior calendar year for which a Control Event was continuing as of December 31 and setting forth its assessment of the special
servicer’s performance of its duties under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement during the prior calendar year on a “platform-level
basis” with respect to the resolution and liquidation of Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans that the special servicer is responsible
for servicing under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement; provided, however, that in the event the special servicer is replaced,
the senior trust advisor’s annual report will only relate to the entity that was acting as special servicer as of December
31 in the prior calendar year and is continuing in such capacity through the date of such annual report. Only as used in connection
with the senior trust advisor’s annual report, the term “platform-level basis” refers to the special servicer’s
performance of its duties as they relate to the resolution and liquidation of Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans, taking into account
the special servicer’s specific duties under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement as well as the extent to which those duties
were performed in accordance with the Servicing Standard, with reasonable consideration by the senior trust advisor of any Assessment
of Compliance, Attestation Report, Asset Status Report and other information delivered to the senior trust advisor by the special
servicer (other than any communications between the Directing Certificateholder and the special servicer that would be Privileged
Information) pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
The special servicer must be given an opportunity
to review any annual report produced by the senior trust advisor at least five (5) business days prior to its delivery to the certificate
administrator and the 17g-5 Information Provider; provided that the senior trust advisor will have no obligation to adopt
any comments to such annual report that are provided by the special servicer.
 
A form of annual report is attached to this
free writing prospectus as Annex C (which form may, subject to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, be modified or supplemented
from time to time to cure any ambiguity or error or to incorporate additional information). In each annual report, the senior trust
advisor will identify any material deviations (i) from the Servicing Standard and (ii) from the special servicer’s
obligations under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement with respect to the resolution or liquidation of Specially Serviced Mortgage
Loans or REO Properties that the special servicer is responsible for
servicing under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (other than with respect to any REO Property related to a Non-Serviced Mortgage
Loan) based on the limited review required in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Each annual report will be required to comply
with the confidentiality requirements, subject to certain exceptions, each as described in this free writing prospectus and as
provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement regarding Privileged Information.
 
Consultation Duties of
the Senior Trust Advisor After a Control Event
 
After the occurrence and during the continuance
of a Control Event, the special servicer will be required to promptly deliver each Asset Status Report prepared in connection with
the workout or
 

S-346
 
 
liquidation of a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan to the senior trust advisor. The senior trust advisor will be
required to provide comments to the special servicer in respect of the Asset Status Reports, if any, within ten business days following
the later of (i) receipt of such Asset Status Report or (ii) such related additional information reasonably requested
by the senior trust advisor, and propose possible alternative courses of action to the extent it determines such alternatives to
be in the best interest of the Certificateholders (including any Certificateholders that are holders of the Control Eligible Certificates),
as a collective whole. After the occurrence and during the continuance of a Control Event, the special servicer will be obligated
to consider such alternative courses of action and any other feedback provided by the senior trust advisor (and, with respect to
any mortgage loan other than an Excluded Loan, during the continuance of such Control Event but prior to the occurrence of a Consultation
Termination Event, the Directing Certificateholder) in connection with the special servicer’s preparation of any Asset Status
Report. The special servicer will revise the Asset Status Reports as it deems necessary to take into account any input and/or comments
from the senior trust advisor (and, with respect to any mortgage loan other than an Excluded Loan, during the continuance of such
Control Event but prior to the occurrence of a Consultation Termination Event, the Directing Certificateholder), to the extent
the special servicer determines that the senior trust advisor’s and/or Directing Certificateholder’s input and/or recommendations
are consistent with the Servicing Standard and in the best interest of the Certificateholders (or, with respect to a Serviced Whole
Loan, the best interest of the Certificateholders and the holders of the related Serviced Companion Loan, as a collective whole
(taking into account the pari passu nature of such Serviced Companion Loan)), taking into account the interests of all of
the Certificateholders as a collective whole. See “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—General” in this free
writing prospectus.
 
The special servicer will not be required
to take or to refrain from taking any action because of an objection or comment by the senior trust advisor or a recommendation
of the senior trust advisor.
 
After the occurrence and during the continuance
of a Control Event, the special servicer will forward any Appraisal Reduction or net present value calculations to the senior trust
advisor and the senior trust advisor is required to promptly recalculate and verify the accuracy of the mathematical calculations
and the corresponding application of the non-discretionary portion of the applicable formulas required to be utilized in connection
with any Appraisal Reduction or net present value calculations used in the special servicer’s determination of what course
of action to take in connection with the workout or liquidation of a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan prior to utilization by the
special servicer. The special servicer will be required to deliver the foregoing calculations together with information and supporting
materials (including such additional information reasonably requested by the senior trust advisor to confirm the mathematical accuracy
of such calculations, but not including any Privileged Information) to the senior trust advisor. The senior trust advisor will
recalculate and verify the accuracy of those calculations and, in the event the senior trust advisor does not agree with the mathematical
calculations of the Appraisal Reduction (as calculated by the special servicer) or net present value or the application of the
applicable non-discretionary portions of the formula required to be utilized for such calculation, the senior trust advisor and
special servicer will consult with each other in order to resolve any inaccuracy in the mathematical calculations or the application
of the non-discretionary portions of the related formula in arriving at those mathematical calculations or any disagreement within
five (5) business days of delivery of such calculations. In the event the senior trust advisor and special servicer are not able
to resolve such matters, the senior trust advisor is required to promptly notify the certificate administrator and the certificate
administrator will determine any necessary action to take in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
The ability to perform the duties of the
senior trust advisor and the quality and the depth of any annual report will be dependent upon the timely receipt of information
prepared or made available by others and the accuracy and the completeness of such information. In addition, in no event will the
senior trust advisor have the power to compel any transaction party to take, or refrain from taking, any action. It is possible
that the lack of access to Privileged Information may limit or prohibit the senior trust advisor from performing its duties under
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, in which case any annual report will describe any resulting limitations.
 

S-347
 
 
Replacement of the Special
Servicer
 
After the occurrence of a Consultation Termination
Event, if the senior trust advisor determines that the special servicer is not performing its duties as required under the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement or is otherwise not acting in accordance with the Servicing Standard, the senior trust advisor may recommend
the replacement of the special servicer in the manner described in “Transaction Parties—Replacement of the Special
Servicer” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Termination and Resignation
of the Senior Trust Advisor
 
After the occurrence of a Consultation Termination
Event, the senior trust advisor may be removed upon (i) the written direction of holders of certificates evidencing not less
than 25% of the aggregate Certificate Balance of all classes of Principal Balance Certificates and Class EC certificates (taking
into account the application of Appraisal Reductions to notionally reduce the Certificate Balances of classes to which such Appraisal
Reductions are allocable) requesting a vote to replace the senior trust advisor with a replacement senior trust advisor selected
by such Certificateholders, (ii) payment by such requesting holders to the certificate administrator of all reasonable fees
and expenses to be incurred by the certificate administrator in connection with administering such vote and (iii) receipt
by the trustee and the certificate administrator of Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency that the appointment of
such replacement senior trust advisor will not result in a downgrade of the Offered Certificates (which confirmations will be obtained
by the certificate administrator at the expense of such holders). The certificate administrator will be required to promptly provide
written notice to all Certificateholders of such request by posting such notice on its internet website, and by mail, and conduct
the solicitation of votes of all certificates in such regard. Upon the vote or written direction of holders of at least 75% of
the aggregate Certificate Balance of all classes of Principal Balance Certificates and Class EC certificates (taking into
account the application of Appraisal Reductions to notionally reduce the Certificate Balances of classes to which such Appraisal
Reductions are allocable), the trustee will immediately replace the senior trust advisor with the replacement senior trust advisor.
 
In addition, in the event that the senior
trust advisor fails to duly observe or perform in any material respect any of its duties, covenants or obligations under the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement, then the trustee may, and upon the written direction of Certificateholders representing at least 51% of
the Voting Rights (taking into account the application of any Appraisal Reductions to notionally reduce the Certificate Balance
of the classes of certificates), the trustee will, terminate the senior trust advisor for cause. In the event (i) of the insolvency
of the senior trust advisor, or (ii) the senior trust advisor acknowledges in writing its inability to legally perform its
duties under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, then the trustee will terminate the senior trust advisor for cause. Upon the
termination of the senior trust advisor, a replacement senior trust advisor meeting the eligibility requirements set forth in the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement and described in this free writing prospectus will be selected by the certificate administrator.
The certificate administrator may rely on a certification by the replacement senior trust advisor that it meets such criteria.
If the certificate administrator is unable to find a replacement senior trust advisor within 30 days of the termination of the
senior trust advisor, the depositor will be permitted to find a replacement. Unless and until a replacement senior trust advisor
is appointed, no party may act as the senior trust advisor. Any replacement senior trust advisor must (or all of the personnel
responsible for supervising the obligations of the senior trust advisor must) meet either of the following criteria: (A) (i) be
regularly engaged in the business of analyzing and advising clients in commercial mortgage-backed securities matters and have at
least five years of experience in collateral analysis and loss projections, and (ii) have at least five years of experience
in commercial real estate asset management and experience in the workout and management of distressed commercial real estate assets
or (B) be an institution that is a special servicer, senior trust advisor or operating advisor on a commercial mortgage-backed
securities transaction rated by S&P, Fitch, Moody’s, Morningstar, KBRA or DBRS (including, in the case of the senior
trust advisor, this transaction) but has not been special servicer or senior trust advisor on a transaction for which any Rating
Agency has qualified, downgraded or withdrawn its rating or ratings of, one or more classes of certificates for such transaction
citing servicing concerns with the special servicer or senior trust advisor as the sole or a material factor in such rating action.
 

S-348
 
 
The senior trust advisor may resign upon
30 days’ prior written notice to the depositor, master servicer, special servicer, trustee, certificate administrator and
the Directing Certificateholder, if the senior trust advisor has secured a replacement senior trust advisor meeting the eligibility
requirements set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and described in this free writing prospectus and such replacement
has accepted its appointment as the replacement senior trust advisor and the trustee has received a Rating Agency Confirmation
from each Rating Agency. Notwithstanding the above, in the event that the only mortgage loan (or REO loan) that remains in the
trust is the mortgage loan identified as “U-Haul Portfolio” on Annex A-1 of this free writing prospectus, the senior
trust advisor may resign as senior trust advisor, and no replacement senior trust advisor will be engaged in the event that the
senior trust advisor elects to resign under these circumstances.
 
Prior to the occurrence and continuance
of a Control Event, the Directing Certificateholder will have the right to consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed to the identity of any replacement senior trust advisor.
 
In addition, in the event there are no classes
of certificates outstanding other than the Control Eligible Certificates and the Class R certificates, then all of the rights and
obligations of the senior trust advisor under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement will terminate without payment of any penalty
or termination fee. If the senior trust advisor is terminated pursuant to the foregoing sentence, then no replacement senior trust
advisor will be appointed. In the event the senior trust advisor resigns or is terminated for any reason it will remain entitled
to any accrued and unpaid fees and reimbursement of Senior Trust Advisor Expenses and any rights to indemnification provided under
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement with respect to the period for which it acted as senior trust advisor.
 
Senior Trust Advisor Compensation
 
The fee of the senior trust advisor (the
“Senior Trust Advisor Fee”) will be payable monthly from amounts received in respect of each mortgage loan (including
any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and REO Loan (other than the portion of an REO Loan related to any Serviced Companion Loan), and
will accrue at a rate (the “Senior Trust Advisor Fee Rate”) equal to a per annum rate of 0.00250%.
 
A “Senior Trust Advisor Consulting
Fee” will be payable to the senior trust advisor with respect to each Major Decision on which the senior trust advisor
has consultation obligations and performed its duties with respect to that Major Decision. The Senior Trust Advisor Consulting
Fee will be a fee for each such Major Decision equal to $10,000 or such lesser amount as the related borrower agrees to pay with
respect to any mortgage loan (other than any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan); provided that the senior trust advisor may in
its sole discretion reduce the Senior Trust Advisor Consulting Fee with respect to any Major Decision.
 
Each of the Senior Trust Advisor Fee and
the Senior Trust Advisor Consulting Fee will be payable from funds on deposit in the Certificate Account out of amounts otherwise
available to make distributions on the Offered Certificates as described in “Description of the Certificates—Distributions”
in this free writing prospectus, but with respect to the Senior Trust Advisor Consulting Fee, only as and to the extent that such
fee is actually received from the related borrower. If the senior trust advisor has consultation rights with respect to a Major
Decision, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement will require the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, to use commercially
reasonable efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to collect the applicable Senior Trust Advisor Consulting Fee from the
related borrower in connection with such Major Decision, but only to the extent not prohibited by the related mortgage loan documents.
The master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, will each be permitted to waive or reduce the amount of any such Senior
Trust Advisor Consulting Fee payable by the related borrower if it determines that such full or partial waiver is in accordance
with the Servicing Standard but in no event will take any enforcement action with respect to the collection of such Senior Trust
Advisor Consulting Fee other than requests for collection; provided that the master servicer or the special servicer, as
applicable, will be required to consult, on a non-binding basis, with the senior trust advisor prior to any such waiver or reduction.
 

S-349
 
 
In addition to the Senior Trust Advisor
Fee and the Senior Trust Advisor Consulting Fee, the senior trust advisor will be entitled to reimbursement of Senior Trust Advisor
Expenses in accordance with the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. “Senior Trust Advisor Expenses”
for each Distribution Date will equal any unreimbursed indemnification amounts or additional trust fund expenses payable to the
senior trust advisor pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (other than the Senior Trust Advisor Fee and the Senior Trust
Advisor Consulting Fee).
 
Maintenance of Insurance
 
To the extent permitted by the related mortgage
loan and required by the Servicing Standard, the master servicer (with respect to the mortgage loans and any related Serviced Companion
Loan but excluding the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans) will be required to use efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard
to cause each borrower to maintain, and the special servicer (with respect to REO Properties other than the Mortgaged Property
securing a Non-Serviced Whole Loan and subject to the conditions set forth in the following sentence) will maintain, for the
related Mortgaged Property all insurance coverage required by the terms of the related mortgage loan documents; provided, however,
that the master servicer (with respect to mortgage loans and Serviced Companion Loans) will not be required to maintain or cause
the borrower to maintain and the special servicer (with respect to REO Properties) will not be required to maintain terrorism insurance
to the extent that the failure of the related borrower to do so is an Acceptable Insurance Default or if the trustee does not have
an insurable interest. Insurance coverage is required to be in the amounts (which, in the case of casualty insurance, is generally
equal to the lesser of the outstanding principal balance of the related mortgage loan and the replacement cost of the related Mortgaged
Property), and from an insurer meeting the requirements, set forth in the related mortgage loan documents. If the borrower does
not maintain such coverage, the master servicer (with respect to such mortgage loans and any related Serviced Companion Loan) or
the special servicer (with respect to REO Properties other than a Mortgaged Property securing a Non-Serviced Whole Loan), as the
case may be, will be required to maintain such coverage to the extent such coverage is available at commercially reasonable rates
and the trustee has an insurable interest, as determined by the master servicer (with respect to the mortgage loans and any related
Serviced Companion Loan) or special servicer (with respect to REO Properties other than a Mortgaged Property securing the Non-Serviced
Whole Loan), as applicable, in accordance with the Servicing Standard; provided that the master servicer will be obligated
to use efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to cause the borrower to maintain (or to itself maintain) insurance against
property damage resulting from terrorist or similar acts unless the borrower’s failure is an Acceptable Insurance Default
as determined by the special servicer. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Certain Terms and Conditions of the
Mortgage Loans—Hazard, Liability and Other Insurance” and “Risk Factors—Availability of Terrorism
Insurance” in this free writing prospectus. Notwithstanding any contrary provision above, the master servicer will not
be required to maintain, and will not be in default for failing to obtain, any earthquake or environmental insurance on any Mortgaged
Property unless (other than with respect to a Mortgaged Property securing a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) such insurance was required
at the time of origination of the related mortgage loan, the trustee has an insurable interest and is currently available at commercially
reasonable rates. In addition, the master servicer (at its own expense) and the special servicer (at the expense of the trust)
will be entitled to rely on insurance consultants in determining whether any insurance is available at commercially reasonable
rates. After the master servicer determines that a Mortgaged Property other than the Mortgaged Property securing the Non-Serviced
Mortgage Loan is located in an area identified as a federally designated special flood hazard area (and flood insurance has
been made available), the master servicer will be required to use efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to (1) cause
each borrower to maintain (to the extent required by the related mortgage loan documents), and if the borrower does not so maintain,
will be required to (2) itself maintain to the extent the trustee, as mortgagee, has an insurable interest in the Mortgaged
Property and is available at commercially reasonable rates (as determined by the master servicer in accordance with the Servicing
Standard) a flood insurance policy in an amount representing coverage not less than the lesser of (x) the outstanding principal
balance of the related mortgage loan (and any related Serviced Companion Loan, if applicable) and (y) the maximum amount of
insurance which is available under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, plus such additional excess flood coverage
with respect to the Mortgaged Property, if any, in an amount consistent with the
 

S-350
 
 
Servicing Standard, but only to the extent that
the related mortgage loan permits the lender to require the coverage and maintaining coverage is consistent with the Servicing
Standard.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect
to the mortgage loans (other than the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans) and any related Serviced Companion Loan that either (x) require
the borrower to maintain “all-risk” property insurance (and do not expressly permit an exclusion for terrorism) or
(y) contain provisions generally requiring the applicable borrower to maintain insurance in types and against such risks as
the holder of such mortgage loan and any related Serviced Companion Loan reasonably requires from time to time in order to
protect its interests, the master servicer will be required to, consistent with the Servicing Standard, (A) monitor in accordance
with the Servicing Standard whether the insurance policies for the related Mortgaged Property contain exclusions in addition to
those customarily found in insurance policies on or prior to September 11, 2001 (“Additional Exclusions”),
(B) request the borrower to either purchase insurance against the risks specified in the Additional Exclusions or provide
an explanation as to its reasons for failing to purchase such insurance, and (C) notify the special servicer if it has knowledge
that any insurance policy contains Additional Exclusions or if it has knowledge that any borrower fails to purchase the insurance
requested to be purchased by the master servicer pursuant to clause (B) above. If the special servicer determines in accordance
with the Servicing Standard that such failure is not an Acceptable Insurance Default, the special servicer will be required to
notify the master servicer and the master servicer will be required to use efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to cause
such insurance to be maintained. If the special servicer determines that such failure is an Acceptable Insurance Default, it will
be required to promptly deliver such conclusions in writing to the 17g-5 Information Provider for posting to the 17g-5 Information
Provider’s website for those mortgage loans that (i) have one of the ten (10) highest outstanding principal balances
of the mortgage loans then included in the trust or (ii) comprise more than 5% of the outstanding principal balance of the
mortgage loans then included in the trust.
 
“Acceptable Insurance Default”
means, with respect to any mortgage loan (other than the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loans) or any Serviced Whole Loan, a default under
the related mortgage loan documents arising by reason of (i) any failure on the part of the related borrower to maintain with
respect to the related Mortgaged Property specific insurance coverage with respect to, or an all-risk casualty insurance policy
that does not specifically exclude, terrorist or similar acts, and/or (ii) any failure on the part of the related borrower
to maintain with respect to the related Mortgaged Property, insurance coverage with respect to damages or casualties caused by
terrorist or similar acts upon terms not materially less favorable than those in place as of the Closing Date, in each case, as
to which default the master servicer and the special servicer may forbear taking any enforcement action; provided that the
special servicer has determined in its reasonable judgment based on inquiry consistent with the Servicing Standard and, unless
a Control Event has occurred and is continuing, and other than with respect to an Excluded Loan, with the consent of the Directing
Certificateholder (and after a Control Event has occurred, but prior to the occurrence of a Consultation Termination Event, after
consultation with the Directing Certificateholder as provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement), that either (a) such
insurance is not available at commercially reasonable rates and that such hazards are not at the time commonly insured against
for properties similar to the related Mortgaged Property and located in or around the region in which such related Mortgaged Property
is located, or (b) such insurance is not available at any rate; provided, however, that the Directing Certificateholder
will not have more than 30 days to respond to the special servicer’s request for such consent or consultation; provided,
further, that upon the special servicer’s determination, consistent with the Servicing Standard, that exigent circumstances
do not allow the special servicer to consult with the Directing Certificateholder, the special servicer will not be required to
do so. Each of the master servicer (at its own expense) and the special servicer (at the expense of the trust) will be entitled
to rely on insurance consultants in making the determinations described above.
 
During the period that the special servicer
is evaluating the availability of such insurance, or waiting for a response from the Directing Certificateholder, neither the master
servicer nor the special servicer will be liable for any loss related to its failure to require the borrower to maintain such insurance
and neither will be in default of its obligations as a result of such failure.
 

S-351
 
 
The special servicer will be required to
maintain (or cause to be maintained), fire and hazard insurance on each REO Property (other than any REO Property with respect
to the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan), to the extent obtainable at commercially reasonable rates and the trustee has an insurable
interest, in an amount that is at least equal to the lesser of (1) the full replacement cost of the improvements on the REO
Property, and (2) the outstanding principal balance owing on the related mortgage loan and any related Companion Loan or
REO Loan, as applicable, and in any event, the amount necessary to avoid the operation of any co-insurance provisions. In addition,
if the REO Property is located in an area identified as a federally designated special flood hazard area, the special servicer
will be required to cause to be maintained, to the extent available at commercially reasonable rates (as determined by the special
servicer in accordance with the Servicing Standard), a flood insurance policy meeting the requirements of the current guidelines
of the Federal Insurance Administration in an amount representing coverage not less than the maximum amount of insurance that is
available under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended.
 
The Pooling and Servicing Agreement provides
that the master servicer may satisfy its obligation to cause each borrower to maintain a hazard insurance policy and the master
servicer or special servicer may satisfy their respective obligation to maintain hazard insurance by maintaining a blanket or master
single interest or force-placed policy insuring against hazard losses on the mortgage loans and REO Properties (other than the
Mortgaged Property securing a Non-Serviced Whole Loan), as applicable. Any losses incurred with respect to mortgage loans (and
any related Companion Loan) or REO Properties due to uninsured risks (including earthquakes, mudflows and floods) or insufficient
hazard insurance proceeds may adversely affect payments to Certificateholders. Any cost incurred by the master servicer or special
servicer in maintaining a hazard insurance policy, if the borrower defaults on its obligation to do so, will be advanced by the
master servicer as a Servicing Advance and will be charged to the related borrower. Generally, no borrower is required by the mortgage
loan documents to maintain earthquake insurance on any Mortgaged Property and the special servicer will not be required to maintain
earthquake insurance on any REO Properties. Any cost of maintaining that kind of required insurance or other earthquake insurance
obtained by the special servicer will be paid out of a segregated custodial account created and maintained by the special servicer
on behalf of the trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders (the “REO Account”) or advanced by the master
servicer as a Servicing Advance.
 
The costs of the insurance may be recovered
by the master servicer or the trustee, as the case may be, from reimbursements received from the borrower or, if the borrower does
not pay those amounts, as a Servicing Advance as set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. All costs and expenses incurred
by the special servicer in maintaining the insurance described above on REO Properties will be paid out of the related REO Account
or, if the amount in such account is insufficient, such costs and expenses will be advanced by the master servicer to the special
servicer as a Servicing Advance to the extent that such Servicing Advance is not determined to be a Nonrecoverable Advance.
 
No pool insurance policy, special hazard
insurance policy, bankruptcy bond, repurchase bond or certificate guarantee insurance will be maintained with respect to the mortgage
loans, nor will any mortgage loan be subject to FHA insurance.
 
Modifications, Waivers and
Amendments
 
Except as otherwise set forth in this paragraph,
the special servicer (or, with respect to certain non-material modifications, waivers and amendments that are not Special Servicer
Decisions or Major Decisions, the master servicer) may not waive, modify or amend (or consent to waive, modify or amend) any provision
of a mortgage loan and/or Serviced Companion Loan that is not in default or as to which default is not reasonably foreseeable
except for (1) the waiver of any due-on-sale clause or due-on-encumbrance clause to the extent permitted in the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and (2) any waiver, modification or amendment more than three months after the Closing Date
that would not be a “significant modification” of the mortgage loan within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(b).
The master servicer will not be permitted under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to agree to any modifications, waivers and
amendments that constitute Special Servicer Decisions or Major Decisions without the consent of the special servicer (which such
consent may be deemed received by the master servicer if the master servicer is processing such modification, waiver or amendment
and special servicer does not respond within ten (10) business days of delivery to the special servicer of the recommendation
 

S-352
 
 
and
analysis and all information reasonably requested by the special servicer in order to grant or withhold such consent, plus the
time provided to the Directing Certificateholder or other relevant party under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and, if applicable,
any time period provided to a holder of a Companion Loan under a related intercreditor agreement), except certain non-material
consents and waivers described in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and as permitted under the mortgage loan documents.
 
With respect to any non-Specially Serviced
Mortgage Loan except as set forth in the proviso immediately following this definition below, the master servicer will not
consent to, process or approve any request by a borrower with respect to any of the following, but will forward such request to
the special servicer for processing and evaluation (each a “Special Servicer Decision”):
 
(a)	  approving leases, lease
modifications or amendments or any requests for subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreements or other similar agreements
for (i) all ground leases, including any determination whether to cure any borrower defaults relating to any ground lease, and
(ii) all other leases in excess of the lesser of (y) 30,000 square feet and (z) 30% of the net rentable area at the related Mortgaged
Property so long as it is considered a “major lease” or otherwise reviewable by the lender under the related mortgage
loan documents;
 
(b)	  approving any waiver regarding
the receipt of financial statements (other than an immaterial timing waiver including late financial statements);
 
(c)	  approving annual budgets
for the related Mortgaged Property that provide for (i) operating expenses equal to more than 110% of the amount that was budgeted
therefor in the prior year or (ii) payments to affiliates of the related borrower (excluding affiliated managers paid at fee rates
agreed to at the origination of the related mortgage loan or Whole Loan);
 
(d)	  approving easements that
materially affect the use or value of a Mortgaged Property or the borrower’s ability to make payments with respect to the
related mortgage loan;
 
(e)	  agreeing to any modification,
waiver, consent or amendment of the related mortgage loan or Whole Loan in connection with a defeasance if such proposed modification,
waiver, consent or amendment is with respect to a (i) a waiver of a mortgage loan event of default, (ii) a modification of the
type of defeasance collateral required under the mortgage loan or Whole Loan documents such that defeasance collateral other than
direct, non-callable obligations of the United States would be permitted or (iii) a modification that would permit a principal
prepayment instead of defeasance if the applicable loan documents do not otherwise permit such principal prepayment; provided
that the foregoing is not otherwise a Major Decision;
 
(f)	   in circumstances where
no lender discretion is required other than confirming that the conditions in the related mortgage loan documents have been satisfied
(including determining whether any applicable terms or tests are satisfied), any request to incur additional debt in accordance
with the terms of the mortgage loan documents;
 
(g)	  any requests for the funding
or disbursement of amounts from any escrow accounts, reserve funds or letters of credit held as “performance”, “earn-out”
or “holdback” escrows or reserves, including the funding or disbursement of any such amounts with respect to any of
the mortgage loans secured by the Mortgaged Properties specifically identified in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, other than
routine and/or customary escrow and reserve fundings or disbursements for which the satisfaction of performance-related criteria
is not required pursuant to the terms of the related mortgage loan documents (for the avoidance of doubt, any request for the funding
or disbursement of ordinary course impounds, repair and replacement reserves, lender approved budget and operating expenses, and
tenant improvements pursuant to an approved lease, each in accordance with the mortgage loan documents or any other funding or
disbursement as mutually agreed upon by the master servicer and the special servicer, will not constitute a Special Servicer Decision);
 
(h)	  in circumstances where
no lender discretion is required other than confirming satisfaction of the applicable terms of the mortgage loan documents (including
determining whether any applicable
 

S-353
 
 
terms or tests are satisfied), processing requests for any release of collateral or any acceptance
of substitute or additional collateral for a mortgage loan; provided that, in any case, Special Servicer Decisions will
not include (i) grants of easements or rights of way that do not materially affect the use or value of the Mortgaged Property or
the borrower’s ability to make any payments with respect to the mortgage loan; (ii) the release, substitution or addition
of collateral securing any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Whole Loan in connection with a defeasance of such collateral; or
(iii) requests that are related to any condemnation action that is pending, or threatened in writing, and would affect a non-material
portion of the Mortgaged Property; provided that such release or substitution or addition of collateral is not a Major Decision;
and
 
(i)	   any modification, consent
to a modification or waiver of any material term of any intercreditor or similar agreement related to a Serviced Mortgage Loan
or Serviced Whole Loan, or any action to enforce rights with respect thereto.
 
provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing,
the master servicer and the special servicer may mutually agree as provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement that the master
servicer will process any of the foregoing matters (as well as any Major Decision) with respect to any non-Specially Serviced Mortgage
Loan. The master servicer and the special servicer will each be entitled to 50% of any fees paid in connection with a Special Servicer
Decision or Major Decision with respect to any non-Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan regardless of whether the master servicer or
the special servicer processes such Special Servicer Decision or Major Decision.
 
If, and only if, the special servicer determines
that a modification, waiver or amendment (including the forgiveness or deferral of interest or principal or the substitution or
release of collateral or the pledge of additional collateral) of the terms of a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan with respect
to which a payment default or other material default has occurred or a payment default or other material default is, in the special
servicer’s judgment, reasonably foreseeable, is reasonably likely to produce a greater recovery on a net present value basis
(the relevant discounting to be performed at the related Mortgage Rate) to the trust and, if applicable, the holders of any applicable
Companion Loan than liquidation of such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, then the special servicer may, but is not required
to, agree to a modification, waiver or amendment of the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, subject to (x) the restrictions
and limitations described below, (y) with respect to any mortgage loan, prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Control
Event, the approval of the Directing Certificateholder (or after the occurrence and continuance of a Control Event, but prior to
a Consultation Termination Event upon consultation with the Directing Certificateholder) as provided in the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement and described in this free writing prospectus, and (z) with respect to a Serviced Whole Loan, the rights of the
holder of the related Serviced Companion Loan to advise or consult with the special servicer with respect to, or consent to,
such modification, waiver or amendment, in each case, pursuant to the terms of the related intercreditor agreement and, with respect
to a mortgage loan that has mezzanine debt, the rights of the mezzanine lender to consent to such modification, waiver or amendment,
in each case, pursuant to the terms of the related intercreditor agreement.
 
In connection with (i) the release
of a Mortgaged Property (other than a Mortgaged Property securing the Non-Serviced Whole Loan) or any portion of a Mortgaged Property
from the lien of the related Mortgage or (ii) the taking of a Mortgaged Property or any portion of a Mortgaged Property by
exercise of the power of eminent domain or condemnation, if the mortgage loan documents require the master servicer or the special
servicer, as applicable, to calculate (or to approve the calculation of the related borrower of) the loan-to-value ratio of the
remaining Mortgaged Property or Mortgaged Properties or the fair market value of the real property constituting the remaining Mortgaged
Property or Mortgaged Properties, for purposes of REMIC qualification of the related mortgage loan, then such calculation will,
unless then permitted by the REMIC Provisions, exclude the value of personal property and going concern value, if any, as determined
by an appropriate third party.
 
With respect to non-Specially Serviced Mortgage
Loans except as set forth in the third sentence in this paragraph, the master servicer will not consent to, process or evaluate
any borrower request for a Major Decision or Special Servicer Decision but will refer such request to the special servicer. Generally,
the special servicer will process the request directly and make the determination whether or not to
 

S-354
 
 
consent to or approve such
request. However, if the master servicer and special servicer mutually agree that the master servicer will process such request,
the master servicer will prepare and submit its written analysis and recommendation to the special servicer with all information
reasonably available to the master servicer that the special servicer may reasonably request in order to withhold or grant its
consent, and in all cases the special servicer will be entitled (subject to the discussion under “—The Directing
Certificateholder” above and “Description of the Mortgage Pool—The Whole Loans” in this
free writing prospectus) to approve or disapprove any modification, waiver or amendment that constitutes such a Major Decision
or a Special Servicer Decision. In any case with respect to any Major Decision in connection with a non-Specially Serviced Loan,
each of the master servicer and the special servicer will be entitled to 50% of any related fee whether or not the master servicer
processes such request.
 
The special servicer is required to use
its reasonable efforts to the extent reasonably possible to fully amortize a modified mortgage loan prior to the Rated Final Distribution
Date. The special servicer may not agree to a modification, waiver or amendment of any term of any Specially Serviced Mortgage
Loan if that modification, waiver or amendment would:
 
(1)	  extend the maturity date
of the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan to a date occurring later than the earlier of (A) five years prior to the Rated
Final Distribution Date and (B) if the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan is secured solely or primarily by a leasehold
estate and not the related fee interest, the date occurring twenty years or, to the extent consistent with the Servicing Standard
giving due consideration to the remaining term of the ground lease and, other than with respect to an Excluded Loan and prior
to the occurrence and continuance of a Control Event, with the consent of the Directing Certificateholder, ten years, prior
to the end of the current term of the ground lease, plus any options to extend exercisable unilaterally by the borrower; or
 
(2)	  provide for the deferral
of interest unless interest accrues on the mortgage loan or the Serviced Whole Loans, generally, at the related Mortgage Rate.
 
In the event of a modification that creates
Mortgage Deferred Interest, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement will provide that the amount of deferred interest will be allocated
to reduce the Distributable Certificate Interest of the class or classes of certificates (other than the Class X-A, Class
X-B, Class X-C, Class X-D, Class R and Class Z certificates) with the latest sequential designation then outstanding,
and to the extent so allocated, will be added to the Certificate Balance of the class or classes.
 
If the special servicer gives notice of
any modification, waiver or amendment of any term of any mortgage loan (other than a Non-Serviced Whole Loan) or related Companion
Loan (or if such Companion Loan is in a securitization, the master servicer of such securitization on its behalf), the
special servicer will be required to notify the master servicer, the holder of any related Companion Loan, the senior trust advisor
(after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Control Event), the certificate administrator, the trustee, the Directing
Certificateholder (unless a Consultation Termination Event has occurred and other than with respect to an Excluded Loan), and the
17g-5 Information Provider, who will thereafter post any such notice to the 17g-5 Information Provider’s website. If the
master servicer gives notice of any modification, waiver or amendment of any term of any such mortgage loan or related Companion
Loan, the master servicer will be required to notify the certificate administrator, trustee, special servicer, the Directing Certificateholder
(unless a Consultation Termination Event has occurred and other than with respect to an Excluded Loan), the related mortgage loan
seller (so long as such mortgage loan seller is not a master servicer or sub-servicer of such mortgage loan or the Directing Certificateholder),
the holder of any related Companion Loan and the 17g-5 Information Provider, who will be required to thereafter post any such
notice to the 17g-5 Information Provider’s website. The party providing notice will be required to deliver to the custodian
for deposit in the related Mortgage File, an original counterpart of the agreement related to the modification, waiver or amendment,
promptly following the execution of that agreement, and if required, a copy to the master servicer and to the holder of any related
Companion Loan, all as set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Copies of each agreement whereby the modification, waiver
or amendment of any term of any mortgage loan is effected are required to be available for review during normal business hours
at the offices of the custodian. See “Description of the Certificates—Reports to Certificateholders; Certain Available
Information” in this free writing prospectus.
 

S-355
 
 
The modification, waiver or amendment of
a Serviced Whole Loan or a mortgage loan that has a related mezzanine loan will be subject to certain limitations set forth
in the related intercreditor agreement. See “Risk Factors—Additional Debt or the Ability To Incur Other Borrowings
Entails Risk” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Mortgage Loans with “Due-on-Sale”
and “Due-on-Encumbrance” Provisions
 
The special servicer will determine, in
a manner consistent with the Servicing Standard, whether (a) to exercise any right it may have with respect to a mortgage
loan and any related Companion Loan containing a “due-on-sale” clause (1) to accelerate the payments on that mortgage
loan and any related Companion Loan, as applicable, or (2) to withhold its consent to any sale or transfer, consistent with the
Servicing Standard or (b) to waive its right to exercise such rights; provided, however, (i) that with respect to such waiver
of rights prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Control Event, the special servicer has obtained the prior written consent
(or deemed consent) of the Directing Certificateholder, if applicable, and (ii) with respect to any mortgage loan (x) with a Stated
Principal Balance greater than or equal to $20,000,000, (y) with a Stated Principal Balance greater than or equal to 5% of the
aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the mortgage loans then outstanding, or (z) together with all other mortgage loans with which
it is cross collateralized or cross-defaulted or together with all other mortgage loans with the same or an affiliated borrower,
that is one of the ten largest mortgage loans outstanding (by Stated Principal Balance), a Rating Agency Confirmation is received
by the master servicer or the special servicer, as the case may be, from each Rating Agency and a confirmation of any applicable
rating agency that such action will not result in the downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of its then-current ratings of any
class of securities backed, wholly or partially, by any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (if any); provided, however,
that with respect to clauses (y) and (z) of this paragraph, such mortgage loan will also be required to have a Stated Principal
Balance of at least $10,000,000 for such Rating Agency Confirmation requirement to apply.
 
With respect to a mortgage loan (other than
a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and related Companion Loan with a “due-on-encumbrance” clause, the special servicer
will determine, in a manner consistent with the Servicing Standard, whether (a) to exercise any right it may have with respect
to a mortgage loan containing a “due-on-encumbrance” clause (1) to accelerate the payments thereon, or (2) to withhold
its consent to the creation of any additional lien or other encumbrance, consistent with the Servicing Standard or (b) to waive
its right to exercise such rights, provided, however, (i) that, with respect to such waiver of rights, prior to the occurrence
and continuance of a Control Event, and other than with respect to an Excluded Loan, the special servicer has obtained the consent
of the Directing Certificateholder (or after the occurrence and continuance of a Control Event, but prior to a Consultation Termination
Event, upon consultation with the Directing Certificateholder) and (ii) with respect to any mortgage loan (x) with a Stated Principal
Balance greater than or equal to $20,000,000, (y) with a Stated Principal Balance greater than or equal to 5% of the aggregate
Stated Principal Balance of the mortgage loans then outstanding, or (z) together with all other mortgage loans with which it is
cross collateralized or cross-defaulted or together with all other mortgage loans with the same or an affiliated borrower, that
is one of the ten largest mortgage loans outstanding (by Stated Principal Balance), a Rating Agency Confirmation is received by
the master servicer or the special servicer, as the case may be, from each Rating Agency and a confirmation of any applicable rating
agency that such action will not result in the downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of its then-current ratings of any class
of securities backed, wholly or partially, by any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (if any); provided, however, that with
respect to clauses (y) and (z) of this paragraph, such mortgage loan will also be required to have a Stated Principal Balance of
at least $10,000,000 for such Rating Agency Confirmation requirement to apply.
 
Any modification, extension, waiver or amendment
of the payment terms of the Non-Serviced Whole Loan will be required to be structured so as to be consistent with the Servicing
Standard and the allocation and payment priorities in the related loan documents and the related intercreditor agreement, such
that neither the trust as holder of such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan nor any holder of the related Companion Loan gains
a priority over the other holder that is not reflected in the related loan documents and the related intercreditor agreement.
 

S-356
 
 
Realization Upon Defaulted
Mortgage Loans
 
Within 30 days after a Defaulted Mortgage
Loan has become a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, the special servicer will be required to order an appraisal of the related
Mortgaged Property (which will not be required to be received within that 30-day period) and, not more than 30 days after receipt
of such appraisal, determine the fair value of the related mortgage loan in accordance with the Servicing Standard. The special
servicer will be permitted to change, from time to time thereafter, its determination of the fair value of a mortgage loan in default
based upon changed circumstances, new information or otherwise, in accordance with the Servicing Standard. The special servicer
will promptly notify the master servicer in writing of the initial fair value determination and any adjustment to its fair value
determination. “Defaulted Mortgage Loan” means a mortgage loan (i) that is delinquent at least sixty (60)
days in respect of its Periodic Payments or more than thirty (30) days (or sixty (60) days with respect to the circumstances described
under clause (1) of the definition of Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan) delinquent in respect of its balloon payment, if any,
in either case such delinquency to be determined without giving effect to any grace period permitted by the related mortgage or
mortgage note and without regard to any acceleration of payments under the related mortgage and mortgage note or (ii) as to
which the master servicer or special servicer has, by written notice to the related mortgagor, accelerated the maturity of the
indebtedness evidenced by the related Mortgage Note.
 
The Pooling and Servicing Agreement will
provide that the special servicer may offer to sell to any person any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan (to the extent consistent
with the term of any related intercreditor agreement) or may offer to purchase any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, if and when
the special servicer determines, consistent with the Servicing Standard, that no satisfactory arrangements (including by way of
a discounted pay-off) can be made for collection of delinquent payments thereon and such a sale would be in the best economic interests
of the trust on a net present value basis. The special servicer is required to give the trustee not less than five days prior written
notice of its intention to sell any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, in which case the special servicer is required to accept
the highest offer received from any person for any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan in an amount at least equal to par plus
accrued interest plus all other outstanding amounts due under such mortgage loan (or REO Loan) or, if applicable, Serviced Whole
Loan and any outstanding expenses of the trust relating to such mortgage loan (the “Mortgage Loan Repurchase
Price”) or, at its option, if it has received no offer at least equal to the Mortgage Loan Repurchase Price therefor,
purchase the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan at such Mortgage Loan Repurchase Price.
 
In the absence of any such offer (or purchase
by the special servicer) (and, in the case of any Whole Loan, subject to certain additional conditions set forth in the related
intercreditor agreement), the special servicer will accept the highest offer received from any person that is determined by the
special servicer to be a fair price for such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, if the highest offeror is a person other than the
depositor, the master servicer, the special servicer, the certificate administrator, the trustee, the senior trust advisor, any
borrower, any manager of a Mortgaged Property, any independent contractor engaged by the special servicer, a holder of any related
Companion Loan (in connection with offers related to any Serviced Whole Loan), a holder of a related mezzanine loan (except
to the extent described below), or any known affiliate of any of them (any such person, an “Interested Person”).
The trustee (based upon, among other things, updated independent appraisals ordered by the special servicer (or ordered by the
trustee if the special servicer or any of its affiliates is the Interested Person) and received by the trustee (the cost of which
will be a Servicing Advance by the master servicer)), is required to determine the fair price for the Specially Serviced Mortgage
Loan if the highest offeror is an Interested Person. Any such determination by the trustee will be binding on all parties.
The reasonable cost of such independent appraisal will be an expense of the offering Interested Person and the special servicer
will use efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to collect payment from such Interested Person. If such expense is not
paid by the applicable Interested Person within 30 days of demand for payment, such expense will be reimbursable to the trustee
by the master servicer as a Servicing Advance, but the special servicer will continue to use efforts consistent with the Servicing
Standard to collect such amounts from the applicable Interested Person. If the trustee is required to determine whether a cash
offer by an Interested Person constitutes a fair price, the trustee may (at its option) designate an independent third party expert
in real estate or commercial mortgage loan matters with at least 5 years’ experience in valuing or investing in
 

S-357
 
 
loans similar
to the subject mortgage loan, that has been selected with reasonable care by the trustee to determine if such cash offer constitutes
a fair price for such mortgage loan. The trustee will be required to act in a commercially reasonable manner in making such determination.
If the trustee designates such a third party to make such determination, the trustee will be entitled to rely conclusively upon
such third party’s determination. The reasonable fees of and the costs of all appraisals, inspection reports and broker opinions
of value incurred by any such third party will be covered by, and will be required to be reimbursable from the offering Interested
Person and the special servicer will use efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to collect payment from such Interested
Person. If such expense is not paid by the applicable Interested Person within 30 days of demand for payment, such expense will
be reimbursable to the trustee by the master servicer as a Servicing Advance but the special servicer will continue to use efforts
consistent with the Servicing Standard to collect such amounts from the applicable Interested Person. Neither the trustee, in its
individual capacity, nor any of its affiliates may make an offer for or purchase any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan.
 
The Pooling and Servicing Agreement will
not obligate the special servicer to accept the highest offer if the special servicer determines, in accordance with the Servicing
Standard, that rejection of such offer would be in the best interests of the holders of certificates and, with respect to a Serviced
Whole Loan, any related holder of a Companion Loan, as a collective whole (taking into account the pari passu nature of
any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan). In addition, the special servicer may accept a lower offer if it determines, in accordance
with the Servicing Standard, that acceptance of such offer would be in the best interests of the holders of certificates and, with
respect to a Serviced Whole Loan, any related holder of a Companion Loan, as a collective whole (taking into account the pari
passu nature of any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) (for example, if the prospective buyer making the lower offer is more
likely to perform its obligations, or the terms offered by the prospective buyer making the lower offer are more favorable); provided
that the offeror is not the special servicer or a person affiliated with the special servicer. The special servicer is required
to use reasonable efforts to sell all Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans prior to the Rated Final Distribution Date.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect
to each mortgage loan (other than the Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) with a related mezzanine loan, the sale by the special servicer
of any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan is subject to the rights of the holder of the related mezzanine debt to exercise its
option to purchase the related mortgage loan or REO Property, as applicable, following a default as described under the related
intercreditor agreement (and such purchase price is subject to the terms of such intercreditor agreement). See “Description
of the Mortgage Pool—Additional Debt—Mezzanine Debt” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the related intercreditor
agreement, if a Serviced Mortgage Loan becomes a Defaulted Mortgage Loan, and if the special servicer determines to sell the related
Serviced Mortgage Loan that has become a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan in accordance with the terms described above, then the
special servicer will be required to sell the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan together with the related Serviced Mortgage
Loan as one whole loan and will be required to require that all offers be submitted to the special servicer in writing (together
with any refundable deposit required under the related intercreditor agreement, if applicable). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the special servicer will not be permitted to sell such Serviced Pari Passu Whole Loan if it becomes a defaulted Whole Loan without
the written consent of the holder of the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (or if such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan
is included in a securitization, then prior to a control event under such securitization, with the consent of the related directing
certificateholder) (provided that such consent is not required if the holder of 50% or more of such Serviced Pari Passu
Companion Loan is the borrower or an affiliate of the borrower) unless the special servicer has delivered to the holder of such
Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (or, in the event such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan has been securitized, to the applicable
master servicer of such other securitization): (a) at least 15 business days prior written notice of any decision to attempt
to sell the related Serviced Pari Passu Whole Loan; (b) at least 10 days prior to the permitted sale date, a copy of each
bid package (together with any material amendments to such bid packages) received by the special servicer in connection with any
such proposed sale; (c) at least 10 days prior to the proposed sale date, a copy of the most recent appraisal for such Serviced
Pari Passu Whole Loan, and any documents in the servicing file reasonably requested by
 

S-358
 
 
the holder of a Serviced Pari Passu Companion
Loan that are material to the sale price of such Serviced Whole Loan; and (d) until the sale is completed, and a reasonable
period of time (but no less time than is afforded to other offerors and the Directing Certificateholder) prior to the proposed
sale date, all information and other documents being provided to other offerors and all leases or other documents that are approved
by the master servicer or the special servicer in connection with the proposed sale; provided that with respect to a Serviced
Pari Passu Whole Loan, the holder of such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan may waive any of the delivery or timing requirements
set forth in this sentence. The holder of a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (or its representative) will be permitted to submit
an offer at any sale of the related Serviced Pari Passu Whole Loan; however, the mortgagor and its agents and affiliates will not
be permitted to submit an offer at such sale. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—The Whole Loans—The First
National Building Whole Loan—Sale of Defaulted Serviced Pari Passu Whole Loan”, “—The Eastmont Town
Center Whole Loan—Sale of Defaulted Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan”, “—The Hyatt Place Texas Portfolio
Whole Loan—Sale of Defaulted Serviced Pari Passu Whole Loan” and “—The New Center One Building
Whole Loan—Sale of Defaulted Serviced Pari Passu Whole Loan” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the related intercreditor
agreement, if any Non-Serviced Whole Loan becomes a defaulted mortgage loan, and if the related special servicer under the applicable
Non-Serviced PSA determines to sell the related Pari Passu Companion Loan that has become a specially serviced mortgage loan in
accordance with the applicable Non-Serviced PSA, then the related special servicer will be required to sell the related Non-Serviced
Mortgage Loan together with the related Pari Passu Companion Loan (and with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan, including
the related Subordinate Companion Loan) as one whole loan. In connection with any such sale, the related special servicer will
be required to follow procedures substantially similar to those described above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the related special
servicer under the applicable Non-Serviced PSA will not be permitted to sell the related Non-Serviced Whole Loan (other than the
U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan) if it becomes a defaulted mortgage loan without the written consent of the Directing Certificateholder
(prior to the occurrence and continuance of a Control Event (provided that such consent is not required if such party is
the borrower or an affiliate of the borrower)) unless the related special servicer under such Non-Serviced PSA has delivered to
the special servicer under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, who will forward to the Directing Certificateholder: (a) at
least 15 business days prior written notice of any decision to attempt to sell such Non-Serviced Whole Loan; (b) at least
10 days prior to the permitted sale date, a copy of each bid package (together with any material amendments to such bid packages)
received by the related special servicer in connection with any such proposed sale; (c) at least 10 days prior to the proposed
sale date, a copy of the most recent appraisal for such Non-Serviced Whole Loan, and any documents in the servicing file reasonably
requested by the holder of the related mortgage loan that are material to the sale price of such Non-Serviced Whole Loan; and (d) until
the sale is completed, and a reasonable period of time (but no less time than is afforded to other offerors) prior to the proposed
sale date, all information and other documents being provided to other offerors and all leases or other documents that are approved
by the related master servicer or the related special servicer in connection with the proposed sale; provided that the special
servicer for this securitization may (with the consent of the Directing Certificateholder prior to the occurrence and continuance
of a Control Event) in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement waive any of the delivery or timing requirements set

If title to any Mortgaged Property is acquired
by the trust fund, the special servicer, on behalf of the trust fund (and the holder of any related Companion Loan, if applicable),
will be required to sell the Mortgaged Property prior to the close of the third calendar year beginning after the year of acquisition,
unless (1) the IRS grants or has not denied an extension of time to sell the property or (2) the trustee, the certificate
administrator and the master servicer receive an opinion of independent counsel to the effect that the holding of the property
by the trust fund longer than the above-referenced three year period will not result in the imposition of a tax on any Trust REMIC
or cause the trust fund (or cause any Trust REMIC) to fail to qualify as a REMIC under the Code at any time that any certificate
is outstanding. Subject to the foregoing and any other tax-related limitations, pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
the special servicer will generally be required to attempt to sell any Mortgaged Property so acquired on the same terms and conditions
it would if it were the owner. The special servicer will also be
 

S-359
 
 
required to ensure that any Mortgaged Property acquired by the
trust fund is administered so that it constitutes “foreclosure property” within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8)
of the Code at all times and that the sale of the property does not result in the receipt by the trust fund or the holder of any
Companion Loan of any “income from non-permitted assets” as described in Section 860F(a)(2)(B) of the Code, endanger
the status of any Trust REMIC, or result in the imposition of a tax upon any Trust REMIC or the trust fund (including but not limited
to the tax on “prohibited transactions” as defined in Section 860F(a)(2) of the Code and the tax on contributions
to a REMIC set forth in Section 860G(d) of the Code, but not including the tax on “net income from foreclosure
property” as defined in Section 860G(c)(2) of the Code). If the trust fund acquires title to any Mortgaged Property,
the special servicer, on behalf of the trust fund, will retain, at the expense of the trust fund, an independent contractor to
manage and operate the property. The independent contractor generally will be permitted to perform construction (including renovation)
on a foreclosed property only if the construction was more than 10% completed before default on the related mortgage loan became
imminent. The retention of an independent contractor, however, will not relieve the special servicer of its obligation to manage
the Mortgaged Property as required under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
Generally, no Trust REMIC will be taxable
on income received with respect to a Mortgaged Property acquired by the trust fund to the extent that it constitutes “rents
from real property,” within the meaning of Section 856(d) of the Code and Treasury regulations under the Code.
Rents from real property include fixed rents and rents based on the receipts or sales of a tenant but do not include the portion
of any rental based on the net income or profit of any tenant or sub-tenant. No determination has been made whether rent on any
of the Mortgaged Properties meets this requirement. Rents from real property include charges for services customarily furnished
or rendered in connection with the rental of real property, whether or not the charges are separately stated. Services furnished
to the tenants of a particular building will be considered as customary if, in the geographic market in which the building is located,
tenants in buildings that are of similar class are customarily provided with the service. No determination has been made whether
the services furnished to the tenants of the Mortgaged Properties are “customary” within the meaning of applicable
regulations. It is therefore possible that a portion of the rental income with respect to a Mortgaged Property owned by the trust
fund would not constitute rents from real property, or that none of such income would qualify if a separate charge is not stated
for such non-customary services or they are not performed by an independent contractor. Rents from real property also do not include
income from the operation of a trade or business on the Mortgaged Property, such as a hotel, or rental income attributable to personal
property leased in connection with a lease of real property if the rent attributable to that personal property exceeds 15% of the
total rent at the related mortgaged property for the taxable year. Any of the foregoing types of income may instead constitute
“net income from foreclosure property,” which would be taxable to the Lower-Tier REMIC at the highest marginal federal
corporate rate (currently 35%) and may also be subject to state or local taxes. The Pooling and Servicing Agreement provides that
the special servicer will be permitted to cause a Trust REMIC to earn “net income from foreclosure property” that is
subject to tax if it determines that the net after-tax benefit to Certificateholders is greater than another method of operating
or net leasing the Mortgaged Property. Because these sources of income, if they exist, are already in place with respect to the
Mortgaged Properties, it is generally viewed as beneficial to Certificateholders to permit the trust fund to continue to earn them
if it acquires a Mortgaged Property, even at the cost of this tax. These taxes would be chargeable against the related income for
purposes of determining the proceeds available for distribution to holders of certificates. See “Material Federal Income
Tax Consequences—Federal Income Tax Consequences for REMIC Certificates—Mark to Market Regulations—Taxes That
May Be Imposed on the REMIC Pool” in the prospectus.
 
To the extent that Liquidation Proceeds
collected with respect to any mortgage loan are less than the sum of: (1) the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage
loan, (2) interest accrued on the mortgage loan and (3) the aggregate amount of expenses reimbursable to the master servicer,
the special servicer, the certificate administrator, the senior trust advisor or the trustee or paid out of the trust fund that
were not reimbursed by the related borrower (including any unpaid servicing compensation, unreimbursed Servicing Advances and unpaid
and accrued interest on all Advances and additional trust fund expenses) incurred with respect to the mortgage loan, the trust
fund will realize a loss in the amount of the shortfall. The trustee, the certificate administrator, the master servicer, the special
servicer and/or the senior trust
 

S-360
 
 
advisor will be entitled to reimbursement out of the Liquidation Proceeds recovered on any mortgage
loan, prior to the distribution of those Liquidation Proceeds to Certificateholders, of any and all amounts that represent unpaid
servicing compensation in respect of the related mortgage loan, certain unreimbursed expenses incurred with respect to the mortgage
loan and any unreimbursed Advances (including interest thereon) made with respect to the mortgage loan. In addition, amounts otherwise
distributable on the certificates will be further reduced by interest payable to the master servicer, the special servicer or the
trustee on these Advances.
 
If any Mortgaged Property suffers damage
and the proceeds, if any, of the related hazard insurance policy are insufficient to restore fully the damaged property, the master
servicer will not be required to advance the funds to effect the restoration unless (1) the special servicer determines that
the restoration will increase the proceeds to Certificateholders on liquidation of the mortgage loan after reimbursement of the
special servicer or the master servicer, as the case may be, for its expenses and (2) the master servicer has not determined
that the advance would be a Nonrecoverable Advance.
 
Servicing of the Civic Opera
Building Mortgage Loan
 
The Civic Opera Building Mortgage Loan (the
“2015-C31 Serviced Mortgage Loan” and the related Whole Loan, the “2015-C31 Serviced Whole Loan”),
is being serviced under the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Accordingly, the JPMBB 2015-C31 Master Servicer will
generally make servicing advances and remit collections on the 2015-C31 Serviced Mortgage Loan to or on behalf of the trust for
this securitization. However, the master servicer for this securitization will generally be obligated to compile reports that include
information on the 2015-C31 Serviced Mortgage Loan and, to the extent required by the Servicing Standard, to enforce the rights
of the trust as the holder for this securitization of the 2015-C31 Serviced Mortgage Loan under the terms of the related intercreditor
agreement and make P&I Advances with respect to the 2015-C31 Serviced Mortgage Loan, subject to any non-recoverability determination.
The servicing arrangements under the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing Agreement differ in certain respects from the servicing
arrangements under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Below are certain provisions in the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing
Agreement for your consideration:
 

·The master servicer, the special servicer, the certificate administrator, senior trust advisor and the trustee under the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement will have no obligation or authority to (a) supervise or consent to the actions of the JPMBB 2015-C31
Master Servicer, the JPMBB 2015-C31 Special Servicer, or any of the trustee, certificate administrator or senior trust advisor
under the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing Agreement or (b) make Servicing Advances with respect to the 2015-C31 Serviced
Mortgage Loan. The obligation of the master servicer for this securitization to provide information and collections and make P&I
Advances to the certificate administrator for the benefit of the Certificateholders with respect to the 2015-C31 Serviced Mortgage
Loan is dependent on its receipt of the corresponding information and/or collections from the JPMBB 2015-C31 Master Servicer or
the JPMBB 2015-C31 Special Servicer.
 

·Pursuant to the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the liquidation fee, the special servicing fee and the workout
fee with respect to the 2015-C31 Serviced Mortgage Loan will be generally similar to the corresponding fee payable under the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement, although the special servicing fee on a loan-by-loan basis will be equal to a per annum rate of
0.25000% for the related month.
 

·The master servicer for this securitization will be required to make P&I Advances with respect to the 2015-C31 Serviced
Mortgage Loan, unless it has determined that such Advance would not be recoverable from collections on the related mortgage loan.
 

·The JPMBB 2015-C31 Master Servicer is obligated to make servicing advances with respect to the 2015-C31 Serviced Whole Loan.
If the JPMBB 2015-C31 Master Servicer determines that a servicing advance it made with respect to the 2015-C31 Serviced Whole Loan
or the related Mortgaged Property is nonrecoverable, it will be entitled to be reimbursed first from collections on, 
 

S-361
 
 

and proceeds
of, the related mortgage loan and the related Pari Passu Companion Loan, on a pro rata basis (based on such loan’s
outstanding principal balance), and then from general collections on the mortgage loans in the trust established under the JPMBB
2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the trust established under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement for this transaction.
 

·With respect to the 2015-C31 Serviced Mortgage Loan, prior to the occurrence and continuance of any control event under the
JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the JPMBB 2015-C31 Directing Certificateholder will have the right to terminate
the JPMBB 2015-C31 Special Servicer for cause or without cause at any time.
 

·In addition, with respect to the 2015-C31 Serviced Mortgage Loan, following the occurrence of a consultation termination event
under the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, if the senior trust advisor under the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing
Agreement determines that the JPMBB 2015-C31 Special Servicer is not performing its duties under the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and
Servicing Agreement or is otherwise not acting in accordance with the related servicing standard, the senior trust advisor under
the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing Agreement will have the right to recommend the replacement of the JPMBB 2015-C31 Special
Servicer.
 

·If the 2015-C31 Serviced Mortgage Loan becomes a defaulted mortgage loan, the JPMBB 2015-C31 Special Servicer will be required
to take actions that are substantially similar to the actions described under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Realization
Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans” in this free writing prospectus.
 

·The rating agencies rating the securities issued under the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing Agreement may vary from the
rating agencies rating the certificates, which may cause servicing arrangements (including, but not limited to, servicer termination
events) to be different under the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing Agreement than under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 

·With respect to the 2015-C31 Serviced Mortgage Loans, the servicing provisions relating to performing inspections and collecting
operating information are substantially similar to those of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 

·The provisions of the JPMBB 2015-C31 Pooling and Servicing Agreement may also vary from the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
with respect to time period and timing matters, terminology, allocation of ministerial duties between multiple servicers or other
service providers, servicer termination events, notice or rating agency communication and confirmation requirements.
 
The JPMBB 2015-C31 Master Servicer and JPMBB
2015-C31 Special Servicer (a) have substantially similar rights related to resignation and (b) are subject to servicer
termination events substantially similar to those in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, as well as the rights related thereto.
 
Servicing of the U-Haul Portfolio
Mortgage Loan
 
The U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan, which includes
the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan and any related REO Properties, is being serviced and administered under the U-Haul Portfolio
Trust and Servicing Agreement. Accordingly, the U-Haul Portfolio Master Servicer (or, if it fails to do so, the trustee under the
U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement (the “U-Haul Portfolio Trustee”)) will generally make servicing
advances, unless it is determined in accordance with the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement that such servicing advance
would not be recoverable from related collections. However, no such party will make a P&I advance with respect to the U-Haul
Portfolio Mortgage Loan. The U-Haul Portfolio Master Servicer will generally also remit collections on the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage
Loan to or on behalf of the trust for this securitization. However, the master servicer for this securitization will generally
be obligated to compile reports that include information on the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan, and, to the extent required by
the Servicing Standard, to enforce the rights of the trust as the holder for
 

S-362
 
 
this securitization of the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage
Loan under the terms of the related intercreditor agreement and make P&I Advances with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage
Loan, subject to any non-recoverability determination. The U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement both address similar servicing matters, including, but not limited to: collection of payments; establishment of accounts
to hold such payments; investment of funds in those accounts; maintenance of insurance coverage on the mortgaged properties; enforcement
of due-on-sale and du-on-encumbrance provisions; property inspections; collection of operating statements; loan assumptions; realization
upon and sale of defaulted mortgage loans; acquisition, operation, maintenance and disposition of REO properties; servicing compensation;
modifications, waivers, amendments and consents with respect to the serviced mortgage loans; servicing reports; servicer liability
and indemnification; servicer resignation, servicer termination events; and the ability of certain parties to terminate a particular
servicer in connection with a servicer termination event or otherwise. Nonetheless, the servicing arrangements under the U-Haul
Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement are expected to differ in certain respects from the servicing arrangements under the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement. For example, the provisions of the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement and the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement differ with respect to, among other things, time periods and timing matters, terminology, allocation of duties
between multiple servicers and other service providers, the specifics of particular servicer termination events, notices to and
communications with applicable rating agencies and rating confirmation requirements. Below are certain matters regarding the servicing
of the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan for your consideration:
 

·The master servicer, the special servicer, the certificate administrator, senior trust advisor and the trustee under the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement will have no obligation or authority to (a) supervise or consent to the actions of the U-Haul Portfolio
Master Servicer, the U-Haul Portfolio Special Servicer, the U-Haul Portfolio Trustee or the certificate administrator under the
U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement or (b) make Servicing Advances with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan.
The obligation of the master servicer for this securitization to provide information and collections and make P&I Advances
to the certificate administrator for the benefit of the Certificateholders with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan is
dependent on its receipt of the corresponding information and/or collections from either of the U-Haul Portfolio Servicers.
 

·The U-Haul Portfolio Master Servicer will earn a servicing fee with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan at 0.00250%
per annum.
 

·Pursuant to the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement, the liquidation fee, the special servicing fee and the workout
fee with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan will be generally similar to the corresponding fee payable under the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement, except that (i) the liquidation fee and the workout fee payable under the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing
Agreement each has a fixed fee rate of 0.50% and neither is subject to a $25,000 minimum fee and (ii) the special servicing fee
payable under the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement is not subject to a $3,500 per month minimum.
 

·The U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement vary as regards the extent to which
late payment charges, default interest, modification fees, assumption fees, consent fees, defeasance fees and other ancillary fees
are allocated to (i) cover or offset expenses, (ii) pay master servicing compensation and (iii) pay special servicing compensation,
and it is unlikely that any such items will be passed through to the trust for this securitization transaction.
 

·Servicing advances with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan are reimbursable out of related collections, together with
interest thereon at a prime rate. If the U-Haul Portfolio Master Servicer determines that a servicing advance it made with respect
to the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan or the related Mortgaged Property is nonrecoverable, it will be entitled to be reimbursed first
from collections on, and proceeds of, the related mortgage loan and the related Companion Loans, on a pro rata basis (based
on each such loan’s outstanding principal balance), and then 
 

S-363
 
 

from general collections on the mortgage loans in the trust
established under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement for this transaction with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan’s
pro rata portion.
 

·The U-Haul Portfolio Master Servicer is generally responsible for servicing and administration of the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage
Loan prior to the curing of, and after the correction of, any special servicing loan event with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio
Mortgage Loan, and the U-Haul Portfolio Special Servicer is generally responsible for the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan while
a special servicing loan event exists with respect thereto or if the related Mortgaged Properties become REO Properties. However,
the consent of the U-Haul Portfolio Special Servicer (subject to the rights of the U-Haul Portfolio Directing Certificateholder)
is generally required for all major decisions with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan even if no special servicing loan
event exists with respect thereto. The major decisions and special servicing loan events under the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing
Agreement vary, in some respects, from Major Decisions and servicing transfer events under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 

·Major decisions under the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement include any of the following actions:
 

oany proposed or actual foreclosure upon or comparable conversion (which may include acquisitions of a foreclosed property by
deed in lieu of foreclosure) of the ownership of the properties if the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan comes into and continues in
default;
 

oany amendment or modification, consent to a modification or waiver of a monetary term (other than penalty charges, but including
the timing of payments and acceptance of discounted payoffs) or material non-monetary term of the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan or
any extension of the maturity date thereof;
 

ofollowing a default or an event of default under the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement, any exercise of remedies,
including any acceleration of the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan or initiation of judicial, bankruptcy or similar proceedings under
the related whole loan documents;
 

oany sale of the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan if it is a defaulted loan for less than the repurchase price set forth in the U-Haul
Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement or any sale of any foreclosed property;
 

oany determination to bring any foreclosed property into compliance with applicable environmental laws or to otherwise address
hazardous materials located at a property or foreclosed property;
 

oany release of collateral or any acceptance of substitute or additional collateral for the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan or any
consent to either of the foregoing, unless required or permitted pursuant to the specific terms of the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan
and for which there is no material lender discretion;
 

oany waiver of a “due-on-sale” or “due-on-encumbrance” clause with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio Whole
Loan or, if lender consent is required, any consent to such waiver or consent to a transfer of a property or interests in the borrowers,
other than any such transfer or incurrence of debt as may be effected without the consent of the lender under the related whole
loan documents;
 

oany incurrence of additional debt by the borrowers or of any mezzanine financing by any beneficial owner of the borrowers (to
the extent that the lender has consent rights pursuant to the related whole loan documents (for purposes of the determination whether
a lender has such consent rights pursuant to the related whole loan documents, any provision in the related whole loan documents
that requires that an intercreditor 
 

S-364
 
 

 agreement be reasonably or otherwise acceptable to the lender will constitute such consent
rights));
 

oany material modification, waiver or amendment of the U-Haul Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement, co-lender agreement, participation
agreement or similar agreement with any mezzanine lender or subordinate debt holder related to the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan,
or an action to enforce rights with respect thereto or decision not to enforce such rights;
 

oany franchise changes (with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan, if the lender is required to consent or approve under
the related whole loan documents) or any material property management company changes, including approval of the termination of
a manager and appointment of a new property manager;
 

oreleases of any escrow accounts, reserve accounts or letters of credit held as performance escrows or reserves, other than
those required pursuant to the specific terms of the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan and for which there is no material lender discretion;
 

oany requests for the funding or disbursement of “performance,” “earn-out,” holdback or similar escrows
and reserves (including those evidenced by letters of credit) if, with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan, escrows and
reserves (i) exceed, at the related origination date, in the aggregate, 10% of the initial principal balance of the U-Haul Portfolio
Whole Loan (regardless of whether such funding or disbursement may be characterized as routine and/or customary and regardless
of whether the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan has a primary servicer other than the U-Haul Portfolio Master Servicer) or (ii) are
not routine and/or customary escrow and reserve fundings or disbursements;
 

oany acceptance of an assumption agreement or any other agreement permitting a transfer of interests in the borrowers, guarantor
or other obligor, or releasing the borrowers, guarantor or other obligor from liability under the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan,
or modifying any of the borrowers, guarantor or other obligor’s monetary liability under the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan,
other than pursuant to the specific terms thereof and for which there is no lender discretion;
 

oany determination of an acceptable insurance default under the related whole loan documents;
 

othe determination of any use of proceeds of a hazard insurance claim to restore a property if the amount of such proceeds exceeds
the applicable restoration threshold in the related whole loan documents;
 

othe modification, waiver, amendment, execution, termination or renewal of any lease, to the extent lender approval is required
under the related whole loan documents and if such lease constitutes a “major lease” under the related whole loan documents,
including entering into any related subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement, subject to any deemed approval expressly
set forth in the related lease;
 

oany adoption or implementation of a budget for a property submitted by the borrowers with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio Whole
Loan (to the extent lender approval is required under the related whole loan documents), if (a) the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan
is on the CREFC® servicer watch list or (b) such budget includes material (more than 25%) increases in operating expenses or
payments to entities actually known by the servicer to be affiliates of the borrowers (excluding affiliated managers paid at fee
rates agreed to at the origination of the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan), subject in each case to any deemed approval expressly set
forth in the related whole loan documents;
 

S-365
 
 

othe voting on any plan of reorganization, restructuring or similar plan in the bankruptcy of a borrower; and
 

othe exercise of the rights and powers granted under the U-Haul Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement or any related mezzanine loan
intercreditor agreement to the holder of the U-Haul Portfolio Companion A-2A Note, the “Senior Lender” or such other
similar term as may be set forth in any such agreement, as applicable, and/or the “Servicer” referred to therein, if
and to the extent such rights or powers affect the priority, payments, consent rights, or security interest with respect to the
holder of U-Haul Portfolio Companion A-2A Note, the “Senior Lender” or such other similar term.
 

·The U-Haul Portfolio Trustee will be the mortgagee of record with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan.
 

·The custodian under the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement will generally be responsible for holding the loan documents
with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan (other than the original promissory note for the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan
and any allonges thereto). However, from time to time to the extent necessary for the servicing and administration of the U-Haul
Portfolio Whole Loan, related loan documents will be released to either of the U-Haul Portfolio Servicers.
 

·With respect to the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan, prior to the occurrence and continuance of any control event under the
U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement, the U-Haul Portfolio Directing Certificateholder will have the right to terminate
the U-Haul Portfolio Special Servicer at any time with or without cause.
 

·In addition, with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan, after the occurrence and during the continuance of any control
event under the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement, at the written direction of holders of principal balance certificates
under the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement evidencing not less than 25% of the voting rights of such certificates
(taking into account the application of any appraisal reduction amounts to notionally reduce the certificate balances of those
certificates), a request can be made to vote to terminate the U-Haul Portfolio Special Servicer and appoint a successor U-Haul
Portfolio Special Servicer. The termination and replacement of the U-Haul Portfolio Special Servicer will occur if the holders
of the applicable U-Haul Portfolio certificates evidencing the requisite U-Haul Portfolio voting rights vote within 180 days to
approve that termination and replacement.
 

·The U-Haul Portfolio Directing Certificateholder is comparable to the Directing Certificateholder and will have similar rights
to those of the Directing Certificateholder. Among other things, provided that a control event does not exist under the U-Haul
Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement, the U-Haul Portfolio Directing Certificateholder will (subject to a servicing standard
override on the part of the U-Haul Portfolio Special Servicer) have approval rights over U-Haul Portfolio major decisions (which
include, among other things, foreclosure upon or comparable conversion of ownership of mortgaged properties, various loan modifications,
waivers and consents and defaulted loan sales for less than par) and asset status reports. If a control event exists, but a consultation
termination event has not occurred, under the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement, then the U-Haul Portfolio Directing
Certificateholder will have consultation rights with respect to U-Haul Portfolio major decisions.
 

·If the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan is subject to special servicing, then (subject to, if and when applicable, the consent/consultation
rights of the U-Haul Portfolio Directing Certificateholder) the U-Haul Portfolio Special Servicer may agree to modify, waive or
amend any term of such Whole Loan if such modification, waiver or amendment (i) is consistent with the related servicing standard,
(ii) would not (A) cause any REMIC created under the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement to fail to qualify as a REMIC
or (B) constitute a “significant modification” of the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan pursuant to Treasury Regulations
Section 1.860G-2(b) (and the 
 

S-366
 
 

U-Haul Portfolio Master Servicer or the U-Haul Portfolio Special Servicer, as applicable, may
obtain and be entitled to rely upon an opinion of counsel in connection with such determination). However, the U-Haul Portfolio
Special Servicer may not extend the maturity date of the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan beyond the date that is seven years prior
to the distribution date in September 2042 under the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement.
 

·Each of the U-Haul Portfolio Master Servicer and the U-Haul Portfolio Special Servicer may resign and assign its rights and
delegate its duties and obligations under the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement; provided that certain conditions
are satisfied including obtaining a rating agency confirmation. The resigning U-Haul Portfolio Master Servicer or U-Haul Portfolio
Special Servicer, as applicable, must pay all costs and expenses associated with the transfer of its duties after resignation.
The U-Haul Portfolio Master Servicer or the U-Haul Portfolio Special Servicer, as the case may be, may not otherwise resign from
its obligations and duties under the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement, except upon the determination that performance
of its duties is no longer permissible under applicable law or are in material conflict by reason of applicable law with any other
activities carried on by it. No such resignation will become effective until the U-Haul Portfolio Trustee or a successor master
servicer or a successor special servicer, as the case may be, has assumed the obligations of the U-Haul Portfolio Master Servicer
or the U-Haul Portfolio Special Servicer, as applicable, under the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement.
 

·Each of the U-Haul Portfolio Master Servicer and the U-Haul Portfolio Special Servicer will be liable in accordance with the
U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement only to the extent of its obligations specifically imposed by that agreement. Accordingly,
in general, each of the U-Haul Portfolio Master Servicer and the U-Haul Portfolio Special Servicer will not be liable for any action
taken, or for refraining from the taking of any action, in good faith pursuant to the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement
(including actions taken or not taken at the direction of the U-Haul Portfolio Directing Certificateholder) or for errors in judgment;
provided that neither such party will be protected against any breach of representations or warranties made by it in the
U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement or against any liability which would otherwise be imposed by reason of willful misconduct,
bad faith or negligence in the performance of duties or by reason of negligent disregard of obligations and duties under the U-Haul
Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement.
 

·The U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement provides that each of the U-Haul Portfolio Master Servicer and U-Haul Portfolio
Special Servicer (and, in each case, certain related persons) will be entitled to indemnification for all losses, liabilities and
expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with any legal action or other claims, losses, penalties,
fines, foreclosures, judgments or liabilities relating to the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement, the U-Haul Portfolio
Whole Loan, the U-Haul Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement, the related Mortgaged Property or the U-Haul Portfolio certificates (other
than any loss, liability or expense incurred by such party by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance
of duties or by reason of negligent disregard of obligations and duties under the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement).
The U-Haul Portfolio Intercreditor Agreement requires that the Pooling and Servicing Agreement provide that any related master
servicer, special servicer, certificate administrator, trustee or depositor under the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement
and any director, officer, employee or agent of any of them will be entitled to indemnification by the trust fund for this securitization
transaction and held harmless against such trust fund’s pro rata share of any loss, liability, claim, cost or expense incurred
in connection with the servicing and administration of the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan or any related Mortgaged Property.
 
Servicing of the One Shell
Square Mortgage Loan and the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan
 
Each of the One Shell Square Mortgage Loan
and the Brunswick Portfolio Mortgage Loan (each a “2015-C30 Serviced Mortgage Loan” and each related Whole Loan,
a “2015-C30 Serviced Whole Loan”),
 

S-367
 
 
is being serviced under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
Accordingly, the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer will generally make servicing advances and remit collections on each 2015-C30 Serviced
Mortgage Loan to or on behalf of the trust for this securitization. However, the master servicer for this securitization will generally
be obligated to compile reports that include information on each 2015-C30 Serviced Mortgage Loan and, to the extent required by
the Servicing Standard, to enforce the rights of the trust as the holder for this securitization of each 2015-C30 Serviced Mortgage
Loan under the terms of the related intercreditor agreement and make P&I Advances with respect to each 2015-C30 Serviced Mortgage
Loan, subject to any non-recoverability determination. The servicing arrangements under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing
Agreement differ in certain respects from the servicing arrangements under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Below are certain
provisions in the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement for your consideration:
 

·The master servicer, the special servicer, the certificate administrator, senior trust advisor and the trustee under the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement will have no obligation or authority to (a) supervise or consent to the actions of the JPMBB 2015-C30
Master Servicer, the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer, or any of the trustee, certificate administrator or senior trust advisor
under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement or (b) make Servicing Advances with respect to any 2015-C30 Serviced
Mortgage Loan. The obligation of the master servicer for this securitization to provide information and collections and make P&I
Advances to the certificate administrator for the benefit of the Certificateholders with respect to each 2015-C30 Serviced Mortgage
Loan is dependent on its receipt of the corresponding information and/or collections from the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer or
the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer.
 

·Pursuant to the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the liquidation fee, the special servicing fee and the workout
fee with respect to each 2015-C30 Serviced Mortgage Loan will be generally similar to the corresponding fee payable under the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement, although the special servicing fee on a loan-by-loan basis will be equal to the greater of a per annum
rate of 0.25000% and the per annum rate that would result in a special servicing fee of $3,500 for the related month.
 

·The master servicer for this securitization will be required to make P&I Advances with respect to each 2015-C30 Serviced
Mortgage Loan, unless it has determined that such Advance would not be recoverable from collections on the related mortgage loan.
 

·The JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer is obligated to make servicing advances with respect to each 2015-C30 Serviced Whole Loan.
If the JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer determines that a servicing advance it made with respect to any 2015-C30 Serviced Whole Loan
or the related Mortgaged Property is nonrecoverable, it will be entitled to be reimbursed first from collections on, and proceeds
of, the related mortgage loan and the related Pari Passu Companion Loan, on a pro rata basis (based on such loan’s
outstanding principal balance), and then from general collections on the mortgage loans in the trust established under the JPMBB
2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the trust established under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement for this transaction.
 

·With respect to each 2015-C30 Serviced Mortgage Loan, prior to the occurrence and continuance of any control event under the
JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the JPMBB 2015-C30 Directing Certificateholder will have the right to terminate
the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer for cause or without cause at any time.
 

·In addition, with respect to each 2015-C30 Serviced Mortgage Loan, following the occurrence of a consultation termination event
under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement, if the senior trust advisor under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing
Agreement determines that the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer is not performing its duties under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement or is otherwise not acting in accordance with the related servicing standard, the senior trust advisor under
the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and

 

S-368
 
 


Servicing Agreement will have the right to recommend the replacement of the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special
Servicer.
 

·If a 2015-C30 Serviced Mortgage Loan becomes a defaulted mortgage loan, the JPMBB 2015-C30 Special Servicer will be required
to take actions that are substantially similar to the actions described under “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Realization
Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans” in this free writing prospectus.
 

·The rating agencies rating the securities issued under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement may vary from the
rating agencies rating the certificates, which may cause servicing arrangements (including, but not limited to, servicer termination
events) to be different under the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement than under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 

·With respect to the 2015-C30 Serviced Mortgage Loans, the servicing provisions relating to performing inspections and collecting
operating information are substantially similar to those of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 

·The provisions of the JPMBB 2015-C30 Pooling and Servicing Agreement may also vary from the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
with respect to time period and timing matters, terminology, allocation of ministerial duties between multiple servicers or other
service providers, servicer termination events, notice or rating agency communication and confirmation requirements.
 
The JPMBB 2015-C30 Master Servicer and JPMBB
2015-C30 Special Servicer (a) have substantially similar rights related to resignation and (b) are subject to servicer
termination events substantially similar to those in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, as well as the rights related thereto.
 
Inspections; Collection of
Operating Information
 
The master servicer will be required to
perform (at its own expense) or cause to be performed (at its own expense), physical inspections of each Mortgaged Property relating
to a mortgage loan (other than the Mortgaged Property securing any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, which is subject to inspection pursuant
to the applicable Non-Serviced PSA, and other than a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan) with a Stated Principal Balance of (A) $2,000,000
or more at least once every 12 months and (B) less than $2,000,000 at least once every 24 months, in each case commencing
in the calendar year 2016 unless a physical inspection has been performed by the special servicer within the previous 12 months
and the master servicer has no knowledge of a material change in the Mortgaged Property since such physical inspection; provided,
further, however, that if any scheduled payment becomes more than 60 days delinquent on the related mortgage loan,
the special servicer is required to inspect or cause to be inspected the related Mortgaged Property as soon as practicable after
the mortgage loan becomes a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and annually thereafter for so long as the mortgage loan remains a
Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan (the cost of which inspection, to the extent not paid by the related borrower, will be reimbursed
first from default interest and late charges constituting additional compensation of the special servicer on the related
mortgage loan (but with respect to a Serviced Whole Loan, only amounts available for such purpose under the related intercreditor
agreement) and then from the Certificate Account as an expense of the trust fund, and in the case of a Serviced Whole Loan,
as an expense of the holders of the related Serviced Mortgage Loan and Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, pro rata and
pari passu, to the extent provided in the related intercreditor agreement. The special servicer or the master servicer,
as applicable, will be required to prepare or cause to be prepared a written report of the inspection describing, among other things,
the condition of and any damage to the Mortgaged Property to the extent evident from the inspection and specifying the existence
of any vacancies in the Mortgaged Property of which it has knowledge and deems material, of any sale, transfer or abandonment of
the Mortgaged Property of which it has knowledge or that is evident from the inspection, of any adverse change in the condition
of the Mortgaged Property of which the preparer of such report has knowledge or that is evident from the inspection, and that the
preparer of such report
 

S-369
 
 
deems material, or of any material waste committed on the Mortgaged Property to the extent evident from
the inspection.
 
With respect to each mortgage loan that
requires the borrower to deliver Operating Statements, the special servicer or the master servicer, as applicable, is also required
to use reasonable efforts to collect and (beginning with calendar year end 2016) review the annual Operating Statements of the
related Mortgaged Property. Most of the mortgage loan documents obligate the related borrower to deliver annual property Operating
Statements. However, we cannot assure you that any Operating Statements required to be delivered will in fact be delivered, nor
is the special servicer or the master servicer likely to have any practical means of compelling the delivery in the case of an
otherwise performing mortgage loan.
 
Copies of the inspection reports referred
to above that are delivered to the certificate administrator will be posted to the certificate administrator’s website for
review by Privileged Persons pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. See “Description of the Certificates—Reports
to Certificateholders; Certain Available Information” in this free writing prospectus.
 
Certain Matters Regarding
the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Senior Trust Advisor and the Depositor
 
The Pooling and Servicing Agreement permits
the master servicer and the special servicer to resign from their respective obligations only upon (a) the appointment of,
and the acceptance of the appointment by, a successor and receipt by the certificate administrator and the trustee of a Rating
Agency Confirmation from each of the Rating Agencies and confirmation of the applicable rating agencies that such action will not
result in the downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of its then-current ratings of any securities related to a Serviced Companion
Loan (provided that such rating agency confirmation may be considered satisfied in the same manner as any Rating Agency
Confirmation may be considered satisfied with respect to the certificates as described in this free writing prospectus); and, as
to the special servicer only, for so long as a Control Event has not occurred and is not continuing, the approval of such successor
by the Directing Certificateholder, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or (b) a determination that their respective
obligations are no longer permissible with respect to the master servicer or the special servicer, as the case may be, under applicable
law. No resignation will become effective until the trustee or other successor has assumed the obligations and duties of the resigning
master servicer or special servicer, as the case may be, under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Further, the resigning master
servicer or special servicer, as the case may be, must pay all costs and expenses associated with the transfer of its duties. Other
than as described under “—Servicer Termination Events” below, in no event will the master servicer or
the special servicer have the right to appoint any successor master servicer or special servicer if such master servicer or special
servicer, as applicable, is terminated or removed pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
The Pooling and Servicing Agreement will
provide that none of the master servicer (including in its capacity as the companion paying agent), the special servicer, the depositor,
the senior trust advisor or any partner, shareholder, member, manager, director, officer, employee or agent of any of them will
be under any liability to the trust fund, Certificateholders or holders of the related Companion Loan for any action taken, or
not taken, in good faith pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or for errors in judgment; provided, however, that
none of the master servicer (including in its capacity as the companion paying agent), the special servicer, the depositor, the
senior trust advisor or similar person will be protected against any breach of a representation or warranty made by such party,
as applicable, in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any liability that would otherwise be imposed by reason of willful misconduct,
bad faith or negligence in the performance of obligations or duties under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or by reason of negligent
disregard of such obligations and duties. The Pooling and Servicing Agreement will also provide that the master servicer (including
in its capacity as the companion paying agent), the special servicer, the depositor, the senior trust advisor and their respective
affiliates and any partner, shareholder, member, manager, director, officer, employee or agent of any of them will be entitled
to indemnification by the trust against any claims, losses, penalties, fines, forfeitures, reasonable legal fees and related costs,
judgments, and other costs, liabilities, fees and expenses
 

S-370
 
 
incurred in connection with any legal action or claim that relates to
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the mortgage loans, any related Companion Loan or the certificates; provided, however,
that the indemnification will not extend to any loss, liability or expense incurred in connection with any breach of a representation
or warranty made by such party, as applicable, in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or incurred by reason of willful misconduct,
bad faith or negligence in the performance of obligations or duties under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, by reason of negligent
disregard of such party’s obligations or duties, or in the case of the depositor and any of its partners, shareholders, directors,
officers, members, managers, employees and agents, any violation by any of them of any state or federal securities law. In addition,
absent actual fraud (as determined by a final non-appealable court order), neither the trustee nor the certificate administrator
will be liable for special, punitive, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited
to lost profits), even if the trustee or the certificate administrator has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage
and regardless of the form of action. The Pooling and Servicing Agreement will also provide that any related master servicer, depositor,
special servicer, certificate administrator, senior trust advisor or trustee under any Non-Serviced PSA with respect to a Non-Serviced
Companion Loan and any partner, director, officer, shareholder, member, manager, employee or agent of any of them and the related
non-serviced trust fund will be entitled to indemnification by the trust fund and held harmless against the trust’s pro
rata share of any claim, loss, damage, penalty, fine, forfeiture, reasonable legal fees and related costs, judgments and any
other cost, liability, fees and expenses incurred in connection with servicing and administration of the related Non-Serviced Mortgage
Loan and the related non-serviced mortgaged property (or with respect to the senior trust advisor under the related Non-Serviced
PSA, incurred in connection with the provision of services for the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) under the applicable Non-Serviced
PSA or the Pooling and Servicing Agreement; provided, however, that such indemnification will not extend to any loss, liability
or expense incurred by reason of willful misconduct, bad faith, fraud or negligence on the part of the related master servicer,
depositor, special servicer, senior trust advisor or trustee under such Non-Serviced PSA in the performance of obligations or duties
or by reason of negligent disregard of obligations or duties under such Non-Serviced PSA or the related intercreditor agreement.
 
In addition, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
will provide that none of the master servicer (including in its capacity as the companion paying agent), the special servicer,
the depositor or senior trust advisor will be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal action that is not
incidental to its respective responsibilities under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or that in its opinion may involve it in
any expense or liability not reimbursed by the trust. However, each of the master servicer, the special servicer, the depositor
and the senior trust advisor will be permitted, in the exercise of its discretion, to undertake any action that it may deem necessary
or desirable with respect to the enforcement and/or protection of the rights and duties of the parties to the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement and the interests of the Certificateholders (and, in the case of a Serviced Whole Loan, the rights of the Certificateholders
and the holders of the related Serviced Companion Loan (as a collective whole), taking into account the pari passu nature
of such Serviced Companion Loan) under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement; provided, however, that if a Serviced Whole
Loan and/or the holder of the related Companion Loan are involved, such expenses, costs and liabilities will be payable out of
funds related to such Serviced Whole Loan in accordance with the related intercreditor agreement and will also be payable out of
the other funds in the Certificate Account if amounts on deposit with respect to such Serviced Whole Loan are insufficient therefor.
If any such expenses, costs or liabilities relate to a mortgage loan or Companion Loan, then any subsequent recovery on that mortgage
loan or Companion Loan, as applicable, will be used to reimburse the trust for any amounts advanced for the payment of such expenses,
costs or liabilities. In that event, the legal expenses and costs of the action, and any liability resulting from the action, will
be expenses, costs and liabilities of the trust fund, and the master servicer (including in its capacity as the companion paying
agent), the special servicer, the depositor, or the senior trust advisor, as the case may be, will be entitled to be reimbursed
out of the Certificate Account for the expenses.
 
Pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
the master servicer and the special servicer will each be required to maintain a fidelity bond and errors and omissions policy
or their equivalent that provides coverage against losses that may be sustained as a result of an officer’s or employee’s
 

S-371
 
 
misappropriation of funds or errors and omissions, subject to certain limitations as to amount of coverage, deductible amounts,
conditions, exclusions and exceptions permitted by the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the master
servicer and the special servicer will be allowed to self-insure with respect to an errors and omission policy and a fidelity bond
so long as certain conditions set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement are met.
 
Any person into which the master servicer,
the special servicer, the depositor or senior trust advisor may be merged or consolidated, or any person resulting from any merger
or consolidation to which the master servicer, the special servicer, the depositor or senior trust advisor is a party, or any person
succeeding to the business of the master servicer, the special servicer, the depositor or senior trust advisor, will be the successor
of the master servicer, the special servicer, the depositor or senior trust advisor, as the case may be, under the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement. The master servicer, the special servicer and the senior trust advisor may have other normal business relationships
with the depositor or the depositor’s affiliates.
 
Unless and until the special servicer liquidates
a mortgage loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) following a default with respect to such mortgage loan, the special servicer
will be required to pursue such other resolution strategies available under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, including, without
limitation, workout, sale and foreclosure, consistent with the Servicing Standard and any applicable REMIC Provisions.
 
In connection with the master servicer and
the special servicer’s duties, all net present value calculations and determinations made under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement with respect to a mortgage loan, Serviced Companion Loan, Mortgaged Property or REO Property (including for purposes
of the definition of “Servicing Standard”) will be made using a discount rate appropriate for the type of cash flows
being discounted; namely (i) for principal and interest payments on a mortgage loan or Serviced Companion Loan, as applicable,
or a sale of a mortgage loan by the special servicer, the higher of (1) the rate determined by the master servicer or special
servicer, as applicable, that approximates the market rate that would be obtainable by the borrower on non-defaulted debt of such
borrower as of such date of determination and (2) the Mortgage Rate on the applicable mortgage loan or Serviced Companion
Loan based on its outstanding principal balance and (ii) for all other cash flows, including property cash flow, the “discount
rate” set forth in the most recent appraisal (or update of such appraisal) of the related Mortgaged Property.
 
The Pooling and Servicing Agreement will
provide that if with respect to any mortgage loan (or Serviced Whole Loan) the related mortgage loan documents permit the lender
to (but do not require the lender to), at its option, prior to an event of default under the related mortgage loan (or Serviced
Whole Loan), apply amounts held in any reserve account as a prepayment or hold such amounts in a reserve account, the master servicer
or special servicer, as applicable, may not apply such amounts as a prepayment, and will instead continue to hold such amounts
in the applicable reserve account, unless not applying those amounts as a prepayment would be a violation of the Servicing Standard.
Such amount may be used, if permitted under the mortgage loan documents, to defease the loan, or may be used to prepay the mortgage
loan (or Serviced Whole Loan), or for other purpose consistent with the Servicing Standard and the mortgage loan documents, upon
a subsequent default.
 
Rating Agency Confirmations
 
The Pooling and Servicing Agreement will
provide that, notwithstanding the terms of the related mortgage loan documents or other provisions of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, if any action under such mortgage loan documents or the Pooling and Servicing Agreement requires a Rating Agency Confirmation
from each of the Rating Agencies as a condition precedent to such action, if the party (the “Requesting Party”)
required to obtain such Rating Agency Confirmations has made a request to any Rating Agency for such Rating Agency Confirmation
and, within 10 business days of such request being posted to the 17g-5 Information Provider’s website, such Rating Agency
has not replied to such request or has responded in a manner that indicates that such Rating Agency is neither reviewing such request
nor waiving the requirement for Rating Agency Confirmation, then such Requesting Party will be required
 

S-372
 
 
to confirm (through direct
communication and not by posting any confirmation on the 17g-5 Information Provider’s website) that the applicable Rating
Agency has received the Rating Agency Confirmation request, and, if it has, promptly request the related Rating Agency Confirmation
again. The circumstances described in the preceding sentence are referred to in this free writing prospectus as a “RAC
No-Response Scenario”.
 
If there is no response to either such Rating
Agency Confirmation request within 5 business days of such second request in a RAC No-Response Scenario or if such Rating Agency
has responded in a manner that indicates such Rating Agency is neither reviewing such request nor waiving the requirement for Rating
Agency Confirmation, then (x) with respect to any condition in any mortgage loan document requiring such Rating Agency Confirmation,
or with respect to any other matter under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement relating to the servicing of the mortgage loans (other
than as set forth in clause (y) below), the requirement to obtain a Rating Agency Confirmation will be deemed not to apply
(as if such requirement did not exist) with respect to such Rating Agency, and the master servicer or the special servicer, as
the case may be, may then take such action if the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, confirms its original
determination (made prior to making such request) that taking the action with respect to which it requested the Rating Agency Confirmation
would still be consistent with the Servicing Standard, and (y) with respect to a replacement of the master servicer or special
servicer, such condition will be deemed not to apply (as if such requirement did not exist) if (i) Moody’s has not cited
servicing concerns of the applicable replacement as the sole or material factor in such rating action or any qualification, downgrade
or withdrawal of the ratings (or placement on “watch status” in contemplation of a ratings downgrade or withdrawal)
of securities in a transaction serviced by the applicable master servicer or special servicer prior to the time of determination,
if Moody’s is the non-responding Rating Agency, (ii) the applicable replacement master servicer or special servicer is rated
at least “CMS3” (in the case of the master servicer) or “CSS3” (in the case of the special servicer), if
Fitch is the non-responding Rating Agency, (iii) DBRS has not cited servicing concerns of the applicable replacement master servicer
or special servicer as the sole or material factor in any qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings (or placement on
“watch status” in contemplation of a ratings downgrade or withdrawal) of securities in any other commercial mortgage-backed
securitization transaction serviced by the applicable master servicer or special servicer prior to the time of determination, if
DBRS is the non-responding Rating Agency or (iv) KBRA has not cited servicing concerns of the applicable replacement master
servicer or special servicer as the sole or material factor in any qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings (or placement
on “watch status” in contemplation of a ratings downgrade or withdrawal) of securities in any other commercial mortgage-backed
securitization serviced by the applicable master servicer or special servicer prior to the time of determination, if KBRA is the
non-responding Rating Agency. Promptly following the master servicer’s or special servicer’s determination to take
any action discussed above following any requirement to obtain Rating Agency Confirmation being deemed not to apply (as if such
requirement did not exist) as described in clause (x) above, the master servicer or special servicer will be required to provide
electronic written notice to the 17g-5 Information Provider, who will promptly post such notice to the 17g-5 Information Provider’s
website pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, of the action taken.
 
For all other matters or actions not specifically
discussed above, the applicable Requesting Party will be required to obtain a Rating Agency Confirmation from each of the Rating
Agencies. In the event an action otherwise requires a Rating Agency Confirmation from each of the Rating Agencies, in absence of
such Rating Agency Confirmation, we cannot assure you that any Rating Agency will not downgrade, qualify or withdraw its ratings
as a result of any such action taken by the master servicer or the special servicer in accordance with the procedures discussed
above.
 
As used above, “Rating Agency Confirmation”
means, with respect to any matter, confirmation in writing by each applicable Rating Agency that a proposed action, failure to
act or other event specified in this free writing prospectus will not in and of itself result in the downgrade, withdrawal or qualification
of the then-current rating assigned to any class of certificates (if then rated by the Rating Agency); provided that a written
waiver or acknowledgment from the Rating Agency indicating its decision not to review the matter for which the Rating Agency Confirmation
is sought will be deemed to satisfy the requirement for the Rating Agency Confirmation from the Rating Agency with respect to such
matter.
 

S-373
 
 
Any Rating Agency Confirmation requests
made by the master servicer, special servicer, certificate administrator, or trustee, as applicable, pursuant to the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, will be required to be made in writing, which writing must contain a cover page indicating the nature of the
Rating Agency Confirmation request, and must contain all back-up material necessary for the Rating Agency to process such request.
Such written Rating Agency Confirmation requests must be provided in electronic format to the 17g-5 Information Provider (who will
be required to post such request on the 17g-5 Information Provider’s website in accordance with the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement).
 
The master servicer, the special servicer,
the certificate administrator and the trustee will be permitted (but not obligated) to orally communicate with the Rating Agencies
regarding any of the mortgage loan documents or any matter related to the mortgage loans, the related Mortgaged Properties, the
related borrowers or any other matters relating to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any related intercreditor agreement;
provided that such party summarizes the information provided to the Rating Agencies in such communication in writing and
provides the 17g-5 Information Provider with such written summary the same day such communication takes place; provided
that the summary of such oral communications will not identify with which Rating Agency the communication was. The 17g-5 Information
Provider will be required to post such written summary on the 17g-5 Information Provider’s website in accordance with the
provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. All other information required to be delivered to the Rating Agencies pursuant
to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or requested by the Rating Agencies, will first be provided in electronic format to the
17g-5 Information Provider, who will be required to post such information to the 17g-5 Information Provider’s website in
accordance with the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and thereafter be delivered by the applicable party to the Rating Agencies
in accordance with the delivery instructions set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The senior trust advisor will have
no obligation or authority to communicate directly with the Rating Agencies, but may deliver required information to the Rating
Agencies to the extent set forth in this free writing prospectus.
 
The Pooling and Servicing Agreement will
provide that the Pooling and Servicing Agreement may be amended to change the procedures regarding compliance with Rule 17g-5
without any Certificateholder consent; provided that notice of any such amendment must be provided to the 17g-5 Information
Provider (who will post such notice to the 17g-5 Information Provider’s website) and to the certificate administrator (which
will post such report to the certificate administrator’s website).
 
To the extent required under the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement, in the event a rating agency confirmation is required by the applicable rating agencies that any action
under any mortgage loan documents or the Pooling and Servicing Agreement will not result in the downgrade, withdrawal or qualification
of any such rating agency’s then-current ratings of any securities related to a Companion Loan, then such rating agency confirmation
may be considered satisfied in the same manner as described above with respect to any Rating Agency Confirmation from a Rating
Agency.
 
Evidence as to Compliance
 
Each of the master servicer, the special
servicer (regardless of whether the special servicer has commenced special servicing of a mortgage loan), the custodian, the trustee
and the certificate administrator will be required to furnish (and each such party will be required, with respect to each servicing
function participant with which it has entered into a servicing relationship with respect to the mortgage loans, to cause (or,
in the case of a sub-servicer that a mortgage loan seller requires the master servicer to retain, to use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause) such servicing function participant to furnish) to the depositor, the certificate administrator, the trustee
and the 17g-5 Information Provider, an officer’s certificate of the officer responsible for the servicing activities of such
party stating, among other things, that (i) a review of that party’s activities during the preceding calendar year or
portion of that year and of performance under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any sub-servicing agreement in the case of
an additional master servicer or special servicer, as applicable, has been made under such officer’s supervision and (ii) to
the best of such officer’s knowledge, based on the review, such party has fulfilled all of its obligations under the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement or the sub-servicing agreement in the case of an additional master servicer or special servicer, as applicable,
in all material
 

S-374
 
 
respects throughout the preceding calendar year or portion of such year, or, if there has been a failure to fulfill
any such obligation in any material respect, specifying each such failure known to such officer and the nature and status of the
failure.
 
In addition, each of the master servicer,
the special servicer (regardless of whether the special servicer has commenced special servicing of the mortgage loan), the trustee,
the custodian, the certificate administrator and the senior trust advisor will be required to furnish (and each such party will
be required, with respect to each servicing function participant with which it has entered into a servicing relationship with respect
to the mortgage loans, to cause (or, in the case of a sub-servicer that a mortgage loan seller requires the master servicer to
retain, to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause) such servicing function participant to furnish) to the trustee, the certificate
administrator, the 17g-5 Information Provider and the depositor (and, with respect to the special servicer, also to the senior
trust advisor) a report (an “Assessment of Compliance”) assessing compliance by that party with the servicing
criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB (as described below) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act”) that contains the following:
 

·a statement of the party’s responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122

Rights Upon Servicer Termination
Event
 
If a Servicer Termination Event occurs with
respect to the master servicer or the special servicer under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, then, so long as the Servicer
Termination Event remains unremedied, the depositor or the trustee will be authorized, and at the written direction of Certificateholders
entitled to not less than 25% of the Voting Rights or, for so long as a Control Event has not occurred and is not continuing, the
Directing Certificateholder (solely with respect to the special servicer and other than with respect to an Excluded Loan), the
trustee will be required to terminate all of the rights and obligations of the defaulting party as master servicer or the special
servicer, as the case may be (other than certain rights in respect of indemnification and certain items of servicing compensation),
under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The trustee will then succeed to all of the responsibilities, duties and liabilities
of the defaulting party as master servicer or special servicer, as the case may be, under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and
will be entitled to similar compensation arrangements. If the trustee is unwilling or unable to so act, it may (or, at the written
request of Certificateholders entitled to not less than 25% of the Voting Rights, or, for so long as a Control Event has not occurred
and is not continuing and other than with respect to an Excluded Loan, the Directing Certificateholder, it will be required to)
appoint, or petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, a loan servicing institution or other entity that would not
result in the downgrade, qualification or withdrawal of the then-current ratings assigned to any class of Offered Certificates
by any Rating Agency to act as successor to the master servicer or special servicer, as the case may be, under the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement and, for so long as a Control Event has not occurred and is not continuing, that has been approved by the Directing
Certificateholder, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld.
 
In addition, the depositor may direct the
trustee to terminate each of the master servicer or the special servicer, as applicable, upon five business days’ written
notice if there is a Servicer Termination Event under clause (c)(i) above.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in the section described above, if a Servicer Termination Event on the part of the special servicer remains unremedied
and affects the holder of a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, and the special servicer has not otherwise been terminated, the
holder of such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (or, if applicable, the related trustee, acting at the direction of the related
directing certificateholder (or similar entity)) will be entitled to direct the trustee (and, upon receipt of that direction, the
trustee will be required) to terminate the special servicer solely with respect to the related Serviced Pari Passu Whole Loan.
The appointment (or replacement) of a special servicer with respect to a Serviced Whole Loan will in any event be subject to Rating
Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency. A replacement special servicer will be selected by the trustee or, prior to a Consultation
Termination Event, by the Directing Certificateholder; provided, however, that any successor special servicer appointed
to replace the special servicer with respect to a Serviced Mortgage Loan cannot at any time be the person (or an affiliate of such
person) that was terminated at the direction of the holder of the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, without the prior
written consent of such holder of the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan.
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in the section described above, if a servicer termination event on the part of the special servicer under any Non-Serviced
PSA entered into in connection with the securitization of any Non-Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (each such special servicer,
a “Non-Serviced Special Servicer”) remains unremedied and affects the holder of such Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan,
and the related Non-Serviced Special Servicer has not otherwise been terminated, the trustee, acting at the direction of the Directing
Certificateholder, will be entitled to direct the trustee under such Non-Serviced PSA (the “Non-Serviced Trustee”)
to terminate the related Non-Serviced Special Servicer solely with respect to such Non-Serviced Whole Loan. The appointment (or
replacement) of any such Non-Serviced Special Servicer with respect to such Non-Serviced Whole Loan will in any event be subject
to Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency. Such replacement special servicer will be selected by the related Non-Serviced
Trustee or, prior to a consultation termination event under the related Non-Serviced PSA, by the related directing certificateholder
(or similar entity); provided, however, that any successor Non-Serviced Special Servicer appointed to replace the terminated
Non-Serviced Special Servicer with respect to a Non-Serviced Whole
 

S-377
 
 
Loan cannot at any time be the person (or its affiliate) that
was terminated at the direction of the holder of the related Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, without the prior written consent of the
Directing Certificateholder.
 
In addition, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in the section described above, if the master servicer receives notice of termination solely due to a Servicer
Termination Event described in clauses (f) or (g) under “—Servicer Termination Events”
above, and prior to being replaced as described in the second preceding paragraph, the master servicer will have 45 days after
receipt of the notice of termination to find, and sell its rights and obligations to, a successor master servicer that meets the
requirements of a master servicer under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement; provided that the Rating Agencies have each
provided a Rating Agency Confirmation. The termination of the master servicer will be effective when such successor master servicer
has succeeded the terminated master servicer, as successor master servicer and such successor master servicer has assumed the terminated
master servicer’s servicing obligations and responsibilities under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. If a successor has
not entered into the Pooling and Servicing Agreement as successor master servicer within 45 days after notice of the termination
of the master servicer, the master servicer will be replaced by the trustee as described above.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) if any
Servicer Termination Event on the part of the master servicer affects a Serviced Companion Loan, the related holder of a Serviced
Companion Loan or the rating on any class of certificates backed, wholly or partially, by any Serviced Companion Loan, and if the
master servicer is not otherwise terminated, or (2) if a Servicer Termination Event on the part of the master servicer affects
only a Serviced Companion Loan, the related holder of a Serviced Companion Loan or the rating on any class of certificates backed,
wholly or partially, by any Serviced Companion Loan, then the master servicer may not be terminated by or at the direction of the
related holder of such Serviced Companion Loan or the holders of any certificates backed, wholly or partially, by such Serviced
Companion Loan, but upon the written direction of the related holder of such Serviced Companion Loan, the master servicer will
be required to appoint a sub-servicer that will be responsible for servicing the related Serviced Whole Loan.
 
No Certificateholder will have any right
under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law upon or under or with
respect to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, any intercreditor agreement or any mortgage loan, or with respect to the certificates,
unless the holder previously has given to the trustee and the certificate administrator a written notice of default, and of the
continuance of the default, or of the need to institute such suit, action or proceeding on behalf of the trust and unless also
(except in the case of a default by the trustee) the holders of certificates of any class evidencing not less than 25% of the aggregate
Percentage Interests constituting the class have made written request upon the trustee to institute such action, suit or proceeding
in its own name (as trustee) and have offered to the trustee reasonable indemnity satisfactory to it, and the trustee, for 60 days
after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of such indemnity, has neglected or refused to institute any such action, suit
or proceeding. However, the trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the trusts or powers vested in it by the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement or the certificates or to institute, conduct or defend any related litigation at the request, order or
direction of any of the Certificateholders, unless such Certificateholders have offered to the trustee reasonable security or indemnity
against the costs, expenses and liabilities that may be incurred as a result. It is understood and intended, and expressly covenanted by each Certificateholder with every other Certificateholder and
the trustee, that no one or more Certificateholders will have any right in any manner whatsoever by virtue of any provision of
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or the certificates to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of the holders of any other
of such certificates, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such Certificateholder, which priority
or preference is not otherwise provided for in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, or to enforce any right under the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement or the certificates, except in the manner provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or the certificates
and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all Certificateholders.
 

S-378
 
 
Further, if replaced as a result of a Servicer
Termination Event any master servicer or special servicer, as the case may be, will be responsible for the costs and expenses associated
with the transfer of its duties.

not continuing, and with respect to any mortgage loan other than an Excluded Loan, the Directing Certificateholder, determine that
the commercial mortgage backed securities industry standard for such provisions has changed, in order to conform to such industry
standard, (b) such modification does not adversely affect the status of any Trust REMIC as a REMIC or the status of the Grantor
Trust as a grantor trust under the relevant provisions of the Code, as evidenced by an opinion of counsel and (c) a Rating

and provided, further, that the certificate administrator must give notice of any such amendment to the 17g-5 Information

for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing

to be distributed on a certificate of any class without the consent of the holder of such certificate or which are required to
be distributed to a holder of a Companion Loan without the consent of such holder, (2) reduce the aforesaid percentage of

administrator, the master servicer, the special servicer and the senior trust advisor having first received an opinion of counsel
(at the trust fund’s expense) to the effect that the amendment does not conflict with the terms of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, and that the amendment or the exercise of any power granted to the master servicer, the special servicer, the depositor,
the certificate administrator, the trustee or any other specified person in accordance with the amendment, will not result in the

Trust to fail to qualify as a grantor trust under the relevant provisions of the Code.
 
Certain
Affiliations, Relationships and Related Transactions Involving Transaction Parties
 
JPMCB and its affiliates are playing several
roles in this transaction. J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. is the depositor and a wholly-owned subsidiary
of JPMCB. JPMCB and the other mortgage loan sellers originated, co-originated or acquired the mortgage loans and will be selling
them to the depositor. JPMCB is also an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, an underwriter for the offering of the certificates.
 
In addition, JPMCB currently holds the First
National Building Pari Passu Companion Loan and the New Center One Building Pari Passu Companion Loan; however, JPMCB expects to
deposit such Pari Passu Companion Loans into one or more future securitization transactions.
 
JPMCB also provides warehouse financing
to an affiliate of RCMC through a repurchase facility. Two (2) of the mortgage loans that RCMC will transfer to the depositor identified
as “Park Place I & II Portfolio” and “Falcon Gateway” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus,
representing approximately 3.6% of the Initial Pool Balance, are expected to be subject to that repurchase facility.
 
In addition, JPMCB currently holds certain
equity interests in the parent company for the two tenants under the master lease related to the Mortgaged Properties identified
as “Brunswick Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing approximately 1.7% of the Initial
Pool Balance. JPMCB acquired the equity interests as part of the reorganization of the parent company after a bankruptcy filing

Sanford, FL” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, representing approximately 12.3% of the Initial Pool Balance,
are subject to that repurchase facility. Proceeds received by SMF II in connection with the contribution of the SMF II
Mortgage Loans to this securitization transaction will be applied, among other things, to reacquire the financed mortgage loans
and to make payments to Barclays as the repurchase agreement counterparty.
 
SMF II is a sponsor and one of the
mortgage loan sellers and is an affiliate of LNR Partners, LLC, the initial special servicer, and of LNR Securities Holdings, LLC
(or its affiliate), which is expected to purchase the Class E, Class F, Class G, Class NR and Class Z certificates on the
Closing Date and appoint itself to be the initial Directing Certificateholder, and Starwood Mortgage Capital LLC, an originator.
Conflicts may arise due to SMF II participating in this transaction in the capacity of a sponsor and mortgage loan seller
as well as being an affiliate of the anticipated purchaser of the Class E, Class F, Class G, Class NR and Class Z certificates,
the anticipated initial Directing Certificateholder and being an affiliate of the initial special servicer.

Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loan; however, SMF II or an affiliate expects to deposit such Pari Passu Companion Loan into
a future securitization.

such certificates and, if the price was other than par, the rate and timing of payments (whether as a result of voluntary or involuntary
prepayments received in respect of the mortgage loans) of principal on the Certificate (or, in the case of the Class X-A, Class
X-B, Class X-C and Class X-D certificates, reduction of the Notional Amount of the Class X-A, Class X-B, Class X-C and Class X-D

for Class EC certificates)); (3) the aggregate amount of distributions on the certificates (or in the case of the Class X-A, Class
X-B, Class X-C and Class X-D certificates, the resulting reductions of the Notional Amount of the Class X-A, Class X-B, Class X-C
and Class X-D certificates, as applicable (in each case, determined without giving effect to any exchange of Class A-S, Class B
and Class C certificates for Class EC certificates), as a result of such principal distributions); and (4) the aggregate amount
of Collateral Support Deficit amounts allocated to a class of Certificates (or, in the case of the Class X-A, Class X-B, Class
X-C and Class X-D certificates, in reduction of the Notional Amount of the Class X-A, Class X-B, Class X-C and Class X-D certificates,
as applicable (in each case, determined without giving effect to any exchange of Class A-S, Class B and Class C certificates for
Class EC certificates)).
 
Pass-Through
Rate. The Pass-Through Rate applicable to each class of Offered Certificates (other than the Class EC certificates,
which do not have a Pass-Through Rate) for any Distribution Date will equal the rate set forth on the cover of this free writing
prospectus (including additional information indicated by any relevant footnotes). See “Description of the Certificates”
in this free writing prospectus.
 
Rate
and Timing of Principal Payments. The yield to holders of Offered Certificates that are purchased at a discount or premium
will be affected by the rate and timing of principal payments on the mortgage loans (including principal prepayments on the mortgage
loans resulting from both voluntary prepayments by the borrowers and involuntary liquidations). As described in this free writing
prospectus, the Principal Distribution Amount for each Distribution Date will generally be distributable first, in respect
of the Class A-SB certificates until their Certificate Balance is reduced to the Class A-SB Planned Principal Balance for such
Distribution Date, second, in respect of the Class A-1 certificates until their Certificate Balance is reduced to zero,
third, in respect of the Class A-2 certificates, until their Certificate Balance is reduced to zero, fourth, in respect
of the Class A-3 certificates, until their Certificate Balance is reduced to zero, fifth, in respect of the Class A-4 certificates
until their Certificate Balance is reduced to zero, sixth, in respect of the Class A-5 certificates until their Certificate
Balance is reduced to zero, and seventh, in respect of the Class A-SB certificates, without regard to the Class A-SB Planned
Principal Balance, until their Certificate Balance is reduced to zero. After those distributions, the remaining Principal Distribution
Amount with respect to the pool of mortgage loans will generally be distributable entirely in respect of the Class A-S certificates,
the Class B certificates, the Class C certificates, the Class D certificates, the Class E certificates, the Class F certificates,
the Class G certificates and the Class NR certificates, in that order, in each case until the Certificate Balance of such class
of certificates is reduced to zero (calculated without giving effect to any exchange of the Exchangeable Certificates for Class
EC certificates). On each Distribution Date, the Class EC certificates will receive, in the aggregate, the sum of the principal
distributable to the Class A-S, Class B and Class C certificates that have been exchanged for such Class EC certificates. Consequently,
the rate and timing of principal payments on the mortgage loans will in turn be affected by their amortization schedules, lockout
periods, defeasance provisions, provisions relating to the release and/or application of earnout reserves, provisions requiring
prepayments in connection with the release of real property collateral, provisions requiring or permitting prepayments in connection
with casualties and condemnations, requirements to pay Yield Maintenance Charges and/or other prepayment consideration in connection
with principal payments, the dates on which balloon payments are due, incentives for a borrower to repay an ARD Loan by the related
Anticipated Repayment Date, property release provisions, provisions relating to the application or release of earnout reserves,
any extensions of maturity dates by the master servicer or the special servicer and the rate and timing of principal prepayments
and other unscheduled collections received in respect of the
 


S-383
 
 
mortgage loans (including for this purpose, collections made in connection
with liquidations of mortgage loans due to defaults, casualties or condemnations affecting the Mortgaged Properties, or purchases
of mortgage loans out of the trust fund). Furthermore, because the Class X Certificates are not entitled to distributions of principal,
the yield on such certificates will be extremely sensitive to prepayments received in respect of the mortgage loans to the extent
distributed to reduce the related Notional Amount of the applicable class of Class X Certificates. In addition, although the borrower
under an ARD Loan may have certain incentives to prepay such ARD Loan on its Anticipated Repayment Date, we cannot assure you that
the borrower will be able to prepay such ARD Loan on its related Anticipated Repayment Date. The failure of the borrower to prepay
an ARD Loan on its Anticipated Repayment Date will not be an event of default under the terms of such ARD Loan, and pursuant to
the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, neither the master servicer nor the special servicer will be permitted to take
any enforcement action with respect to the borrower’s failure to pay Excess Interest, other than to make requests for collection,
until the scheduled maturity of such ARD Loan; provided that the master servicer or the special servicer, as the case may
be, may take action to enforce the trust fund’s right to apply excess cash flow to principal in accordance with the terms
of the respective ARD Loan documents. With respect to the Class A-SB certificates, the extent to which the planned balances are
achieved and the sensitivity of the Class A-SB certificates to principal prepayments on the mortgage loans will depend in part
on the period of time during which the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4 and Class A-5 certificates remain outstanding.
As such, the Class A-SB certificates will become more sensitive to the rate of prepayments on the mortgage loans than they were
when the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4 and Class A-5 certificates were outstanding.
 
Prepayments and, assuming the respective
stated maturity dates (or, if applicable, Anticipated Repayment Dates) for the mortgage loans have not occurred, liquidations and
purchases of the mortgage loans will result in distributions on the Offered Certificates of amounts that would otherwise be distributed
over the remaining terms of the mortgage loans to maturity (or, if applicable, to the related Anticipated Repayment Date). Defaults
on the mortgage loans particularly at or near their stated maturity dates (or, if applicable, Anticipated Repayment Dates), may
result in significant delays in anticipated payments of principal on the mortgage loans (and, accordingly, on the Offered Certificates)
while work-outs are negotiated or foreclosures are completed. See “Servicing of the Mortgage Loans—Modifications,
Waivers and Amendments” and “—Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans” and “Certain
Legal Aspects of the Mortgage Loans” in this free writing prospectus. Because the rate of principal payments on the mortgage
loans will depend on future events and a variety of factors (as described below), we cannot assure you as to the rate of principal
payments or the rate of principal prepayments in particular. We are not aware of any relevant publicly available or authoritative
statistics with respect to the historical prepayment experience of a large group of mortgage loans comparable to the mortgage loans.
 
The extent to which the yield to maturity
of any class of Offered Certificates may vary from the anticipated yield will depend upon the degree to which the certificates
are purchased at a discount or premium and when, and to what degree, payments of principal on the mortgage loans are in turn distributed
on the certificates or, in the case of the Class X-A or Class X-B certificates applied to reduce the Notional Amount of the Class
X-A or Class X-B certificates, as applicable (in each case, determined without giving effect to any exchange of Exchangeable Certificates
for Class EC certificates). An investor should consider, in the case of any certificate (other than the Class X Certificates) purchased
at a discount, the risk that a slower than anticipated rate of principal payments on the mortgage loans could result in an actual
yield to such investor that is lower than the anticipated yield and, in the case of any certificate purchased at a premium, the
risk that a faster than anticipated rate of principal payments could result in an actual yield to such investor that is lower than
the anticipated yield. In general, the earlier a payment of principal on the mortgage loans is distributed or otherwise results
in reduction of the principal balance of a certificate purchased at a discount or premium, the greater will be the effect on an
investor’s yield to maturity. As a result, the effect on an investor’s yield of principal payments distributed on an
investor’s certificates occurring at a rate higher (or lower) than the rate anticipated by the investor during any particular
period would not be fully offset by a subsequent like reduction (or increase) in the rate of principal payments.
 


S-384
 
 
Because the Notional Amounts of the Class
X-A and Class X-B certificates are based on the outstanding Certificate Balances of, in the case of the Class X-A certificates,
the Class A Certificates (determined without giving effect to any exchange and conversion of any Class A-S certificates for Class
EC certificates) and, in the case of the Class X-B certificates, the Class B certificates (determined without giving effect to
any exchange and conversion of any Class B certificates for Class EC certificates), the yield to maturity on the Class X-A and
Class X-B certificates will be extremely sensitive to the rate and timing of prepayments of principal on the mortgage loans.
 
The yield on each of the classes of certificates
that have a Pass-Through Rate equal to, limited by, or based on, the WAC Rate could (or in the case of any class of certificates
with a Pass-Through Rate equal to the WAC Rate, would) be adversely affected if mortgage loans with higher Mortgage Rates prepay
faster than mortgage loans with lower Mortgage Rates. The Pass-Through Rates on these classes of certificates may be adversely
affected by a decrease in the WAC Rate even if principal prepayments do not occur.
 
Losses
and Shortfalls. The yield to holders of the Offered Certificates will also depend on the extent to which the holders
are required to bear the effects of any losses or shortfalls on the mortgage loans. Losses and other shortfalls on the mortgage
loans will generally be borne by the holders of the Class NR certificates, the Class G certificates, the Class F certificates,
the Class E certificates, the Class D certificates, the Class C certificates (and any related portion of the Class EC certificates),
Class B certificates (and any related portion of the Class EC certificates) and the Class A-S certificates (and any related portion
of the Class EC certificates), in that order, in each case to the extent of amounts otherwise distributable in respect of the class
of Subordinate Certificates. Although losses on the Class A-S certificates (and any related portion of the Class EC certificates)
will not be allocated to the Class X-A certificates directly, they will reduce the Notional Amount of the Class X-A certificates
(without giving effect to any conversion and exchange of Class A-S certificates for Class EC certificates), which will reduce the
yield on such Offered Certificates. Similarly, although losses on the Class B certificates (and any related portion of the Class
EC certificates) will not be allocated to the Class X-B certificates directly, they will reduce the Notional Amount of the Class
X-B certificates (without giving effect to any conversion and exchange of Class B certificates for Class EC certificates), which
will reduce the yield on such Offered Certificates. In the event of the reduction of the Certificate Balances of all those classes
of Subordinate Certificates and the Class EC certificates to zero, the resulting losses and shortfalls will then be borne, pro
rata, by the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5 and Class A-SB certificates. As is the case with losses
on the Class A-S certificates as described above, although losses on such Class A Certificates will not be allocated to the Class
X-A certificates directly, they will reduce the Notional Amount of the Class X-A certificates (without giving effect to any conversion
and exchange of Class A-S certificates for Class EC certificates), which will reduce the yield on such Offered Certificates. If
Exchangeable Certificates are converted in an exchange for Class EC certificates, all losses and shortfalls that would otherwise
be allocable to such converted Exchangeable Certificates will be borne by such Class EC certificates.
 
Certain
Relevant Factors. The rate and timing of principal payments and defaults and the severity of losses on the mortgage
loans may be affected by a number of factors, including, without limitation, prevailing interest rates, the terms of the mortgage
loans (for example, due-on-sale clauses, lockout periods or Yield Maintenance Charges, release of property provision and amortization
terms that require balloon payments and incentives for a borrower to repay its mortgage loan by an anticipated repayment date),
the demographics and relative economic vitality of the areas in which the Mortgaged Properties are located and the general supply
and demand for rental properties in those areas, the quality of management of the Mortgaged Properties, the servicing of the mortgage
loans, possible changes in tax laws and other opportunities for investment. See “Risk Factors” and “Description
of the Mortgage Pool” and “Yield and Maturity Considerations” in this free writing prospectus.
 
The rate of prepayment on the pool of mortgage
loans is likely to be affected by prevailing market interest rates for mortgage loans of a comparable type, term and risk level
as the mortgage loans. When the prevailing market interest rate is below a mortgage coupon, a borrower may have an increased incentive
to refinance its mortgage loan. However, under all of the mortgage loans, voluntary
 


S-385
 
 
prepayments are subject to lockout periods
and/or Yield Maintenance Charges. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Certain Terms and Conditions of the Mortgage
Loans” in this free writing prospectus. In any case, we cannot assure you that the related borrowers will refrain from
prepaying their mortgage loans due to the existence of Yield Maintenance Charges or prepayment premiums, or that involuntary prepayments
will not occur. See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Certain Terms and Conditions of the Mortgage Loans”
in this free writing prospectus.
 
With respect to certain mortgage loans,
the related mortgage loan documents allow for the sale of individual properties and the severance of the related debt and the assumption
by the transferee of such portion of the mortgage loan as is allocable to the individual property acquired by that transferee,
subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. In addition, with respect to certain mortgage loans, the related mortgage loan
documents allow for partial releases of individual Mortgaged Properties during a lockout period or during such time as a yield
maintenance charge would otherwise be payable, which could result in a prepayment of a portion of the initial principal balance
of the related mortgage loan without payment of a yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium. Additionally, in the case of
a partial release of an individual Mortgaged Property, the related release amount in many cases is greater than the allocated loan
amount for the Mortgaged Property being released, which would result in a greater than proportionate paydown of the mortgage loan.
For certain Mortgage Loans, a prepayment may occur (often without any required yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium)
in connection with a casualty at or condemnation of the related Mortgaged Property. For more information see “Description
of the Mortgage Pool—Certain Terms and Conditions of the Mortgage Loans—Releases of Individual Mortgaged Properties”
in this free writing prospectus.
 
Depending on prevailing market interest
rates, the outlook for market interest rates and economic conditions generally, some borrowers may sell Mortgaged Properties in
order to realize their equity in the Mortgaged Property, to meet cash flow needs or to make other investments. In addition, some
borrowers may be motivated by federal and state tax laws (which are subject to change) to sell Mortgaged Properties prior to the
exhaustion of tax depreciation benefits.
 
We make no representation as to the particular
factors that will affect the rate and timing of prepayments and defaults on the mortgage loans, as to the relative importance of
those factors, as to the percentage of the principal balance of the mortgage loans that will be prepaid or as to which a default
will have occurred as of any date or as to the overall rate of prepayment or default on the mortgage loans or related mortgage
loans.
 
Delay
in Payment of Distributions. Because each monthly distribution is made on each Distribution Date, which is at least
15 days after the end of the related Interest Accrual Period for the certificates, the effective yield to the holders of such certificates
will be lower than the yield that would otherwise be produced by the applicable Pass-Through Rates and purchase prices (assuming
the prices did not account for the delay).
 
Unpaid
Distributable Certificate Interest. As described under “Description of the Certificates—Distributions—Priority”
in this free writing prospectus, if the portion of the Available Distribution Amount distributable in respect of interest on any
class of certificates on any Distribution Date is less than the Distributable Certificate Interest then payable for that class
of certificates, then the shortfall will be distributable to holders of that class of certificates on subsequent Distribution Dates,
to the extent of available funds. Any shortfall will not bear interest, however, so it will negatively affect the yield to maturity
of the related class of certificates for so long as it is outstanding. Similarly, any amounts constituting Collateral Support Deficit
that are subsequently reimbursed generally will not bear interest (except as provided in this free writing prospectus with respect
to Accrued Interest From Recoveries).
 
Weighted Average Life
 
The weighted average life of a Regular Certificate
and the Class EC certificates refers to the average amount of time that will elapse from the date of its issuance until each dollar
allocable to principal of the certificate is distributed to the related investor. The weighted average life of a Regular Certificate
and the Class EC certificates will be influenced by, among other things, the rate at which principal on the
 


S-386
 
 
mortgage loans is paid
or otherwise received, which may be in the form of scheduled amortization, voluntary prepayments, Insurance and Condemnation Proceeds
and Liquidation Proceeds. As described in this free writing prospectus, the Principal Distribution Amount for each Distribution
Date will generally be distributable first, in respect of the Class A-SB certificates until their Certificate Balance is
reduced to the Class A-SB Planned Principal Balance for such Distribution Date, second, in respect of the Class A-1 certificates
until their Certificate Balance is reduced to zero, third, in respect of the Class A-2 certificates until their Certificate
Balance is reduced to zero, fourth, in respect of the Class A-3 certificates until their Certificate Balance is reduced
to zero, fifth, in respect of the Class A-4 certificates until their Certificate Balance is reduced to zero, sixth,
in respect of the Class A-5 certificates until their Certificate Balance is reduced to zero, and seventh, in respect of
the Class A-SB certificates, without regard to the Class A-SB Planned Principal Balance, until their Certificate Balance is reduced
to zero. After those distributions, the remaining Principal Distribution Amount with respect to all the mortgage loans will generally
be distributable entirely in respect of the Class A-S certificates, then the Class B certificates, then the Class
C certificates, then the Class D certificates, then the Class E certificates, then the Class F certificates,
then the Class G certificates, and then the Class NR certificates, in that order, in each case until the Certificate
Balance of each such class of certificates is reduced to zero (calculated without giving effect to any exchange of the Exchangeable
Certificates for Class EC certificates). On each Distribution Date, the Class EC certificates will receive, in the aggregate, the
sum of the Principal Distribution Amount that would otherwise be distributed to the Class A-S, Class B and Class C certificates
that have been converted in an exchange for such Class EC certificates.
 
Prepayments
on mortgage loans may be measured by a prepayment standard or model. The “Constant Prepayment Rate” or “CPR”
model represents an assumed constant annual rate of prepayment each month, expressed as a per annum percentage of the then-scheduled
principal balance of the pool of mortgage loans. The “CPY” model represents an assumed CPR prepayment rate after
any applicable lockout period, any applicable period in which Defeasance is permitted and any applicable yield maintenance period.
The model used in this free writing prospectus is the CPY model. As used in each of the following tables, the column headed “0%
CPY” assumes that none of the mortgage loans is prepaid before its maturity date or Anticipated Repayment Date, as the case
may be. The columns headed “25% CPY”, “50% CPY”, “75% CPY” and “100% CPY” assume
that prepayments on the mortgage loans are made at those levels of CPR following the expiration of any applicable lockout period,
any applicable period in which Defeasance is permitted and any applicable yield maintenance period (except as described below).
We cannot assure you, however, that prepayments of the mortgage loans will conform to any level of CPY, and we make no representation
that the mortgage loans will prepay at the levels of CPY shown or at any other prepayment rate.
 
The
following tables indicate the percentage of the initial Certificate Balance of each class of the Offered Certificates that would
be outstanding after each of the dates shown at various CPYs and the corresponding weighted average life of each class of Offered
Certificates. The tables have been prepared on the basis of the following assumptions (the “Modeling Assumptions”),
among others:
 
(a)	scheduled Periodic Payments
including payments due at maturity of principal and/or interest on the mortgage loans will be received on a timely basis and will
be distributed on the 15th day of the related month, beginning in November 2015;
 
(b)	the Mortgage Rate in effect
for each mortgage loan as of the Cut-off Date will remain in effect to the related maturity date or Anticipated Repayment Date,
as the case may be, and will be adjusted as required pursuant to the definition of Mortgage Rate;
 
(c)	the
mortgage loan sellers will not be required to repurchase any mortgage loan, and none of the holders of the Controlling Class (or
any other Certificateholder), the special servicer, the master servicer or the holders of the Class R certificates will exercise
its option to purchase all the mortgage loans and thereby cause an early termination of the trust fund and no holder of any mezzanine
debt or other indebtedness will exercise its option to purchase the related mortgage loan;
 
(d)	any principal prepayments
on the mortgage loans will be received on their respective Due Dates after the expiration of any applicable lockout period, any
applicable period in which Defeasance
 


S-387
 
 
is permitted, and any applicable yield maintenance period, in each case, at the respective
levels of CPY set forth in the tables (without regard to any limitations in such mortgage loans on partial voluntary principal
prepayment);
 
(e)	no Prepayment Interest
Shortfalls are incurred and no prepayment premiums or Yield Maintenance Charges are collected;
 
(f)	the Closing Date is on
October 29, 2015;
 
(g)	each ARD Loan prepays
in full on the related Anticipated Repayment Date;
 
(h)	the Pass-Through Rates,
initial Certificate Balances and initial Notional Amount of the respective classes of Offered Certificates are as described in
this free writing prospectus;
 
(i)	the Administrative Cost
Rate is calculated on the Stated Principal Balance of the mortgage loans and in the same manner as interest is calculated on the
mortgage loans;
 
(j)	no reserves, earnouts,
holdbacks, insurance proceeds or condemnation proceeds are applied to prepay any related mortgage loan in whole or in part;
 
(k)	no additional trust fund
expenses or Senior Trust Advisor Expenses are incurred;
 
(l)	no property releases (or
related re-amortizations) occur;
 
(m)	the optional termination
is not exercised;
 
(n)	the Certificate Balance
of the Class EC certificates at all times equals the aggregate of the Certificate Balances of the Class A-S, Class B and Class
C certificates;
 
(o)	there are no modifications
or maturity date extensions in respect of the mortgage loans; and
 
(p)	the
mortgage loan secured by the Mortgaged Property identified as “U-Haul Portfolio” on Annex A-1 to this free writing
prospectus, representing approximately 4.3% of the Initial Pool Balance, amortizes based on the assumed principal payment schedule
attached to this free writing prospectus as Annex F, and for purposes of assumed CPR prepayment rates, prepayments are determined
on the basis of the principal balance of the related mortgage loan only.
 
To the extent that the mortgage loans have
characteristics that differ from those assumed in preparing the tables set forth below, a class of Offered Certificates may mature
earlier or later than indicated by the tables. The tables set forth below are for illustrative purposes only and it is highly unlikely
that the mortgage loans will actually prepay at any constant rate until maturity or that all the mortgage loans will prepay at
the same rate. In addition, variations in the actual prepayment experience and the balance of the mortgage loans that prepay may
increase or decrease the percentages of initial Certificate Balances (and weighted average lives) shown in the following tables.
These variations may occur even if the average prepayment experience of the mortgage loans were to equal any of the specified CPY
percentages. Investors should not rely on the prepayment assumptions set forth in this free writing prospectus and are urged to
conduct their own analyses of the rates at which the mortgage loans may be expected to prepay, based on their own assumptions.
Based on the foregoing assumptions, the following tables indicate the resulting weighted average lives of each class of Offered
Certificates and set forth the percentage of the initial Certificate Balance of the class of the certificate that would be outstanding
after each of the dates shown at the indicated CPYs.

(1)The
  weighted average life of the Class D certificates is determined by (a) multiplying the
  amount of each principal distribution on it by the number of years from the date of issuance
  of the Class D certificates to the related Distribution Date, (b) summing the results
  and (c) dividing the sum by the aggregate amount of the reductions in the principal balance
  of the Class D certificates.
 
Yield Sensitivity of the
Class X-A and Class X-B Certificates
 
The yield to maturity of the Class X-A and
Class X-B certificates will be highly sensitive to the rate and timing of principal payments including by reason of prepayments
(whether voluntary or involuntary), principal losses and other factors described above to the extent allocated to (a) in the case
of the Class X-A certificates, the Class A Certificates (and any portion of the Class EC certificates related to the Class A-S
certificates) and (b) in the case of the Class X-B certificates, the Class B certificates (and any portion of the Class EC certificates
related to the Class B certificates). Investors in the Class X-A and Class X-B certificates should fully consider the associated
risks, including the risk that an extremely rapid rate of amortization, prepayment or other liquidation of the mortgage loans could
result in the failure of such investors to recoup fully their initial investments.
 


S-393
 
 
Any optional termination by the holders
of the Controlling Class, the special servicer, the master servicer or the holders of the Class R certificates would result in
prepayment in full of the Offered Certificates and would have an adverse effect on the yield of a class of the Class X-A and Class
X-B certificates because a termination would have an effect similar to a principal prepayment in full of the mortgage loans and,
as a result, investors in the Class X-A and Class X-B certificates and any other certificates purchased at premium might not fully
recoup their initial investment. See “Description of the Certificates—Termination; Retirement of Certificates”
in this free writing prospectus.
 
Pre-Tax Yield to Maturity
Tables
 
The
following tables indicate the approximate pre-tax yield to maturity on a corporate bond equivalent (“CBE”)
basis on the Offered Certificates for the specified CPYs based on the assumptions set forth under “—Weighted Average
Life” above. It was further assumed that the purchase price of the Offered Certificates is as specified in the tables
below, expressed as a percentage of the initial Certificate Balance or Notional Amount, as applicable, plus accrued interest from
October 1, 2015 to the Closing Date.
 
The yields set forth in the following tables
were calculated by determining the monthly discount rates that, when applied to the assumed streams of cash flows to be paid on
the applicable class of Offered Certificates, would cause the discounted present value of such assumed stream of cash flows to
equal the assumed purchase price of such class, and by converting such monthly rates to semi-annual corporate bond equivalent rates.
Such calculations do not take into account shortfalls in collection of interest due to prepayments (or other liquidations) of the
mortgage loans or the interest rates at which investors may be able to reinvest funds received by them as distributions on the
applicable class of certificates (and, accordingly, do not purport to reflect the return on any investment in the applicable class
of Offered Certificates when such reinvestment rates are considered).
 
The characteristics of the mortgage loans
may differ from those assumed in preparing the tables below. In addition, we cannot assure you that the mortgage loans will prepay
in accordance with the above assumptions at any of the rates shown in the tables or at any other particular rate, that the cash
flows on the applicable class of Offered Certificates will correspond to the cash flows shown in this free writing prospectus or
that the aggregate purchase price of such class of Offered Certificates will be as assumed. In addition, it is unlikely that the
mortgage loans will prepay in accordance with the above assumptions at any of the specified CPYs until maturity or that all the
mortgage loans will so prepay at the same rate. Timing of changes in the rate of prepayments may significantly affect the actual
yield to maturity to investors, even if the average rate of principal prepayments is consistent with the expectations of investors.
Investors must make their own decisions as to the appropriate prepayment assumption to be used in deciding whether to purchase
any class of Offered Certificates.
 
For purposes of this free writing prospectus,
prepayment assumptions with respect to the mortgage loans are presented in terms of the CPY model described under “—Weighted
Average Life” above.

Material
Federal Income Tax Consequences
 
General
 
This discussion does not purport to address
all federal income tax consequences that may be applicable to particular categories of investors (such as banks, insurance companies,
securities dealers, foreign persons, investors whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, and investors that hold the Offered
Certificates as part of a “straddle” or “conversion transaction”), some of which may be subject to special
rules. Investors should consult their own tax advisors in determining the federal, state, local or any other tax consequences to
them of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Offered Certificates and should review the discussions under the heading
“Material Federal Income Tax Consequences—Federal Income Tax Consequences for REMIC Certificates” in the
prospectus.
 
The
Lower-Tier REMIC will hold the mortgage loans and the related proceeds of the mortgage loans (other than Excess Interest), and
the trust’s allocable share of any property that secured a mortgage loan that was acquired by foreclosure or deed in lieu
of foreclosure (or, in the case of any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, a beneficial interest in an allocable portion of the property
securing that Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) and will issue certain uncertificated classes (the “Lower-Tier REMIC Regular
Interests”) as the regular interests in the Lower-Tier REMIC, and will issue an uncertificated interest represented
by the Class R certificates, as the sole class of residual interests in the Lower-Tier REMIC. The Upper-Tier REMIC will hold the
Lower-Tier REMIC Regular Interests and the proceeds of the Lower-Tier REMIC Regular Interests and will issue the Senior Certificates
and the Subordinate Certificates as regular interests in the Upper-Tier REMIC and an uncertificated interest represented by the
Class R certificates as the sole class of residual interest in the Upper-Tier REMIC.
 
On
the Closing Date, Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, special counsel to the depositor, will deliver its opinion that, assuming
(1) the making of appropriate elections, (2) compliance with the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and any applicable
intercreditor agreements, (3) compliance with the provisions of the Non-Serviced PSA and any amendments thereto and the continued
qualification of the REMICs formed under the Non-Serviced PSA and (4) compliance with applicable changes in the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), for federal income tax purposes (a) each Trust REMIC will qualify
as a real estate mortgage investment conduit (each, a “REMIC”) within the meaning of Sections 860A through 860G
of the Code, (b)(i) the Lower-Tier REMIC Regular Interests will evidence the “regular interests” in the Lower-Tier
REMIC and (ii) the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5, Class A-SB, Class X-A, Class X-B, Class X-C, Class X-D,
Class A-S, Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E, Class F, Class G and Class NR certificates will evidence the “regular interests”
in the Upper-Tier REMIC and (c) the Class R certificates will represent the sole class of “residual interests” in each
of the Trust REMICs, within the meaning of the REMIC Provisions. For convenience, distributions are described in this free writing
prospectus as if distributions on the mortgage loans were made directly on the certificates. The Offered Certificates are (or,
in the case of the Class EC certificates, represent beneficial ownership of) “Regular Certificates” as defined in the
prospectus.
 
In
addition, in the opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, (i) the portions of the trust consisting of (a) any Class A-S,
Class B and Class C certificates that have been exchanged for and converted to Class EC certificates (and the related amounts in
the Class EC Distribution Account) and (b) the Excess Interest (and related amounts in the Excess Interest Distribution Account),
will be treated as a grantor trust (the “Grantor Trust”) for federal income tax purposes under subpart
E, part I of subchapter J of the Code, (ii) the Class EC certificates will represent undivided beneficial interests in the portion
of the Grantor Trust described in clause (i)(a) above and (iii) the Class Z certificates will represent undivided beneficial interests
in the portion of the Grantor Trust described in clause (i)(b) above.
 


S-400
 
 
Tax Status of Offered
Certificates
 
Except
as provided below, Offered Certificates (whether held directly or in the form of the Class EC certificates) held by a real estate
investment trust will constitute “real estate assets” within the meaning of Section 856(c)(5)(B) of the Code, and interest,
including original issue discount (“OID”), on the Offered Certificates will be considered “interest
on obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property” within the meaning of Section 856(c)(3)(B)
of the Code in the same proportion that, for both purposes, the assets of the trust would be so treated. For purposes of the foregoing
tests, the Trust REMICs are treated as a single REMIC. If at all times 95% or more of the assets of the Trust REMICs qualify for
each of the foregoing treatments, the Offered Certificates will qualify for the corresponding status in their entirety. For purposes
of Section 856(c)(5)(B) of the Code, payments of principal and interest on mortgage loans that are reinvested pending distribution
to holders of certificates qualify for such treatment. Offered Certificates held by a domestic building and loan association will
be treated as “loans. . . secured by an interest in real property which is . . . residential real property” within
the meaning of Section 7701(a)(19)(C)(v) of the Code or as other assets described in Section 7701(a)(19)(C) of the Code only to
the extent the mortgage loans are secured by multifamily properties. As of the Cut-off Date, thirty-six (36) of the Mortgaged Properties
identified as “Waterstone Apartments”, “The Park at Veneto”, “The Park at Murano”, “Oakland
Hills”, “Walnut Multifamily Portfolio”, “Mustang Crossing Apartments”, “Shadow Hills Apartments”,
“Hawthorne Townhomes”, “Marquis Forest Apartments”, “University Studios”, “Colony Village”,
“Summer View Apartments”, “Brynn Marr Village”, “Condor Garden Apartments”, “Evergreen
Village Apartments”, “Diamond Pointe Apartments (6th/Deodar)”, “Rose Pointe Apartments (Euclid/Budd)”,
“Cedar Pointe Apartments”, “South View (Avalon) Apartments”, “Suncrest Apartments”, “Forest
View Apartments”, “Royal Palms Apartments”, “Rose Terrace Apartments (Parthenia)”, “Beverly
Terrace Apartments”, “Iron Mountain Apartments”, “Camellia Apartments”, “Highland Springs Apartments”,
“Highland Meadows (43/44) Apartments”, “Glen Terrace Apartments”, “Twin Palms”, “Highland
Meadows (Meridian) Apartments”, “South View (Carondelet) Apartments”, “South View (Main) Apartments”
and “Summer Wind Apartments” on Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing thirty-four (34) mortgage loans,
representing approximately 17.6% of the Initial Pool Balance, are multifamily properties. Holders of the Offered Certificates should
consult their own tax advisors whether the foregoing percentage or some other percentage applies to their certificates. In addition,
mortgage loans that have been defeased with government securities will not qualify for the foregoing tax treatments. Offered Certificates
held by certain financial institutions will constitute “evidence of indebtedness” within the meaning of Section 582(c)(1)
of the Code. Moreover, the Offered Certificates will be “qualified mortgages” for another REMIC within the meaning
of Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code. See “Material Federal Income Tax Consequences—Federal Income Tax Consequences
for REMIC Certificates—Characterization of Investments in REMIC Certificates” in the prospectus.
 
Taxation of Offered Certificates
 
General.
Each class of Offered Certificates (whether held directly or in the form of the Class EC certificates) generally will be treated
as newly originated debt instruments for federal income tax purposes. Holders of the Class EC certificates will treat the related
portions of the related Exchangeable Certificates as separate debt instruments and will report the aggregate of separate amounts
computed with respect thereto. Holders of such classes will be required to include in income all interest on the regular interests
represented by their certificates in accordance with the accrual method of accounting, regardless of a Certificateholder’s
usual method of accounting. The prepayment assumption that will be used in determining the rate of accrual of OID, if any, and
market discount or whether any such discount is de minimis, and that may be used to amortize premium, if any, for federal
income tax purposes will be based on the assumption that subsequent to the date of any determination the mortgage loans will prepay
at a rate equal to a CPR of 0%; provided that it is assumed that any ARD Loan prepays on its related Anticipated Repayment
Date (the “Prepayment Assumption”). No representation is made that the mortgage loans will prepay at that rate
or at any other rate. Treasury Regulations (the “OID Regulations”) governing the computation of OID do not address
the manner of accruing OID on securities such as the Offered Certificates, on which principal is required to be prepaid based on
prepayments of the underlying assets and which are governed by Section 1272(a)(6) of the Code. The methodology for accruing OID
described in this paragraph and in the prospectus will be used for reporting to investors unless and until
 


S-401
 
 
more specific regulations
are issued for obligations governed by Section 1272(a)(6) of the Code. See “Material Federal Income Tax Consequences—Federal
Income Tax Consequences for REMIC Certificates—Taxation of Regular Certificates—Original Issue Discount”
and “—Premium” in the prospectus. It is anticipated that the Class [●]
certificates will be issued with OID.
 
In addition, it is anticipated that the
certificate administrator will treat the Class X-A and Class X-B certificates as having no qualified stated interest. Accordingly,
such classes will be considered to be issued with OID in an amount equal to the excess of all distributions of interest expected
to be received thereon, over their respective issue prices (including interest accrued prior to the Closing Date). Any “negative”
amounts of OID on the Class X-A or Class X-B certificates attributable to rapid prepayments with respect to the mortgage loans
will not be deductible currently. Holders of Class X-A and Class X-B certificates may be entitled to a loss, which may be a capital
loss, to the extent it becomes certain that such Certificateholders will not recover a portion of their basis in such classes,
assuming no further prepayments. In the alternative, it is possible that rules similar to the “noncontingent bond method”
of the contingent interest rules of the OID Regulations, may be promulgated with respect to such classes. Unless and until required
otherwise by applicable authority, it is not anticipated that the contingent interest rules will apply.
 
Premium.
A Regular Certificate purchased upon initial issuance or in the secondary market at a cost, as adjusted, greater than its remaining
stated redemption price at maturity generally is considered to be purchased at a premium. See “Material Federal Income
Tax Consequences—Federal Income Tax Consequences for REMIC Certificates—Taxation of Regular Certificates—Premium”
in the prospectus. It is anticipated that the Class [●] certificates will be issued at
a premium.
 
Yield
Maintenance Charges and Prepayment Premiums. Yield Maintenance Charges and prepayment premiums actually collected on
the mortgage loans will be distributed to the Offered Certificates as described in “Description of the Certificates—Allocation
of Yield Maintenance Charges and Prepayment Premiums” in this free writing prospectus. It is not entirely clear under
the Code when the amount of Yield Maintenance Charges and prepayment premiums so allocated should be taxed to the holders of the
Regular Certificates, but it is not expected, for federal income tax reporting purposes, that Yield Maintenance Charges and prepayment
premiums will be treated as giving rise to any income to the holder of such classes of certificates prior to the certificate administrator’s
actual receipt of Yield Maintenance Charges and prepayment premiums. Yield Maintenance Charges and prepayment premiums, if any,
may be treated as paid upon the retirement or partial retirement of the Offered Certificates. The IRS may disagree with these positions.
Holders of Offered Certificates should consult their own tax advisors concerning the treatment of Yield Maintenance Charges and
prepayment premiums.
 
Taxation of the Class
EC Certificates
 
The arrangement under which Exchangeable
Certificates converted in an exchange for Class EC certificates is held will be classified as a grantor trust under subpart E,
part I of subchapter J of the Code, and the Class EC certificates will evidence beneficial ownership of a portion of the Grantor
Trust. The interests in the Exchangeable Certificates that have been exchanged and converted for an interest in the Class EC certificates,
including any exchanges effective on the Closing Date, will be the assets of that portion of the Grantor Trust, and such Class
EC certificates will represent beneficial ownership of such Exchangeable Certificates.
 
The Class EC certificates will represent
undivided beneficial interests in the Exchangeable Certificates that have been exchanged for such Class EC certificates, which
will be treated as separate debt instruments for federal income tax purposes. The holder of the Class EC certificates must account
separately for its interest in each such class of Exchangeable Certificates. See “—Taxation of Offered Certificates”
above. A purchaser must allocate its basis in the Class EC certificates among the Exchangeable Certificates represented by each
Class of Exchangeable Certificates in accordance with their relative fair market values as of the time of acquisition. Similarly,
on the sale of such Class EC certificate, the holder must allocate the amount received on the sale among the Exchangeable
 


S-402
 
 
Certificates
represented by each Class of Exchangeable Certificates in accordance with their relative fair market values as of the time of sale.
Prospective beneficial owners of the Class EC certificates should consult their tax advisors as to the appropriate method of accounting
for their interest in the Class EC certificates.
 
If a beneficial owner exchanges Exchangeable
Certificates for Class EC certificates, the exchange and conversion will not be taxable. Likewise, if a beneficial owner exchanges
and converts Class EC certificates for Exchangeable Certificates, the exchange and conversion will not be taxable.
 
Taxation of Foreign Investors
 
For further information regarding the federal
income tax consequences of investing in the Offered Certificates, including consequences of purchase, ownership and disposition
of Offered Certificates by any person who is not a citizen of resident of the United States, a corporation or partnership or other
entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia,
or is a foreign estate or trust, see “Material Federal Income Tax Consequences—Federal Income Tax Consequences for
REMIC Certificates—Taxation of Certain Foreign Investors” in the prospectus.
 
Further Information
 
For
a discussion of the deductibility, character and timing of losses with respect to the Offered Certificates, see “Material
Federal Income Tax Consequences—Federal Income Tax Consequences for REMIC Certificates—Taxation of Regular Certificates—Treatment
of Losses” in the prospectus.
 
For
further information regarding the federal income tax consequences of investing in the Offered Certificates, see “Material
Federal Income Tax Consequences—Federal Income Tax Consequences for REMIC Certificates—Taxation of Regular Certificates”
in the prospectus.
 
DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THESE RULES
AND THE CURRENT UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE MANNER OF THEIR APPLICATION TO THE ISSUING ENTITY AND CERTIFICATEHOLDERS, IT IS PARTICULARLY
IMPORTANT THAT POTENTIAL INVESTORS CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE TAX TREATMENT OF THEIR ACQUISITION, OWNERSHIP AND
DISPOSITION OF THE OFFERED CERTIFICATES.
 
Certain
State, Local and foreign Tax Considerations
 
In addition to the federal income tax consequences
described in “Material Federal Income Tax Consequences” above, purchasers of Offered Certificates should consider
the state, local and foreign income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of the Offered Certificates.
State, local and foreign income tax law may differ substantially from the corresponding federal law, and this discussion does
not purport to describe any aspect of the income tax laws of any state, locality or foreign jurisdiction. Therefore, potential
purchasers should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the various state, local and foreign tax consequences of investment
in the Offered Certificates.
 
Certain
ERISA Considerations
 
A
fiduciary of any retirement plan or other employee benefit plan or arrangement, including individual retirement accounts and annuities,
Keogh plans and collective investment funds and separate accounts in which those plans, annuities, accounts or arrangements are
invested, including insurance company general accounts, that is subject to the fiduciary responsibility rules of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”)
or which is a governmental plan, as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA, a church plan, as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA and
for which no election has been made under Section 410(d) of the Code, or any other plan subject to any federal, state or local
law (“Similar Law”) which is, to a material extent, similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA or the Code
(collectively, with an ERISA Plan, a “Plan”) should review with
 


S-403
 
 
its legal advisors whether the purchase or holding
of Offered Certificates could give rise to a transaction that is prohibited or is not otherwise permitted under ERISA, the Code
or Similar Law or whether there exists any statutory, regulatory or administrative exemption applicable thereto. Moreover, each
Plan fiduciary should determine whether an investment in the Offered Certificates is appropriate for the Plan, taking into account
the overall investment policy of the Plan and the composition of the Plan’s investment portfolio.
 
The
U.S. Department of Labor has issued to J.P. Morgan Securities LLC an individual prohibited transaction exemption, PTE 2002-19,
67 Fed. Reg. 14,979 (March 28, 2002), as amended by PTE 2013-08, 78 Fed. Reg. 41,090 (July 9, 2013) (the “Exemption”).
The Exemption generally exempts from the application of the prohibited transaction provisions of Sections 406 and 407 of ERISA,
and the excise taxes imposed on prohibited transactions pursuant to Sections 4975(a) and (b) of the Code, certain transactions,
among others, relating to the servicing and operation of pools of mortgage loans, such as the pool of mortgage loans held by the
trust, and the purchase, sale and holding of mortgage pass-through certificates, such as the Offered Certificates, underwritten
by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, provided that certain conditions set forth in the Exemption are satisfied. The depositor
expects that the Exemption generally will apply to the Offered Certificates.
 
The
Exemption sets forth five general conditions that must be satisfied for a transaction involving the purchase, sale and holding
of the Offered Certificates to be eligible for exemptive relief. First, the acquisition of the Offered Certificates by an ERISA
Plan must be on terms (including the price paid for the Offered Certificates) that are at least as favorable to the ERISA Plan
as they would be in an arm’s-length transaction with an unrelated party. Second, the Offered Certificates at the time of
acquisition by the ERISA Plan must be rated in one of the four highest generic rating categories by at least one NRSRO that meets
the requirements of the Exemption (an “Exemption Rating Agency”). Third, the trustee cannot be an affiliate
of any other member of the Restricted Group other than an underwriter. The “Restricted Group” consists of any
underwriter, the depositor, the trustee, the master servicer, the special servicer, any sub-servicer, any entity that provides
insurance or other credit support to the trust fund and any borrower with respect to mortgage loans constituting more than 5% of
the aggregate unamortized principal balance of the mortgage loans as of the date of initial issuance of the Offered Certificates,
and any affiliate of any of the foregoing entities. Fourth, the sum of all payments made to and retained by the underwriters must
represent not more than reasonable compensation for underwriting the Offered Certificates, the sum of all payments made to and
retained by the depositor pursuant to the assignment of the mortgage loans to the trust fund must represent not more than the fair
market value of the mortgage loans and the sum of all payments made to and retained by the master servicer, the special servicer
and any sub-servicer must represent not more than reasonable compensation for that person’s services under the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement and reimbursement of the person’s reasonable expenses in connection therewith. Fifth, the investing ERISA
Plan must be an accredited investor as defined in Rule 501(a)(1) of Regulation D under the Securities Act.
 
It is a condition of the issuance of the
Offered Certificates that they have the ratings described above required by the Exemption and the depositor believes that each
of the Rating Agencies qualifies as an Exemption Rating Agency. Consequently, the second general condition set forth above will
be satisfied with respect to the Offered Certificates as of the Closing Date. As of the Closing Date, the third general condition
set forth above will be satisfied with respect to the Offered Certificates. In addition, the depositor believes that the fourth
general condition set forth above will be satisfied with respect to the Offered Certificates. A fiduciary of an ERISA Plan contemplating
purchasing an Offered Certificate in the secondary market must make its own determination that, at the time of purchase, the Offered
Certificates continue to satisfy the second general condition set forth above. A fiduciary of an ERISA Plan contemplating purchasing
an Offered Certificate, whether in the initial issuance of the Offered Certificates or in the secondary market, must make its own
determination that the first and fifth general conditions set forth above will be satisfied with respect to the related Offered
Certificate.
 
The Exemption also requires that the trust
fund meet the following requirements: (1) the trust fund must consist solely of assets of the type that have been included in other
investment pools; (2) certificates in those other investment pools must have been rated in one of the four highest categories by
at least one
 


S-404
 
 
of the Exemption Rating Agencies for at least one year prior to the ERISA Plan’s acquisition of Offered Certificates;
and (3) certificates in those other investment pools must have been purchased by investors other than ERISA Plans for at least
one year prior to any ERISA Plan’s acquisition of Offered Certificates.
 
The depositor believes that the conditions
to the applicability of the Exemption will generally be met with respect to the Offered Certificates, other than those conditions
which are dependent on facts unknown to the depositor or which it cannot control, such as those relating to the circumstances of
the ERISA Plan purchaser or the ERISA Plan fiduciary making the decision to purchase any such Offered Certificates.
 
If
the general conditions of the Exemption are satisfied, the Exemption may provide an exemption from the restrictions imposed by
Sections 406(a) and 407(a) of ERISA (as well as the excise taxes imposed by Sections 4975(a) and (b) of the Code by reason of Sections
4975(c)(1)(A) through (D) of the Code) in connection with (1) the direct or indirect sale, exchange or transfer of Offered Certificates
in the initial issuance of Certificates between the depositor or the underwriters and an ERISA Plan when the depositor, any of
the underwriters, the trustee, the master servicer, the special servicer, a sub-servicer or a borrower is a party in interest with
respect to the investing ERISA Plan, (2) the direct or indirect acquisition or disposition in the secondary market of the Offered
Certificates by an ERISA Plan and (3) the holding of Offered Certificates by an ERISA Plan. However, no exemption is provided from
the restrictions of Sections 406(a)(1)(E), 406(a)(2) and 407 of ERISA for the acquisition or holding of an Offered Certificate
on behalf of an “Excluded Plan” by any person who has discretionary authority or renders investment advice with respect
to the assets of the Excluded Plan. For purposes of this free writing prospectus, an “Excluded Plan”
is an ERISA Plan sponsored by any member of the Restricted Group.
 
If certain specific conditions of the Exemption
are also satisfied, the Exemption may provide an exemption from the restrictions imposed by Sections 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of ERISA
and the taxes imposed by Section 4975(c)(1)(E) of the Code in connection with (1) the direct or indirect sale, exchange or transfer
of Offered Certificates in the initial issuance of Certificates between the depositor or the underwriters and an ERISA Plan when
the person who has discretionary authority or renders investment advice with respect to the investment of Plan assets in those
Certificates is (a) a borrower with respect to 5% or less of the fair market value of the mortgage loans or (b) an affiliate of
that person, (2) the direct or indirect acquisition or disposition in the secondary market of Offered Certificates by an ERISA
Plan and (3) the holding of Offered Certificates by an ERISA Plan.
 
Further, if certain specific conditions
of the Exemption are satisfied, the Exemption may provide an exemption from the restrictions imposed by Sections 406(a), 406(b)
and 407(a) of ERISA, and the taxes imposed by Sections 4975(a) and (b) of the Code by reason of Section 4975(c) of the Code for
transactions in connection with the servicing, management and operation of the pool of mortgage loans.
 
A fiduciary of an ERISA Plan should consult
with its counsel with respect to the applicability of the Exemption. The fiduciary of a Plan not subject to ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code, such as a governmental plan, should determine the need for and availability of exemptive relief under applicable Similar
Law. A purchaser of an Offered Certificate should be aware, however, that even if the conditions specified in one or more exemptions
are satisfied, the scope of relief provided by an exemption may not cover all acts which might be construed as prohibited transactions.
In particular, a Plan fiduciary should note that one of the Mortgaged Properties is located in Canada. Plan fiduciaries should
consult with their advisors as to whether the Plan could continue to own an interest in the Offered Certificates if the Mortgaged
Property located in Canada were acquired by the trust, whether by foreclosure or otherwise.
 
THE SALE OF OFFERED CERTIFICATES TO A
PLAN IS IN NO RESPECT A REPRESENTATION BY THE DEPOSITOR OR ANY OF THE UNDERWRITERS THAT THIS INVESTMENT MEETS ANY RELEVANT LEGAL
REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO INVESTMENTS BY PLANS GENERALLY OR ANY PARTICULAR PLAN, OR THAT THIS INVESTMENT IS APPROPRIATE FOR
PLANS GENERALLY OR ANY PARTICULAR PLAN.

Certain
Legal Aspects of the Mortgage Loans
 
The following discussion summarizes certain
legal aspects of mortgage loans secured by real property in Illinois and Pennsylvania that is general in nature. This summary does
not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable federal and state laws governing the
mortgage loans.
 
Illinois.
Twenty (20) of the Mortgaged Properties identified as “Hilton Suites Chicago Magnificent Mile”, “Civic Opera
Building”, “Palmer House Retail Shops”, “U-Haul Portfolio – Evanston”, “U-Haul Portfolio
– South Shore”, “U-Haul Portfolio – Aurora”, “Brunswick Portfolio – BZ Randall Road Consolidated”,
“Brunswick Portfolio – BZ Romeoville Consolidated”, “Brunswick Portfolio – BZ River Grove”,
“Brunswick Portfolio – Brunswick’s Buffalo Grove”, “Brunswick Portfolio – BZ Mt Prospect”,
“Brunswick Portfolio – BZ Deer Park”, “Brunswick Portfolio – BZ Woodridge”, “Brunswick
Portfolio – BZ Roselle”, “Brunswick Portfolio – BZ Glendale Heights”, “Brunswick Portfolio
– BZ Hawthorn Lanes”, “Brunswick Portfolio – BZ Fountain Square”, “Town & Country Shopping
Center”, “Mattoon Market Place” and “Prospect Industrial Center” on Annex A-1 to this free writing
prospectus, securing or partially securing eight (8) mortgage loans representing approximately 21.5% of the Initial Pool Balance
by allocated loan amount are in Illinois. Mortgage loans in Illinois are generally secured by mortgages on the related real estate.
Foreclosure of a mortgage in Illinois is accomplished by judicial foreclosure. There is no power of sale in Illinois. After an
action for foreclosure is commenced and the lender secures a judgment, the judgment of foreclosure will provide that the property
be sold at a sale in accordance with the Illinois Mortgage Foreclosure Law (Article 15 of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure)
on such terms and conditions as specified by the court on the judgment of foreclosure if the full amount of the judgment is not
paid prior to the scheduled sale. A sale may be conducted by any judge, sheriff or private third-party. The notice of sale shall
set forth, among other things, the time and location of such sale. Generally, the foreclosure sale must occur after the expiration
of the applicable reinstatement and redemption periods or waiver thereof. During this period, a notice of sale must be published
once a week for 3 consecutive weeks in the county in which the property is located, the first such notice to be published not more
than 45 days prior to the sale and the last such notice to be published not less than 7 days prior to the sale. Illinois does recognize
a right of redemption, but such right may be waived by a borrower in the mortgage. Illinois does not have a “one action rule”
or “anti-deficiency legislation.” Subsequent to a foreclosure sale, the court conducts a hearing to confirm the sale
and enters an order confirming the sale. In the order confirming the sale pursuant to the judgment of foreclosure, the court shall
enter a personal judgment for deficiency against any party (i) if otherwise authorized and (ii) to the extent requested in the
complaint and proven upon presentation of a report of sale and to the extent personally served. In certain circumstances, the lender
may have a receiver appointed.
 
Pennsylvania.
Twenty-one (21) of the Mortgaged Properties identified as “U-Haul Portfolio – Philadelphia”, “U-Haul Portfolio
– Wilkes-Barre”, “U-Haul Portfolio – Cheltenham”, “U-Haul Portfolio – Overbrook”,
“U-Haul Portfolio – Roxborough”, “U-Haul Portfolio – Reading”, “U-Haul Portfolio –
Lebanon”, “The Outlet Shoppes at Gettysburg”, “Park Place I & II Portfolio”, “Brunswick
Portfolio – BZ Belle Vernon”, “Robinson Plaza”, “Langhorne Shopping Center”, “Chow Triple
Net Retail Portfolio I – Chipotle - Pittsburgh, PA”, “Walnut Multifamily Portfolio”, “Hawthorne Townhomes”,
“Guardian Self Storage - Liberty Avenue”, “Chippewa Towne Centre” and “Frankford Square” on
Annex A-1 to this free writing prospectus, securing or partially securing twelve (12) mortgage loans representing 12.4% of the
Initial Pool Balance by allocated loan amount are in Pennsylvania. Mortgage loans in Pennsylvania are generally secured by mortgages
on the related real estate. Foreclosure of a mortgage is accomplished by foreclosure in judicial proceedings. Such proceedings
are regulated by statutes and rules and subject throughout to the court’s equitable powers. Public notice of the judgment
of foreclosure and sale and the amount of the judgment is given for a statutory period of time after which the mortgaged real estate
is sold by a sheriff at public auction. The proceeds received by the sheriff from the sale are applied first to the cost and expenses
of the sale, then to any liens entitled to priority over the mortgage, such as liens for real estate taxes, and then in satisfaction
of the indebtedness secured by the mortgage. After satisfaction of any other liens, the remaining proceeds are generally payable
to the mortgagor. There is no right of redemption after foreclosure sale in Pennsylvania. In certain circumstances, deficiency
judgments may be obtained. The remedy of appointment of a receiver for the mortgaged real estate is available and is sometimes
used.
 


S-406
 
 
Other
Aspects. Please see the discussion under “Certain Legal Aspects of Mortgage Loans” in the prospectus
regarding other legal aspects of the mortgage loans that you should consider prior to making any investment in the certificates.
 
Legal
Investment
 
No class of the Offered Certificates will
constitute “mortgage related securities” for purposes of the Secondary Mortgage Market Enhancement Act of 1984, as
amended. The appropriate characterization of the certificates under various legal investment restrictions, and thus the ability
of investors subject to these restrictions to purchase the Offered Certificates, are subject to significant interpretive uncertainties.
 
No representations are made as to the proper
characterization of the Offered Certificates for legal investment, financial institution regulatory, or other purposes, or as to
the ability of particular investors to purchase the Offered Certificates under applicable legal investment restrictions. Further,
any ratings downgrade of a class of certificates to less than an “investment grade” rating (i.e., lower than
the top four rating categories) by a Rating Agency or another NRSRO, whether initially or as a result of a ratings downgrade, may
adversely affect the ability of an investor to purchase or retain, or otherwise impact the regulatory characteristics of, that
Class. The uncertainties described above (and any unfavorable future determinations concerning the legal investment or financial
institution regulatory characteristics of the certificates) may adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the certificates.
 
Accordingly, all investors whose investment
activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities
should consult with their own legal advisors in determining whether and to what extent the Offered Certificates will constitute
legal investments for them or are subject to investment, capital, or other regulatory restrictions. See “Legal Investment”
in the prospectus.
 
The
issuing entity will be relying on an exclusion or exemption from the definition of “investment company” under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), contained in Section 3(c)(5) of the Investment
Company Act or Rule 3a-7 as a basis for not registering under the Investment Company Act, although there may be additional exclusions
or exemptions available to the issuing entity. The issuing entity was structured so as not to constitute a “covered fund”
for purposes of the Volcker Rule under the Dodd-Frank Act.
 
Legal
Matters
 
The validity of the certificates will be
passed upon for the depositor by Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP and for the underwriters by Sidley Austin LLP. In addition,
material federal income tax matters will be passed upon for the depositor by Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP.

(1)Moody’s,
  Fitch, DBRS and KBRA have informed us that the “sf” designation in their
  respective ratings represents an identifier for structured finance product ratings. For
  information about this identifier, prospective investors can go to the website of the
  applicable Rating Agency. The depositor, issuing entity and the underwriters have not
  verified, do not adopt and do not accept responsibility for any statements made by the
  rating agencies on their Internet websites. Credit ratings referenced throughout this
  material are forward-looking opinions about credit risk and express a rating agency’s
  opinion about the ability of and willingness of an issuer of securities to meet its financial
  obligations in full and on time. Ratings are not indications of investment merit and
  are not buy, sell or hold recommendations, a measure of asset value, or an indication
  of the suitability of an investment.
 
It is a condition to their issuance that
the Offered Certificates receive investment grade credit ratings from each of the four Rating Agencies.
 
The ratings address the likelihood of the
timely receipt of distributions of interest by the Certificateholders to which they are entitled and, the ultimate distribution
of principal by the Rated Final Distribution Date. The ratings of the Offered Certificates should be evaluated independently from
similar ratings on other types of securities. The ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, a measure of
asset value or an indication of the suitability of an investment, and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by any
Rating Agency. In addition, these ratings do not address: (a) the likelihood, timing, or frequency of prepayments (both voluntary
and involuntary) and their impact on interest payments or the degree to which such prepayments might differ from those originally
anticipated, (b) the possibility that a Certificateholder might suffer a lower than anticipated yield, (c) the likelihood of receipt
of yield maintenance charges, prepayment charges, prepayment premiums, prepayment fees or penalties, default interest or post-anticipated
repayment date additional interest, (d) the likelihood of experiencing any Prepayment Interest Shortfalls, an assessment of whether
or to what extent the interest payable on any class of Offered Certificates may be reduced in connection with any Prepayment Interest
Shortfalls, or of receiving Compensating Interest Payments, (e) the tax treatment of the Offered Certificates or effect of taxes
on the payments received, (f) the likelihood or willingness of the parties to the respective documents to meet their contractual
obligations or the likelihood or willingness of any party or court to enforce, or hold enforceable, the documents in whole or in
part, (g) an assessment of the yield to maturity that investors may experience, (h) the likelihood, timing or receipt of any payments
of interest to the holders of the Offered Certificates resulting from an increase in the interest rate on any underlying mortgage
loan in connection with a mortgage loan modification, waiver or amendment, (i) Excess Interest, or (j) other non-credit risks,
including, without limitation, market risks or liquidity.
 
The ratings take into consideration the
credit quality of the underlying Mortgaged Properties and the mortgage loans, structural and legal aspects associated with the
Offered Certificates, and the extent to which the payment stream of the mortgage loans is adequate to make payments required under
the Offered Certificates. However, as noted above, the ratings do not represent an assessment of the
 


S-408
 
 
likelihood, timing or frequency
of principal prepayments (both voluntary and involuntary) by the borrowers, or the degree to which such prepayments might differ
from those originally anticipated. In general, the ratings address credit risk and not prepayment risk. Ratings are forward-looking
opinions about credit risk and express an agency’s opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer of securities to
meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Ratings are not indications of investment merit. In addition, the ratings do
not represent an assessment of the yield to maturity that investors may experience or the possibility that the Certificateholders
of the Class X-A and Class X-B certificates might not fully recover their initial investment in the event of delinquencies or defaults
or rapid prepayments on the mortgage loans (including both voluntary and involuntary prepayments) or the application of any realized
losses. In the event that holders of such certificates do not fully recover their investment as a result of rapid principal prepayments
on the mortgage loans, all amounts “due” to such holders will nevertheless have been paid, and such result is consistent
with the ratings assigned to such certificates.
 
As indicated in this free writing prospectus,
holders of the Class X-A and Class X-B certificates are entitled only to payments of interest on the related mortgage loans. If
the mortgage loans were to prepay in the initial month, with the result that the holders of the Class X-A and Class X-B certificates
receive only a single month’s interest and therefore, suffer a nearly complete loss of their investment, all amounts “due”
to such holders will nevertheless have been paid, and such result is consistent with the rating received on the Class X-A and Class
X-B certificates. The Notional Amounts of the Class X-A and Class X-B certificates on which interest is calculated may be reduced
by the allocation of realized losses and prepayments, whether voluntary or involuntary. The ratings do not address the timing or
magnitude of reductions of such Notional Amount, but only the obligation to pay interest timely on the Notional Amount, as so reduced
from time to time. Therefore, the ratings of the Class X-A and Class X-B certificates should be evaluated independently from similar
ratings on other types of securities.
 
Although the depositor will prepay fees
for ongoing rating surveillance by certain of the Rating Agencies, the depositor has no obligation or ability to ensure that any
Rating Agency performs ratings surveillance. In addition, a Rating Agency may cease ratings surveillance if the information furnished
to that Rating Agency is insufficient to allow it to perform surveillance.
 
Additionally, other NRSROs that we have
not engaged to rate the Offered Certificates may nevertheless issue unsolicited credit ratings on one or more classes of Certificates,
relying on information they receive pursuant to Rule 17g-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise.
If any such unsolicited ratings are issued, we cannot assure you that they will not be different from or lower than any ratings
assigned to the Offered Certificates by any other NRSRO. The issuance of an unsolicited rating of a class of the Offered Certificates
that is lower than the ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies engaged by the depositor may adversely impact the liquidity, market
value and regulatory characteristics of that class.
 
As part of the process of obtaining ratings
for the Offered Certificates, the depositor had initial discussions with and submitted certain materials to five (5) NRSROs. Based
on preliminary feedback from those NRSROs at that time, the depositor selected Moody’s, Fitch, DBRS and KBRA to rate the
Offered Certificates and not the other NRSRO, due in part to those NRSROs’ initial subordination levels for the various classes
of certificates. Had the depositor selected such other NRSRO to rate the Offered Certificates, we cannot assure you as to the ratings
that such other NRSRO would have ultimately assigned to the Offered Certificates. In addition, had the depositor engaged the other
NRSRO to rate the Offered Certificates, the ratings of those classes of the Offered Certificates that were not ultimately rated
by that Rating Agency may have been different, and potentially lower, than the ratings ultimately assigned to the Offered Certificates.
Although unsolicited ratings may be issued by any NRSRO, relying on information obtained pursuant to Rule 17g-5 or otherwise, an
NRSRO might be more likely to issue an unsolicited rating if it was not selected after having provided preliminary feedback to
the depositor. In the case of Moody’s and Fitch, the depositor only requested ratings for certain classes of rated certificates,
due in part to the final subordination levels provided by Moody’s or Fitch, as applicable, for such classes of certificates.
If the depositor had selected either Moody’s or Fitch to rate those other classes of rated certificates not rated by it,
its ratings of those other certificates may have been different, and potentially lower, than those ratings ultimately assigned
to those certificates by DBRS and KBRA.
 


S-409
 
 
Furthermore, the SEC may determine that
any or all of the Rating Agencies no longer qualifies as an NRSRO, or is no longer qualified to rate the Offered Certificates,
and that determination may have an adverse effect on the liquidity, market value and regulatory characteristics of the Offered
Certificates.

(2)
Certain of the mortgage loans include parcels ground leased to tenants in the calculation of the
total square footage and the occupancy of the mortgaged property.

 



With respect to Loan No. 8, The Outlet Shoppes at Gettysburg, the collateral is held as a leasehold
interest subject to a ground lease with an affiliated ground lessor and the lender has a mortgage on the affiliated entity's fee
interest. As such, the Title Type is presented as Fee.

 



With respect to Loan No. 20, North Miami Business Park, approximately 9% of the mortgaged property
is leased to tenants using their respective spaces as self-storage spaces, which typically operate on short-term leases.

 



With respect to Loan No. 48, Guardian Self Storage - Liberty Avenue, approximately 13.7% of the
underwritten revenues are attributable to leases for office use.

 



With respect to Loan No. 74, Lake Erie MHC, three of the total 162 units are apartment units and

(3)
In certain cases, mortgaged properties may have tenants that have executed leases that were included

With respect to Loan No. 1, Hilton Suites Chicago Magnificent Mile, 7.6% of total UW Revenues ($)
is comprised of other departmental revenue. Departmental revenue is generated from parking, which is operated by a third party,
LAZ Parking. LAZ Parking provides the mortgaged property with 37.5% of its gross parking revenue up to $1.1 million and 60% of
its gross parking revenue in excess of $1.1 million. Other departmental revenue also includes guest communications revenue and
lease revenue from two restaurant leases.

 



With respect to Loan No. 5, U-Haul Portfolio, approximately 21.8% of the trailing 12-month annualized
income was attributable to moving, vehicle leasing or “other” business. Approximately 3.3% of UW Revenues ($) is related
to such business.

 



With respect to Loan No. 7, First National Building, the Largest Tenant, Title Source, Inc., subleases

With respect to all mortgage loans, with the exceptions of the mortgage loans listed below, the
Current LTV % and the Maturity LTV % are based on the “as-is” Appraised Value ($) even though, for certain mortgage
loans, the appraiser provided “as-stabilized” or other hypothetical values based on certain criteria being met.

 



With respect to Loan No. 1, Hilton Suites Chicago Magnificent Mile, the Appraised Value ($) represents
the “as if complete” hypothetical value of $112,400,000, which assumes that the current renovations related to the
property improvement plan have been completed. The “as-is” value as of July 7, 2015 was $102,100,000, which results
in a Current LTV % of approximately 75.7% and a Maturity LTV % of approximately 69.6%.

 



With respect to Loan No. 2, Civic Opera Building, the Appraised Value ($) represents the “hypothetical
market value assuming the contractual tenant improvements and free rent abatements are escrowed” of $220,000,000 for the
mortgaged property, effective as of June 2, 2015, which assumes that all contractual free rent abatements and outstanding tenant
improvements have been paid. The “as-is” value for the property as of June 2, 2015 was $214,000,000, which results
in a Current LTV % of 76.6% and a Maturity LTV % of 67.4%.

 



With respect to Loan No. 5, U-Haul Portfolio, the Appraised Value ($) is calculated based on the
portfolio value of $458,000,000, which includes a premium of 7.8% for the value of selling the portfolio together. This methodology
results in a Current LTV % of approximately 34.6% and a Maturity LTV % of approximately 0.0%. If based on individual aggregate
appraised values of $424,700,000, the Current LTV % is 37.3%.

 



With respect to Loan No. 9, One Shell Square, the Appraised Value ($) represents the “market
value subject to hypothetical condition” of $180,600,000 for the mortgaged property, effective as of April 24, 2015, which
assumes that all capital expenditures, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and free rent (with an estimated cost of $42.6
million) have been paid. The "as-is" value for the property as of April 24, 2015 was $138,000,000, which results in a
Current LTV % of 91.4% and a Maturity LTV % of 75.3%.

(1) In the case of Loan No 13 which has an anticipated
  repayment date, Original Term to Maturity/ARD, Remaining Term to Maturity/ARD, Stated Remaining Term (Mos.) and LTV Ratio
  at Maturity/ARD are as of the anticipated repayment date.

(2) In the case of Loan Nos. 2, 5, 7, 9, 13, 14, 16 and 17, the UW
  NCF DSCR, UW NOI DY, Cut-off Date LTV Ratio and LTV Ratio at Maturity/ARD calculations include the related Pari Passu Companion
  Loans. In the case of Loan No. 5, the UW NCF DSCR, UW NOI DY, Cut-off Date LTV Ratio and LTV Ratio at Maturity/ARD calculations
  exclude the related Subordinate Companion Loan.

(3) In the case of Loan No. 5, the UW NCF DSCR is calculated using
  the average of principal and interest payments over the first 12 months following the cutoff date based on the principal payment
  schedule provided in Annex F of the Free Writing Prospectus.

(4) In the case of Loan Nos. 1, 2, 9, 12, 14 and 22, the Cut-off
  Date LTV Ratio and the LTV Ratio at Maturity/ARD are calculated based upon an appraised value based on certain hypothetical
  assumptions. In the case of Loan No. 5, the loan-to-value ratio was calculated based on the portfolio value rather than the
  individual appraised values, which includes a premium for the value of selling the portfolio in its entirety.

(1)
The
  increase in TTM NOI from 2014 NOI is primarily due to an increase in ADR.




(2)
The
  Additional Debt Balance refers to the original balance of the unsecured debt. See “Additional
  Debt” below for additional details.




(3)
The
  Appraised Value / Per Room, Cut-off Date LTV and Maturity Date LTV are calculated based
  on the “as if complete” value, which assumes that the proposed renovations
  to the property have been completed. At closing, the borrower reserved $10,158,748 for
  the renovations. The “as-is” value as of July 7, 2015 is $102.1 million,
  which results in a Cut-off Date LTV and Maturity Date LTV of 75.7% and 69.6%, respectively.




(4)
For
  a full description of Escrows and Reserves, please refer to “Escrows and Reserves”
below.




(5)
Monthly

The Sponsor. The loan sponsor
and nonrecourse carve-out guarantor is CMS/Procaccianti Hospitality Holdings III, L.P. The Procaccianti
Group serves as general partner for the loan sponsor. Founded in 1964, The Procaccianti Group is a second generation privately-held
real estate investment and management company. Since 1964, The Procaccianti Group has owned or managed real estate assets totaling
more than 50 million square feet with a value exceeding $5 billion. As of September 2015, The Procaccianti Group’s portfolio
included 63 hotel properties located in 25 states totaling 17,554 rooms. 
 
The Hilton Suites
Chicago Magnificent Mile property was acquired in a larger transaction by a partnership between The Procaccianti Group (2.0%)
and CMS/Och-Ziff (98.0%) in June 2005. Och-Ziff held a preferred equity interest in the property, which was paid off with this
financing. Since acquisition, the loan sponsor has invested over $15.7 million ($45,491 per room) in capital improvements, of which
approximately $6.0 million was completed at the property between 2011 and May 2015. According to the loan sponsor, capital improvements
in 2011 alone totaled $3.6 million, which included renovations to the guest rooms, general area, lobby, ballroom and conference
room renovations. At origination, approximately $10.2 million ($29,446 per room) was reserved to complete renovations related to
a property improvement plan (“PIP”). The PIP renovations are expected to include a full renovation of guest
rooms and suites, exterior façade project, full lobby upgrade, full renovation of public restrooms, renovation of a private
dining room, fitness center and pool facilities, modernized elevator system and roof replacement. According to the loan sponsor,
renovations are projected to result in minimal revenue displacement as the work is expected to be completed during the lower occupancy
months of December through April.

which are connected to downtown Chicago via the Chicago Transit Authority’s “L” train rapid transit system. As
of May 2015, the “L” had an average weekday passenger boarding of 779,134. Access to the “L” transit system
is located a half mile from the hotel. According to the appraisal, as of 2014, the population within a three-mile and five-mile

The appraisal identified one hotel under construction
and one proposed hotel as competitive with the Hilton Suites Chicago Magnificent Mile. The 452-room Curio by Hilton is expected
to open in 2016 and the 196-room Marriott Autograph Collection Streeterville hotel is projected to open in 2017. According to the
appraisal, both hotels are projected to operate at a higher price point, and are therefore considered secondary competitors.

Property Management. The
property is managed by TPG Hospitality, Inc., which is an affiliate of the borrower and The Procaccianti Group.
The Procaccianti Group and its principals have over 25 years of experience managing hotels. TPG Hospitality, Inc. has managed
over 100 hotels surpassing 20,000 guest rooms throughout major submarkets within 25 states. The senior management team at TPG Hospitality,
Inc. has an average of 25 years of experience in all aspects of hotel operations. The current management
agreement commenced on June 30, 2005, and was amended and extended on June 30, 2015 for a term of 10 years and six months and provides
for a contractual management fee of 3.0% of gross revenues and other amounts collected from tenants plus an incentive management
fee of 1.0% of gross revenues if the return on equity has equaled or exceeded 10.0%. The management fees are subordinate to the
liens and interests of the loan.
 
Franchise Agreement. The
property has a franchise agreement with HLT Existing Franchise Holding LLC. The current franchise agreement commenced on June 30,
2005 for a term of 20 years and provides for a 4.0% program fee based on room revenue on a monthly basis and a 5.0% royalty fee
based on room revenue on a monthly basis.
 
Escrows and Reserves. At
origination, the borrower deposited into escrow approximately $10.2 million for renovation reserves associated with the PIP, approximately
$1.2 million for seasonality reserves, $370,863 for real estate taxes, $63,144 for FF&E reserves and $8,563 for insurance premiums.

 
Tax Escrows –
On a monthly basis, the borrower is required to escrow 1/12 of the annual estimated tax payments, which currently equates to $123,621.

ANNEX A-3
 
JPMBB
  2015-C32

 

Hilton
  Suites Chicago Magnificent Mile

 
Insurance Escrows
– The requirement for the borrower to make monthly deposits to the insurance escrow is waived
as long as (i) no event of default has occurred and is continuing and the borrower provides satisfactory
evidence that the property is insured as part of a blanket policy in accordance with the loan documents, or (ii) no event
of default has occurred and is continuing and the borrower provides evidence to the lender that
it is paying insurance premiums in accordance with the loan documents and deposits into escrow an amount equal to 115% of a regularly
scheduled monthly installment due under the lender premium financing agreement.
 
FF&E Reserves – On a monthly
basis, the borrower is required to deposit an amount equal to (i) 3.0% of gross revenues from the closing date to the second anniversary
of the origination date and (ii) thereafter 4.0% of gross revenues, in each case for the two calendar months prior to such payment
date for FF&E.
Seasonality Reserve
– On the payment dates in May through October of each calendar year, commencing on the payment date in May 2016, the
borrower is required to deposit an amount equal to 1/6 of the amount which, when added to net operating income, would cause the
debt service coverage ratio as calculated in the loan documents for the immediately preceding disbursement period (the months of
December through March) to equal 1.00x. The amount of the deposit for each year is determined by the lender in February of that
year, commencing in 2016, based on the borrower’s revenues during the previous months.
Lockbox / Cash Management. The
loan is structured with a CMA lockbox. The borrower was required to deliver tenant direction letters and written instructions to
credit card companies to deposit all revenues into a restricted account controlled by the lender. The funds are then returned to
an account controlled by the borrower until the commencement of a Trigger Event (as defined below). During the continuance of a
Trigger Event, all funds in the lockbox account are swept to a segregated cash management account under the control of the lender.
To the extent that a Trigger Event is continuing, all excess cash flow after payment of the mortgage debt service, required reserves
and operating expenses will be held as additional collateral for the loan. The lender has a first priority security interest in
the cash management account.
 
A “Trigger Event” means (i)
the occurrence of an event of default, (ii) the bankruptcy or insolvency action of the borrower or property manager or (iii) the
debt service coverage ratio as calculated in the loan documents based on the trailing 12-month period
being less than 1.25x at the end of a calendar quarter.
 
Additional Debt. The
borrower entered into an agreement with the franchisor, HLT Existing Franchise Holding LLC, to receive $3.0 million for renovations
of the Hilton Suites Chicago Magnificent Mile property. The franchisor will provide the renovation funds incrementally as requested.
For each requested incremental advance of funds, the borrower will deliver a disbursement request to the franchisor. There
is no obligation to repay this amount unless the franchise agreement is terminated prior to its stated expiration date or the borrower
fails to complete the renovation work on the terms set forth in the franchise agreement. The borrower’s
obligations to repay these funds, if any, are unsecured. If the franchise agreement is terminated prior to the expiration
date, the unamortized portion of this key money financing will be payable to the franchisor. The amortization is calculated on
a straight line basis over the 20 year term of the franchise agreement. The loan documents include a nonrecourse carve-out to the
borrower and guarantor for any losses associated with this financing.

(1)
The
  Civic Opera Building loan is part of a loan evidenced by two pari passu notes
  with an aggregate original principal balance of $164.0 million. The Financial Information
  presented in the chart above reflects the Cut-off Date balance of the $164.0 million
  Civic Opera Building Whole Loan.




(2)
The
  increase in 2013 NOI from 2012 NOI is primarily due to the lease-up of the property resulting
  in an 8.4% increase in occupancy year-over-year.




(3)
The
  increase in 2014 NOI from 2013 NOI is primarily due to the lease-up of the property resulting
  in an 8.2% increase in occupancy year-over-year.




(4)
The
  increase in TTM NOI from 2014 NOI is primarily due to the lease-up of the property resulting
  in a 2.6% increase in occupancy.




(5)
The
  increase in UW NOI from TTM NOI is primarily due to income associated with new leases
  signed over the previous 24 months and the expiration of related free rent, as well as
  contractual rent escalations underwritten through August 2016, which account for approximately
  $714,037 in base rent.




(6)
The
  Appraised Value / Per SF, Cut-off Date LTV and Maturity Date LTV are calculated based
  on the “hypothetical market value assuming contractual tenant improvements and
  free rent are escrowed.” At closing, the borrower reserved $3,711,165 for free
  rent and $2,407,592 for outstanding tenant improvements. The “as-is” value
  as of June 2, 2015 is $214.0 million, which results in a Cut-off Date LTV and Maturity
  Date LTV of 76.6% and 67.4%, respectively.

The
Loan. The Civic Opera Building loan is secured by a first mortgage lien on a 44-story, 915,162 square foot office building
located in Chicago, Illinois. The whole loan has an outstanding principal balance as of the Cut-off Date of $164.0 million (the
“Civic Opera Building Whole Loan”), and is comprised of two pari passu notes, Note A-1 and Note A-2.
Note A-2, with an outstanding principal balance as of the Cut-off Date of $75.0 million, is being contributed to the JPMBB 2015-C32
Trust. Note A-1 has an outstanding principal balance as of the Cut-off Date of $89.0 million and was contributed to the JPMBB
2015-C31 trust. The holder of Note A-1 (the “Controlling Noteholder”) is the trustee of the JPMBB 2015-C31
trust. The trustee of the JPMBB 2015-C31 trust (or, prior to the occurrence and continuance of a control event under the related
pooling and servicing agreement, the directing certificateholder for that securitization), will be entitled to exercise all of
the rights of the Controlling Noteholder with respect to the Civic Opera Building Whole Loan; however, the holder of Note A-2
will be entitled, under certain circumstances, to be consulted with respect to certain major decisions. The Civic Opera Building
Whole Loan has a 10-year term and, subsequent to a three-year interest-only period, will amortize on a 30-year schedule. The previous
existing debt was securitized in the UBSCM 2012-C1 transaction. 
 
The
Borrower. The borrowing entity for the Civic Opera Building Whole Loan is SL Civic Wacker LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company and special purpose entity. 
 
The

on June 29, 2015, has a 12-month term and will automatically renew each year on a 12-month term, unless otherwise terminated by
either party. The management agreement provides for a contractual management fee of 3.0% of gross income, payable on a monthly
basis. The management fees related to the Civic Opera Building property are subordinate to the liens and interests of the Civic

Escrows and Reserves. At origination,
the borrower deposited into escrow approximately $3.7 million for free rent reserves, $3.0 million for future tenant improvements
and leasing commissions, approximately $2.4 million for outstanding tenant improvements, approximately $1.7 million for real estate
taxes, $838,578 for required repairs, $369,695 for elevator replacements and repairs, and $15,253 for replacement reserves.
 
Tax Escrows - On a monthly basis, the
borrower is required to escrow 1/12 of the annual estimated tax payments, which currently equates to $294,167.
 
Insurance Escrows - The requirement for
the borrower to make deposits to the insurance escrow is waived so long as no event of default has occurred and is continuing and
the borrower provides satisfactory evidence that the property is insured as part of a blanket policy in accordance with the loan
documents.
 
TI/LC Reserves - On a monthly
basis, the borrower is required to escrow $95,330 (approximately $1.25 per square foot annually) for future tenant improvements
and leasing commissions. The reserve is not subject to a cap.
 
Elevator Work Reserves - On a monthly
basis until the payment date in February 2019, the borrower is required to escrow $61,616 (approximately $0.81 per square foot
annually) for elevator replacements and repairs. The reserve is not subject to a cap.
 
Replacement Reserves - On a monthly basis,
the borrower is required to escrow approximately $15,253 (approximately $0.20 per square foot annually) for replacement reserves.
The reserve is not subject to a cap.
 
Extended Free Rent Reserves - To the
extent there is a Cash Sweep Event (as defined below) caused solely by an Extended Free Rent Trigger Event (as defined below),
all excess cash flow after payment of debt service, other reserves and operating expenses is required to be deposited in a free
rent reserve pursuant to the loan agreement. The reserve is capped at $780,440.
 
Lockbox / Cash Management.
The loan is structured with a hard lockbox and in-place cash management. At origination, the borrower was required to send
a tenant direction letter to all tenants at the property instructing them to deposit all rents and payments into the lockbox account.
All funds in the lockbox account are swept daily to a segregated cash management account under the control of the lender. Except
as described above, to the extent there is a Cash Sweep Event continuing, all excess cash flow after payment of the mortgage and
mezzanine debt service, required reserves and operating expenses will be held as additional collateral for the loan. The lender
has a first priority security interest in the cash management account.
 
A “Cash Sweep Event” means
the occurrence of (i) an event of default (ii) any involuntary bankruptcy action of the borrower or bankruptcy action of the property
manager, (iii) the date on which the debt service coverage ratio (as calculated in the loan documents) based on a trailing three
months is less than 1.20x or (iv) the payment date occurring in October 2018 (an “Extended Free Rent Trigger Event”).

  House Retail Shops

 
The
Property. The Palmer House Retail Shops comprise the 134,536 square foot retail, office and parking garage
components of the historic Palmer House Hilton Hotel located along Monroe Street, State Street and Wabash Avenue in the central
business district of Chicago, Illinois. The property consists of 54,136 square feet of retail space, 14,400 square feet of office
space and a 66,000 square-foot, 166-space parking garage located at the base of the landmark Palmer House Hilton Hotel.
 
An affiliate of Thor Equities acquired the
1,639-room Palmer House Hilton Hotel in September 2005, along with the collateral office, retail and parking components. According
to the loan sponsor, subsequent to the acquisition, over $170.0 million was invested into capital improvements to the overall structure.
Of the total capital improvements, approximately $35.7 million was allocated to the Palmer House Retail Shops and utilized to construct
new store fronts, re-demise the interiors, convert a portion of the second floor area along State Street to retail use, install
new base building HVAC systems, upgrade existing utilities and life safety systems, convert the basement into a parking garage
and pay tenant-related leasing costs. The 23-story Palmer House Hilton Hotel carries a AAA four-diamond rating and is one of the
longest continuously operating hotels in the United States. The hotel, the second largest in Chicago by room count, hosts tourists
and special events/conferences featuring over 130,000 square feet of meeting/event space with a 16,909 square foot exhibit hall,
77 breakout rooms and seven ballrooms, generating potential foot traffic for the collateral retail shops. The hotel is a member
of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation®.
 
As of June 22, 2015, the property was 95.0%
leased by 17 tenants including A’gaci, Kay Jewelers, Aldo and Starbucks. The retail spaces are situated along State Street,
Monroe Street and Wabash Avenue, and within the interior lobby of the Palmer House Hilton Hotel. The largest retail tenant, A’gaci,
leases 13.9% of the net rentable area through January 2025 with two five-year extension options remaining. Founded in 1974, A’gaci
is a privately-owned fashion retailer that has over 50 stores across the United States, an online store and two affiliate brands,
O’Shoes and Boutique Five. The second largest retail tenant, Kay Jewelers, leases 3.8% of the net rentable area through April
2028. Kay Jewelers is a jewelry retailer founded in 1916 with over 900 stores in the United States. Kay Jewelers’ parent
company, Signet Jewelers, is the largest specialty retail jeweler in the world.
 
ABM Parking Services leases the 166-space
underground parking garage, representing approximately 26.0% of underwritten rents in-place, through July 2025. ABM Parking Services
manages approximately 1,800 office and multi-use parking operations across the United States. ABM Parking Services is a subsidiary
of ABM Industries, Inc. (NYSE: ABM), a provider of facility solutions with 2014 revenues of approximately $5.0 billion and 118,000

various services include facilities engineering, commercial cleaning, energy solutions, HVAC, electrical, landscaping, parking
and security.

area, through April 2019. Hilton Complex Sales provides sales and booking reservation services for all three Chicago-area Hilton

According to the appraisal, the Palmer House
Retail Shops property is located in Chicago’s central business district, specifically the downtown district, in the area
generally known as the “Loop”. The downtown district is home to approximately 128.2 million square feet of office space,
over 10.0 million square feet of retail space and a daytime workforce population of over 0.5 million people. Additionally, the
property is situated along the historic State Street retail corridor, one block east of Millennium Park and the Art Institute of
Chicago. According to the appraisal, shopping along State Street in Chicago is considered second only to the Magnificent Mile,
with branches of the Magnificent Mile’s most popular stores located along State Street. The six-block State Street retail
corridor is anchored by a Macy’s location that is one of the largest department stores in the world, occupying an entire
city block with 1.4 million square feet. Other retailers along State Street include Anthropologie, Nordstrom Rack, H&M, Sears,
Target, Zara, TJ Maxx, Urban Outfitters, Gap, Off Saks Fifth Avenue and Forever 21. The Palmer House Retail Shops property is favorably
located on the eastern side of State Street between Macy’s and Target, each of whom occupies the adjacent block. Regular
pedestrian traffic along State Street generally consists of office workers, retail shoppers and college students. The number of
college students in the Loop has grown to approximately 60,000 due to the presence of Columbia College Chicago and DePaul University
in the immediate area.
 
The property is situated along the east
side of State Street at East Monroe Street, approximately three blocks north of Congress Street, the most direct connection between
the Loop and the expressway system. Access to the area is provided by Chicago’s Metra commuter train system which connects
the Loop to suburbs in all directions. Additionally, the property is close to several Chicago Transit Authority (“CTA”)
stations that house the Brown, Orange, Pink, Purple, Blue and Green lines which connect the area to Chicago O’Hare International
Airport in approximately 45 minutes. According to the appraisal, the property is located within Chicago’s City North retail
submarket which had year-end 2014 and second quarter 2015 vacancy rates of 4.2% and 2.8%, respectively. The appraisal determined
market rents based on the different locations of the rentable area at the property as shown in the table below.

The
  property is subject to a Class L Tax Property Tax Incentive. Underwritten real estate
  tax expense of $536,985 represents actual abated amounts due in 2015 in accordance with
  the tax incentive. Please refer to “Class L Property Tax Incentive”
  below for additional details.

 
Property
Management. The property is managed by Thor Equities, LLC, an affiliate of the loan sponsor.
 
Class
L Property Tax Incentive. The property currently benefits from a Class L Property Tax Incentive. The incentive allows
the property to have an assessment level that is less than the standard 25.0% of the taxing authority’s market value. The
property will be assessed at 10.0% of the taxing authority’s market value through the 10th year of the abatement
(tax year 2018), 15.0% in the 11th year (tax year 2019) and 20.0% in 12th year (tax year 2020), before reverting
back to 25.0% in tax year 2021. The Class L Property Tax Incentive is granted by Cook County (with the approval of the City of
Chicago) to encourage the preservation and rehabilitation of landmark commercial, industrial and income-producing not-for-profit
buildings. Renewal of the Class L Property Tax Incentive is not limited so long as the borrower continues to apply and the property
continues to qualify for the incentive program. In the event that the property is no longer eligible for the tax incentive, the
majority of the increase in property tax expense is anticipated to be recaptured through tenant reimbursements, as most tenants
at the property reimburse taxes over a base year in accordance with their leases.

Escrows
and Reserves. At origination, the borrower deposited into escrow $430,000 for future tenant improvements,
leasing commissions and free rent obligations, and $138,274 for real estate taxes.
 
Tax
Escrows - On a monthly basis, the borrower is required to escrow 1/12 of the annual estimated tax payment which currently
equates to $46,091.
 
Insurance
Escrows - The requirement for the borrower to make monthly deposits to the insurance escrow will be waived so long as
there is no event of default and the borrower provides the lender with evidence that the property is insured under an acceptable
blanket insurance policy.
 
Replacement
Reserves - On a monthly basis, the borrower is required to escrow $2,803 (approximately $0.25 per square foot annually)
for replacement reserves. The reserve is not subject to a cap.
 
TI/LC
Reserves - On a monthly basis, the borrower is required to escrow $11,211 (approximately $1.00 per square foot annually)
for future tenant improvements and leasing commissions. The reserve is not subject to a cap.
 
Lockbox
/ Cash Management. The loan is structured with a hard lockbox and in-place cash management. At origination, the
borrower was required to send a tenant direction letter to all tenants at the property instructing them to deposit all rents and
payments into the lockbox account. All funds in the lockbox account are swept daily to a segregated cash management account under
the control of the lender. Except as described above, to the extent a Cash Sweep Event (as defined below) is continuing, all excess
cash flow after payment of the monthly debt service, required reserves and operating expenses will be held as additional collateral
for the loan. The lender has a first priority security interest in the cash management account. 
 
A “Cash Sweep Event”
means the occurrence of (i) an event of default, (ii) the date on which the debt service coverage ratio, as calculated in the loan
documents, falls below 1.20x or (iii) A’gaci or ABM Parking Services either (a) giving notice of its intent to terminate
its lease or (b) not renewing its lease at least 18 months prior to the expiration of its lease.
 
Permitted
Mezzanine Debt. The loan agreement permits future mezzanine financing secured by the ownership interests in the
borrower upon satisfaction of certain terms and conditions which include, without limitation: (i) no event of default has occurred
and is continuing, (ii) the combined loan-to-value ratio, as calculated in the loan documents, does not exceed 95.0% of the loan-to-value
ratio on the origination date (approximately 63.7%, based on the Cut-off Date LTV), (iii) the debt service coverage ratio, as calculated
in the loan documents and including the mezzanine loan, is not less than 105.0% of the debt service coverage ratio on the origination
date (approximately 1.33x, based on the UW NCF DSCR), (iv) an acceptable intercreditor agreement has been executed and (v) rating
agency confirmation.
 
Reciprocal
Easement Agreement. The borrower is party to a three-member reciprocal easement agreement
with the respective owners of the hotel and non-collateral office components of the Palmer House. The agreement outlines the rights,
responsibilities and obligations of each owner, provides cross easements over building common areas (such as the parking floors)
and outlines each party’s proportional share of various expenses related to the common elements (roof, structure, etc.) and
management of common areas. The agreement may not be amended or terminated without the consent of all three members and any mortgagees
then secured by a mortgage on any portion of the Palmer House. See “Risk Factors—Retail Properties Have Special
Risks” in the Free Writing Prospectus.

Gateway
  Business Park

 
The Property. Gateway Business
Park is an eight-building office park totaling 514,047 square feet located in Mount Laurel, New Jersey. The park includes two sets
of buildings, the Fellowship Road Complex and the Gaither Drive Complex, both of which are collateral and are situated on opposite
sides of Fellowship Road, between the New Jersey Turnpike and Interstate 295. According to the appraisal, the properties have access
to both highways. The Fellowship Road Complex consists of three single-story buildings totaling 180,451 square feet and the Gaither
Drive Complex consists of five single-story buildings totaling 333,596 square feet. The buildings were built and completed between
1984 and 1987 and are situated on 50.721 acres. The office park contains 2,210 surface parking spaces, which provides for a parking
ratio of approximately 4.3 spaces per 1,000 square feet of net rentable area.
 
As of September 1, 2015, the property was
82.0% leased by 33 tenants. Other than the largest two tenants, no one tenant accounts for more than 5.9% of the total square feet.
There have been six new leases executed in 2015 totaling 30,062 square feet and one lease renewal for 40,115 square feet that is
currently being negotiated (see below for additional information). The property also includes 21 tenants that executed leases prior
to and including 2007 and account for 79.7% of the underwritten rents in place.
 
The largest tenant at the property, Canon
Financial Services, Inc. (“CFS”), leases 50,030 square feet and occupies an entire building (9.7% of the net
rentable area) within the Gaither Drive Complex. CFS operates all financing and leasing activities for Canon USA, Inc. (“Canon”)
in the United States. CFS is a wholly owned subsidiary of Canon, a leading provider of consumer, business-to-business and industrial
digital imaging solutions to the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean markets. The parent company, Canon Inc. (NYSE:
CAJ), is rated “Aa1 / AA” by Moody’s and S&P and ranks third overall in U.S. patents registered in 2014 and
is one of Fortune Magazine’s World’s Most Admired Companies in 2015. Gateway Business Park serves as CFS’s headquarters
and CFS has expanded twice since its original lease in 2001 from 34,940 square feet to 50,030 square feet. CFS renewed their lease
in 2005 and 2010 and has one five-year renewal option remaining. In addition to CFS’s space at the property, Canon also operates
a warehouse facility adjacent to the property, which is not part of the loan collateral, and uses the space to store copiers and
other inventory in conjunction with Canon’s operations at the property.
 
The second largest tenant at the property,
Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (“Jacobs”) (NYSE: JEC), leases 40,115 square feet (7.8% of the net rentable area)
and occupies approximately 59.1% of a building located in the Fellowship Road Complex. With 2014 revenues of nearly $13.0 billion,
Jacobs is one of the largest technical professional services firms in the world providing a diverse range of technical, professional
and construction services to a large number of industrial, commercial and governmental clients. Jacobs has been at the property
since 2003 and expanded its space in 2008. The current lease is due to expire in June 2016, however, according to the loan sponsor,
a lease amendment is currently being negotiated to extend the lease through December 31, 2025. Through an August 24, 2015 signed
lease estoppel, the tenant confirmed it expects to enter into the amendment. At closing, approximately $722,428 was escrowed for
Jacobs’ outstanding tenant improvements.
 
The Gateway Business Park buildings are
located on Fellowship Road, Gaither Drive and East Park Drive in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, an edge suburb of Philadelphia. The
property is situated between the New Jersey Turnpike and Interstate 295 with full interchanges to both highways located within
approximately 0.5 miles of the property. Fellowship Road is the main local roadway within the three-mile submarket commonly known
as East Gate, which according to the appraisal contains desirable residential communities and office locations in Southern New
Jersey. Given the area’s highway access, other land uses in the immediate area include hotels such as DoubleTree Suites and
Westin Hotel ML. The 1.1 million square foot Moorestown Mall and the 1.0 million square foot East Gate Shopping Center are located
approximately 0.5 miles west of the property. According to the appraisal, tenants at the property have numerous restaurant and
retail options within close proximity.
 
According to the appraisal, the estimated
2015 population within a one-, three- and five-mile radius is 3,621, 67,224 and 192,502 people, respectively, and the estimated
average household income is $106,982, $102,512 and $106,646, respectively. The property is located in the Northern Burlington County
submarket of the Southern New Jersey office market. The Southern New Jersey office market had an office inventory of approximately
47.4 million square feet, a total vacancy rate of 10.8% and average asking rents of $16.49 per square foot, all as of the second
quarter of 2015. The Northern Burlington County submarket had an office inventory of approximately 7.2 million square feet, a total
vacancy rate of 9.9% and average asking rents of $14.65 per square foot, all as of the second quarter of 2015. The current in-place
office triple-net rental rate at the property is $12.26 per square foot, which is in line with the appraisal’s concluded
starting triple-net market rental rate of $12.25 per square foot.

Property Management. The
property is managed by EY&S Management 2011 Inc., a New York corporation and affiliate of the loan sponsor.
 
Escrows and Reserves. At origination,
the borrower deposited into escrow $2.0 million for future tenant improvement and leasing commissions, $1,007,678 for outstanding
tenant improvements, $204,435 for real estate taxes, $67,822 for free rent reserves and $38,347 for insurance reserves.
 
Tax Escrows - On a monthly basis,
the borrower is required to escrow 1/12 of the annual estimated tax payment which currently equates to $103,770.
 
Insurance Escrows - On a monthly
basis, the borrower is required to escrow 1/12 of the annual insurance premium, which currently equates to $12,231.
 
Replacement Reserves - On a monthly
basis, the borrower is required to escrow $8,567 (approximately $0.20 per square foot annually) for replacement reserves.
 
TI/LC Reserves - At closing, the
borrower reserved $2.0 million for future tenant improvements and leasing commissions and, if the total amount on deposit decreases
to less than $1,000,000, then on a monthly basis, the borrower is required to escrow $21,419 (approximately $0.50 per square foot
annually). The reserve is subject to a $1,000,000 cap (approximately $1.95 per square foot annually).
 
Lockbox / Cash Management. The
loan is structured with a CMA lockbox. At origination, the borrower was required to send tenant direction letters to tenants instructing
them to deposit all rents and payments directly to the lockbox account controlled by the lender. During the continuance of a Triggering
Event (as defined below), all funds in the lockbox account are swept daily to a cash management account under the control of the
lender and disbursed on each monthly payment date during the term of the loan in accordance with the loan documents. To the extent
that there is a Triggering Event continuing, all excess cash flow after payment of debt service, required reserves and operating
expenses will be held as additional collateral for the loan.
 
A “Triggering Event”
means the period commencing upon the earlier of: (i) an event of default and (ii) the debt service coverage ratio, as calculated
in the loan documents, is less than 1.15x.

The U-Haul Portfolio is
part of a loan co-originated by JPMCB and Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. and is comprised of (i) a mortgage loan with an aggregate
original principal balance of $50.0 million, (ii) two companion loans, each of which is pari passu with the U-Haul Portfolio
Mortgage Loan (each such companion loan comprised of one or more pari passu notes), with an aggregate original principal
balance of approximately $109.0 million and (iii) a subordinate companion loan (comprised of two pari passu notes) with
an aggregate original principal balance of $111.0 million. The Financial Information presented in the chart above reflects the
approximately $158.3 million aggregate Cut-off Date balance of the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan and the U-Haul Portfolio Pari
Passu Companion Loans and the aggregate Cut-off Date balance of the approximately $269.3 million U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan.




(2)
Moody’s, Fitch, DBRS
and KBRA have confirmed that the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan has, in the context of its inclusion in the mortgage pool, credit
characteristics consistent with an investment grade obligation.




(3)
For a full description of
the borrowers, please refer to “The Borrowers” below.




(4)
The U-Haul Portfolio Whole
Loan has a 20-year original and amortization term; however, the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan, which is included in the JPMBB
2015-C32 Trust, is scheduled to fully amortize over 10 years. The lockout period will be at least 25 payments beginning with and
including the first payment date of October 1, 2015. Defeasance of the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan is permitted two years from
the closing date of the securitization that includes the last U-Haul Portfolio pari passu note to be securitized.




(5)
The annual increases in
NOI are due to increases in rents in place and other income. Other income includes U-Box net income
(portable storage boxes), third party lease income (cell towers, billboards and other signage), intercompany lease income (truck
and trailer repair shops, marketing company offices, third-party retail centers, manufacturing shops and administrative offices),
net sales (moving and storage supplies), U-Move net commissions (rentals of moving trucks, moving trailers and other moving equipment)
and miscellaneous income (shipping costs, package insurance and other income).




(6)
UW Revenues includes other
income. Approximately 21.8% of the TTM NOI was attributable to such sources.




(7)
CBRE, Inc. appraised the
U-Haul Portfolio as of June 11, 2015 on a portfolio basis and on a property-by-property basis as of various dates in May or June
2015. The U-Haul Portfolio value was appraised at $458,000,000, which is reflective of the value of the U-Haul Portfolio as a
whole, if sold in its entirety to a single buyer. The aggregate value of the individual properties totaled $424,700,000. The Cut-off
Date LTV ratio for the Whole Loan based on the aggregate value of the individual properties is 63.4%.




(8)
For a full description of
Escrows and Reserves, please refer to “Escrows and Reserves” below.




(9)
The most recent prior financing
of the U-Haul Portfolio was included as part of a cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted loan group in the MSC 2005-HQ6 and
WBCMT 2005-C20 transactions as U-Haul I, U-Haul III, U-Haul IV and U-Haul VI. The prior financing of $125,116,005 was repaid in
full in January 2015.

ANNEX A-3
 
JPMBB 2015-C32

 

U-Haul
  Portfolio






 
The Loan. The U-Haul
Portfolio Whole Loan is secured by a first mortgage lien on the borrowers’ fee simple interests and, in certain cases,
leasehold interests in a 2,663,398 square foot, 32,519-unit self-storage portfolio consisting of 105 properties and 319
recreational vehicle (“RV”) parking spaces located across 35 states. The U-Haul Portfolio loan is
evidenced by a non-controlling pari passu note with an
aggregate outstanding principal balance as of the Cut-off Date of approximately $49.7 million (the “U-Haul Portfolio
Mortgage Loan”), and represents a portion of a fixed rate loan in the aggregate original principal balance of
$270.0 million (the “U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan” or “Whole Loan”) which was
co-originated by JPMCB and Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. The U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan is pari passu with two
companion loans (such companion loans being comprised in the aggregate of three pari passu notes) with an aggregate
outstanding principal balance as of the Cut-off Date of approximately $108.7 million (the “U-Haul Portfolio Pari
Passu Companion Loans”) and a subordinate companion loan (comprised of two pari
passu notes) with an aggregate outstanding principal balance as of the Cut-off Date of $111.0 million (the
“U-Haul Portfolio Subordinate Companion Loan” and, together with the U-Haul Portfolio Pari
Passu Companion Loans, the “U-Haul Portfolio Companion Loans”). The U-Haul Portfolio Companion
Loans are not included in the JPMBB 2015-C32 Trust.
 
The U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan and the
related U-Haul Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loans are pari passu in
right of payment with each other and are generally senior in right of payment to the U-Haul Portfolio Subordinate Companion Loan,
each as and to the extent described in “Description of the Mortgage
Pool—The Whole Loans—The U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan” in the Free Writing Prospectus. One of the U-Haul
Portfolio Pari Passu Companion Loans and the U-Haul Subordinate Companion Loan are being contributed to a private CMBS securitization
that governs the servicing and administration of the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan. The remaining U-Haul Portfolio Pari Passu Companion
Loan is expected to be included in a separate securitization in the future. The holder of the U-Haul Portfolio Companion Loans
being contributed to the private CMBS securitization (the “Controlling Noteholder”) will be the trustee (the
“U-Haul Portfolio Trustee”) under the trust and servicing agreement (the “U-Haul Portfolio Trust and
Servicing Agreement”) entered into in connection with such private CMBS securitization. The U-Haul Portfolio Trustee
(or, prior to the occurrence and continuance of a control event under the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement, the controlling
class representative under the U-Haul Portfolio Trust and Servicing Agreement) will be entitled to exercise all of the rights of
the Controlling Noteholder with respect to the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan. The U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan has a 20-year original
and amortization term; however, the U-Haul Portfolio Mortgage Loan, which is included in the JPMBB 2015-C32 Trust, is scheduled
to fully amortize over 10 years. The previous existing debt was securitized in the MSC 2005-HQ6 and WBCMT 2005-C20 transactions.
 

 
The Borrowers. The
borrowing entities for the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan are U-Haul Co. of Florida 8, LLC, U-Haul
Co. of Florida 9, LLC, U-Haul Co. of Florida 10, LLC, UHIL 8, LLC, UHIL 9, LLC, UHIL 10, LLC, UHIL 13, LLC, AREC 8, LLC, AREC 9,
LLC, AREC 10, LLC and AREC 13, LLC, each a Delaware limited liability company and special purpose entity.
 

The Sponsor. The
U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan sponsor and nonrecourse carve-out guarantor
is AMERCO (NASDAQ: UHAL), which serves as the holding company for U-Haul International, Inc. (“U-Haul”). U-Haul
is one of the largest North American operators of self-storage facilities and has been serving do-it-yourself movers since its

Lockbox / Cash Management.
The U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan is structured with a CMA lockbox. The borrowers are required to cause the property managers to
deposit all revenues into the lockbox account controlled by the lender. Funds deposited into the deposit account will be disbursed
to the borrowers’ operating account until the occurrence of a Cash Sweep Period (as defined below). During a Cash Sweep Period,
the funds in the deposit account will be swept to a segregated cash management account under the control of the lender. After the
occurrence and during the continuance of a Cash Sweep Period, the funds in the deposit account will be disbursed in accordance
with the Whole Loan documents.
 
A “Cash Sweep
Period” means (i) an event of default; (ii) a DSCR Trigger Event (as defined below); (iii) a Tax/Insurance Trigger Event
(as defined below) or (iv) any bankruptcy action of the property managers.
 
A
“DSCR Trigger Event” is in effect if the Whole Loan debt service coverage ratio (as calculated in the U-Haul
Portfolio Whole Loan documents) is less than 1.10x for two consecutive calendar quarters, and it
will end if the Whole Loan debt service coverage ratio is at least 1.10x for four consecutive calendar quarters.
 
A “Tax/Insurance
Trigger Event” means either(i) the borrowers’ failure to provide timely evidence of payment of taxes or
(ii) the borrowers’ failure to provide timely evidence that the properties are insured, each in accordance with the provisions
of the U-Haul Portfolio Whole Loan documents.

other conditions, such alterations will not have a material adverse effect on the borrowers’ financial condition, the value
of the applicable property or the applicable property’s net operating income, and provided further that such alterations
are made in connection with (i) the restoration of a property after the occurrence of a casualty or condemnation in accordance
with the terms and provisions of the loan documents, or (ii) the construction of additional storage units, U-Box storage or other
ancillary U-Haul business purposes on the property in compliance with the terms and conditions of the loan documents and that such
alterations (a) comply with certain legal requirements and (b) do not require the borrowers to incur any additional indebtedness
to undertake such construction. Following completion of any such improvements at any individual property, the borrowers will provide
to the lender an as-built survey and an endorsement to the lender’s loan policy of title insurance updating the effective
date of such policy to the date of such endorsement and showing no liens or encumbrances other than (1) permitted encumbrances
and (2) the lien for current real estate taxes not yet due and payable.

provided that, among other conditions, the borrowers provide the lender with: (i) an environmental report showing no hazardous
materials or risk of contamination at the adjacent property, (ii) a new title insurance policy and current survey covering the
adjacent property, (iii) evidence that the adjacent property is insured in accordance with the loan documents and (iv) evidence

be encumbered by the lien of the mortgage on the related mortgaged property.
 
After Acquired Leasehold Property.
The borrowers may acquire a leasehold estate in property that is not contiguous to an existing property that is operated as a storage
facility, provided that, among other conditions: (i) the borrowers deliver an environmental report showing
no hazardous materials or risk of contamination at the adjacent property, a current survey and evidence that the adjacent
property is insured in accordance with the loan documents, (ii) fee simple title in the acquired property is owned by an affiliate
of the guarantor, (iii) the borrowers shall have executed and delivered to the lender a lease in the form attached to the loan
agreement, which will not be recorded and (iv) the leased property is operated only as a remote storage facility, U-Box storage

Frandor Shopping Center

 
Property Management. The
property is managed by Corr Commercial Real Estate, Inc., a Florida corporation. The current management agreement has been
extended twice and expires in July 2016 with one five-year renewal option remaining. Corr Commercial Real Estate, Inc. is entitled
to a base management fee of 3.0% of gross rental income. The management fees are subordinate to the liens and interest of the Frandor
Shopping Center loan.
 
Escrows and Reserves. At origination,
the borrower deposited approximately $1.3 million into the TJ Maxx and Kirkland’s reserve for future tenant improvements
and leasing commissions, $92,424 into the free rent reserve for a free rent period for TJ Maxx and Kirkland’s and $72,269
for deferred maintenance.
 
Tax Escrows - On a monthly basis,
the borrower is required to escrow 1/12 of the annual estimated tax payments, which currently equates to $56,853.
 
Insurance Escrows - The requirement
for the borrower to make monthly deposits to the insurance escrow is waived so long as no event of default exists and the borrower
provides satisfactory evidence that the property is insured as part of a blanket policy in accordance with the loan documents.
 
Replacement Reserves - On a monthly
basis, the borrower is required to escrow $9,961 (approximately $0.26 per square foot annually) for replacement reserves. The reserve
is subject to a cap of $358,594 (approximately $0.79 per square foot).
  
TI/LC Reserves
- On a monthly basis, the borrower is required to deposit $16,667 (approximately $0.44 per square foot annually) for future
tenant improvements and leasing commissions. The reserve is subject to a cap of $600,000 (approximately $1.32 per square
foot).
 
Lockbox / Cash Management. The
loan is structured with a CMA lockbox. The borrower and property manager are required to deposit all rents into the lockbox account
controlled by the lender. All funds in the lockbox account are returned to an account controlled by the borrower until the occurrence
of a Trigger Event (as defined below). After the occurrence of a Trigger Event, all funds on deposit in the lockbox account will
be swept to a cash management account, and all excess cash flows after payment of debt service, required reserves and operating
expenses are required to be held as additional collateral for the loan.
 
A “Trigger Event” means
a period commencing upon the earliest of (i) the occurrence of an event of default and (ii) the debt service coverage ratio, as
calculated in the loan documents, being less than 1.25x for two consecutive calendar quarters on a trailing six-month basis annualized.

(1)
The
  First National Building loan is part of a loan evidenced by two pari passu notes
  with an aggregate original principal balance of $70.0 million. The Financial Information
  presented in the chart above reflects the Cut-off Date balance of the $70.0 million First
  National Building Whole Loan.




(2)
The
  negative 2012 NOI is primarily due to the property being under significant renovations
  during that year. According to the loan sponsor, the property was acquired in 2011 with
  less than 50.0% occupancy, and it subsequently spent approximately $110.0 million on
  renovations, with the majority of 2012 leasing occurring in the second half of the year.




(3)
The
  increase in 2014 NOI from 2013 NOI is primarily driven by the impact of rent abatements
  in the form of lower rents given to new tenants after the renovations in 2011 and 2012.




(4)
The
  increase in UW NOI from TTM NOI is due to the inclusion of contractual rent steps through
  August 2016 totaling approximately $337,975, the expiration of prior rent abatements
  and the newly executed Honigman Miller Schwartz & Cohn LLP (“Honigman”)
  lease.

principal balance as of the Cut-off Date of $30.0 million and is expected to be contributed to a future securitization trust. The
holder of Note A-1 (the “Controlling Noteholder”) is the trustee of the JPMBB 2015-C32 Trust. The trustee of
the JPMBB 2015-C32 Trust (or, prior to the occurrence and continuance of a control event under the pooling and servicing agreement,
the directing certificateholder), will be entitled to exercise all of the rights of the Controlling Noteholder with respect to
the First National Building Whole Loan; however, the holder of Note A-2 will be entitled, under certain circumstances, to be consulted
with respect to certain major decisions. The First National Building Whole Loan has a five-year term and, subsequent to a two-year
interest-only period, will amortize on a 30-year schedule.
 
The Borrower. The borrowing
entity for the First National Building loan is 660 Woodward Associates LLC, a Michigan limited liability company and special purpose
entity.
 
The Sponsor. The nonrecourse carve-out
guarantor is Zup Ventures LLC, an affiliate of the loan sponsor, Rock Ventures. Rock Ventures is the CRE investment vehicle of
Dan Gilbert. Dan Gilbert is the founder of Quicken Loans, the country’s largest online home lender, and the owner of the
Cleveland Cavaliers. Since 2010, the loan sponsor has acquired more than 70 properties in Detroit with a value of approximately
$1.7 billion, making Rock Ventures the largest property owner in the city. Bedrock Real Estate Services, the full service property
management firm of Rock Ventures, manages more than 80 assets totaling approximately 13.0 million square feet in Detroit. The loan
sponsor purchased the property for approximately $8.1 million in 2011, when occupancy was less than 50.0% and the property was
not generating any operating income. According to the loan sponsor, since 2011 it has spent more than $110.0 million to completely
renovate the property. Upgrades included a lobby and exterior façade renovation, a new building integration system, parking
deck repairs and the installation of universal card readers.
 
The Property. The First National
Building property consists of a 26-story building with 840,436 square feet of Class A office space and the adjoining parking garage.
The First National Building property was constructed in 1921 and is situated on approximately 1.06 acres. The First National Building,
originally designed by architect Albert Kahn, is known as a unique asset in the Detroit market. The “Z” shape of the
property maximizes the natural light and ventilation to the office spaces. Tenants at the property also have access to the adjoining
parking garage that offers 472 spaces, or 0.56 spaces per 1,000 square feet, allocated solely for tenant use. Access to the First
National Building is provided by East Congress Street, Bates Street, Woodard Avenue and Cadillac Square. The Interstate 75 expressway
is located approximately 3.2 miles west of the property, and provides direct access to Interstate 94 and Interstate 96. These expressways
will all have access to Interstate 275 in early 2016, and Congress Station (a station on the light rail system) will be located
across from the property. This will serve as easy access to many of Detroit’s most popular attractions, including the new
approximately $650.0 million Detroit Events Center, which upon completion will be the location of the new Red Wings arena.
 
As of July 28, 2015, the property was 92.0%
occupied by 37 tenants. The largest tenant at the property, Title Source, Inc. (“TSI”) leases 53.7% of the net
rentable area through January 2023 and has occupied the space since July 2012. Affiliated with the loan sponsor, TSI is the largest
independent provider of title insurance, property valuations and settlement services in the nation and the leading provider of
settlement services for residential and commercial lending institutions. TSI is recognized as a preferred provider for five of
the top 20 Fortune 100 companies and was named as a Detroit Free Press Top Workplace for the past six years. The property serves
as the global headquarters for TSI, which accounts for approximately 60.3% of the in-place base rent at the property. The second
largest tenant, Honigman, leases approximately 25.4% of the net rentable area through November 2025 and has occupied the space
since 1948. Honigman has executed a 10-year lease extension and will pay new rental rates ranging from $10.00 to $23.50 per square
foot, with a weighted average of $21.09 per square foot. Honigman is a business law firm serving clients both nationally and internationally
and is one of the 100 largest law firms in the nation. Honigman is currently headquartered at the property and accounts for 29.3%
of the in-place base rent. The third largest tenant, United Way For Southeastern Michigan (“United Way SE”),
leases approximately 5.4% of the net rentable area through November 2018 and has occupied the space since December 2008. United
Way SE is the local branch of a national non-profit, United Way. United Way SE has partnered with the Greater Detroit community
to improve local communities. United Way SE accounts for approximately 2.2% of the in-place base rent at the property. Since the
beginning of 2015, the loan sponsor has executed five new or renewal leases, including Honigman. These leases account for 223,770
square feet (approximately 26.6% of the net rentable area).

First National Building


 


The
First National Building property is located in the central business district of Detroit. The property is adjacent to Campus Martius
Park, located in downtown Detroit. Many demand drivers are located less than one mile from the property, including the Theatre
District, Comerica Park and Ford Field. The Detroit Medical Center, with approximately 12,000 employees and more than 2,000 licensed
beds, is 2.0 miles north. All of these locations will be accessible from the M1 Light Rail System. The property also benefits
from its proximity to major public transportation lines, including Amtrak, which is located 4.3 miles north, and the Canadian
rail service, which is accessible from the Windsor Train Terminal and located immediately across the Detroit River. Additionally,
the property is located approximately 20.1 miles northeast of the Detroit-Metropolitan Wayne Country Airport.
 
According
to the appraisal, the property is located in the Detroit central business district office submarket. As of the second quarter
of 2015, the submarket consisted of 161 buildings totaling approximately 26.5 million square feet of office space with an overall
vacancy rate of 14.0% and average rents of $20.80 per square foot. This compares to 15.2% and $20.07 per square foot, respectively,
when compared with the first quarter of 2015. The appraisal identified six directly comparable office properties built between
1917 and 2006 ranging in size from 245,862 to 957,355 square feet. The comparable office properties reported occupancies ranging
from 97.0% to 100.0% with a weighted average of approximately 99.7%. Asking rents for the comparable office properties range from
$19.40 to $25.00 per square foot. The appraisal concluded an office market rent of $22.50. The average in-place rent for the property
is $19.28 per square foot, which is below the appraisal’s concluded office market rents. The appraisal also identified five
mixed-use properties with comparable retail rentals. Asking rents for the comparable retail properties range from $19.50 to $21.80
per square foot. The appraisal concluded a retail market rent of $23.00 per square foot. Additionally,
the appraisal identified twelve comparable parking garage properties ranging in size from 440 spaces to 1,850 spaces. The daily
rates at the comparable garages ranged from $5.00 to $18.00 per space with monthly rates ranging from $75.00 to $264.00.

The
  increase in Underwritten Rents in Place from TTM Rents in Place is due to the inclusion
  of contractual rent steps through August 2016 totaling approximately $337,975, the expiration
  of prior rent abatements and the newly executed Honigman lease.




(4)
The
  negative 2012 Net Operating Income is primarily due to the property being under significant
  renovations during that year. According to the loan sponsor, the property was acquired
  in 2011 with less than 50.0% occupancy, and it subsequently spent approximately $110.0
  million on renovations, with the majority of 2012 leasing occurring in the second half
  of the year.



 

Property
Management. The First National Building property is managed by Bedrock Management Services LLC, a Michigan limited liability
company and an affiliate of the loan sponsor. The current management agreement commenced on August 23, 2011, has a five-year term
and will automatically renew for successive three-year periods unless otherwise terminated by either party. The management agreement
provides for a contractual management fee of 4.0% of gross income, payable on a monthly basis. The management fees related to
the First National Building property are subordinate to the liens and interests of the First National Building loan.

ANNEX A-3
 
JPMBB 2015-C32

 

First National Building


 


Escrows and Reserves. At origination,
the borrower was required to deposit into escrow approximately $6.3 million for outstanding tenant improvements, approximately
$1.7 million for free rent, $563,811 for leasing commissions, $159,603 for real estate taxes, $35,018 for future tenant improvements
and leasing commissions and $14,007 for replacement reserves.
 
Tax Escrows - On a monthly basis, the
borrower is required to escrow 1/12 of the annual estimated tax payments, which currently equates to $30,991.
 
Insurance Escrows - The requirement for
the borrower to make deposits to the insurance escrow is waived so long as no event of default has occurred and is continuing and
the borrower provides satisfactory evidence that (a) the property is insured as part of a blanket policy in accordance with the
loan documents, and (b) the borrower has paid all required insurance premiums when due in accordance with the loan documents.
 
Replacement Reserves - On a monthly basis,
the borrower is required to escrow $14,007 (approximately $0.20 per square foot annually) for replacement reserves. The reserve
is capped at $336,174 (approximately $0.40 per square foot).
 
TI/LC Reserves - On a monthly basis,
the borrower is required to escrow $35,018 (approximately $0.50 per square foot annually) for tenant improvement and leasing commission
reserves. The reserve is capped at $850,000 (approximately $1.01 per square foot).
 
Lockbox / Cash Management.
The loan is structured with a CMA lockbox. Tenant direction letters were required to be sent to all tenants upon the origination
of the loan instructing them to deposit all rents and payments into the lockbox account controlled by the lender. The funds are
then returned to an account controlled by the borrower until the occurrence of a Cash Sweep Period (as defined below). During a
Cash Sweep Period, all funds in the lockbox account are swept daily to a segregated cash management account under the control of
the lender. During a Cash Sweep Period, all excess cash flow after payment of the mortgage debt service, required reserves and
operating expenses will be held as additional collateral for the loan. The lender has a first priority security interest in the
cash management account.
 
A “Cash Sweep Period” means
the occurrence of (i) an event of default, (ii) any bankruptcy action of the borrower, (iii) the date on which the debt service
coverage ratio, based on trailing three months of gross income from operations, is less than 1.15x or (iv) Tenant Trigger Event
(as defined below).
 
A “Tenant Trigger Event”
means any of the following: (i) notification from either Honigman or TSI of its intention to (a) terminate or not extend or renew
its lease (b) substantially or completely vacate its leased premises, or (c) not renew its lease on or prior to the required date
to renew as outlined in such lease, (ii) either Honigman or TSI “goes dark”, vacates or abandons its leased premises,
or (iii) either Honigman or TSI is or becomes subject to a bankruptcy action.

The
One Shell Square loan is part of a loan evidenced by two pari passu notes with an aggregate original principal balance
of $126.1 million. The Financial Information presented in the chart above reflects the Cut-off Date balance of the $126.1 million
One Shell Square Whole Loan.




(2)
Net
Rentable Area (SF) excludes 29,083 square feet of structurally vacant space located throughout the property. For the purposes
of underwriting, the space has been removed from any underwriting consideration.




(3)
The
decrease in 2014 NOI from 2013 NOI is driven predominately by a $244,788 increase in payroll expenses and a $214,785 increase
in repairs and maintenance expenses. The increase in payroll expenses was related to the hiring in March 2014 of a construction
manager, the hiring in November 2014 of an assistant chief engineer and the hiring in October 2014 of a chief engineer. The increase
in repairs and maintenance expenses was related to several one-time expenses including travertine for exterior step repair, replacement
of circuit breakers, rewiring of exterior tree lighting, replacement of elevator carpets and the purchase of two new auxiliary
tanks.




(4)
The
increase in UW NOI from TTM NOI (as of July 2015) is driven by Shell Oil Company’s base rent being averaged over the loan
term due to its high credit rating, which results in an approximately $1.3 million increase. Shell Oil Company will be vacating
the fifth and sixth floors but will be moving into floors 13 through 15 on January 1, 2017, which is reflected in the underwriting.
Underwritten NOI is driven by rent escalations underwritten through April 2016 totaling $46,000. Additionally, the higher UW NOI
versus TTM NOI (as of July 2015) is driven by decreased expenses, predominately related to a successfully protested assessed value
of the property resulting in approximately $372,354 in annual real estate tax savings and one-time maintenance and repair expenses
that occurred throughout the trailing 12-month period ended July 31, 2015.




(5)
The
Appraised Value / Per SF, Cut-off Date LTV and Maturity Date LTV are calculated based on the “market value subject to hypothetical
condition”, which assumes that all capital expenditures, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and free rent have been
paid. The “as-is” value as of April 24, 2015 is $138.0 million, which results in a Cut-off Date LTV and Maturity Date
LTV of 91.4% and 75.3%, respectively.

One
  Shell Square

 
The
Loan. The One Shell Square loan is secured by a first mortgage lien on a 51-story, 1,240,539 square foot office building
located in New Orleans, Louisiana. The whole loan has an outstanding principal balance as of the Cut-off Date of $126.1 million
(the “One Shell Square Whole Loan”) and is comprised of two pari passu notes, Note A-1 and Note A-2.
Note A-2 has an outstanding principal balance as of the Cut-off Date of $36.1 million and is being contributed to the JPMBB 2015-C32
Trust. Note A-1, which has an outstanding principal balance as of the Cut-off Date of $90.0 million, was contributed to the JPMBB
2015-C30 trust. The holder of Note A-1 (the “Controlling Noteholder”) is the trustee of the JPMBB 2015-C30
trust. The trustee of the JPMBB 2015-C30 trust (or, prior to the occurrence and continuance of a control event under the related
pooling and servicing agreement, the directing certificateholder for that securitization), will be entitled to exercise all of
the rights of the Controlling Noteholder with respect to the One Shell Square Whole Loan; however, the holder of Note A-2 will
be entitled, under certain circumstances, as described in the Free Writing Prospectus, to be consulted with respect to certain
major decisions. The One Shell Square Whole Loan has a 10-year term and, subsequent to a 12-month interest-only period, will amortize
on a 30-year schedule.
 
The
Borrower. The borrowing entity for the One Shell Square loan is HPT New Orleans
OSS, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and special purpose entity.
 
The
Sponsors. The loan sponsors and nonrecourse carve-out guarantors are William Z. Hertz, Isaac
Hertz and Sarah Hertz of the Hertz Investment Group, LLC. The Hertz Investment Group is a national real estate investment and
management company currently headquartered in Santa Monica, California. The company’s business plan focuses its acquisition
strategy towards secondary central business districts and state capitals. Since its founding in 1979 by Judah Hertz, the company
has grown to own and manage approximately 12.2 million square feet with an aggregate portfolio market value of approximately $1.2
billion. Currently, the Hertz Investment Group owns five other assets totaling approximately 2.5 million square feet of commercial
real estate in New Orleans.
 
The
Property. One Shell Square is a LEED Gold-certified Class A office building and adjoining 10-level parking garage located
at 701 Poydras Street in New Orleans, Louisiana. The One Shell Square property was constructed in 1972, renovated periodically
between 2004 and 2015 and is situated on approximately 1.99 acres. According to the loan sponsors, since 2010, the previous owners
spent approximately $3.4 million in capital expenditures, which was primarily spent on upgrades to the parking garage, lighting
panels and LEED related upgrades. The property, originally designed by architectural firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, is known
as an iconic asset in the New Orleans market and is the tallest building in both the city of New Orleans and state of Louisiana.
Additionally, a majority of the floors offer unobstructed views of the Mississippi River, French Quarter, Warehouse District and
central business district skyline. Office tenants at the property also benefit from the adjoining parking garage that offers 817
spaces allocated predominantly for tenant use and that are contracted on a monthly basis. Additionally, the adjoining parking
garage and interior lobby also contains several ground floor retail spaces consisting of, among other tenants, Capital One, Empire
State Delicatessen, Smoothie King and Subway. Access to the One Shell Square property is provided by Poydras Street, St. Charles
Avenue, Carondelet Street and Perdido Street. US Highway 90 is located approximately 0.7 miles south of the office property and
provides regional access, as well as direct access to Interstate 10.
 
As
of March 25, 2015, the property was 92.6% occupied by 56 tenants. The largest tenant at the property, Shell Oil Company (“Shell”),
leases 53.6% of the net rentable area through December 2026 and has occupied the space since June 2006. Shell may extend the lease
for an additional 20 years which can be structured as either four, five-year renewals or two, 10-year renewals or any combination
of the two. Shell is the United States-based subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell, one of the largest oil companies in the world. The
company is headquartered in The Hague, Netherlands and currently holds interests in 24 refineries, 1,500 storage tanks and 150
distribution facilities globally and, as of 2015, Shell was ranked the third largest company in the world in terms of revenue.
Shell will be vacating its space on the fifth and sixth floors of the property and will subsequently expand its space on the 13th
through 15th floors on January 1, 2017. Approximately $27.1 million of the $29.1 million upfront TI/LC reserve is attributable
to Shell which will be used for the specific build out required on the 13th through 15th floors as related to the new space. Additionally,
Shell accounts for approximately 57.8% of the in-place base rent at the property. The second largest tenant at the property, Adams
and Reese, LLP, (“Adams and Reese”), leases 7.1% of the net rentable area through November 2024 and has occupied
the space since November 2002. The tenant has three, five-year renewal options remaining. Adams and Reese is a law firm with a
strong presence in the southeastern United States and offers clients a wide array of services, from aerospace and aviation law
practice to music and entertainment law to mergers and acquisitions law. Adams and Reese accounts for approximately 7.6% of the
in-place base rent at the property. The third largest tenant, Liskow & Lewis, leases 5.9% of the net rentable area through
November 2019 and has occupied the space since July 2008. Originally founded in 1935, Liskow & Lewis has grown to more than
130 attorneys in New Orleans and Lafayette, Louisiana and Houston, Texas and the firm’s practice focuses on the energy and
oil and gas industries. The company accounts for approximately 7.1% of the in-place base rent at the property.

One
  Shell Square

 
One Shell Square is located in
the heart of the New Orleans central business district and many demand drivers lie within walking distance of the property, including
the French Quarter, Mercedes-Benz Superdome, City Hall, Port of New Orleans and six casinos. The property also benefits from its
proximity to major public transportation lines, including the Poydras Station, which is located five blocks east, and the Canal
Street Station, which is located six blocks northeast. Additionally, the property is located approximately 15.6 miles east of
Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport and approximately 4.0 miles east of Tulane University. According to the appraisal,
the property is located in the New Orleans central business district submarket of the New Orleans / Metairie / Kenner market.
As of the fourth quarter of 2014, the submarket consisted of 144 buildings totaling approximately 9.2 million square feet of office
space with an overall vacancy rate of 15.3% and average rents of $16.22 per square foot. This compares to 17.5% and $13.90 per
square foot, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2013. Additionally, Class A office properties compared favorably to the overall
New Orleans central business district submarket, with an overall vacancy rate of 8.2% and average rents of $18.32 per square foot
as of the fourth quarter of 2014. The appraisal identified seven directly comparable office properties built between 1979 and
1989 and ranging in size from approximately 540,783 to 1,004,484 square feet. Asking rents for the comparable properties range
from $12.00 to $20.00 per square foot, with a weighted average of $17.68 per square foot.

The
  increase in Underwritten Rents in Place from TTM Rents in Place is driven by Shell’s
  base rent being averaged over the loan term due to its high credit rating, which results
  in an approximately $1.3 million increase. Shell will be vacating the fifth and sixth
  floors but will be moving into floors 13 through 15 on January 1, 2017, which is reflected
  in the underwriting. Additionally, Underwritten Rents in Place are driven by rent escalations
  underwritten through April 1, 2016 totaling $46,000.



(4)

The
  lower Underwritten Total Expenses versus TTM Total Expenses is predominantly driven by
  a successfully protested assessed value of the property resulting in approximately $372,354
  in annual real estate tax savings and one-time maintenance and repair expenses that occurred
  throughout the trailing 12-month period ended July 31, 2015.



(5)

The
  decrease in 2014 Net Operating Income from 2013 Net Operating Income is driven predominantly
  by a $244,788 increase in payroll expenses and $214,785 increase in repairs and maintenance
  expenses. The increase in payroll expenses was related to the hiring of a construction
  manager in March 2014, the hiring of an assistant chief engineer in November 2014 and
  the hiring of a chief engineer in October 2014. The increase in repairs and maintenance
  expenses was related to several one-time expenses including travertine for exterior step
  repair, replacement of circuit breakers, rewiring of exterior tree lighting, replacement
  of elevator carpets and the purchase of two new auxiliary tanks.

renew for two consecutive periods of three years unless otherwise terminated by either party. The management agreement provides
for a contractual management fee of 5.0% of gross income, payable on a monthly basis. The management fees related to the One Shell

Escrows
and Reserves. At origination, the borrower was required to deposit into escrow approximately
$29.1 million for outstanding tenant improvements and leasing commissions, approximately $11.4 million for required repairs, approximately
$1.1 million for real estate taxes, $53,000 for future tenant improvements and leasing commissions reserves, $21,200 for replacement
reserves and $8,038 for free rent outstanding to one tenant. 
 
Tax
Escrows - On a monthly basis, the borrower is required to escrow 1/12 of the annual estimated tax payments, which currently
equates to $155,000.
  
Insurance
Escrows - The requirement for the borrower to make deposits to the insurance escrow is waived so long as no event of default
has occurred and is continuing and the borrower provides satisfactory evidence that the property is insured as part of a blanket
policy in accordance with the loan documents.
  
Replacement
Reserves - On a monthly basis, the borrower is required to escrow approximately $21,200 (approximately $0.21 per square foot
annually) for replacement reserves. The reserve is not subject to a cap. 
  
TI/LC
Reserves - On a monthly basis commencing on August 1, 2015, the borrower is required to escrow approximately $53,000 (approximately
$0.51 per square foot annually) for future tenant improvements and leasing commissions. On August 1, 2022, the borrower will be
required to escrow approximately $143,000 (approximately $1.38 per square foot annually) for future tenant improvements and leasing
commissions. The reserve is not subject to a cap. 
 
Lockbox
/ Cash Management. The loan is structured with a hard lockbox and in-place cash management. At origination, the borrower
was required to send a tenant direction letter to all tenants at the property instructing them to deposit all rents and payments
into the lockbox account. All funds in the lockbox account are swept daily to a segregated cash management account under the control
of the lender. To the extent that a Cash Sweep Period (as defined below) is continuing, all excess cash flow after payment of
the mortgage and mezzanine debt service, required reserves and operating expenses will be held as additional collateral for the
loan. The lender has a first priority security interest in the cash management account. 
 
A
“Cash Sweep Period” means the occurrence of (i) an event of default, (ii) any bankruptcy action of the borrower
or property manager, or (iii) the date on which the debt service coverage ratio, based on a trailing three months of gross income
from operations annualized and a 12 month operating expense calculation, is less than 1.10x. 
 
Additional
Debt. A $20.0 million mezzanine loan secured by direct equity interests in the borrower was originated by JPMCB and is
currently held by a third party investor. The mezzanine loan is coterminous with the mortgage loan. The mezzanine loan has a 10.12500%
coupon and is interest-only for the full term of the loan. Including the mezzanine loan, the Cut-off Date LTV is 80.9%, the UW
NCF DSCR is 1.39x and the UW NOI Debt Yield is 9.6%.

Park
  Place I & II Portfolio

 
The Sponsors. The loan sponsors
and nonrecourse carve-out guarantors are David A. Pearson, Paul A. Pearson, Jr. and John M. Pearson, principals of Fifth Avenue
Capital, LLC (“FAC”). FAC and its affiliates have been involved in real estate investments totaling over $700.0
million. FAC has invested in approximately 1,000 apartment units, in excess of four million square feet of commercial space and
over 1,000 acres of land for development.  
 
The
Properties. The Park Place I & II Portfolio is composed of two, five-story, Class A, LEED Gold certified
office properties with a total of 212,328 square feet located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, approximately
10 miles west of the Pittsburgh central business district and less than five miles from the Pittsburgh International Airport. The
Park Place I and II properties were constructed in 1983 and 1985, respectively, and fully renovated in 2012-2013 at an estimated
cost of over $11.0 million. The renovation included the addition of a parking structure to each building, new HVAC systems, structural
repairs, replacing the Park Place II roof, modernizing the elevators at both properties and first generation tenant build-out for
Park Place II. The portfolio was 94.7% occupied by six tenants, as of July 10, 2015. Approximately 74.7% of the net rentable area
has leases that are in-place through 2022 and approximately 53.0% of net rentable area is leased to a credit-rated tenant. The
portfolio is located along Parkway West (I-376), which acts as the main thoroughfare and connects downtown Pittsburgh to the eastern
and western suburbs. The surrounding area contains a mix of residential, retail, and office buildings and due to the challenging
topography and density of existing development, new development is scarce.
 
Park Place I.
Park Place I is a five-story, Class A office building totaling 99,847 square feet improved with an adjacent 286-space parking structure.
Total parking consists of 470 surface level spaces (approximately 4.71 per 1,000 square feet). The building was constructed in
1983 and renovated in 2012-2013. As of July 10, 2015, the property was 88.8% occupied by five tenants. The largest tenant, United
Lender Services Corp. (“ULS”), is headquartered at the property and after expanding by approximately 17,040
square feet in 2013, currently occupies approximately 46.1% of the net rentable area through June 30, 2025. ULS was founded in
2008 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of USAA Real Estate, a full service, national provider of appraisal, title and settlement
services for the residential and commercial real estate industry. The second largest tenant, Atlas Energy Group LLC (“Atlas”),
is headquartered at the property and occupies approximately 25.2% of the net rentable area through October 31, 2018. Atlas develops
and produces natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids in the United States and it is also involved in the terminalling, storage,
throughput, and transloading of crude oil and petroleum products in the East Coast, Gulf Coast, and Midwest regions. Atlas was
acquired in February 2015 by Targa Resources Corporation (rated Ba3 / B+ by Moody’s / S&P).
 
Park Place II.
Park Place II is a five-story, Class A office building totaling 112,481 square feet improved with an adjacent 283-space parking
structure. Total parking consists of 510 surface level spaces (approximately 4.53 per 1,000 square feet). The building was constructed
in 1985 and renovated in 2012-2013. As of July 10, 2015, the property was 100.0% occupied by Williams Field Services Group, LLC
(“Williams”) through March 31, 2023, with two five-year extension options remaining. Williams is a subsidiary
of Williams Partners L.P. (Baa2 / BBB / BBB by Moody’s / S&P / Fitch), a master limited partnership that is also a guarantor
under the lease. The parent company, Williams Companies, Inc., is rated Baa3 / BB+ / BBB- by Moody’s / S&P / Fitch. 
 
The Williams Companies,
Inc. was founded in 1908 and, including its assets held through Williams Partners, L.P., is an energy infrastructure company focused
on connecting North America’s hydrocarbon resource plays to growing markets for natural gas, natural gas liquids and olefins.
The company owns and operates midstream gathering and processing assets and interstate natural gas pipelines.  The company
owns and operates the Transco natural gas network, a 10,200 mile fuel link providing natural gas to the northeastern and southeastern
states and its compressor stations help move gas from the Gulf Coast to 12 Southeast and Atlantic Seaboard states, including major
metropolitan areas in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. On September 28, 2015, Williams Companies, Inc. announced that it
has agreed to be acquired by Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. or a subsidiary thereof (“ETE”) (Ba2 / BB / BB+ by
Moody’s / S&P / Fitch ), though it is anticipated that Williams Partners L.P. will continue to operate as a separate
entity.

Escrows and Reserves. At origination,
the borrowers deposited into escrow $377,000 for deferred maintenance, $250,000 for future tenant improvements and leasing commissions,
$141,954 for real estate taxes and $13,972 for insurance reserves.
 
Tax Escrows - The borrowers
are required to escrow 1/12 of the annual estimated tax payments monthly, which currently equates to a monthly payment of $47,318.
 
Insurance Escrows -
The borrowers are required to escrow 1/12 of the annual estimated insurance payments monthly, which
currently equates to a monthly payment of $3,493.
 
Replacement
Reserves - On a monthly basis, the borrowers are required to escrow $5,875 (approximately
$0.33 per square foot annually) for replacement reserves.

 
TI/LC Reserves
- On a monthly basis, the borrowers are required to escrow $8,847 (approximately $0.50 per
square foot annually) for future tenant improvements and leasing commissions, unless the credit rating of both (i) Williams Companies,
Inc. (“WMB”) falls below the Current WMB Rating (as defined below), and (ii) Williams Partners, L.P. (“WPZ”)
falls below the Current WPZ Rating (as defined below) by any two or more of Moody’s, Fitch or S&P, then the amount of
required monthly deposits into the TI/LC reserve will increase to $17,694 (approximately $1.00 per square foot annually) until
such time, if any, as any two or more of Moody’s, Fitch or S&P upgrades both (i) WMB’s credit rating to at or above
the Current WMB Rating, and (ii) WPZ’s credit rating to at or above the Current WPZ Rating (the “Required Minimum
Rating”). At such time, if any, that the Required Minimum Rating is satisfied, then the amount of required monthly deposits
into the TI/LC reserve will again be $8,847.
 
“Current WMB Rating”
shall mean a credit rating of (i) Baa3 by Moody’s, (ii) BB+ by S&P and (iii) BBB- by Fitch.
 
“Current WPZ Rating”
mean a credit rating of (i) Baa2 by Moody’s, (ii) BBB by S&P and (iii) BBB by Fitch.
 
Lockbox / Cash Management. The
loan is structured with a CMA lockbox. The borrowers are required to deposit all rents directly into a lockbox account controlled
by the lender. The funds are then returned to an account controlled by the borrowers until the commencement of a Trigger Event
(as defined below). During the continuance of a Trigger Event, all funds in the lockbox account are swept to a segregated cash
management account under the control of the lender. To the extent there is a Trigger Event continuing, all excess cash flow after
payment of the mortgage debt service, required reserves and operating expenses will be held as additional collateral for the loan.
The lender has a first priority security interest in the cash management account.
 
“Trigger Event” shall
mean a period (A) commencing upon the earliest of (i) the occurrence of an event of default, (ii) the debt service coverage ratio
(tested quarterly, on a trailing 12-month basis) being less than 1.20x, or (iii) the occurrence of a Tenant Trigger Event (as defined
below).
 
“Tenant Trigger Event”
will occur if any of the following occur with respect to Williams: (a) the tenant files for bankruptcy or becomes involved in an
insolvency proceeding; (b) tenant terminates or cancels its lease or tenant’s lease fails to be in full force and effect;
(c) a monetary or material non-monetary default exists under tenant’s lease (beyond the expiration of any applicable notice
and cure periods under the lease); (d) the tenant goes dark, vacates or otherwise fails to occupy its premises; (e) the tenant
gives a termination notice under its lease for all or any portion of its space greater than 20,000 square feet; or (f) the tenant
fails to renew or extend its lease for a minimum term of five years at a rent equal to tenant’s then-current rent on or before
the earlier of 12 months prior to any lease expiration or renewal date set forth in tenant’s lease. The loan documents contain
cure rights for each trigger.
 
Partial Releases. Provided
no event of default exists, the borrowers are permitted to release the Park Place II property from the lien of the mortgage at
any time after a lockout period if certain conditions are satisfied, including the following: (a) defeasance of 125% of the financing
amount allocated to such property (based on allocations assigned by lender at closing); and (b) after giving effect to the release,
(1) the debt service coverage ratio of the remaining property (as calculated by the lender) based on the trailing 12-month period
subsequent to the date of calculation must be not less than the greater of (i) 1.65x or (ii) the debt service coverage ratio for
both properties prior to the release; (2) the debt yield of the remaining property must be not less than the greater of (i) 10.1%
or (ii) the debt yield for both properties prior to the release; and (3) the loan to value ratio of the remaining property must
be not more than the 71.8%, all as determined by lender.

Waterstone Apartments

 
The Property. The Waterstone
Apartments property is a 276-unit, Class A multifamily property located in Spring, Texas. Developed in 2012, the property is situated
on 28.3 acres and consists of 26 two-story apartment buildings and one single-story clubhouse. As of June 4, 2015, the property
was 92.8% occupied. The property unit features include fully equipped kitchens, washer/dryers, private balconies and attached garages
in approximately 80.0% of the units (220 out of the 276), which collectively serve as market differentiators among the neighborhood
area. Property amenities include a 5,358 square foot clubhouse that has leasing offices, a clubroom with a television, an arcade
game console, a kitchen, a business center, a fitness center, a swimming pool with a sundeck and a grilling area, a dog park and
a car wash area. The property also has 534 parking spaces, including the 220 attached garages, resulting in a parking ratio of
1.93 spaces per unit.
 
The Waterstone Apartments property is conveniently
situated approximately three miles south of ExxonMobil’s new campus in The Woodlands, Texas and 23 miles north of the Houston
central business district. Designed to accommodate approximately 10,000 employees, ExxonMobil’s new campus is located on
385 wooded acres and is expected to reach full occupancy in 2015. An independent
economic impact study estimates the campus will create 44,000 permanent jobs during ongoing operations. Access to the property’s
neighborhood is provided by Interstate 45, located one mile to the east. Additionally, the property is expected to benefit from
the Grand Parkway extension, an over 180 mile circumferential scenic highway traversing seven counties and encircling the Greater
Houston region. The Grand Parkway Interstate 45 segment is currently under construction and is set for opening in late 2015.
  
The Market. The property is
located within the Houston apartment market and the Champions/FM 1960 multifamily submarket. The submarket had a 7.8% vacancy rate
as of March 2015. The submarket vacancy has trended downward over the last three years with average vacancies of 12.8% in 2012,
10.8% in 2013 and 7.4% in 2014. According to CoStar, the 2015 estimated population within a one- and three-mile radius of the property
is 7,919 and 86,265, respectively. The 2015 estimated average household income within a one- and three-mile radius of the property
is $101,898 and $82,367, respectively. As of March 2015, the submarket contained 594,249 units across 2,566 properties, according
to Apartment Data Services, Inc.’s market research report. The appraisal identified five comparable rentals proximate to
the Waterstone Apartments property. The property’s comparables range in average unit size from 823 to 1,078 square feet with
an average of 938 square feet, and indicate an asking rental range of $905 to $1,348, with an average of $1,215.

Hilton
  Atlanta Perimeter

 
The
Loan. The Hilton Atlanta Perimeter loan has an outstanding
principal balance of $30.17 million and is secured by a first mortgage lien on the fee interest in a 224-room full service hotel
located in Atlanta, Georgia. The loan has a five-year term and will amortize on a 30-year schedule. The borrowing entity
for the loan is Proc GA, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership and special purpose entity. The
loan sponsor and nonrecourse carve-out guarantor is CMS/Procaccianti Hospitality Holdings III, L.P. The
Procaccianti Group serves as general partner for the loan sponsor. Founded in 1964, The Procaccianti Group is a second generation
privately-held real estate investment and management company. Since 1964, The Procaccianti
Group has owned or managed real estate assets with more than 50 million square feet with a value exceeding $5 billion. As of September
2015, The Procaccianti Group’s portfolio included 63 hotel properties located in 25 different states totaling 17,554 rooms.
 
The
Property. Hilton Atlanta Perimeter is a six-story, 224-room, full service
hotel located in Atlanta, Georgia. The hotel is located in Atlanta’s Perimeter Center, one of the largest suburban office
submarkets in the country. Originally developed in 1987, the loan sponsor purchased the property in 2005 as part of a larger portfolio,
for an allocated purchase price of $22.0 million ($98,214 per room). The hotel was acquired as a DoubleTree by Hilton hotel by
the loan sponsor and in 2006 was renovated and converted to a Hilton-branded hotel. Since acquisition, the loan sponsor has invested
approximately $12.3 million ($54,730 per room) in capital improvements, of which approximately $2.9 million was completed between
2011 and May 2015. According to the loan sponsor, renovations in 2011 alone totaled $1.7 million, which included renovations to
the guest rooms, general area, lobby, restaurant and conference room. At origination, approximately $7.8 million ($34,632 per room)
was reserved to complete renovations relating to a property improvement plan (“PIP”). The PIP renovations will
address key areas of the hotel including the porte-cochere, installing an executive
lounge, lounge and bar area upgrades, meeting room, fitness center, corridor and guest room renovations and HVAC replacement and
repairs. The renovation is projected to result in minimal revenue displacement as the work is expected to be completed during the
lower occupancy months of December through April.
 
Hilton
Atlanta Perimeter features three food and beverage options: Dunwoody Grill, Lobby Bar and Coffee Station. The hotel also
provides 224 parking spaces and 6,327 square feet of meeting space across one 4,000 square foot event tent, one 1,600 square foot
ballroom and two smaller meeting rooms. Additional amenities at the property include a business center, fitness center, indoor
and outdoor pool, valet parking, laundry and room service.
 
The
property has 224 suites, including 214 king suites and 10 double-double suites.
Each suite features high-speed internet access and a telephone, coffeemaker, microwave, mini-refrigerator, sleeper sofa and 37-inch
high definition televisions.
 
The
Market. The hotel is located in Atlanta’s Perimeter Center at the North Central/Interstate 285 office submarket,
a suburban office submarket with approximately 23.7 million square feet of office space. Perimeter Center is strategically located,
with strong weekday and weekend demand generated by the submarket’s concentration of Class A office parks, retail centers,
restaurants, hospitals and residential neighborhoods. The hotel is located less than one mile from three major hospitals and from
the Perimeter Mall, the second largest mall in the state of Georgia with approximately 1.6 million square feet. The neighborhood
is served by the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (“MARTA”), with the Dunwoody station located half
a mile away at the southwest corner of the Perimeter Mall’s parking lot. As of the fourth quarter of 2014, MARTA had an average
weekday passenger boarding of 232,100. Numerous Fortune 1000 firms are located in the Perimeter Center area including United Parcel
Service, Newell Rubbermaid, Georgia Gulf, Cox Communications, Popeye’s, Global Payments and First Data. According to the
appraisal, as of 2014 the estimated population within a three-mile and five-mile radius contained 100,822 and 228,953 people, respectively,
with an average household income of $99,366 and $103,564, respectively.
 
The appraisal identified one recently opened
hotel, one hotel under construction and one approved hotel as competitive with the Hilton Atlanta Perimeter. The 114-room Homewood
Suites Perimeter Center opened in July 2015, and the 132-room Hampton Inn & Suites Atlanta Perimeter Mall Area and the 128-room
Residence Inn by Marriott Perimeter Center are expected to open in December 2015 and September 2016, respectively. However, according
to the appraisal, the three hotels are considered secondary competitors. Both the Homewood Suites Perimeter Center and the Residence
Inn by Marriott Perimeter Center hotels are projected to operate as extended stay hotels, while the Hampton Inn & Suites Atlanta
Perimeter Mall Area is expected to operate at a lower price point than the Hilton Atlanta Perimeter.

Property
Management. The property is managed by TPG Hospitality, Inc., which is an affiliate
of the borrower and The Procaccianti Group. The Procaccianti Group and its principals have over
25 years of experience in managing hotels. TPG Hospitality, Inc. has managed over 100 hotels surpassing 20,000 guest rooms throughout
major submarkets within 25 states. The senior management team at TPG Hospitality Inc. has an average of 25 years of experience
in all aspects of hotel operations. The current management agreement commenced on June 30, 2005, and was amended and extended on
June 30, 2015 for a term of 10 years and six months and provides for a contractual management fee of 3.0% of gross revenues and
other amounts collected from tenants plus an incentive management fee of 1.0% of gross revenues if the return on equity equals
or exceeds 12.0%. The management fees are subordinate to the liens and interests of the loan.
 
Franchise
Agreement. The property has a franchise agreement with HLT Existing Franchise
Holding LLC. The current franchise agreement commenced on June 30, 2005 for a term of 20 years and provides for a 4.0% program
fee based on room revenue on a monthly basis and a 5.0% royalty fee based on room revenue on a monthly basis.
 
Additional
Debt. The borrower entered into an agreement with the franchisor, HLT Existing Franchise Holding LLC, to receive
$1.0 million for renovations of the Hilton Atlanta Perimeter property. The franchisor will provide the renovation funds incrementally
as requested. For each requested incremental advance of funds, the borrower will deliver a disbursement request to the franchisor.
There is no obligation to repay this amount unless the franchise agreement is terminated prior to its stated expiration date or
the borrower fails to complete the renovation work on the terms set forth in the franchise agreement. The borrower’s obligations
to repay these funds, if any, are unsecured. If the obligation to repay the financing is triggered, the unamortized portion of
the key money financing will be payable to the franchisor. The amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis over the 20
year term of the franchise agreement. The loan documents include a nonrecourse carve-out to the borrower and guarantor for any
losses associated with this financing.

The
  Eastmont Town Center loan is part of a loan evidenced by two pari passu notes
  with an aggregate original principal balance of $41.325 million. The Financial Information
  presented in the chart above reflects the Cut-off Date balance of the approximately $41.0
  million Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan.




(2)
The
  increase from 2012 NOI to 2013 NOI is primarily due to three new leases being executed,
  resulting in an approximately $512,000 increase in base rent and reimbursements.




(3)
The
  loan is structured with an anticipated repayment date (“ARD”) of April
1, 2020. In the event that the loan is not paid off on or before the ARD, the borrower
  is required to make monthly payments to the lender of principal and interest in the amount
  of the monthly debt service payment and interest will accrue at an interest rate (the
  “Adjusted Interest Rate”) that will be equal to the greater of (i)
  8.11000% or (ii) 3.00000% per annum plus the five-year U.S. treasury yield. The interest
  in excess of the interest at the initial interest rate which is not paid will accrue
  and be added to the principal amount of the Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan for the following
  month and will earn interest at the Adjusted Interest Rate. In addition, from and after
  the ARD, all excess cash flow from the property, after payment of reserves, interest
  calculated at the initial interest rate and operating expenses, will be applied to the
  outstanding principal balance of the Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan. The final maturity
  date of the loan is October 1, 2022. Maturity Date Loan / SF and Maturity Date LTV are
  calculated as of the ARD.

Initial
  Other Escrows and Reserves consists of a deferred maintenance reserve.

Eastmont
  Town Center 

 

The Loan. The Eastmont Town Center
loan is secured by a first mortgage lien on the borrower’s fee simple interest in a 514,236 square foot, Class B office building
located in Oakland, California. The whole loan has an outstanding principal balance as of the Cut-off Date of approximately $41.0
million (the “Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan”), and is comprised of two pari passu notes, Note A-1 and
Note A-2. Note A-2, with an outstanding principal balance as of the Cut-off Date of approximately $28.8 million, is being contributed
to the JPMBB 2015-C32 Trust. Note A-1 has an outstanding principal balance as of the Cut-off Date of approximately $12.2 million

trustee of the JPMBB 2015-C32 Trust. The trustee of the JPMBB 2015-C32 Trust (or, prior to the occurrence and continuance of a
control event under the pooling and servicing agreement, the directing certificateholder) will be entitled to exercise all of the
rights of the Controlling Noteholder with respect to the Eastmont Town Center Whole Loan; however, the holder of Note A-1 will
be entitled, under certain circumstances, to consult with respect to certain major decisions. The loan is structured with an ARD
of April 1, 2020 and a final maturity date of October 1, 2022, and will amortize on a 30-year schedule. The previously existing
debt was securitized in 2005 as part of the WBCMT 2005-C17 securitization. The borrowing entity for the loan is Eastmont Office
Owner, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and special purpose entity. The loan sponsors and nonrecourse carve-out guarantors

The

The Park at Veneto

 
The Loan. The Park at Veneto
loan has an outstanding principal balance of $20.2 million and is secured by a first mortgage lien on the borrower’s fee
interest in a 282-unit, garden-style multifamily property located in Fort Myers, Florida. The loan has a five-year term and, subsequent
to an 18-month interest-only period, will amortize on a 30-year schedule. The previously existing debt was securitized in 2014
as part of the ACR 2014-FL2 transaction. The borrowing entity for the loan is Reflections Property Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company and special purpose entity. The loan sponsors are Blue Rock Partners, LLC and Stonecutter Capital Management
LLC. Founded in 2004 and based in Tampa, Florida, Blue Rock Partners, LLC currently manages over 10,000 multifamily units across
13 Florida communities with emphasis on the Orlando and Tampa markets. Founded in 2012, Stonecutter Capital Management LLC is a
real estate investment management company that currently owns more than 8,000 multifamily rental units, with approximately 4,500
units in Florida, and more than 300,000 square feet of commercial space. The nonrecourse carve-out guarantor is Randy X. Ferreira,
senior partner and owner of Blue Rock Partners, LLC. Randy X. Ferreira is responsible for consistent growth and company acquisitions
which now exceed 13,000 multifamily units. In addition, he oversees the day-to-day operations of accounting, property management
services and the repositioning and renovation processes within the company.
 
The Property. The Park at
Veneto is a 282-unit, Class B/B- multifamily property located in Fort Myers, Florida. Developed in 1987 and renovated in 2015,
the property is situated on 12.5 acres and consists of 11 three-story apartment buildings, one clubhouse and one maintenance shop.
As of September 29, 2015, the property was 96.1% occupied. The property unit features include fully equipped kitchens with stainless
steel sinks, refrigerator, dishwasher, laundry equipment hook-ups and wood countertops and cabinetry. In addition, several units
offer balconies, vaulted ceilings and fireplaces. Property amenities include a 2,295 square foot clubhouse which allows for leasing
offices, controlled-access entry, two swimming pools, a fitness center and a tennis court. The property also has 456 parking spaces,
which include 388 surface spaces and 68 carport spaces, resulting in a parking ratio of 1.62 spaces per rentable unit. The loan
sponsor is expected to complete its $2.5 million renovation plan by September 2016, which will include renovations to the interior
and exterior. Upgrades to the units include repainting the cabinets, installing mini-tile backsplashes, faux-wood floors, new lighting
and hardware packages with ceiling fans in the living room and master bedroom and new appliances as needed. Additionally, the landscaping
was upgraded throughout the property, with a heavy focus on the main entrance, gated entrances and small ponds with water fountains.
These upgrades and renovations have enabled the loan sponsor to grow revenues as new leases are executed, while maintaining current
occupancy levels.
 
The Park at Veneto property is situated
approximately three miles south of the Fort Myers central business district and approximately 15 to 20 miles northeast of the Captiva,
Fort Myers and Sanibel Island beaches. The property is located in close proximity to local employers including the 355-bed Lee
Memorial Hospital, the Metro Park office park and the Lee County Public Education Center. In addition, the Macy’s-anchored
Edison Mall is located approximately two miles north of the property. Accessibility to the property’s neighborhood is provided
by US-75, a major north-south thoroughfare along the southwest coast of Florida, located eight miles to the east.
 
The Market. The property is
located within the Florida apartment market and the Fort Myers multifamily submarket. The submarket had an average vacancy rate
of 3.3% as of March 2015. The submarket vacancy has trended downward over the last three years with average vacancies of 6.2% in
2012, 5.0% in 2013 and 3.6% in 2014. According to the appraisal, the 2015 estimated population within a one- and three-mile radius
of the property is 10,774 and 54,511, respectively. The 2015 estimated average household income within a one- and three-mile radius

TTM
  column represents the trailing 12-month period ending on August 31, 2015.



(2)
Percentage
  column represents percent of Net Rental Income for all revenue lines and represents percent
  of Effective Gross Income for the remainder of fields.



(3)
The
  increase from 2014 Rents in Place to TTM Rents in Place is primarily due to the property’s
  most recent renovation and the strong demand in the market, which has led new and renewal
  rents to be, on average, approximately 18% higher than those at acquisition.



(4)
Other
  Income represents collections from previous residents, application fees, cable income,
  late fees, MTM fees, non-refundable pet fees, renter’s insurance, short term fees,
  utility setup fees and other miscellaneous fees.



(5)
The
  increase from TTM Net Operating Income to Underwritten Net Operating Income is primarily
  due to underwriting units at market rent less the loss to lease.



(6)
2014
  Occupancy is as of December 31, 2014. TTM Occupancy is as of September 29, 2015. Underwritten
  Occupancy represents economic occupancy.

(1) Debt Service Coverage Ratios are updated periodically as new NOI figures become available from borrowers on an asset level. In all cases, the most recent DSCR provided by the Servicer is used. To the extent that no DSCR is provided by the Servicer, information from the offering document is used. The Trustee makes no representations as to the accuracy of the data provided by the borrower for this calculation.
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
(2) Anticipated Remaining Term and WAM are each calculated based upon the term from the current month to the earlier of the Anticipated Repayment Date, if applicable, and the maturity date.
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
(3) Data in this table was calculated by allocating pro-rata the current loan information to the properties based upon the Cut-off Date balance of each property as disclosed in the offering document.

I.     Population

of those Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans are still being analyzed by the Special Servicer as part of the development of an Asset
Status Report.
 
b.   Asset

II.    Executive
Summary
 
Based on the requirements and qualifications
set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, as well as the items listed below, the Senior Trust Advisor (in accordance with
the Senior Trust Advisor’s analysis requirements outlined in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) has undertaken a limited
review of the Special Servicer’s operational activities to service certain Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans in accordance
with the Servicing Standard. Based on such limited review, the Senior Trust Advisor [does, does not] believe there are material
violations of the Special Servicer’s compliance with its obligations under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. In addition,
the Senior Trust Advisor notes the following: [PROVIDE SUMMARY OF ANY ADDITIONAL MATERIAL INFORMATION].
 
In connection with the assessment set forth
in this report, the Senior Trust Advisor:
 
1.   Reviewed
the Asset Status Reports, the Special Servicer’s assessment of compliance report, attestation report by a third party regarding
the Special Servicer’s compliance with its obligations and net present value calculations and Appraisal Reduction calculations
and [LIST OTHER REVIEWED INFORMATION] for the following [●] Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans: [List applicable mortgage

2.   Consulted
with the Special Servicer as provided under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The Senior Trust Advisor’s analysis of the

1    This

Trust Advisor will have the ability to modify or alter the organization and content of any particular report, subject
to the compliance with the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, including, without limitation, provisions relating to
Privileged Information.
 


C-1
 
 
the Specially
Serviced Mortgage Loans should be considered a limited investigation and not be considered a full or limited audit. For instance,
we did not review each page of the Special Servicer’s policy and procedure manuals (including amendments and appendices),
re-engineer the quantitative aspects of their net present value calculator, visit any property, visit the Special Servicer, visit
the Directing Certificateholder or interact with any borrower. In addition, our review of the net present value calculations and
Appraisal Reduction calculations is limited to the mathematical accuracy of the calculations and the corresponding application
of the non-discretionary portions of the applicable formulas, and as such, does not take into account the reasonableness of the
discretionary portions of such formulas.
 
III.   Specific
Items of Review
 
1.   The
Senior Trust Advisor reviewed the following items in connection with the generation of this report: [LIST MATERIAL ITEMS].
 
2.   During
the prior year, the Senior Trust Advisor consulted with the Special Servicer regarding its strategy plan for a limited number of
issues related to the following Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans: [LIST]. The Senior Trust Advisor participated in discussions
and made strategic observations and recommended alternative courses of action to the extent it deemed such observations and recommendations
appropriate. The Special Servicer [agreed with/did not agree with] the material recommendations made by the Senior Trust Advisor.
Such recommendations generally included the following: [LIST].
 
3.   Appraisal
Reduction calculations and net present value calculations:
 
4.   The
Senior Trust Advisor [received/did not receive] information necessary to recalculate and verify the accuracy of the mathematical
calculations and the corresponding application of the non-discretionary portions of the applicable formulas required to be utilized
in connection with any Appraisal Reduction or net present value calculations used in the special servicer’s determination
of what course of action to take in connection with the workout or liquidation of a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan prior to the
utilization by the special servicer.
 
a.   The
senior trust advisor [agrees/does not agree] with the [mathematical calculations] [and/or] [the application of the applicable non-discretionary
portions of the formula] required to be utilized for such calculation.
 
b.   After
consultation with the special servicer to resolve any inaccuracy in the mathematical calculations or the application of the non-discretionary
portions of the related formula in arriving at those mathematical calculations, such inaccuracy [has been/ has not been] resolved.

discussion(s) regarding any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan. The Senior Trust Advisor does not have authority to speak with the
 


C-2
 
 
Directing Certificateholder directly. As such, the Senior Trust Advisor generally relied upon the information delivered to it by

ANNEX D-1
 
MORTGAGE LOAN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
 
The mortgage loan seller will make the representations
and warranties set forth below as of the date specified below or, if no such date is specified, generally as of the Closing Date,
in each case subject to the exceptions to those representations and warranties that are described on Annex D-1 to this free
writing prospectus. Prior to the execution of the related final mortgage loan purchase agreement (the “MLPA”),
there may be additions, subtractions or other modifications to the representations, warranties and exceptions. These representations,
warranties and exceptions should not be read alone, but should only be read in conjunction with the free writing prospectus.
 
Each MLPA, together with the related representations
and warranties (subject to the exceptions thereto), serves to contractually allocate risk between the mortgage loan seller, on
the one hand, and the trust fund, on the other. The representations and warranties are not intended to be disclosure statements
regarding the characteristics of the related mortgage loans, Mortgaged Properties or other subjects discussed therein, but rather
are intended as a risk allocation mechanism. We cannot assure you that the mortgage loans actually conform to the statements made
in the representations and warranties that are presented below. The representations, warranties and exceptions have been provided
to you for informational purposes only and prospective investors should not rely on the representations, warranties and exceptions
as a basis for any investment decision. For disclosure regarding the characteristics, risks and other information regarding the
mortgage loans, mortgaged properties and certificates relating to the trust fund, you should read and rely solely on the free writing
prospectus. None of the depositor or the underwriters or their respective affiliates makes any representation regarding the accuracy
or completeness of the representations, warranties and exceptions.
 
1.     Complete
Servicing File. All documents comprising the Servicing File will be or have been delivered to the Master Servicer with respect
to each Mortgage Loan by the deadlines set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and/or Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement.
 
2.     Whole
Loan; Ownership of Mortgage Loans. Except with respect to each Serviced Mortgage Loan, each Mortgage Loan is a whole loan and
not an interest in a mortgage loan. Each Serviced Mortgage Loan is a senior portion (or a pari
passu portion of a senior portion) of a whole mortgage loan evidenced by a senior note. Immediately prior to the sale,
transfer and assignment to depositor, no Mortgage Note or Mortgage was subject to any assignment (other than assignments to the
Mortgage Loan Seller), participation (other than with respect to Serviced Mortgage Loans) or pledge, and at the time of the assignment
of the Mortgage Loans to the Depositor, the Mortgage Loan Seller had good and marketable title to, and was the sole owner and holder
of, each Mortgage Loan free and clear of any and all liens, charges, pledges, encumbrances, participations (other than with respect
to agreements among noteholders with respect to a Whole Loan), any other ownership interests and other interests on, in or to such
Mortgage Loan (subject to certain agreements regarding servicing and/or defeasance successor borrower rights as provided in the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, subservicing agreements permitted thereunder and that certain Servicing Rights Purchase Agreement,
dated as of the Closing Date between the Master Servicer and the Mortgage Loan Seller). The Mortgage Loan Seller has full right
and authority to sell, assign and transfer each Mortgage Loan, and the assignment to depositor constitutes a legal, valid and binding
assignment of such Mortgage Loan and conveys all legal and beneficial ownership of such Mortgage Loan to the Depositor free and
clear of any and all liens, pledges, charges or security interests of any nature encumbering such Mortgage Loan (subject to certain
agreements regarding servicing and/or defeasance successor borrower rights as provided in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
subservicing agreements permitted thereunder and that certain Servicing Rights Purchase Agreement, dated as of the Closing Date
between the Master Servicer and the Mortgage Loan Seller).
 
3.     Loan
Document Status. Each related Mortgage Note, Mortgage, Assignment of Leases (if a separate instrument), guaranty and other
agreement executed by or on behalf of the related Mortgagor, guarantor or other obligor in connection with such Mortgage Loan is
the legal, valid and binding obligation
 


D-1-1
 
 
of the related Mortgagor, guarantor or other obligor (subject to any non-recourse provisions
contained in any of the foregoing agreements and any applicable state anti-deficiency or market value limit deficiency legislation),
as applicable, and is enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by (i) bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’
rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law and except that certain provisions in such Mortgage Loan documents (including, without limitation, provisions
requiring the payment of default interest, late fees or prepayment/yield maintenance premiums) may be further limited or rendered
unenforceable by applicable law, but (subject to the limitations set forth above) such limitations or unenforceability will not
render such Mortgage Loan documents invalid as a whole or materially interfere with the mortgagee’s realization of the principal
benefits and/or security provided thereby (clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, the “Insolvency
Qualifications”).
 
Except as set forth in the immediately preceding
sentences, there is no valid offset, defense, counterclaim or right of rescission available to the related Mortgagor with respect
to any of the related Mortgage Notes, Mortgages or other Mortgage Loan documents, including, without limitation, any such valid
offset, defense, counterclaim or right based on intentional fraud by the Mortgage Loan Seller in connection with the origination
of the Mortgage Loan, that would deny the mortgagee the principal benefits intended to be provided by the Mortgage Note, Mortgage
or other Mortgage Loan documents.
 
4.     Mortgage
Provisions. The Mortgage Loan documents for each Mortgage Loan contain provisions that render the rights and remedies of the
holder thereof adequate for the practical realization against the Mortgaged Property of the principal benefits of the security
intended to be provided thereby, including realization by judicial or, if applicable, nonjudicial foreclosure subject to the limitations
set forth in the Insolvency Qualifications.
 
5.     Hospitality
Provisions. The Mortgage Loan documents for each Mortgage Loan that is secured by a hospitality property operated pursuant
to a franchise agreement includes an executed comfort letter or similar agreement signed by the Mortgagor and franchisor of such
property enforceable by the Trust against such franchisor, either directly or as an assignee of the originator. The Mortgage or
related security agreement for each Mortgage Loan secured by a hospitality property creates a security interest in the revenues
of such property for which a UCC financing statement has been filed in the appropriate filing office.
 
6.     Mortgage
Status; Waivers and Modifications. Since origination and except by written instruments set forth in the related Mortgage File
or as otherwise provided in the related Mortgage Loan documents (a) the material terms of such Mortgage, Mortgage Note, Mortgage
Loan guaranty, and related Mortgage Loan documents have not been waived, impaired, modified, altered, satisfied, canceled, subordinated
or rescinded in any respect; (b) no related Mortgaged Property or any portion thereof has been released from the lien of the
related Mortgage in any manner which materially interferes with the security intended to be provided by such Mortgage or the use
or operation of such Mortgaged Property; and (c) neither Mortgagor nor guarantor has been released from its obligations under
the Mortgage Loan. The material terms of such Mortgage, Mortgage Note, Mortgage Loan guaranty, and related Mortgage Loan documents
have not been waived, impaired, modified, altered, satisfied, canceled, subordinated or rescinded in any respect since September 30,
2015.
 
7.     Lien;
Valid Assignment. Subject to the Insolvency Qualifications, each endorsement and assignment of Mortgage and assignment of Assignment
of Leases from the Mortgage Loan Seller constitutes a legal, valid and binding endorsement or assignment from the Mortgage Loan
Seller. Each related Mortgage and Assignment of Leases is freely assignable without the consent of the related Mortgagor. Each
related Mortgage is a legal, valid and enforceable first lien on the related Mortgagor’s fee (or if identified on the Mortgage
Loan Schedule, leasehold) interest in the Mortgaged Property in the principal amount of such Mortgage Loan or allocated loan amount
(subject only to Permitted Encumbrances (as defined below)), except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by the Insolvency
Qualifications. Such Mortgaged Property (subject to Permitted Encumbrances) as of origination was, and as of the Cut-off Date to
the Mortgage Loan Seller’s knowledge, is free and clear of any recorded mechanics’ liens, recorded materialmen’s
liens and other recorded encumbrances, and to the Mortgage
 


D-1-2
 
 
Loan Seller’s knowledge and subject to the rights of tenants,
no rights exist which under law could give rise to any such lien or encumbrance that would be prior to or equal with the lien of
the related Mortgage, except those which are insured against by a lender’s title insurance policy (as described below). Any
security agreement, chattel mortgage or equivalent document related to and delivered in connection with the Mortgage Loan establishes
and creates a valid and enforceable lien on property described therein subject to Permitted Encumbrances, except as such enforcement
may be limited by Insolvency Qualifications subject to the limitations described in clause (11) below. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, no representation is made as to the perfection of any security interest in rents or other personal property
to the extent that possession or control of such items or actions other than the filing of Uniform Commercial Code financing statements
is required in order to effect such perfection.
 
8.     Permitted
Liens; Title Insurance. Each Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan is covered by an American Land Title Association loan
title insurance policy or a comparable form of loan title insurance policy approved for use in the applicable jurisdiction (or,
if such policy is yet to be issued, by a pro forma policy, a preliminary title policy with escrow instructions or a “marked
up” commitment, in each case binding on the title insurer) (the “Title
Policy”) in the original principal amount of such Mortgage Loan (or with respect to a Mortgage Loan secured by
multiple properties, an amount equal to at least the allocated loan amount with respect to the Title Policy for each such property)
after all advances of principal (including any advances held in escrow or reserves), that insures for the benefit of the owner
of the indebtedness secured by the Mortgage, the first priority lien of the Mortgage, which lien is subject only to (a) the
lien of current real property taxes, water charges, sewer rents and assessments not yet due and payable; (b) covenants, conditions
and restrictions, rights of way, easements and other matters of public record specifically identified in the Title Policy; (c) the
exceptions (general and specific) and exclusions set forth in such Title Policy; (d) other matters to which like properties
are commonly subject; (e) the rights of tenants (as tenants only) under leases (including subleases) pertaining to the related
Mortgaged Property which the Mortgage Loan documents do not require to be subordinated to the lien of such Mortgage; and (f) if
the related Mortgage Loan constitutes a cross-collateralized Mortgage Loan, the lien of the Mortgage for another Mortgage Loan
contained in the same Crossed Mortgage Loan Group, provided that none of items (a) through (f), individually or in
the aggregate, materially interferes with the value, current use or operation of the Mortgaged Property or the security intended
to be provided by such Mortgage or with the current ability of the related Mortgaged Property to generate net cash flow sufficient
to service the related Mortgage Loan or the Mortgagor’s ability to pay its obligations when they become due (collectively,
the “Permitted Encumbrances”). Except as contemplated
by clause (f) of the preceding sentence none of the Permitted Encumbrances are mortgage liens that are senior to or coordinate
and co-equal with the lien of the related Mortgage. Such Title Policy (or, if it has yet to be issued, the coverage to be provided
thereby) is in full force and effect, all premiums thereon have been paid and no claims have been made by the Mortgage Loan Seller
thereunder and no claims have been paid thereunder. Neither the Mortgage Loan Seller, nor to the Mortgage Loan Seller’s knowledge,
any other holder of the Mortgage Loan, has done, by act or omission, anything that would materially impair the coverage under such
Title Policy. Each Title Policy contains no exclusion for, or affirmatively insures (except for any Mortgaged Property located
in a jurisdiction where such affirmative insurance is not available in which case such exclusion may exist), (a) that the
Mortgaged Property shown on the survey is the same as the property legally described in the Mortgage, and (b) to the extent
that the Mortgaged Property consists of two or more adjoining parcels, such parcels are contiguous.
 
9.     Junior
Liens. It being understood that B notes secured by the same Mortgage as a Mortgage Loan are not subordinate mortgages or junior
liens, there are no subordinate mortgages or junior liens encumbering the related Mortgaged Property. The Mortgage Loan Seller
has no knowledge of any mezzanine debt related to the Mortgaged Property and secured directly by the ownership interests in the
Mortgagor.
 
10.   Assignment
of Leases and Rents. There exists as part of the related Mortgage File an Assignment of Leases (either as a separate instrument
or incorporated into the related Mortgage). Each related Assignment of Leases creates a valid first-priority collateral assignment
of, or a valid first-priority lien or security interest in, rents and certain rights under the related lease or leases, subject
only to a license granted to the related Mortgagor to exercise certain rights and to perform certain obligations of the
 


D-1-3
 
 
lessor
under such lease or leases, including the right to operate the related leased property, except as the enforcement thereof may be
limited by the Insolvency Qualifications; no person other than the related Mortgagor owns any interest in any payments due under
such lease or leases that is superior to or of equal priority with the lender’s interest therein. The related Mortgage or
related Assignment of Leases, subject to applicable law, provides for, upon an event of default under the Mortgage Loan, a receiver
to be appointed for the collection of rents or for the related mortgagee to enter into possession to collect the rents or for rents
to be paid directly to the mortgagee.
 
11.     Financing
Statements. Each Mortgage Loan or related security agreement establishes a valid security interest in, and a UCC-1 financing
statement has been filed (except, in the case of fixtures, the Mortgage constitutes a fixture filing) in all places necessary to
perfect a valid security interest in, the personal property (the creation and perfection of which is governed by the UCC) owned
by the Mortgagor and necessary to operate any Mortgaged Property in its current use other than (1) non-material personal property,
(2) personal property subject to purchase money security interests and (3) personal property that is leased equipment.
Each UCC-1 financing statement, if any, filed with respect to personal property constituting a part of the related Mortgaged Property
and each UCC-3 assignment, if any, filed with respect to such financing statement was in suitable form for filing in the filing
office in which such financing statement was filed.
 
12.     Condition
of Property. The Mortgage Loan Seller or the originator of the Mortgage Loan inspected or caused to be inspected each related
Mortgaged Property within four months of origination of the Mortgage Loan and within twelve months of the Cut-off Date.
 
An engineering report or property condition
assessment was prepared in connection with the origination of each Mortgage Loan no more than twelve months prior to the Cut-off
Date, which indicates that, except as set forth in such engineering report or with respect to which repairs were required to be
reserved for or made, all building systems for the improvements of each related Mortgaged Property are in good working order, and
further indicates that each related Mortgaged Property (a) is free of any material damage, (b) is in good repair and
condition, and (c) is free of structural defects, except to the extent (i) any damage or deficiencies that would not
materially and adversely affect the use, operation or value of the Mortgaged Property or the security intended to be provided by
such Mortgage or repairs with respect to such damage or deficiencies estimated to cost less than $50,000 in the aggregate per Mortgaged
Property; (ii) such repairs have been completed; or (iii) escrows in an aggregate amount consistent with the standards
utilized by the Mortgage Loan Seller with respect to similar loans it originates for securitization have been established, which
escrows will in all events be in an aggregate amount not less than the estimated cost of such repairs. The Mortgage Loan Seller
has no knowledge of any material issues with the physical condition of the Mortgaged Property that the Mortgage Loan Seller believes
would have a material adverse effect on the use, operation or value of the Mortgaged Property other than those disclosed in the
engineering report and those addressed in sub-clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence.
 
13.     Taxes
and Assessments. As of the date of origination and as of the Closing Date, all taxes and governmental assessments and other
outstanding governmental charges (including, without limitation, water and sewage charges) due with respect to the Mortgaged Property
(excluding any related personal property) securing a Mortgage Loan that is or if left unpaid could become a lien on the related
Mortgaged Property that would be of equal or superior priority to the lien of the Mortgage and that became due and delinquent and
owing prior to the Cut-off Date with respect to each related Mortgaged Property have been paid, or, if the appropriate amount of
such taxes or charges is being appealed or is otherwise in dispute, the unpaid taxes or charges are covered by an escrow of funds
or other security sufficient to pay such tax or charge and reasonably estimated interest and penalties, if any, thereon. For purposes
of this representation and warranty, real property taxes, governmental assessments and other outstanding governmental charges shall
not be considered delinquent until the date on which interest and/or penalties would be payable thereon.
 
14.     Condemnation.
As of the date of origination and to the Mortgage Loan Seller’s knowledge as of the Closing Date, there is no proceeding
pending or threatened for the total or partial condemnation of
 


D-1-4
 
 
such Mortgaged Property that would have a material adverse effect
on the use or operation of the Mortgaged Property.
 
15.     Actions
Concerning Mortgage Loan. As of the date of origination and to the Mortgage Loan Seller’s knowledge as of the Closing
Date, there was no pending, filed or threatened action, suit or proceeding, arbitration or governmental investigation involving
any Mortgagor, guarantor, or Mortgaged Property, an adverse outcome of which would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely
affect (a) title to the Mortgaged Property, (b) the validity or enforceability of the Mortgage, (c) such Mortgagor’s
ability to perform under the related Mortgage Loan, (d) such guarantor’s ability to perform under the related guaranty,
(e) the use, operation or value of the Mortgaged Property, (f) the principal benefit of the security intended to be provided
by the Mortgage Loan documents, (g) the current ability of the Mortgaged Property to generate net cash flow sufficient to
service such Mortgage Loan, or (h) the current principal use of the Mortgaged Property.
 
16.     Escrow
Deposits. All escrow deposits and payments required pursuant to each Mortgage Loan (including capital improvements and environmental
remediation reserves) are in the possession, or under the control, of the Mortgage Loan Seller or its servicer, and there are no
deficiencies (subject to any applicable grace or cure periods) in connection therewith, and all such escrows and deposits (or the
right thereto) that are required under the related Mortgage Loan documents are being conveyed by the Mortgage Loan Seller to depositor
or its servicer and identified as such with appropriate detail. Any and all requirements under the Mortgage Loan as to completion
of any material improvements and as to disbursements of any funds escrowed for such purpose, which requirements were to have been
complied with on or before Closing Date, have been complied with in all material respects or the funds so escrowed have not been
released unless such release was consistent with proper and prudent commercial mortgage servicing practices or such released funds
were otherwise used for their intended purpose. No other escrow amounts have been released except in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the related Mortgage Loan documents.
 
17.     No
Holdbacks. The principal amount of the Mortgage Loan stated on the Mortgage Loan Schedule has been fully disbursed as of the
Closing Date and there is no requirement for future advances thereunder (except in those cases where the full amount of the Mortgage
Loan has been disbursed but a portion thereof is being held in escrow or reserve accounts pending the satisfaction of certain conditions
relating to leasing, repairs, occupancy, performance or other matters with respect to the related Mortgaged Property), and any
requirements or conditions to disbursements of any loan proceeds held in escrow have been satisfied with respect to any disbursement
of any such escrow fund prior to the Cut-off Date.
 
18.     Insurance.
Each related Mortgaged Property is, and is required pursuant to the related Mortgage to be, insured by a property insurance policy
providing coverage for loss in accordance with coverage found under a “special cause of loss form” or “all-risk
form” that includes replacement cost valuation issued by an insurer meeting the requirements of the related Mortgage Loan
documents and having a claims-paying or financial strength rating of at least “A-:VIII” (for a Mortgage Loan with a
principal balance below $35 million) and “A:VIII” (for a Mortgage Loan with a principal balance of $35 million or more)
from A.M. Best Company or “A3” (or the equivalent) from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or “A-“ from
Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (collectively the “Insurance
Rating Requirements”), in an amount not less than the lesser of (1) the original principal balance of the
Mortgage Loan and (2) the full insurable value on a replacement cost basis of the improvements, furniture, furnishings, fixtures
and equipment owned by the mortgagor and included in the Mortgaged Property (with no deduction for physical depreciation), but,
in any event, not less than the amount necessary or containing such endorsements as are necessary to avoid the operation of any
coinsurance provisions with respect to the related Mortgaged Property.
 
Each related Mortgaged Property is also
covered, and required to be covered pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan documents, by business interruption or rental loss insurance
which (i) covers a period beginning on the date of loss and continuing until the earlier to occur of restoration of the Mortgaged
Property or the expiration of 12 months (or with respect to each Mortgage Loan with a principal balance of $35 million or more,
18 months); (ii) for a Mortgage Loan with a principal balance of $50 million or more
 


D-1-5
 
 
contains a 180-day “extended period
of indemnity”; and (iii) covers the actual loss sustained (or in certain cases, an amount sufficient to cover the period
set forth in (i) above) during restoration.
 
If any material part of the improvements,
exclusive of a parking lot, located on a Mortgaged Property is in an area identified in the Federal Register by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency as having special flood hazards, the related Mortgagor is required to maintain insurance in the maximum amount
available under the National Flood Insurance Program, plus such additional excess flood coverage in an amount as is generally required
by the Mortgage Loan Seller originating mortgage loans for securitization.
 
If windstorm and/or windstorm related perils
and/or “named storms” are excluded from the primary property damage insurance policy the Mortgaged Property is insured
by a separate windstorm insurance policy issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements or endorsement covering
damage from windstorm and/or windstorm related perils and/or named storms, in an amount at least equal to 100% of the full insurable
value on a replacement cost basis of the Improvements and personalty and fixtures owned by the mortgagor and included in the related
Mortgaged Property by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements.
 
The Mortgaged Property is covered, and required
to be covered pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan documents, by a commercial general liability insurance policy issued by an
insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements including broad-form coverage for property damage, contractual damage and personal
injury (including bodily injury and death) in amounts as are generally required by the Mortgage Loan Seller for loans originated
for securitization, and in any event not less than $1 million per occurrence and $2 million in the aggregate.
 
An architectural or engineering consultant
has performed an analysis of each of the Mortgaged Properties located in seismic zones 3 or 4 in order to evaluate the structural
and seismic condition of such property, for the sole purpose of assessing the probable maximum loss (“PML”)
for the Mortgaged Property in the event of an earthquake. In such instance, the PML or equivalent was based on a 475-year return
period, an exposure period of 50 years and a 10% probability of exceedance. If the resulting report concluded that the PML or equivalent
would exceed 20% of the amount of the replacement costs of the improvements, earthquake insurance on such Mortgaged Property was
obtained by an insurer rated at least “A:VIII” by A.M. Best Company or “A3” (or the equivalent) from Moody’s
Investors Service, Inc. or “A-“ by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services in an amount not less than 100%
of the PML or the equivalent.
 
The Mortgage Loan documents require insurance
proceeds in respect of a property loss to be applied either (a) to the repair or restoration of all or part of the related
Mortgaged Property, with respect to all property losses in excess of 5% of the then-outstanding principal amount of the related
Mortgage Loan, the lender (or a trustee appointed by it) having the right to hold and disburse such proceeds as the repair or restoration
progresses, or (b) to the payment of the outstanding principal balance of such Mortgage Loan together with any accrued interest
thereon.
 
All premiums on all insurance policies referred
to in this section required to be paid as of the Cut-off Date have been paid, and such insurance policies name the lender under
the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns as a loss payee under a mortgagee endorsement clause or, in the case of the general
liability insurance policy, as named or additional insured. Such insurance policies will inure to the benefit of the trustee. Each
related Mortgage Loan obligates the related Mortgagor to maintain all such insurance and, at such Mortgagor’s failure to
do so, authorizes the lender to maintain such insurance at the Mortgagor’s cost and expense and to charge such Mortgagor
for related premiums. All such insurance policies (other than commercial liability policies) require at least 10 days’ prior
notice to the lender of termination or cancellation arising because of nonpayment of a premium and at least 30 days prior notice
to the lender of termination or cancellation (or such lesser period, not less than 10 days, as may be required by applicable law)
arising for any reason other than non-payment of a premium and no such notice has been received by the Mortgage Loan Seller.
 
19.     Access;
Utilities; Separate Tax Lots. Each Mortgaged Property (a) is located on or adjacent to a public road and has direct legal
access to such road, or has access via an irrevocable easement or
 


D-1-6
 
 
irrevocable right of way permitting ingress and egress to/from
a public road, (b) is served by or has uninhibited access rights to public or private water and sewer (or well and septic)
and all required utilities, all of which are appropriate for the current use of the Mortgaged Property, and (c) constitutes
one or more separate tax parcels which do not include any property which is not part of the Mortgaged Property or is subject to
an endorsement under the related Title Policy insuring the Mortgaged Property, or in certain cases, an application has been made
to the applicable governing authority for creation of separate tax lots, in which case the Mortgage Loan requires the Mortgagor
to escrow an amount sufficient to pay taxes for the existing tax parcel of which the Mortgaged Property is a part until the separate
tax lots are created.
 
20.     No
Encroachments. To the Mortgage Loan Seller’s knowledge and based solely on surveys obtained in connection with origination
and the lender’s Title Policy (or, if such policy is not yet issued, a pro forma title policy, a preliminary title policy
with escrow instructions or a “marked up” commitment) obtained in connection with the origination of each Mortgage
Loan, (a) all material improvements that were included for the purpose of determining the appraised value of the related Mortgaged
Property at the time of the origination of such Mortgage Loan are within the boundaries of the related Mortgaged Property, except
encroachments that do not materially and adversely affect the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property, or are insured by
applicable provisions of the Title Policy, (b) no improvements on adjoining parcels encroach onto the related Mortgaged Property
except for encroachments that do not materially and adversely affect the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property, or are
insured by applicable provisions of the Title Policy and (c) no improvements encroach upon any easements except for encroachments
the removal of which would not materially and adversely affect the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property or are insured
by applicable provisions of the Title Policy.
 
21.     No
Contingent Interest or Equity Participation. No Mortgage Loan has a shared appreciation feature, any other contingent interest
feature or a negative amortization feature (except that an ARD Loan may provide for the accrual of the portion of interest in excess
of the rate in effect prior to the Anticipated Repayment Date) or an equity participation by the Mortgage Loan Seller.
 
22.     REMIC.
The Mortgage Loan is a “qualified mortgage” within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code (but determined
without regard to the rule in Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(f)(2) that treats certain defective mortgage loans as
qualified mortgages), and, accordingly, (A) the issue price of the Mortgage Loan to the related Mortgagor at origination did
not exceed the non-contingent principal amount of the Mortgage Loan and (B) either: (a) such Mortgage Loan is secured
by an interest in real property (including buildings and structural components thereof, but excluding personal property) having
a fair market value (i) at the date the Mortgage Loan was originated at least equal to 80% of the adjusted issue price of
the Mortgage Loan or Whole Loan on such date or (ii) at the Closing Date at least equal to 80% of the adjusted issue price
of the Mortgage Loan or Whole Loan on such date, provided
that for purposes hereof, the fair market value of the real property interest must first be reduced by (A) the amount of any
lien on the real property interest that is senior to the Mortgage Loan and (B) a proportionate amount of any lien that is
in parity with the Mortgage Loan; or (b) substantially all of the proceeds of such Mortgage Loan were used to acquire, improve
or protect the real property which served as the only security for such Mortgage Loan (other than a recourse feature or other third-party
credit enhancement within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(a)(1)(ii)). If the Mortgage Loan was “significantly
modified” prior to the Closing Date so as to result in a taxable exchange under Section 1001 of the Code, it either
(x) was modified as a result of the default or reasonably foreseeable default of such Mortgage Loan or (y) satisfies
the provisions of either sub-clause (B)(a)(i) above (substituting the date of the last such modification for the date the
Mortgage Loan was originated) or sub-clause (B)(a)(ii), including the proviso thereto. Any prepayment premium and yield maintenance
charges applicable to the Mortgage Loan constitute “customary prepayment penalties” within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.860G-(b)(2). All terms used in this paragraph shall have the same meanings as set forth in the related
Treasury Regulations.
 
23.     Compliance.
The terms of the Mortgage Loan documents evidencing such Mortgage Loan, comply in all material respects with all applicable local,
state and federal laws and regulations, and the Mortgage Loan Seller has complied with all material requirements pertaining to
the origination of the Mortgage Loans, including but not limited to, usury and any and all other material requirements of any
 


D-1-7
 
 
federal,
state or local law to the extent non-compliance would have a material adverse effect on the Mortgage Loan.
 
24.     Authorized
to do Business. To the extent required under applicable law, as of the Closing Date or as of the date that such entity held
the Mortgage Note, each holder of the Mortgage Note was authorized to transact and do business in the jurisdiction in which each
related Mortgaged Property is located, or the failure to be so authorized does not materially and adversely affect the enforceability
of such Mortgage Loan.
 
25.     Trustee
under Deed of Trust. With respect to each Mortgage which is a deed of trust, a trustee, duly qualified under applicable law
to serve as such, currently so serves and is named in the deed of trust or has been substituted in accordance with the Mortgage
and applicable law or may be substituted in accordance with the Mortgage and applicable law by the related mortgagee, and except
in connection with a trustee’s sale after a default by the related Mortgagor or in connection with any full or partial release
of the related Mortgaged Property or related security for such Mortgage Loan, no fees are payable to such trustee except for de
minimis fees paid.
 
26.     Local
Law Compliance. To the Mortgage Loan Seller’s knowledge, based solely upon any of a letter from any governmental authorities,
a legal opinion, an architect’s letter, a zoning consultant’s report, an endorsement to the related Title Policy, or
other affirmative investigation of local law compliance consistent with the investigation conducted by the Mortgage Loan Seller
for similar commercial and multifamily mortgage loans intended for securitization, the improvements located on or forming part
of each Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan are in material compliance with applicable laws, zoning ordinances, rules,
covenants, and restrictions (collectively “Zoning Regulations”)
governing the occupancy, use, and operation of such Mortgaged Property or constitute a legal non-conforming use or structure and
any non-conformity with zoning laws constitutes a legal non-conforming use or structure which does not materially and adversely
affect the use or operation of such Mortgaged Property. In the event of casualty or destruction, (a) the Mortgaged Property
may be restored or repaired to the extent necessary to maintain the use of the structure immediately prior to such casualty or
destruction, (b) law and ordinance insurance coverage has been obtained for the Mortgaged Property in amounts customarily
required by the Mortgage Loan Seller for loans originated for securitization that provides coverage for additional costs to rebuild
and/or repair the property to current Zoning Regulations, (c) the inability to restore the Mortgaged Property to the full
extent of the use or structure immediately prior to the casualty would not materially and adversely affect the use or operation
of such Mortgaged Property, or (d) title insurance coverage has been obtained for such nonconformity.
 
27.     Licenses
and Permits. Each Mortgagor covenants in the Mortgage Loan documents that it shall keep all material licenses, permits, franchises,
certificates of occupancy, consents, and other approvals necessary for the operation of the Mortgaged Property in full force and
effect, and to the Mortgage Loan Seller’s knowledge based upon any of a letter from any government authorities or other affirmative
investigation of local law compliance consistent with the investigation conducted by the Mortgage Loan Seller for similar commercial
and multifamily mortgage loans intended for securitization; all such material licenses, permits, franchises, certificates of occupancy,
consents, and other approvals are in effect or the failure to obtain or maintain such material licenses, permits, franchises or
certificates of occupancy does not materially and adversely affect the use and/or operation of the Mortgaged Property as it was
used and operated as of the date of origination of the Mortgage Loan or the rights of a holder of the related Mortgage Loan. The
Mortgage Loan requires the related Mortgagor to be qualified to do business in the jurisdiction in which the related Mortgaged
Property is located and for the Mortgagor and the Mortgaged Property to be in compliance in all material respects with all regulations,
zoning and building laws.
 
28.     Recourse
Obligations. The Mortgage Loan documents for each Mortgage Loan provide that such Mortgage Loan (a) becomes full recourse
to the Mortgagor and guarantor (which is a natural person or persons, or an entity distinct from the Mortgagor (but may be affiliated
with the Mortgagor) that has assets other than equity in the related Mortgaged Property that are not de
minimis) in any of the following events: (i) if any petition for bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation
pursuant to federal bankruptcy law, or any similar federal or state law, shall be filed by, consented to, or acquiesced in by,
the Mortgagor; (ii) Mortgagor or guarantor shall have colluded with other creditors to cause an involuntary bankruptcy
 


D-1-8
 
 
filing
with respect to the Mortgagor or (iii) transfers of either the Mortgaged Property or equity interests in Mortgagor made in
violation of the Mortgage Loan documents; and (b) contains provisions providing for recourse against the Mortgagor and guarantor
(which is a natural person or persons, or an entity distinct from the Mortgagor (but may be affiliated with the Mortgagor) that
has assets other than equity in the related Mortgaged Property that are not de
minimis), for losses and damages sustained in the case of (i) (A) misapplication, misappropriation or conversion
of insurance proceeds or condemnation awards or of rents following an event of default, or (B) any security deposits not delivered
to lender upon foreclosure or action in lieu thereof (except to the extent applied in accordance with leases prior to a Mortgage
Loan event of default); (ii) the Mortgagor’s fraud or intentional misrepresentation; (iii) willful misconduct by
the Mortgagor or guarantor; (iv) breaches of the environmental covenants in the Mortgage Loan documents; or (v) commission
of material physical waste at the Mortgaged Property, which may, with respect to this clause (v), in certain instances, be
limited to acts or omissions of the related Mortgagor, guarantor, property manager or their affiliates, employees or agents.
 
29.     Mortgage
Releases. The terms of the related Mortgage or related Mortgage Loan documents do not provide for release of any material portion
of the Mortgaged Property from the lien of the Mortgage except (a) a partial release, accompanied by principal repayment of
not less than a specified percentage at least equal to 115% of the related allocated loan amount of such portion of the Mortgaged
Property, (b) upon payment in full of such Mortgage Loan, (c) upon a Defeasance defined in paragraph (34) below,
(d) releases of out-parcels that are unimproved or other portions of the Mortgaged Property which will not have a material
adverse effect on the underwritten value of the Mortgaged Property and which were not afforded any material value in the appraisal
obtained at the origination of the Mortgage Loan and are not necessary for physical access to the Mortgaged Property or compliance
with zoning requirements, or (e) as required pursuant to an order of condemnation. With respect to any partial release under
the preceding clauses (a) or (d), either: (x) such release of collateral (i) would not constitute a “significant
modification” of the subject Mortgage Loan within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(b)(2) and (ii) would
not cause the subject Mortgage Loan to fail to be a “qualified mortgage” within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(3)(A)
of the Code; or (y) the mortgagee or servicer can, in accordance with the related Mortgage Loan documents, condition such
release of collateral on the related Mortgagor’s delivery of an opinion of tax counsel to the effect specified in the immediately
preceding clause (x). For purposes of the preceding clause (x), for any Mortgage Loan originated after December 6,
2010, if the fair market value of the real property constituting such Mortgaged Property after the release is not equal to at least
80% of the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan or Whole Loan outstanding after the release, the Mortgagor is required to make
a payment of principal in an amount not less than the amount required by the REMIC Provisions.
 
In the case of any Mortgage Loan originated
after December 6, 2010, in the event of a taking of any portion of a Mortgaged Property by a State or any political subdivision
or authority thereof, whether by legal proceeding or by agreement, the Mortgagor can be required to pay down the principal balance
of the Mortgage Loan or Whole Loan in an amount not less than the amount required by the REMIC Provisions and, to such extent,
may not be required to apply such an amount to the restoration of the Mortgaged Property or released to the Mortgagor, if, immediately
after the release of such portion of the Mortgaged Property from the lien of the Mortgage (but taking into account the planned
restoration) the fair market value of the real property constituting the remaining Mortgaged Property is not equal to at least
80% of the remaining principal balance of the Mortgage Loan or Whole Loan.
 
In the case of any Mortgage Loan originated
after December 6, 2010, no such Mortgage Loan that is secured by more than one Mortgaged Property or that is cross-collateralized
with another Mortgage Loan permits the release of cross-collateralization of the related Mortgaged Properties or a portion thereof,
including due to a partial condemnation, other than in compliance with the loan-to-value ratio and other requirements of the REMIC
Provisions.
 
30.     Financial
Reporting and Rent Rolls. Each Mortgage requires the Mortgagor to provide the owner or holder of the Mortgage with quarterly
(other than for single-tenant properties) and annual operating statements, and quarterly (other than for single-tenant properties)
rent rolls for properties that have leases contributing more than 5% of the in-place base rent and annual financial statements,
which annual
 


D-1-9
 
 
financial statements (i) with respect to each Mortgage Loan with more than one Mortgagor are in the form of an
annual combined balance sheet of the Mortgagor entities (and no other entities), together with the related combined statements
of operations, members’ capital and cash flows, including a combining balance sheet and statement of income for the Mortgaged
Properties on a combined basis and (ii) for each Mortgage Loan with an original principal balance greater than $50 million
shall be audited by an independent certified public accountant upon the request of the owner or holder of the Mortgage.
 
31.     Acts
of Terrorism Exclusion. With respect to each Mortgage Loan over $20 million, the related special-form all-risk insurance policy
and business interruption policy (issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements) do not specifically exclude Acts
of Terrorism, as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization
Act of 2007 (collectively referred to as “TRIA”),
from coverage, or if such coverage is excluded, it is covered by a separate terrorism insurance policy. With respect to each other
Mortgage Loan, the related special all-risk insurance policy and business interruption policy (issued by an insurer meeting the
Insurance Rating Requirements) did not, as of the date of origination of the Mortgage Loan, and, to the Mortgage Loan Seller’s
knowledge, do not, as of the Cut-off Date, specifically exclude Acts of Terrorism, as defined in TRIA, from coverage, or if such
coverage is excluded, it is covered by a separate terrorism insurance policy. With respect to each Mortgage Loan, the related Mortgage
Loan documents do not expressly waive or prohibit the mortgagee from requiring coverage for Acts of Terrorism, as defined in TRIA,
or damages related thereto, except to the extent that any right to require such coverage may be limited by availability on commercially
reasonable terms.
 
32.     Due
on Sale or Encumbrance. Subject to specific exceptions set forth below, each Mortgage Loan contains a “due-on-sale”
or other such provision for the acceleration of the payment of the unpaid principal balance of such Mortgage Loan if, without the
consent of the holder of the Mortgage and/or complying with the requirements of the related Mortgage Loan documents (which provide
for transfers without the consent of the lender which are customarily acceptable to the Mortgage Loan Seller lending on the security
of property comparable to the related Mortgaged Property, such as transfers of worn-out or obsolete furnishings, fixtures, or equipment
promptly replaced with property of equivalent value and functionality and transfers by leases entered into in accordance with the
Mortgage Loan documents), (a) the related Mortgaged Property, or any controlling equity interest in the related Mortgagor,
is directly or indirectly pledged, transferred or sold, other than as related to (i) family and estate planning transfers
or transfers upon death or legal incapacity, (ii) transfers to certain affiliates as defined in the related Mortgage Loan
documents, (iii) transfers of less than a controlling interest in a Mortgagor, (iv) transfers to another holder of direct
or indirect equity in the Mortgagor, a specific Person designated in the related Mortgage Loan documents or a Person satisfying
specific criteria identified in the related Mortgage Loan documents, (v) transfers of common stock in publicly traded companies,
(vi) a substitution or release of collateral within the parameters of paragraphs 29 and 34 in this Annex D-1,
or (vii) by reason of any mezzanine debt that existed at the origination of the related Mortgage Loan, or future permitted
mezzanine debt or (b) the related Mortgaged Property is encumbered with a subordinate lien or security interest against the
related Mortgaged Property, other than (i) any companion interest of any Mortgage Loan or any subordinate debt that existed
at origination and is permitted under the related Mortgage Loan documents, (ii) purchase money security interests, (iii) any
Mortgage Loan that is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with another Mortgage Loan or (iv) Permitted Encumbrances.
The Mortgage or other Mortgage Loan documents provide that to the extent any Rating Agency fees are incurred in connection with
the review of and consent to any transfer or encumbrance, the Mortgagor is responsible for such payment along with all other reasonable
fees and expenses incurred by the mortgagee relative to such transfer or encumbrance.
 
33.     Single-Purpose
Entity. Each Mortgage Loan requires the Mortgagor to be a Single-Purpose Entity for at least as long as the Mortgage Loan is
outstanding. Both the Mortgage Loan documents and the organizational documents of the Mortgagor with respect to each Mortgage Loan
with a Cut-off Date Principal Balance in excess of $5 million provide that the Mortgagor is a Single-Purpose Entity, and each Mortgage
Loan with a Cut-off Date Principal Balance of $20 million or more has a counsel’s opinion regarding non-consolidation of
the Mortgagor. For this purpose, a “Single-Purpose Entity”
shall mean an entity, other than an individual, whose organizational documents (or if the Mortgage Loan has a Cut-off
 


D-1-10
 
 
Date Principal
Balance equal to $5 million or less, its organizational documents or the related Mortgage Loan documents) provide substantially
to the effect that it was formed or organized solely for the purpose of owning and operating one or more of the Mortgaged Properties
securing the Mortgage Loans and prohibit it from engaging in any business unrelated to such Mortgaged Property or Properties, and
whose organizational documents further provide, or which entity represented in the related Mortgage Loan documents, substantially
to the effect that it does not have any assets other than those related to its interest in and operation of such Mortgaged Property
or Properties, or any indebtedness other than as permitted by the related Mortgage(s) or the other related Mortgage Loan documents,
that it has its own books and records and accounts separate and apart from those of any other person (other than a Mortgagor for
a Mortgage Loan that is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with the related Mortgage Loan), and that it holds itself out
as a legal entity, separate and apart from any other person or entity.
 
34.     Defeasance.
With respect to any Mortgage Loan that, pursuant to the Mortgage Loan documents, can be defeased (a “Defeasance”),
(i) the Mortgage Loan documents provide for defeasance as a unilateral right of the Mortgagor, subject to satisfaction of
conditions specified in the Mortgage Loan documents; (ii) the Mortgage Loan cannot be defeased within two years after the
Closing Date; (iii) the Mortgagor is permitted to pledge only United States “government securities” within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(a)(8)(ii), the revenues from which will be sufficient to make all scheduled
payments under the Mortgage Loan when due, including the entire remaining principal balance on the maturity date (or on or after
the first date on which payment may be made without payment of a yield maintenance charge or prepayment penalty) or, if the Mortgage
Loan is an ARD Loan, the entire principal balance outstanding on the Anticipated Repayment Date, and if the Mortgage Loan permits
partial releases of real property in connection with partial defeasance, the revenues from the collateral will be sufficient to
pay all such scheduled payments calculated on a principal amount equal to a specified percentage at least equal to 115% of the
allocated loan amount for the real property to be released; (iv) the defeasance collateral is not permitted to be subject
to prepayment, call, or early redemption; (v) the Mortgagor is required to provide a certification from an independent certified
public accountant that the collateral is sufficient to make all scheduled payments under the Mortgage Note as set forth in (iii) above;
(vi) if the Mortgagor would continue to own assets in addition to the defeasance collateral, the portion of the Mortgage Loan
secured by defeasance collateral is required to be assumed by a Single-Purpose Entity; (vii) the Mortgagor is required to
deliver an opinion of counsel that the trustee has a perfected security interest in such collateral prior to any other claim or
interest; and (viii) the Mortgagor is required to pay all rating agency fees associated with defeasance (if rating confirmation
is a specific condition precedent thereto) and all other reasonable expenses associated with defeasance, including, but not limited
to, accountant’s fees and opinions of counsel.
 
35.     Fixed
Interest Rates. Each Mortgage Loan bears interest at a rate that remains fixed throughout the remaining term of such Mortgage
Loan, except in the case of an ARD Loan and situations where default interest is imposed.
 
36.     Ground
Leases. For purposes of the MLPA, a “Ground Lease”
shall mean a leasehold estate in real property where the fee owner as the ground lessor conveys for a term or terms of years its
entire interest in the land and buildings and other improvements, if any, to the ground lessee (who may, in certain circumstances,
own the building and improvements on the land), subject to the reversionary interest of the ground lessor as fee owner.
 
With respect to any Mortgage Loan where
the Mortgage Loan is secured by a ground leasehold estate in whole or in part, and the related Mortgage does not also encumber
the related lessor’s fee interest in such Mortgaged Property, based upon the terms of the ground lease and any estoppel or
other agreement received from the ground lessor in favor of the Mortgage Loan Seller, its successors and assigns, the Mortgage
Loan Seller represents and warrants that:
 
(A)     The
ground lease or a memorandum regarding such ground lease has been duly recorded or submitted for recordation in a form that is
acceptable for recording in the applicable jurisdiction. The ground lease or an estoppel or other agreement received from the ground
lessor permits the interest of the lessee to be encumbered by the related Mortgage and does not restrict the use of the related
Mortgaged Property by such lessee, its successors or assigns in a manner that would adversely affect the
 


D-1-11
 
 
security provided by the
related Mortgage. To the Mortgage Loan Seller’s knowledge, no material change in the terms of the ground lease had occurred
since its recordation, except by any written instruments which are included in the related Mortgage File;
 
(B)     The
lessor under such ground lease has agreed in a writing included in the related Mortgage File (or in such ground lease) that the
ground lease may not be amended, modified, canceled or terminated without the prior written consent of the lender and that any
such action without such consent is not binding on the lender, its successors or assigns;
 
(C)     The
ground lease has an original term (or an original term plus one or more optional renewal terms, which, under all circumstances,
may be exercised, and will be enforceable, by either borrower or the mortgagee) that extends not less than 20 years beyond the
stated maturity of the related Mortgage Loan, or 10 years past the stated maturity if such Mortgage Loan fully amortizes by the
stated maturity (or with respect to a Mortgage Loan that accrues on an actual 360 basis, substantially amortizes);
 
(D)     The
ground lease is not subject to any interests, estates, liens or encumbrances superior to, or of equal priority with, the Mortgage,
except for the related fee interest of the ground lessor and the Permitted Encumbrances;
 
(E)     The
ground lease does not place commercially unreasonable restrictions on the identity of the mortgagee and the ground lease is assignable
to the holder of the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns without the consent of the lessor thereunder, and in the event
it is so assigned, it is further assignable by the holder of the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns without the consent
of the lessor;
 
(F)     The
Mortgage Loan Seller has not received any written notice of default under or notice of termination of such ground lease. To the
Mortgage Loan Seller’s knowledge, there is no default under such ground lease and no condition that, but for the passage
of time or giving of notice, would result in a default under the terms of such ground lease. Such ground lease is in full force
and effect as of the Closing Date;
 
(G)     The
ground lease or ancillary agreement between the lessor and the lessee requires the lessor to give to the lender written notice
of any default, provides that no notice of default or termination is effective unless such notice is given to the lender, and requires
that the ground lessor will supply an estoppel;
 
(H)     A
lender is permitted a reasonable opportunity (including, where necessary, sufficient time to gain possession of the interest of
the lessee under the ground lease through legal proceedings) to cure any default under the ground lease which is curable after
the lender’s receipt of notice of any default before the lessor may terminate the ground lease;
 
(I)      The
ground lease does not impose any restrictions on subletting that would be viewed as commercially unreasonable by the Mortgage Loan
Seller in connection with loans originated for securitization;
 
(J)     Under
the terms of the ground lease, an estoppel or other agreement received from the ground lessor and the related Mortgage (taken together),
any related insurance proceeds or the portion of the condemnation award allocable to the ground lessee’s interest (other
than in respect of a total or substantially total loss or taking as addressed in subpart (K)) will be applied either to the
repair or to restoration of all or part of the related Mortgaged Property with (so long as such proceeds are in excess of the threshold
amount specified in the related Mortgage Loan documents) the lender or a trustee appointed by it having the right to hold and disburse
such proceeds as repair or restoration progresses, or to the payment of the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan,
together with any accrued interest;
 
(K)     In
the case of a total or substantial taking or loss, under the terms of the ground lease, an estoppel or other agreement and the
related Mortgage (taken together), any related insurance proceeds,
 


D-1-12
 
 
or portion of the condemnation award allocable to ground lessee’s
interest in respect of a total or substantially total loss or taking of the related Mortgaged Property to the extent not applied
to restoration, will be applied first to the payment of the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, together with any
accrued interest; and
 
   (L)     Provided
that the lender cures any defaults which are susceptible to being cured, the ground lessor has agreed to enter into a new lease
with lender upon termination of the ground lease for any reason, including rejection of the ground lease in a bankruptcy proceeding.
 
37.     Servicing.

over its stated term, which term is at least 60 months after the related Anticipated Repayment Date. Each ARD Loan has an Anticipated
Repayment Date not less than five years following the origination of such Mortgage Loan. If the related Mortgagor elects not to
prepay its ARD Loan in full on or prior to the Anticipated Repayment Date pursuant to the existing terms of the Mortgage Loan or
a unilateral option (as defined in Treasury Regulations under Section 1001 of the Code) in the Mortgage Loan exercisable during
the term of the Mortgage Loan, (i) the Mortgage Loan’s interest rate will step up to an interest rate per
annum as specified in the related Mortgage Loan documents; provided,
however, that payment of such Excess Interest shall be deferred until the principal of such ARD Loan has been paid in
full; (ii) all or a substantial portion of the excess cash flow (which is net of certain costs associated with owning, managing
and operating the related Mortgaged Property) collected after the Anticipated Repayment Date shall be applied towards the prepayment
of such ARD Loan and once the principal balance of an ARD Loan has been reduced to zero all excess cash flow will be applied to
the payment of accrued Excess Interest; and (iii) if the property manager for the related Mortgaged Property can be removed
by or at the direction of the mortgagee on the basis of a debt service coverage test, the subject debt service coverage ratio shall
be calculated without taking account of any increase in the related Mortgage Interest Rate on such Mortgage Loan’s Anticipated
Repayment Date. No ARD Loan provides that the property manager for the related Mortgaged Property can be removed by or at the direction
of the mortgagee solely because of the passage of the related Anticipated Repayment Date.
 
39.     Rent
Rolls; Operating Histories. The Mortgage Loan Seller has obtained a rent roll (the “Certified
Rent Roll(s)”) other than with respect to hospitality properties certified by the related Mortgagor or the related
guarantor(s) as accurate and complete in all material respects as of a date within 180 days of the date of origination of the related
Mortgage Loan. The Mortgage Loan Seller has obtained operating histories (the “Certified
Operating Histories”) with respect to each Mortgaged Property certified by the related Mortgagor or the related

Mortgage Loan. The Certified Operating Histories collectively report on operations for a period equal to (a) at least a continuous
three-year period or (b) in the event the Mortgaged Property was owned, operated or constructed by the Mortgagor or an affiliate
for less than three years then for such shorter period of time, it being understood that for mortgaged properties acquired with
the proceeds of a Mortgage Loan, Certified Operating Histories may not have been available.
 
40.     No
Material Default; Payment Record. No Mortgage Loan has been more than 30 days delinquent, without giving effect to any grace
or cure period, in making required payments since origination, and as of the Closing Date, no Mortgage Loan is delinquent (beyond
any applicable grace or cure period) in making required payments. To the Mortgage Loan Seller’s knowledge, there is (a) no,
and since origination there has been no, material default, breach, violation or event of acceleration existing under the related
Mortgage Loan, or (b) no event (other than payments due but not yet delinquent) which, with the passage of time or with notice
and the expiration of any grace or cure period, would constitute a material default, breach, violation or event of acceleration,
provided, however, that this representation and
 


D-1-13
 
 
warranty
does not cover any default, breach, violation or event of acceleration that specifically pertains to or arises out of an exception
scheduled to any other representation and warranty made by the Mortgage Loan Seller in Exhibit C to the MLPA. No person other than
the holder of such Mortgage Loan may declare any event of default under the Mortgage Loan or accelerate any indebtedness under
the Mortgage Loan documents.
 
41.     Bankruptcy.
In respect of each Mortgage Loan, the related Mortgagor is not a debtor in any bankruptcy, receivership, conservatorship, reorganization,
insolvency, moratorium or similar proceeding.
 
42.     Organization

for such Mortgagor) (the “Controlling Owner”)
and all owners that hold a 20% or greater direct ownership share (i.e., the “Major
Sponsors”). The Mortgage Loan Seller (1) required questionnaires to be completed by each Controlling Owner
and guarantor or performed other processes designed to elicit information from each Controlling Owner and guarantor regarding such
Controlling Owner’s or guarantor’s prior history for at least 10 years regarding any bankruptcies or other insolvencies,
any felony convictions, and (2) performed or caused to be performed searches of the public records or services such as Lexis/Nexis,
or a similar service designed to elicit information about each Controlling Owner, Major Sponsor and guarantor regarding such Controlling
Owner’s, Major Sponsor’s or guarantor’s prior history for at least 10 years regarding any bankruptcies or other
insolvencies, any felony convictions, and provided, however,
that records searches were limited to the last 10 years. ((1) and (2) collectively, the “Sponsor
Diligence”). Based solely on the Sponsor Diligence, to the knowledge of the Mortgage Loan Seller, no Major Sponsor
or guarantor (i) was in a state of federal bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, (ii) had a prior record of having been
in a state of federal bankruptcy or insolvency, or (iii) had been convicted of a felony.

substances or materials which are included under or regulated by environmental laws are located on, or have been handled, manufactured,
generated, stored, processed, or disposed of on or released or discharged from the Mortgaged Property, except as disclosed by a
Phase I environmental assessment (or a Phase II environmental assessment, if applicable) delivered in connection with the
origination of the Mortgage Loan or except for those substances commonly used in the operation and maintenance of properties of
kind and nature similar to those of the Mortgaged Property in compliance with all environmental laws and in a manner that does
not result in contamination of the Mortgaged Property. A Phase I environmental site assessment (or update of a previous Phase I
and or Phase II site assessment) and, with respect to certain Mortgage Loans, a Phase II environmental site assessment
(collectively, an “ESA”) meeting ASTM requirements
conducted by a reputable environmental consultant in connection with such Mortgage Loan within 12 months prior to its origination
date (or an update of a previous ESA was prepared), and such ESA (i) did not reveal any known circumstance or condition that
rendered the Mortgaged Property at the date of the ESA in material noncompliance with applicable environmental laws or the existence
of recognized environmental conditions (as such term is defined in ASTM E1527-05 or its successor, hereinafter “Environmental
Condition”) or the need for further investigation, or (ii) if any material noncompliance with environmental
laws or the existence of an Environmental Condition or need for further investigation was indicated in any such ESA, then at least
one of the following statements is true: (A) 125% of the funds reasonably estimated by a reputable environmental consultant
to be sufficient to cover the estimated cost to cure any material noncompliance with applicable environmental laws or the Environmental
Condition has been escrowed by the related Mortgagor and is held by the related lender; (B) if the only Environmental Condition
relates to the presence of asbestos-containing materials, radon in indoor air, lead based paint, or lead in drinking water, and
the only recommended action in the ESA is the institution of such a plan, an operations or maintenance plan has been required to
be instituted by the related Mortgagor that can reasonably be expected to mitigate the identified risk; (C) the Environmental
Condition identified in the related environmental report was remediated or abated in all material respects prior to the Cut-off
Date, and, as appropriate, a no further action or closure letter was obtained from the applicable governmental regulatory authority
(or the environmental issue affecting the related Mortgaged Property was otherwise listed by such governmental authority as administratively
“closed” or a reputable environmental consultant
 


D-1-14
 
 
has concluded that no further action is required); (D) an environmental
policy or a lender’s pollution legal liability insurance policy meeting the requirements set forth below that covers liability
for the identified circumstance or condition was obtained from an insurer rated no less than A- (or the equivalent) by Moody’s
Investors Service, Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and/or Fitch Ratings, Inc.; (E) a party not related
to the Mortgagor with assets reasonably estimated to be adequate to effect all necessary remediation was identified as the responsible
party for such condition or circumstance; or (F) a party related to the Mortgagor with assets reasonably estimated to be adequate
to effect all necessary remediation was identified as the responsible party for such condition or circumstance is required to take
action. The ESA will be part of the Servicing File; and to the Mortgage Loan Seller’s knowledge, except as set forth in the
ESA, there is no (i) known circumstance or condition that rendered the Mortgaged Property in material noncompliance with applicable
environmental laws, (ii) Environmental Conditions (as such term is defined in ASTM E1527-05 or its successor), or (iii) need
for further investigation.
 
In the case of each Mortgage Loan set forth
on Schedule I to the MLPA, (i) such Mortgage Loan is the subject of an environmental insurance policy, issued by the issuer
set forth on Schedule I (the “Policy Issuer”)
and effective as of the date thereof (the “Environmental Insurance
Policy”), (ii) as of the Cut-off Date the Environmental Insurance Policy is in full force and effect, there
is no deductible and the trustee is a named insured under such policy, (iii)(a) a property condition or engineering report
was prepared, if the related Mortgaged Property was constructed prior to 1985, with respect to asbestos-containing materials (“ACM”)
and, if the related Mortgaged Property is a multifamily property, with respect to radon gas (“RG”)
and lead-based paint (“LBP”), and (b) if
such report disclosed the existence of a material and adverse LBP, ACM or RG environmental condition or circumstance affecting
the related Mortgaged Property, the related Mortgagor (A) was required to remediate the identified condition prior to closing
the Mortgage Loan or provide additional security or establish with the mortgagee a reserve in an amount deemed to be sufficient
by the Mortgage Loan Seller, for the remediation of the problem, and/or (B) agreed in the Mortgage Loan documents to establish
an operations and maintenance plan after the closing of the Mortgage Loan that should reasonably be expected to mitigate the environmental
risk related to the identified LBP, ACM or RG condition, (iv) on the effective date of the Environmental Insurance Policy,
the Mortgage Loan Seller as originator had no knowledge of any material and adverse environmental condition or circumstance affecting
the Mortgaged Property (other than the existence of LBP, ACM or RG) that was not disclosed to the Policy Issuer in one or more
of the following: (a) the application for insurance, (b) a Mortgagor questionnaire that was provided to the Policy Issuer,
or (c) an engineering or other report provided to the Policy Issuer, and (v) the premium of any Environmental Insurance
Policy has been paid through the maturity of the policy’s term and the term of such policy extends at least five years beyond
the maturity of the Mortgage Loan.

Estoppels. With respect to each Mortgage Loan predominantly secured by a retail, office or industrial property leased to a
single tenant, the Mortgage Loan Seller reviewed such estoppel obtained from such tenant no earlier than 90 days prior to the origination
date of the related Mortgage Loan, and to the Mortgage Loan Seller’s knowledge based solely on the related estoppel certificate,
the related lease is in full force and effect or if not in full force and effect the related space was underwritten as vacant,
subject to customary reservations of tenant’s rights, such as, without limitation, with respect to common area maintenance
(“CAM”) and pass-through audits and verification
of landlord’s compliance with co-tenancy provisions. With respect to each Mortgage Loan predominantly secured by a retail,
office or industrial property, the Mortgage Loan Seller has received lease estoppels executed within 90 days of the origination
date of the related Mortgage Loan that collectively account for at least 65% of the in-place base rent for the Mortgaged Property
or set of cross-collateralized properties that secure a Mortgage Loan that is represented on the Certified Rent Roll. To the Mortgage
Loan Seller’s knowledge, each lease represented on the Certified Rent Roll is in full force and effect, subject to customary
reservations of tenant’s rights, such as with respect to CAM and pass-through audits and verification of landlord’s
compliance with co-tenancy provisions.
 
45.     Appraisal.

Market Square at Montrose (Loan No. 49)

(Ground Leases) – The ground lease does not expressly provide
  that it may not be terminated without the consent of the lender, subject, however, to the lender’s cure rights. At origination
  of the Mortgage Loan, the ground lessor executed an estoppel providing that it will enter into a new lease with the lender in the
  event of any termination or any rejection of the ground lease in bankruptcy.
 
The current term of the ground lease expires in October 2027,
  which is not more than 20 years beyond the stated maturity date. The Mortgagor has an option to extend the lease until October
  2067, which is more than 20 years beyond the stated maturity date, but the lender does not have express rights to exercise such
  options. However, the lender is entitled to a new lease in the event the Mortgagor fails to exercise the extension options. In
  addition, the lender is holding an extension letter in escrow and, upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default under
  the Mortgage Loan documents and the Mortgagor’s subsequent failure to exercise the extension option, may send such letter.
 
In the event of a substantial or total casualty during
the last two (2) years of the ground lease term, the Mortgagor may terminate the lease and any proceeds will be applied to remove
and raze the improvements at the Mortgaged Property, pave over the Mortgaged Property, and then to pay off the Mortgage Loan,
in that order. However, the Mortgage Loan matures two (2) years prior to the expiration of the ground lease and the ground lessor
agreed in an estoppel related to the Mortgage Loan not to accept a termination of the ground lease following an event of casualty
during the last two (2) years of the term without the prior written consent of the lender.

Description of Certificates
 
We will offer certificates in one or more classes of
  a series of certificates issued pursuant to a pooling and servicing agreement or other agreement specified in the related
  prospectus supplement.  The certificates will represent in the aggregate the entire beneficial ownership interest
  in the trust fund created by that agreement.

 
 
 

 
 
As described in the related prospectus supplement, the certificates of each
  series, may consist of one or more classes of certificates that, among other things:

 
 
 

 
 
·
are senior or subordinate to one or more other classes of certificates
  in entitlement to certain distributions on the certificates;

 
 
 
 

 
 
·
are principal-only certificates entitled to distributions of principal,
  with disproportionately small, nominal or no distributions of interest;

 
 
 
 

 
 
·
are interest-only certificates entitled to distributions of interest,
  with disproportionately small, nominal or no distributions of principal;

 
 
 
 

 
 
·
provide for distributions of interest on, or principal of, the
  certificates that begin only after the occurrence of certain events, such as the retirement of one or more other classes of
  certificates of that series;

 
 
 
 

 
 
·
provide for distributions of principal of the certificates to be
  made, from time to time or for designated periods, at a rate that is faster, or slower than the rate at which payments or
  other collections of principal are received on the mortgage assets in the related trust fund;

 
 
 
 

 
 
·
provide for controlled distributions of principal to be made based
  on a specified schedule or other methodology, subject to available funds; or

 
 
 
 

 
 
·
provide for distributions based on collections of prepayment premiums
  or yield maintenance penalties on the mortgage assets in the related trust fund.

 
 
 
 

 
 
Each class of certificates, other than interest-only certificates and residual
  certificates which are only entitled to a residual interest in the trust fund, will have a stated principal balance.  Each
  class

 

4

 

 



 
 
 
 

 
 
of certificates, other than principal-only certificates and residual certificates,
  will accrue interest on its stated principal balance or, in the case of interest-only certificates, on a notional amount.  Each
  class of certificates entitled to interest will accrue interest based on a fixed, variable or adjustable pass-through interest
  rate.  The related prospectus supplement will specify the principal balance, notional amount and/or fixed pass-through
  interest rate, or, in the case of a variable or adjustable pass-through interest rate, the method for determining that rate,
  as applicable, for each class of offered certificates.

 
 
 

 
 
The certificates will be guaranteed or insured only to the extent specified
  in the related prospectus supplement.  See “Risk Factors—The Assets of the Trust Fund May Not
  Be Sufficient to Pay Your Certificates” and “Description of the Certificates” in this prospectus.

 
 
 

Distributions of Interest on the
 
 
 

Certificates
 
Interest on each class of offered certificates, other
  than certain classes of principal-only certificates and certain classes of residual certificates, of each series will accrue
  at the applicable fixed, variable or adjustable pass-through interest rate on the principal balance or, in the case of certain
  classes of interest-only certificates, on the notional amount, outstanding from time to time.  Interest will be
  distributed to you as provided in the related prospectus supplement on specified distribution dates.  Distributions
  of interest with respect to one or more classes of accrual certificates may not begin until the occurrence of certain events,
  such as the retirement of one or more other classes of certificates, and interest accrued with respect to a class of accrual
  certificates before the occurrence of that event will either be added to its principal balance or otherwise deferred.  Distributions
  of interest with respect to one or more classes of certificates may be reduced to the extent of certain delinquencies, losses
  and other contingencies described in this prospectus and in the related prospectus supplement.  See “Risk
  Factors—Prepayments of the Mortgage Assets Will Affect the Timing of Your Cash Flow and May Affect Your Yield”;
  “Yield and Maturity Considerations” and “Description of the Certificates—Distributions of
  Interest on the Certificates” in this prospectus.

 
 
 

Distributions of Principal of the
 
 
 

Certificates
 
Each class of certificates of each series, other than
  certain classes of interest-only certificates and certain classes of residual certificates, will have a principal balance.  The
  principal balance of a class of certificates will represent the maximum amount that you are entitled to receive as principal
  from future cash flows on the assets in the related trust fund.

 
 
 

 
 
Distributions of principal with respect to one or more classes of certificates
  may:

 
 
 

 
 
·
not commence until the occurrence of certain events, such as the
  retirement of one or more other classes of certificates of the same series;

 


5

 




 
 
 
 

 
 
·
be made, subject to certain limitations, based on a specified principal
  payment schedule resulting in a controlled amortization class of certificates;

 
 
 
 

 
 
·
be contingent on the specified principal payment schedule for a
  controlled amortization class of the same series and the rate at which payments and other collections of principal on the
  mortgage assets in the related trust fund are received;

 
 
 
 

 
 
·
be made at a rate that is faster, and, in some cases, substantially
  faster, than the rate at which payments or other collections of principal are received on the mortgage assets in the related
  trust fund; or

 
 
 
 

 
 
·
be made at a rate that is slower, and, in some cases, substantially
  slower, than the rate at which payments or other collections of principal are received on the mortgage assets in the related
  trust fund.

 
 
 
 

 
 
See “Description of the Certificates—Distributions of Principal
  on the Certificates” in this prospectus.

 
 
 
 

Advances
 
If provided in the related prospectus supplement, if
  a trust fund includes mortgage loans, the master servicer, a special servicer, the trustee, any provider of credit support
  and/or any other specified person may be obligated to make, or have the option of making, certain advances (i) with respect
  to delinquent scheduled payments of principal and/or interest on those mortgage loans and (ii) to pay delinquent real estate
  taxes, assessments and hazard insurance premiums and other similar costs and expenses in connection with the servicing of
  the mortgage loans.  Any of the advances of principal and interest or servicing advances made with respect to a
  particular mortgage loan will be reimbursable from subsequent recoveries from the related mortgage loan and otherwise to the
  extent described in this prospectus and in the related prospectus supplement.  If provided in the prospectus supplement
  for a series of certificates, any entity making these advances may be entitled to receive interest on those advances while
  they are outstanding, payable from amounts in the related trust fund.  If a trust fund includes mortgage participations,
  pass-through certificates or other mortgage-backed securities, any comparable advancing obligation will be described in the
  related prospectus supplement.  See “Description of the Certificates—Advances in Respect of Delinquencies”
  in this prospectus.

 
 
 
 

Termination
 
If so specified in the related prospectus supplement,
  the mortgage assets in the related trust fund may be sold, causing an early termination of a series of certificates in the
  manner set forth in the prospectus supplement.  If so provided in the related prospectus supplement, upon the reduction
  of the principal balance of a specified class or classes of certificates by a specified percentage or amount, the party specified

Registration of Book-Entry
 
 
 

Certificates
 
If so provided in the related prospectus supplement,
  one or more classes of the offered certificates of any series will be book-entry certificates offered through the facilities
  of The Depository Trust Company.  Each class of book-entry certificates will be initially represented by one or
  more certificates registered in the name of a nominee of The Depository Trust Company.  No person acquiring an interest
  in a class of book-entry certificates will be entitled to receive definitive certificates of that class in fully registered
  form, except under the limited circumstances described in this prospectus.  See “Risk Factors—Book-Entry
  System for Certain Classes May Decrease Liquidity and Delay Payment” and “Description of the Certificates—Book-Entry
  Registration and Definitive Certificates” in this prospectus.

 
 
 

Material Federal Income Tax
 
 
 

Consequences
 
The federal income tax consequences to certificateholders
  will vary depending on whether one or more elections are made to treat the trust fund or specified portions of the trust fund
  as one or more “real estate mortgage investment conduits” (each, a “REMIC”) or grantor trusts
  under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.  The prospectus supplement for each series of certificates will
  specify whether one or more REMIC elections will be made.  See “Material Federal Income Tax Consequences”
  in this prospectus.

 
 
 

Certain ERISA Considerations
 
If you are a fiduciary of any retirement plans or certain
  other employee benefit plans and arrangements, including individual retirement accounts, annuities, Keogh plans, and collective
  investment funds and insurance company general and separate accounts in which those plans, accounts, annuities or arrangements
  are invested, that are subject to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code, you should carefully review with
  your legal advisors whether the purchase or holding of offered certificates could give rise to a transaction that is prohibited
  or is not otherwise permissible either under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code.  See “Certain ERISA Considerations”
  in this prospectus and in the related prospectus supplement.

 
 
 

Legal Investment
 
Your offered certificates will constitute “mortgage
  related securities” for purposes of the Secondary Mortgage Market Enhancement Act of 1984, as amended, only if the related
  prospectus supplement so provides.  If your investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations,
  regulatory capital requirements or review by regulatory authorities, then you may be subject to restrictions on investment
  in the offered certificates.  You should consult your own legal advisors for assistance in determining the suitability
  of and consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and sale of the offered certificates.  See “Legal
  Investment” in this prospectus and in the related prospectus supplement.

RISK
FACTORS
 
You should carefully consider the following
risks and the risks described under “Risk Factors” in the prospectus supplement for the applicable series of
certificates before making an investment decision. In particular, distributions on your certificates will depend on payments received
on and other recoveries with respect to the mortgage loans. Thus, you should carefully consider the risk factors relating to the
mortgage loans and the mortgaged properties.
 
Your Ability to Resell Certificates
May Be Limited Because of Their Characteristics
 
We cannot assure you that a secondary market
for the certificates will develop or, if it does develop, that it will provide you with liquidity of investment or will continue
for the life of your certificates. The prospectus supplement for any series of offered certificates may indicate that an underwriter
intends to make a secondary market in those offered certificates; however, no underwriter will be obligated to do so and may discontinue
such a secondary market at any time. Any resulting secondary market may provide you with less liquidity than any comparable market
for certificates that evidence interests in single-family mortgage loans.
 
The primary source of ongoing information
regarding the offered certificates of any series, including information regarding the status of the related mortgage assets and
any credit support for your certificates, will be the periodic reports delivered to you. See “Description of the Certificates—Reports
to Certificateholders” in this prospectus. We cannot assure you that any additional ongoing information regarding your
certificates will be available through any other source. The limited nature of the available information in respect of a series
of offered certificates may adversely affect its liquidity, even if a secondary market for those certificates does develop.
 
Even if a secondary market does develop
with respect to any series or class of certificates, the market value of those certificates will be affected by several factors,
including:
 


·
The perceived liquidity of the certificates;




 
 




·
The anticipated cash flow of the certificates, which
may vary widely depending upon the prepayment and default assumptions applied in respect of the underlying mortgage loans and
prevailing interest rates;




 
 




·
The price payable at any given time in respect of
certain classes of offered certificates may be extremely sensitive to small fluctuations in prevailing interest rates, particularly,
for a class with a relatively long average life, a companion class to a controlled amortization class, a class of interest-only
certificates or principal-only certificates; and




 
 




·
The relative change in price for an offered certificate
in response to an upward or downward movement in prevailing interest rates may not equal the relative change in price for that
certificate in response to an equal but opposite movement in those rates. Accordingly, the sale of your certificates in any secondary
market that may develop may be at a discount from the price you paid.


 
We are not aware of any source through which
price information about the offered certificates will be generally available on an ongoing basis.
 
You will generally have no redemption rights,
and the certificates of each series will be subject to early retirement only under certain specified circumstances described in
this prospectus and in the related prospectus supplement. See “Description of the Certificates—Termination”
in this prospectus.

The Assets of the Trust Fund
May Not Be Sufficient to Pay Your Certificates
 
If not described in the related prospectus
supplement,
 


·
The certificates of any series and the mortgage assets
in the related trust fund will not be guaranteed or insured by the depositor or any of its affiliates, by any governmental agency
or instrumentality or by any other person or entity; and




 
 




·
The certificates of any series will not represent
a claim against or security interest in the trust funds for any other series.




 
 


Accordingly, if the related trust fund has
insufficient assets to make payments on a series of offered certificates, no other assets will be available to make those payments.
Additionally, certain amounts on deposit from time to time in certain funds or accounts constituting part of a trust fund may be
withdrawn under certain conditions, as described in the related prospectus supplement, for purposes other than the payment of principal
of or interest on the related series of certificates. If so provided in the prospectus supplement for a series of certificates
consisting of one or more classes of subordinate certificates, if losses or shortfalls in collections have occurred with respect
to any distribution date, all or a portion of the amount of these losses or shortfalls will be borne first by one or more classes
of the subordinate certificates, and, thereafter, by the remaining classes of certificates in the priority and manner specified
in the prospectus supplement.
 
Prepayments of the Mortgage
Assets Will Affect the Timing of Your Cash Flow and May Affect Your Yield
 
As a result of, among other things, prepayments
on the mortgage loans in any trust fund, the amount and timing of distributions of principal and/or interest on the offered certificates
of the related series may be highly unpredictable. Prepayments on the mortgage loans in any trust fund will result in a faster
rate of principal payments on one or more classes of the related series of certificates than if payments on those mortgage loans
were made as scheduled. Thus, the prepayment experience on the mortgage loans in a trust fund may affect the average life of one
or more classes of offered certificates of the related series.
 
The rate of principal payments on pools
of mortgage loans varies among pools and from time to time is influenced by a variety of economic, demographic, geographic, social,
tax, legal and other factors. For example, if prevailing interest rates fall significantly below the mortgage interest rates of
the mortgage loans included in a trust fund, then, subject to, among other things, the particular terms of the mortgage loans and
the ability of borrowers to get new financing, principal prepayments on those mortgage loans are likely to be higher than if prevailing
interest rates remain at or above the rates on those mortgage loans. Conversely, if prevailing interest rates rise significantly
above the mortgage interest rates of the mortgage loans included in a trust fund, then principal prepayments on those mortgage
loans are likely to be lower than if prevailing interest rates remain at or below the rates on those mortgage loans. We cannot
assure you as to the actual rate of prepayment on the mortgage loans in any trust fund or that the rate of prepayment will conform
to any model described in this prospectus or in any prospectus supplement. As a result, depending on the anticipated rate of prepayment
for the mortgage loans in any trust fund, the retirement of any class of certificates of the related series could occur significantly
earlier or later than expected.
 
The extent to which prepayments on the mortgage
loans in any trust fund ultimately affect the average life of your certificates will depend on the terms of your certificates.
 


·
A class of certificates that entitles the holders
of those certificates to a disproportionately large share of the prepayments on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund increases
the “call risk” or the likelihood of early retirement of that class if the rate of prepayment is relatively fast;
and




 
 




·
A class of certificates that entitles the holders
of the certificates to a disproportionately small share of the prepayments on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund increases
the likelihood 


 


10

 

 


 
 
of “extension risk” or an extended average life of that class if the rate of prepayment is relatively
slow.

 
As described in the related prospectus supplement,
the respective entitlements of the various classes of certificate of any series to receive payments, especially prepayments, of
principal of the mortgage loans in the related trust fund may vary based on the occurrence of certain events such as the retirement
of one or more classes of certificates of that series, or subject to certain contingencies such as the rate of prepayments and
defaults with respect to those mortgage loans.
 
A series of certificates may include one
or more controlled amortization classes, which will entitle you to receive principal distributions according to a specified principal
payment schedule. Although prepayment risk cannot be eliminated entirely for any class of certificates, a controlled amortization
class will generally provide a relatively stable cash flow so long as the actual rate of prepayment on the mortgage loans in the
related trust fund remains relatively constant at the rate, or within the range of rates, of prepayment used to establish the specific
principal payment schedule for those certificates. Prepayment risk with respect to a given pool of mortgage assets does not disappear,
however, and the stability afforded to a controlled amortization class comes at the expense of one or more companion classes of
the same series, any of which companion classes may also be a class of offered certificates. In general, and as more specifically
described in the related prospectus supplement, a companion class may entitle you to a disproportionately large share of prepayments
on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund when the rate of prepayment is relatively fast, or may entitle you to a disproportionately
small share of prepayments on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund when the rate of prepayment is relatively slow. As described
in the related prospectus supplement, a companion class absorbs some (but not all) of the “call risk” and/or “extension
risk” that would otherwise belong to the related controlled amortization class if all payments of principal of the mortgage
loans in the related trust fund were allocated on a pro rata basis.
 
A series of certificates may include one
or more classes of offered certificates offered at a premium or discount. Yields on those classes of certificates will be sensitive,
and in some cases extremely sensitive, to prepayments on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund. Where the amount of interest
payable with respect to a class is disproportionately large, as compared to the amount of principal, as with certain classes of
interest-only certificates, you might fail to recover your original investment under some prepayment scenarios. The extent to which
the yield to maturity of any class of offered certificates may vary from the anticipated yield will depend upon the degree to which
they are purchased at a discount or premium and the amount and timing of distributions on those certificates. You should consider,
in the case of any offered certificate purchased at a discount, the risk that a slower than anticipated rate of principal payments
on the mortgage loans could result in an actual yield that is lower than the anticipated yield and, in the case of any offered
certificate purchased at a premium, the risk that a faster than anticipated rate of principal payments could result in an actual
yield that is lower than the anticipated yield. See “Yield and Maturity Considerations” in this prospectus.
 
Ratings Do Not Guarantee
Payment and Do Not Address Prepayment Risks
 
Any rating assigned to a class of offered
certificates by a rating agency will only reflect its assessment of the probability that you will receive payments to which you
are entitled. This rating will not constitute an assessment of the probability that:
 


·
principal prepayments on the related mortgage loans
will be made;




 
 




·
the degree to which the rate of prepayments might
differ from the rate of prepayments that was originally anticipated; or




 
 




·
the likelihood of early optional termination of the
related trust fund.


 
Furthermore, the rating will not address
the possibility that prepayment of the related mortgage loans at a higher or lower rate than you anticipated may cause you to experience
a lower than anticipated yield
 


11

 

 
or that
if you purchase a certificate at a significant premium you might fail to recover your initial investment under certain prepayment
scenarios.
 
The amount, type and nature of credit support,
if any, provided with respect to a series of certificates will be determined on the basis of criteria established by each rating
agency rating classes of the certificates of that series. These criteria are sometimes based upon analysis of the behavior of mortgage
loans in a larger group. However, we cannot assure you that the historical data supporting that analysis will accurately reflect
future experience, or that the data derived from a large pool of mortgage loans will accurately predict the delinquency, foreclosure
or loss experience of any particular pool of mortgage loans. In other cases, the criteria may be based upon determinations of the
values of the mortgaged properties that provide security for the mortgage loans in the related trust fund. However, we cannot assure
you that those values will not decline in the future. See “Description of Credit Support” and “Rating”
in this prospectus.
 
If one or more of the rating agencies downgrade,
suspend or withdraw a rating of a class of your offered certificates, those certificates will decrease in value and the liquidity
and regulatory characteristics of such certificates may also be adversely affected. Because neither we nor the issuing entity,
the trustee, the master servicer, the special servicer, any originator, any seller or any other party to the related pooling and
servicing agreement will have any obligation to maintain a rating on a class of offered certificates, you will have no recourse
if your offered certificates decrease in value by reason of a downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of a rating. In addition, pursuant
to Rule 17g-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, an issuer, underwriter or sponsor that retains a rating agency
is required to make all information provided to the retained rating agency available to non-retained rating agencies. Those rating
agencies may issue their own ratings of the certificates in reliance on that information or otherwise, which ratings may be higher
or lower than the ratings issued by the retained rating agencies. If a non-retained rating agency issues a rating for a class of
offered certificates that is lower than the rating issued by a retained rating agency, that may have an adverse effect on the liquidity,
market value and regulatory characteristics of such class.
 
Commercial and Multifamily
Mortgage Loans Have Risks That May Affect Payments on Your Certificates
 
A description of risks associated with investments
in mortgage loans is included under “Certain Legal Aspects of Mortgage Loans” in this prospectus. Commercial
and multifamily lending are generally thought to expose the lender to a greater risk of loss than one to four family residential
lending. Commercial and multifamily lending typically involves larger loans to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers
than residential one to four family mortgage loans. Further, the repayment of loans secured by income producing properties is typically
dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate project. See “Description of the Trust Funds—Mortgage
Loans—Default and Loss Considerations with Respect to the Mortgage Loans” in this prospectus. If the cash flow
from the project is reduced (for example, if leases are not obtained or renewed or rental, hotel room or occupancy rates decline
or real estate tax rates or other operating expenses increase), the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired.
Commercial and multifamily real estate can be affected significantly by the supply and demand in the market for the type of property
securing the loan and, therefore, may be subject to adverse economic conditions. Market values may vary as a result of economic
events or governmental regulations outside the control of the borrower or lender that impact the cash flow of the property. For
example, some laws, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, may require modifications to properties, and rent control laws
may limit rent collections in the case of multifamily properties. A number of the mortgage loans may be secured by liens on owner
occupied mortgaged properties or on mortgaged properties leased to a single tenant or a small number of significant tenants. Accordingly,
a decline in the financial condition of the borrower or a significant tenant, as applicable, may have a disproportionately greater
effect on the net operating income from those mortgaged properties than would be the case with respect to mortgaged properties
with multiple tenants.
 


12

 

 
The net operating incomes and property values
of the mortgaged properties may be adversely affected by a large number of factors. Some of these factors relate to the properties
themselves, such as:
 


·
the age, design and construction quality of the properties;




 
 




·
perceptions regarding the safety, convenience and
attractiveness of the properties;




 
 




·
the characteristics of the neighborhood where the
property is located;




 
 




·
the proximity and attractiveness of competing properties;




 
 




·
the adequacy of the property’s management and
maintenance;




 
 




·
increases in interest rates, real estate taxes and
other operating expenses at the mortgaged property and in relation to competing properties;




 
 




·
an increase in the capital expenditures needed to
maintain the properties or make improvements;




 
 




·
dependence upon a single tenant, or a concentration
of tenants in a particular business or industry;




 
 




·
a decline in the financial condition of a major tenant;




 
 




·
an increase in vacancy rates; and




 
 




·
a decline in rental rates as leases are renewed or
entered into with new tenants.


 
Other factors are more general in nature,
such as:
 


·
national, regional or local economic conditions, including
plant closings, military base closings, industry slowdowns and unemployment rates;




 
 




·
local real estate conditions, such as an oversupply
of retail space, office space, multifamily housing or hotel capacity;




 
 




·
demographic factors;




 
 




·
consumer confidence;




 
 




·
consumer tastes and preferences;




 
 




·
retroactive changes in building codes;




 
 




·
changes or continued weakness in specific industry
segments; and




 
 




·
the public perception of safety for customers and
clients.



 
The volatility of net operating income will
be influenced by many of the foregoing factors, as well as by:
 


·
the length of tenant leases;




 
 




·
the creditworthiness of tenants;




 
 




·
tenant defaults;




 
 




·
in the case of rental properties, the rate at which
new rentals occur; and


 


13

 

 


·
the property’s “operating leverage”
which is generally the percentage of total property expenses in relation to revenue, the ratio of fixed operating expenses to
those that vary with revenues, and the level of capital expenditures required to maintain the property and to retain or replace
tenants.


 
A decline in the real estate market or in
the financial condition of a major tenant will tend to have a more immediate effect on the net operating income of properties with
short-term revenue sources, such as short-term or month to month leases, and may lead to higher rates of delinquency or defaults.
 
Furthermore, the value of any mortgaged
property may be adversely affected by risks generally incident to interests in real property, including:
 


·
Changes in general or local economic conditions and/or
specific industry segments;




 
 




·
Declines in real estate values;




 
 




·
Declines in rental or occupancy rates;




 
 




·
Increases in interest rates, real estate tax rates
and other operating expenses;




 
 




·
Changes in governmental rules, regulations and fiscal
policies, including environmental legislation;




 
 




·
Acts of God; and




 
 




·
Other factors beyond the control of a master servicer
or special servicer.


 
The type and use of a particular mortgaged
property may present additional risk. For instance:
 


·
Mortgaged properties that operate as hospitals and
nursing homes may present special risks to lenders due to the significant governmental regulation of the ownership, operation,
maintenance and financing of health care institutions.




 
 




·
Hotel and motel properties are often operated pursuant
to franchise, management or operating agreements that may be terminable by the franchisor or operator. Moreover, the transferability
of a hotel’s operating, liquor and other licenses upon a transfer of the hotel, whether through purchase or foreclosure,
is subject to local law requirements.




 
 




·
The ability of a borrower to repay a mortgage loan
secured by shares allocable to one or more cooperative dwelling units may depend on the ability of the dwelling units to generate
sufficient rental income, which may be subject to rent control or stabilization laws, to cover both debt service on the loan as
well as maintenance charges to the cooperative. Further, a mortgage loan secured by cooperative shares is subordinate to the mortgage,
if any, on the cooperative apartment building.


 
The economic performance of mortgage loans
that are secured by full service hotels, limited service hotels, hotels associated with national franchise chains, hotels associated
with regional franchise chains and hotels that are not affiliated with any franchise chain but may have their own brand identity,
are affected by various factors, including:
 


·
Adverse economic and social conditions, either local,
regional or national (which may limit the amount that can be charged for a room and reduce occupancy levels);




 
 




·
Construction of competing hotels or resorts;




 
 




·
Continuing expenditures for modernizing, refurbishing,
and maintaining existing facilities prior to the expiration of their anticipated useful lives;


 


14

 

 


·
Deterioration in the financial strength or managerial
capabilities of the owner and operator of a hotel; and




 
 




·
Changes in travel patterns caused by changes in access,
energy prices, strikes, relocation of highways, the construction of additional highways or other factors.


 
Additionally, the hotel and lodging industry
is generally seasonal in nature and this seasonality can be expected to cause periodic fluctuations in room and other revenues,
occupancy levels, room rates and operating expenses. The demand for particular accommodations may also be affected by changes in
travel patterns caused by changes in energy prices, strikes, relocation of highways, the construction of additional highways and
other factors.
 
The viability of any hotel property that
is the franchisee of a national or regional chain depends in part on the continued existence and financial strength of the franchisor,
the public perception of the franchise service mark and the duration of the franchise licensing agreements. The transferability
of franchise license agreements may be restricted and, in the event of a foreclosure on that hotel property, the property would
not have the right to use the franchise license without the franchisor’s consent. Conversely, a lender may be unable to remove
a franchisor that it desires to replace following a foreclosure. Further, in the event of a foreclosure on a hotel property, it
is unlikely that the trustee (or servicer or special servicer) or purchaser of that hotel property would be entitled to the rights
under any existing liquor license for that hotel property. It is more likely that those persons would have to apply for new licenses.
We cannot assure you that a new license could be obtained or that it could be obtained promptly.
 
Other multifamily properties, hotels, retail
properties, office buildings, mobile home parks and manufactured housing communities, nursing homes and self-storage facilities
located in the areas of the mortgaged properties compete with the mortgaged properties to attract residents and customers. The
leasing of real estate is highly competitive. The principal means of competition are price, location and the nature and condition
of the facility to be leased. A borrower under a mortgage loan competes with all lessors and developers of comparable types of
real estate in the area in which the mortgaged property is located. Those lessors or developers could have lower rentals, lower
operating costs, more favorable locations or better facilities. While a borrower under a mortgage loan may renovate, refurbish
or expand the mortgaged property to maintain it and remain competitive, that renovation, refurbishment or expansion may itself
entail significant risk. Increased competition could adversely affect income from and market value of the mortgaged properties.
In addition, the business conducted at each mortgaged property may face competition from other industries and industry segments.
 
Self-storage properties are considered vulnerable
to competition, because both acquisition costs and break-even occupancy are relatively low. The conversion of self-storage facilities
to alternative uses would generally require substantial capital expenditures. Thus, if the operation of any of the self-storage
mortgaged properties becomes unprofitable due to decreased demand, competition, age of improvements or other factors such that
the borrower becomes unable to meet its obligations on the related mortgage loan, the liquidation value of that self-storage mortgaged
property may be substantially less, relative to the amount owing on the mortgage loan, than would be the case if the self-storage
mortgaged property were readily adaptable to other uses. Tenant privacy and lack of efficient access may heighten environmental
risks.
 
It is anticipated that some or all of the
mortgage loans included in any trust fund will be nonrecourse loans or loans for which recourse may be restricted or unenforceable.
As to that mortgage loan, recourse in the event of borrower default will be limited to the specific real property and other assets,
if any, that were pledged to secure the mortgage loan. However, even with respect to those mortgage loans that provide for recourse
against the borrower and its assets generally, we cannot assure you that enforcement of those recourse provisions will be practicable,
or that the assets of the borrower will be sufficient to permit a recovery in respect of a defaulted mortgage loan in excess of
the liquidation value of the related mortgaged property. See “Certain Legal Aspects of Mortgage Loans—Foreclosure”
in this prospectus.
 


15

 

 
Further, the concentration of default, foreclosure
and loss risks in individual mortgage loans in a particular trust fund will generally be greater than for pools of single-family
loans because mortgage loans in a trust fund will generally consist of a smaller number of higher balance loans than would a pool
of single-family loans of comparable aggregate unpaid principal balance.
 
The Borrower’s Form
of Entity May Cause Special Risks
 
Most of the borrowers are legal entities
rather than individuals. Mortgage loans made to legal entities may entail risks of loss greater than those of mortgage loans made
to individuals. For example, a legal entity, as opposed to an individual, may be more inclined to seek legal protection from its
creditors under the bankruptcy laws. Unlike individuals involved in bankruptcies, most of the entities generally, but not in all
cases, do not have personal assets and creditworthiness at stake. The terms of the mortgage loans generally, but not in all cases,
require that the borrowers covenant to be single-purpose entities, although in many cases the borrowers are not required to observe
all covenants and conditions that typically are required in order for them to be viewed under standard rating agency criteria as
“special purpose entities.” In general, but not in all cases, borrowers’ organizational documents or the terms
of the mortgage loans limit their activities to the ownership of only the related mortgaged property or properties and limit the
borrowers’ ability to incur additional indebtedness and create or allow any encumbrance on the mortgaged properties to secure
additional indebtedness or obligations of other entities. These provisions are designed to mitigate the possibility that the borrowers’
financial condition would be adversely impacted by factors unrelated to the mortgaged property and the mortgage loan in the pool.
However, we cannot assure you that the related borrowers will comply with these requirements. Also, although a borrower may currently
be a single purpose entity, that borrower may have previously owned property other than the related mortgaged property and may
not have observed all covenants that typically are required to consider a borrower a “single purpose entity.” The bankruptcy
of a borrower, or a general partner or managing member of a borrower, may impair the ability of the lender to enforce its rights
and remedies under the related mortgage. Borrowers that are not special purpose entities structured to limit the possibility of
becoming insolvent or bankrupt, may be more likely to become insolvent or the subject of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy
proceeding because the borrowers may be:
 


·
operating entities with a business distinct from the
operation of the mortgaged property with the associated liabilities and risks of operating an ongoing business; or




 
 




·
entities or individuals that have liabilities unrelated
to the mortgaged property.


 
However, any borrower, even a special purpose
entity structured to be bankruptcy-remote, as an owner of real estate will be subject to certain potential liabilities and risks.
We cannot assure you that any borrower will not file for bankruptcy protection or that creditors of a borrower or a corporate or
individual general partner or managing member of a borrower will not initiate a bankruptcy or similar proceeding against the borrower
or corporate or individual general partner or managing member of the borrower.
 
The organizational documents of a borrower
may also contain requirements that there be one or two independent directors, managers or trustees (depending on the entity form
of such borrower) whose vote is required before the borrower files a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency petition or otherwise institutes
insolvency proceedings. Generally, but not always, the independent directors, managers or trustees may only be replaced by certain
other independent successors. Although the requirement of having independent directors, managers or trustees is designed to mitigate
the risk of a voluntary bankruptcy filing by a solvent borrower, the independent directors, managers or trustees may determine
in the exercise of their fiduciary duties to the applicable borrower that a bankruptcy filing is an appropriate course of action
to be taken by such borrower. Such determination might take into account the interests and financial condition of such borrower’s
parent entities and such parent entities’ other subsidiaries in addition to those of the borrower, such that the financial
distress of an affiliate of a borrower might increase the likelihood of a bankruptcy filing by a borrower. In any event, we cannot
assure you that a borrower will not file for bankruptcy protection or that creditors of a borrower will not initiate a bankruptcy
or similar proceeding against such borrower.
 


16

 

 
Furthermore, with respect to any affiliated
borrowers, creditors of a common parent in bankruptcy may seek to consolidate the assets of those borrowers with those of the parent.
Consolidation of the assets of the borrowers would likely have an adverse effect on the funds available to make distributions on
your certificates, and may lead to a downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of the ratings of your certificates. See “Certain
Legal Aspects of Mortgage Loans—Bankruptcy Laws” in this prospectus.
 
Ability to Incur Other Borrowings
Entails Risk
 
When a mortgage loan borrower (or its constituent
members) also has one or more other outstanding loans (even if they are subordinated or mezzanine loans), the trust is subjected
to additional risk. The borrower may have difficulty servicing and repaying multiple loans. The existence of another loan generally
also will make it more difficult for the borrower to obtain refinancing of its mortgage loan and may thereby jeopardize repayment
of the mortgage loan. Moreover, the need to service additional debt may reduce the cash flow available to the borrower to operate
and maintain the mortgaged property.
 
Additionally, if a borrower, or its constituent
members, defaults on its mortgage loan and/or any other loan, actions taken by other lenders such as a foreclosure or an involuntary
petition for bankruptcy against the borrower could impair the security available to the trust, including the mortgaged property,
or stay the trust’s ability to foreclose during the course of the bankruptcy case. The bankruptcy of another lender also
may operate to stay foreclosure by the trust. The trust may also be subject to the costs and administrative burdens of involvement
in foreclosure or bankruptcy proceedings or related litigation.
 
In this regard, the mortgage loans generally
prohibit borrowers from incurring any additional debt secured by their mortgaged property without the consent of the lender. However,
no investigations, searches or inquiries to determine the existence or status of any subordinate secured financing with respect
to any of the mortgaged properties have been made at any time since origination of the related mortgage loan. We cannot assure
you that any of the borrowers have complied with the restrictions on indebtedness in the related mortgage loan documents.
 
The mortgage loans will generally permit
the related borrower to incur limited indebtedness in the ordinary course of business that is not secured by the related mortgaged
property. In addition, the borrowers under certain of the mortgage loans have incurred, and/or may incur in the future, unsecured
debt other than in the ordinary course of business.
 
Additionally, the terms of certain mortgage
loans may permit or require the borrowers to post letters of credit and/or surety bonds for the benefit of the related mortgage
loan, which may constitute a contingent reimbursement obligation of the related borrower or an affiliate. The issuing bank or surety
will not typically agree to subordination and standstill protection benefiting the mortgagee.
 
The mortgage loan documents generally place
certain restrictions on the transfer and/or pledging of general partnership and managing member equity interests in a borrower
such as specific percentage or control limitations. The terms of the mortgage loans generally permit, subject to certain limitations,
the transfer or pledge of less than a controlling portion of the limited partnership or non-managing member equity or other interests
in a borrower. Certain of the mortgage loans do not restrict the pledging of ownership interests in the related borrower, but do
restrict the transfer of ownership interests in the related borrower by imposing a specific percentage or control limitation or
requiring the consent of the mortgagee to any such transfer (which consent in certain instances would consist of the mortgagee
ascertaining that certain specific transfer conditions have been satisfied). Moreover, in general, mortgage loans with borrowers
that do not meet single purpose entity criteria may not restrict in any way the incurrence by the relevant borrower of mezzanine
debt. See “—The Borrower’s Form of Entity May Cause Special Risks” above and “Risk Factors—The
Borrower’s Form of Entity May Cause Special Risks” in the prospectus supplement. Certain of the mortgage loans
permit mezzanine debt, secured by pledges of ownership interests in the borrower, to be incurred in the future subject to criteria
set forth in the mortgage loan documents.
 
Mezzanine debt is debt that is incurred
by the owner of equity in one or more borrowers and is secured by a pledge of the equity ownership interests in such borrowers.
Because mezzanine debt is
 


17

 

 
secured
by the obligor’s equity interest in the related borrowers, such financing effectively reduces the obligor’s economic
stake in the related mortgaged property. The existence of mezzanine debt may reduce cash flow on the borrower’s mortgaged
property after the payment of debt service or result in liquidity pressures if the mezzanine debt matures or becomes payable prior
to the maturity of the mortgage loan, and may thus increase the likelihood that the owner of a borrower will permit the value
or income producing potential of a mortgaged property to fall and may create a greater risk that a borrower will default on the
mortgage loan secured by a mortgaged property whose value or income is relatively weak. In addition, the current and any future
mezzanine lender may have cure rights with respect to the related mortgage loan and/or an option to purchase the mortgage loan
after a default pursuant to an intercreditor agreement.
 
Generally, upon a default under mezzanine
debt, the holder of such mezzanine debt would be entitled to foreclose upon the equity in the related borrower, which has been
pledged to secure payment of such mezzanine debt, if permitted pursuant to the terms of the related intercreditor agreement, and
provided that foreclosure is not stayed by the commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding involving the mezzanine borrowers. See “Certain
Legal Aspects of Mortgage Loans—Bankruptcy Laws” in this prospectus. Although such transfer of equity may not trigger
the due on sale clause under the related mortgage loan, it could cause a change of control in the borrower and/or cause the obligor
under such mezzanine debt to file for bankruptcy, which could negatively affect the operation of the related mortgaged property
and such borrower’s ability to make payments on the related mortgage loan in a timely manner.
 
In addition, borrowers under certain of
the mortgage loans have issued or are permitted to issue preferred equity in such borrowers. Preferred equity in a borrower will
generally require such borrower to make certain specified dividend payments to the preferred equity holder on a preferred basis.
Since a borrower’s assets are generally limited to its mortgaged property, any preferred equity in the borrower effectively
reduces the borrower’s economic stake in the related mortgaged property. The existence of preferred equity may reduce cash
flow on the borrower’s mortgaged property after payment of debt service on the mortgage loans and any mezzanine loans, and
may thus increase the likelihood that a borrower will permit the value or income producing potential of a mortgaged property to
fall and may create a greater risk that a borrower will default on a mortgage loan secured by a mortgaged property whose value
or income is relatively weak.
 
See “Description of the Mortgage
Pool—General” in the prospectus supplement and “Certain Legal Aspects of Mortgage Loans—Subordinate
Financing” in this prospectus.
 
Borrowers May Be Unable
to Make Balloon Payments
 
Certain of the mortgage loans included in
a trust fund may be non-amortizing or only partially amortizing over their terms to maturity and, thus, will require substantial
principal payments (that is, balloon payments) at their stated maturity. In addition, fully amortizing mortgage loans which may
pay interest on an “actual/360” basis but have fixed monthly payments may, in effect, have a small balloon payment
due at maturity.
 
Mortgage loans of this type involve a greater
degree of risk than self-amortizing mortgage loans because the ability of a borrower to make a balloon payment typically will depend
upon its ability either to refinance the mortgage loan or to sell the related mortgaged property. A borrower’s ability to
repay a mortgage loan on its stated maturity date or anticipated repayment date typically will depend upon its ability either to
refinance the mortgage loan or to sell the mortgaged property at a price sufficient to permit repayment. A borrower’s ability
to achieve either of these goals will be affected by a number of factors, including:
 


·
The fair market value of the related mortgaged property;




 
 




·
The level of available mortgage interest rates at
the time of sale or refinancing;




 
 




·
The borrower’s equity in the related mortgaged
property;


 


18

 

 


·
The borrower’s financial condition;




 
 




·
The operating history and occupancy level of the related
mortgaged property;




 
 




·
Tax laws;




 
 




·
Reductions in government assistance/rent subsidy programs;




 
 




·
Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement rates, with respect
to hospitals and nursing homes;




 
 




·
Prevailing general and regional economic conditions;
and




 
 




·
The availability of, and competition for, credit for
loans secured by multifamily or commercial real properties generally.


 
We cannot assure you that each borrower
will have the ability to repay the remaining principal balances on the related maturity date.
 
Neither the depositor nor any of its affiliates
will be required to refinance any mortgage loan.
 
If described in this prospectus and in the
related prospectus supplement, to maximize recoveries on defaulted mortgage loans, the master servicer or a special servicer may,
within prescribed limits, extend and modify mortgage loans that are in default or as to which a payment default is reasonably foreseeable.
While a master servicer or a special servicer generally will be required to determine that any extension or modification is reasonably
likely to produce a greater recovery, taking into account the time value of money, than liquidation, we cannot assure you that
any extension or modification will in fact increase the present value of receipts from or proceeds of the affected mortgage loans.
 
Credit Support May Not
Cover Losses
 
The prospectus supplement for a series of
certificates will describe any credit support provided for those certificates. Any use of credit support will be subject to the
conditions and limitations described in this prospectus and in the related prospectus supplement, and may not cover all potential
losses or risks. For example, it may or may not cover fraud or negligence by a mortgage loan originator or other parties.
 
A series of certificates may include one
or more classes of subordinate certificates, if so provided in the related prospectus supplement. Although subordination is intended
to reduce the risk to holders of senior certificates of delinquent distributions or ultimate losses, the amount of subordination
will be limited and may decline under certain circumstances described in the related prospectus supplement. In addition, if principal
payments on one or more classes of certificates of a series are made in a specified order of priority, any limits with respect
to the aggregate amount of claims under any related credit support may be exhausted before the principal of the later paid classes
of certificates of that series has been repaid in full. As a result, the impact of losses and shortfalls experienced with respect
to the mortgage assets may fall primarily upon those subordinate classes of certificates. Moreover, if a form of credit support
covers more than one series of certificates, holders of certificates of one series will be subject to the risk that the credit
support will be exhausted by the claims of the holders of certificates of one or more other series.
 
The amount of any applicable credit support
supporting one or more classes of offered certificates, including the subordination of one or more classes of certificates, will
be determined on the basis of criteria established by each rating agency rating those classes of certificates. Such criteria will
be based on an assumed level of defaults, delinquencies and losses on the underlying mortgage assets and certain other factors.
However, we cannot assure you that the default, delinquency or loss experience on the related mortgage assets will not exceed the
assumed levels. See “—Ratings Do Not Guarantee Payment and Do Not Address Prepayment Risks,” “Description
of the Certificates” and “Description of Credit Support” in this prospectus.

Tenant Concentration Entails
Risk
 
A deterioration in the financial condition
of a tenant can be particularly significant if a mortgaged property is wholly or significantly owner–occupied or leased to
a single tenant or if any tenant makes up a significant portion of the rental income. Mortgaged properties that are wholly or significantly
owner occupied or leased to a single tenant or tenants that make up a significant portion of the rental income also are more susceptible
to interruptions of cash flow if the owner occupier’s business operations are negatively impacted or if such a tenant fails
to renew its lease. This is so because the financial effect of the absence of operating income or rental income may be severe;
more time may be required to re-lease the space; and substantial capital costs may be incurred to make the space appropriate for
replacement tenants.
 
Retail and office properties also may be
adversely affected if there is a concentration of particular tenants among the mortgaged properties or of tenants in a particular
business or industry.
 
Certain Additional Risks
Relating to Tenants
 
The income from, and market value of, the
mortgaged properties leased to various tenants would be adversely affected if:
 
·	    space
in the mortgaged properties could not be leased or re-leased;
 
·	    leasing
or re-leasing is restricted by exclusive rights of tenants to lease the mortgaged properties or other covenants not to lease space
for certain uses or activities, or covenants limiting the types of tenants to which space may be leased;
 
·	    substantial
re-leasing costs were required and/or the cost of performing landlord obligations under existing leases materially increased;
 
·	    tenants
were unwilling or unable to meet their lease obligations;
 
·	    a
significant tenant were to become a debtor in a bankruptcy case;
 
·	    a
borrower fails to perform its obligations under a lease resulting in the related tenant having a right to terminate such lease;
or
 
·	    rental
payments could not be collected for any other reason.
 
Repayment of the mortgage loans secured
by retail, office and industrial properties will be affected by the expiration of leases and the ability of the respective borrowers
to renew the leases or relet the space on comparable terms and on a timely basis. Certain of the mortgaged properties may be leased
in whole or in part by government sponsored tenants who have the right to rent reductions or to cancel their leases at any time
or for lack of appropriations. Additionally, mortgaged properties may have concentrations of leases expiring at varying rates in
varying percentages.
 
In addition, certain properties may have
tenants that are paying rent but are not in occupancy or may have vacant space that is not leased, and in certain cases, the occupancy
percentage could be less than 80%. Any such “dark” space may cause the property to be less desirable to other potential
tenants and the related tenant may be more likely to default in its obligations under the lease. We cannot assure you that those
tenants will continue to fulfill their lease obligations or that the space will be relet. Additionally, certain tenants may have
a right to a rent abatement or the right to cancel their lease if certain major tenants at the mortgaged property vacate or go
dark.
 
Even if vacated space is successfully relet,
the costs associated with reletting, including tenant improvements and leasing commissions, could be substantial and could reduce
cash flow from the mortgaged properties. Moreover, if a tenant defaults in its obligations to a borrower, the borrower may incur
substantial costs and experience significant delays associated with enforcing its rights and
 


20

 

 
protecting
its investment, including costs incurred in renovating and reletting the related mortgaged property.
 
Additionally, in certain jurisdictions,
if tenant leases are subordinated to the liens created by the mortgage but do not contain attornment provisions (provisions requiring
the tenant to recognize as landlord under the lease a successor owner following foreclosure), the leases may terminate upon the
transfer of the property to a foreclosing lender or purchaser at foreclosure. Accordingly, if a mortgaged property is located in
such a jurisdiction and is leased to one or more desirable tenants under leases that are subordinate to the mortgage and do not
contain attornment provisions, such mortgaged property could experience a further decline in value if such tenants’ leases
were terminated.
 
Mortgaged Properties Leased
to Multiple Tenants Also Have Risks
 
If a mortgaged property has multiple tenants,
re-leasing expenditures may be more frequent than in the case of mortgaged properties with fewer tenants, thereby reducing the
cash flow available for debt service payments. Multi-tenant mortgaged properties also may experience higher continuing vacancy
rates and greater volatility in rental income and expenses.
 
Mortgaged Properties Leased
to Borrowers or Borrower Affiliated Entities Also Have Risks
 
If a mortgaged property is leased in whole
or substantial part to the borrower under the mortgage loan or to an affiliate of the borrower, there may be conflicts. For instance,
it is more likely a landlord will waive lease conditions for an affiliated tenant than it would for an unaffiliated tenant. We
cannot assure you that the conflicts arising where a borrower is affiliated with a tenant at a mortgaged property will not adversely
impact the value of the related mortgage loan. In some cases this affiliated lessee is physically occupying space related to its
business; in other cases, the affiliated lessee is a tenant under a master lease with the borrower, under which the tenant is obligated
to make rent payments but does not occupy any space at the mortgaged property. These master leases are typically used to bring
occupancy to a “stabilized” level but may not provide additional economic support for the mortgage loan. We cannot
assure you that the space “leased” by a borrower affiliate will eventually be occupied by third party tenants and consequently,
a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or its affiliates can be particularly significant to the borrower’s
ability to perform under the mortgage loan as it can directly interrupt the cash flow from the mortgaged property if the borrower’s
or its affiliate’s financial condition worsens. These risks may be mitigated when mortgaged properties are leased to unrelated
third parties.
 
Tenant Bankruptcy Entails
Risks
 
The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major
tenant, or a number of smaller tenants, in retail, office and industrial properties may adversely affect the income produced by
a mortgaged property. Under the federal bankruptcy code a tenant has the option of assuming or rejecting or, subject to certain
conditions, assuming and assigning to a third party, any unexpired lease. If the tenant assumes its lease, the tenant must cure
all defaults under the lease and provide the landlord with adequate assurance of its future performance under the lease. If the
tenant rejects the lease, the landlord’s claim for breach of the lease would be treated as a general unsecured claim against
the tenant (absent collateral securing the claim). In addition, a lessor’s damages for lease rejection are limited to the
amount owed for the unpaid rent reserved under the lease for the periods prior to the bankruptcy petition (or earlier surrender
of the leased premises), which are unrelated to the rejection, plus the greater of one year’s rent or 15% of the remaining
rent reserved under the lease (but not to exceed three years’ rent). If the tenant assigns its lease, the tenant must cure
all defaults under the lease and the proposed assignee must demonstrate adequate assurance of future performance under the lease.
Certain of the tenants may be, and may at any time during the term of the related mortgage loan become, a debtor in a bankruptcy
proceeding.
 
We cannot assure you that tenants of mortgaged
properties will continue making payments under their leases or that tenants will not file for bankruptcy protection in the future
or, if any tenants so file, that they will continue to make rental payments in a timely manner.
 


21

 

 
If the leased premises are located in a
“shopping center” as such term has been interpreted under Section 365 of the federal bankruptcy code, the assignee
may be required to agree to certain conditions that are protective of the property owner, such as compliance with specific lease
terms relating to, among other things, exclusivity and the terms of reciprocal easement agreements. However, we cannot assure you
that any mortgaged property would be considered a shopping center by a court considering the question.
 
Assignment of Leases and
Rents May Be Limited by State Law
 
Each mortgage loan included in any trust
fund secured by mortgaged property that is subject to leases typically will be secured by an assignment of leases and rents pursuant
to which the borrower (or with respect to any indemnity deed of trust structure, the related property owner) assigns to the lender
its right, title and interest as landlord under the leases of the related mortgaged property, and the income derived from those
leases, as further security for the related mortgage loan, while retaining a license to collect rents for so long as there is no
default. If the borrower defaults, the license terminates and the lender is entitled to collect rents. Some state laws may require
that the lender take possession of the mortgaged property and obtain a judicial appointment of a receiver before becoming entitled
to collect the rents. In addition, if bankruptcy or similar proceedings are commenced by or in respect of the borrower, the lender’s
ability to collect the rents may be adversely affected. See “Certain Legal Aspects of Mortgage Loans—Leases and
Rents” in this prospectus.
 
Failure to Comply with Environmental
Law May Result in Additional Losses
 
Under federal law and the laws of certain
states, contamination of real property may give rise to a lien on the property to assure or reimburse the costs of cleanup. In
several states, that lien has priority over an existing mortgage lien on that property. In addition, under various federal, state
and local laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation
of hazardous substances or toxic substances on, in or beneath the property. This liability may be imposed without regard to whether
the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of those hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of any required
remediation and the owner’s or operator’s liability for them as to any property are generally not limited under these
laws, ordinances and regulations and could exceed the value of the mortgaged property and the aggregate assets of the owner or
operator. In addition, as to the owners or operators of mortgaged properties that generate hazardous substances that are disposed
of at “off-site” locations, the owners or operators may be held strictly, jointly and severally liable if there are
releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at the off-site locations where that person’s hazardous substances
were disposed.
 
Under some environmental laws, such as the
federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, as well as some state laws,
a secured lender (such as the trust) may be liable as an “owner” or “operator” for the costs of dealing
with hazardous substances affecting a borrower’s or neighboring property, if agents or employees of the lender have participated
in the management of the borrower’s property. This liability could exist even if a previous owner caused the environmental
damage. The trust’s potential exposure to liability for cleanup costs may increase if the trust actually takes possession
of a borrower’s property, or control of its day-to-day operations, as for example through the appointment of a receiver.
See “Certain Legal Aspects of Mortgage Loans—Environmental Risks” in this prospectus.
 
Hazard Insurance May Be
Insufficient to Cover All Losses on Mortgaged Properties
 
The master servicer for the related trust
fund will generally be required to cause the borrower on each mortgage loan in that trust fund to maintain the insurance coverage
in respect of the related mortgaged property required under the related mortgage, including hazard insurance. The master servicer
may satisfy its obligation to cause hazard insurance to be maintained with respect to any mortgaged property through acquisition
of a blanket policy. However, we cannot assure you that the amount of insurance maintained will be sufficient to insure against
all losses on the mortgaged properties.
 


22

 

 
In general, the standard form of fire and
extended coverage policy covers physical damage to or destruction of the improvements of the mortgaged property by:
 


·
fire;




 
 




·
lightning;




 
 




·
explosion;




 
 




·
smoke;




 
 




·
windstorm and hail; and




 
 




·
riot, strike and civil commotion.


 
Each subject to the conditions and exclusions
specified in each policy.
 
The policies covering the mortgaged properties
will be underwritten by different insurers under different state laws, and therefore will not contain identical terms and conditions.
However, most policies do not typically cover any physical damage resulting from war, revolution, governmental actions, floods
and other water-related causes, earth movement, including earthquakes, landslides and mudflows, wet or dry rot, vermin, domestic
animals and certain other kinds of risks. Unless the related mortgage specifically requires the mortgagor to insure against physical
damage arising from those causes, those losses may be borne, at least in part, by the holders of one or more classes of offered
certificates of the related series, to the extent they are not covered by any available credit support. See “Description
of the Pooling Agreements—Hazard Insurance Policies” in this prospectus.
 
Poor Property Management
May Adversely Affect the Performance of the Related Mortgaged Property
 
The successful operation of a real estate
project also depends upon the performance and viability of the property manager. Properties deriving revenues primarily from short-term
sources generally are more management intensive than properties leased to creditworthy tenants under long-term leases. The property
manager is generally responsible for:
 


·
operating the properties;




 
 




·
providing building services;




 
 




·
establishing and implementing the rental structure;




 
 




·
managing operating expenses;




 
 




·
responding to changes in the local market; and




 
 




·
assuring that maintenance and capital improvements
are carried out in a timely fashion.


 
Property managers may not be in a financial
condition to fulfill their management responsibilities.
 
Certain of the mortgaged properties are
managed by affiliates of the applicable mortgagor. If a mortgage loan is in default or undergoing special servicing, such relationship
could disrupt the management of the underlying property. This may adversely affect cash flow. However, the mortgage loans may permit
the lender to remove the property manager upon the occurrence of an event of default, a decline in cash flow below a specified
level or the failure to satisfy some other specified performance trigger.
 


23

 

 
We make no representation or warranty as
to the skills of any present or future managers. In many cases, the property manager is an affiliate of the borrower and may not
manage properties for non-affiliates. Additionally, we cannot assure you that the property managers will be in a financial condition
to fulfill their management responsibilities throughout the terms of their respective management agreements.
 
Property Value May Be Adversely
Affected Even When Current Operating Income Is Not
 
Various factors may adversely affect the
value of a mortgaged property without affecting the property’s current net operating income. These factors include, among
others:
 


·
the existence of, or changes in, governmental regulations,
fiscal policy, zoning or tax laws;




 
 




·
potential environmental legislation or liabilities
or other legal liabilities;




 
 




·
the availability of refinancing; and




 
 




·
changes in interest rate levels.


 
Mortgage Loans Secured by
Leasehold Interests May Expose Investors to Greater Risks of Default and Loss
 
Leasehold mortgage loans are subject to
certain risks not associated with mortgage loans secured by a lien on the fee estate of the borrower. The most significant of these
risks is that if the related borrower’s leasehold were to be terminated upon a lease default, the lender would lose its security
in the leasehold interest. Generally, each related ground lease requires the lessor to give the lender notice of the borrower’s
defaults under the ground lease and an opportunity to cure them, permits the leasehold interest to be assigned to the lender or
the purchaser at a foreclosure sale, in some cases only upon the consent of the lessor, and contains certain other protective provisions
typically included in a “mortgageable” ground lease.
 
Upon the bankruptcy of a lessor or a lessee
under a ground lease, the debtor has the right to assume or reject the lease. If a debtor lessor rejects the lease, the lessee
has the right pursuant to Section 365(h) of the federal bankruptcy code to remain in possession of its leased premises for the
rent otherwise payable under the lease for the term of the ground lease (including renewals) and to offset against such rent any
damages incurred due to the landlord’s failure to perform its obligations under the lease. If a debtor lessee/borrower rejects
the lease, the leasehold lender could succeed to the lessee/borrower’s position under the lease only if the lease specifically
grants the lender such right. If both the lessor and the lessee/borrower are involved in bankruptcy proceedings, the trustee may
be unable to enforce the bankrupt lessee/borrower’s right to refuse to treat a ground lease rejected by a bankrupt lessor
as terminated. In such circumstances, a ground lease could be terminated notwithstanding lender protection provisions contained
in the ground lease or in the mortgage.
 
Some of the ground leases securing the mortgaged
properties may provide that the ground rent payable under the related ground lease increases during the term of the mortgage loan.
These increases may adversely affect the cash flow and net income of the related borrower.
 
A leasehold lender could lose its security
unless the leasehold lender holds a fee mortgage, the ground lease requires the lessor to enter into a new lease with the leasehold
lender upon termination or rejection of the ground lease, or the bankruptcy court, as a court of equity, allows the leasehold lender
to assume the ground lessee’s obligations under the ground lease and succeed to the ground lessee’s position. Although
not directly covered by the 1994 amendments to the federal bankruptcy code, such a result would be consistent with the purpose
of the 1994 amendments to the federal bankruptcy code granting the holders of leasehold mortgages permitted under the terms of
the lease the right to succeed to the position of a leasehold mortgagor. Although consistent with the federal bankruptcy code,
such position may not be adopted by the applicable bankruptcy court.
 


24

 

 
Further, in a decision by the United States
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (Precision Indus. v. Qualitech Steel SBQ, LLC, 327 F.3d 537 (7th Cir. 2003)), the court
ruled with respect to an unrecorded lease of real property that where a statutory sale of the fee interest in leased property occurs
under Section 363(f) of the federal bankruptcy code (11 U.S.C. Section 363(f)) upon the bankruptcy of a landlord, such sale terminates
a lessee’s possessory interest in the property, and the purchaser assumes title free and clear of any interest, including
any leasehold estates. Pursuant to Section 363(e) of the federal bankruptcy code (11 U.S.C. Section 363(e)), a lessee may request
the bankruptcy court to prohibit or condition the statutory sale of the property so as to provide adequate protection of the leasehold
interest; however, the court ruled that this provision does not ensure continued possession of the property, but rather entitles
the lessee to compensation for the value of its leasehold interest, typically from the sale proceeds. While there are certain circumstances
under which a “free and clear” sale under Section 363(f) of the federal bankruptcy code would not be authorized (including
that the lessee could not be compelled in a legal or equitable proceeding to accept a monetary satisfaction of his possessory interest,
and that none of the other conditions of Section 363(f)(1)–(4) of the federal bankruptcy code otherwise permits the sale),
we cannot provide assurances that those circumstances would be present in any proposed sale of a leased premises. As a result,
we cannot provide assurances that, in the event of a statutory sale of leased property pursuant to Section 363(f) of the federal
bankruptcy code, the lessee may be able to maintain possession of the property under the ground lease. In addition, we cannot assure
you that the lessee and/or the lender (to the extent it can obtain standing to intervene) will be able to recoup the full value
of the leasehold interest in bankruptcy court.
 
Limitations of Appraisals
 
Appraisals will be obtained with respect
to each of the mortgaged properties servicing mortgage loans of a series at or about the time of the origination of the applicable
mortgage loan. In general, appraisals represent the analysis and opinion of qualified appraisers and are not guarantees of present
or future value. One appraiser may reach a different conclusion than the conclusion that would be reached if a different appraiser
were appraising that property. The values of the mortgaged properties may have fluctuated significantly since the appraisals were
performed. Moreover, appraisals seek to establish the amount a typically motivated buyer would pay a typically motivated seller
and, in certain cases, may have taken into consideration the purchase price paid by the borrower. That amount could be significantly
higher than the amount obtained from the sale of a mortgaged property under a distress or liquidation sale. We cannot assure you
that the information set forth in the prospectus supplement regarding appraised values or loan to value ratios accurately reflects
past, present or future market values of the mortgaged properties. Any engineering report, site inspection or appraisal represents
only the analysis of the individual consultant, engineer or inspector preparing such report at the time of such report, and may
not reveal all necessary or desirable repairs, maintenance and capital improvement items.
 
Your Lack of Control Over
Trust Fund Can Create Risks
 
You and other certificateholders generally
do not have a right to vote and do not have the right to make decisions with respect to the administration of the trust. See “Servicing
of the Mortgage Loans—General” in the prospectus supplement. Those decisions are generally made, subject to the
express terms of the pooling and servicing agreement, by the master servicer, the trustee or the special servicer, as applicable.
Any decision made by one of those parties in respect of the trust, even if that decision is determined to be in your best interests
by that party, may be contrary to the decision that you or other certificateholders would have made and may negatively affect your
interests.
 
One Action Jurisdiction May Limit
the Ability of the Servicer to Foreclose on a Mortgaged Property
 
The ability to realize upon the mortgage
loans may be limited by the application of state and federal laws. Several states (including California) have laws that prohibit
more than one “judicial action” to enforce a mortgage obligation, and some courts have construed the term “judicial
action” broadly. Accordingly, the special servicer may need to obtain advice of counsel prior to enforcing any of the trust
 


25

 

 
fund’s
rights under any of the mortgage loans that include mortgaged properties where a “one action” rule could be applicable.
 
In the case of a multi-property mortgage
loan secured by mortgaged properties located in multiple states, the special servicer may be required to foreclose first on properties
located in states where such “one action” rules apply (and where non-judicial foreclosure is permitted) before foreclosing
on properties located in states where judicial foreclosure is the only permitted method of foreclosure. The application of other
state and federal laws may delay or otherwise limit the ability to realize on defaulted mortgage loans. See “Certain Legal
Aspects of Mortgage Loans—Foreclosure” in this prospectus.
 
Rights Against Tenants May Be
Limited if Leases Are Not Subordinate to Mortgage or Do Not Contain Attornment Provisions
 
Some of the tenant leases contain provisions
that require the tenant to attorn to (that is, recognize as landlord under the lease) a successor owner of the property following
foreclosure. Some of the leases may be either subordinate to the liens created by the mortgage loans or else contain a provision
that requires the tenant to subordinate the lease if the mortgagee agrees to enter into a non-disturbance agreement. In some states,
if tenant leases are subordinate to the liens created by the mortgage loans and such leases do not contain attornment provisions,
such leases may terminate upon the transfer of the property to a foreclosing lender or purchaser at foreclosure. Accordingly, in
the case of the foreclosure of a mortgaged property located in such a state and leased to one or more desirable tenants under leases
that are subordinate to the mortgage and do not contain attornment provisions, such mortgaged property could experience a further
decline in value if such tenants’ leases were terminated. This is particularly likely if such tenants were paying above-market
rents or could not be replaced.
 
If a mortgage is subordinate to a lease,
the trust will not (unless it has otherwise agreed with the tenant) possess the right to dispossess the tenant upon foreclosure
of the mortgaged property, and if the lease contains provisions inconsistent with the mortgage (e.g., provisions relating to application
of insurance proceeds or condemnation awards) or that could affect the enforcement of the lender’s rights (e.g., a right
of first refusal to purchase the property), the provisions of the lease will take precedence over the provisions of the mortgage.
 
If Mortgaged Properties Are
Not in Compliance With Current Zoning Laws Restoration Following a Casualty Loss May Be Limited
 
Certain of the mortgaged properties may
not comply with current zoning laws, including density, use, parking, height and set back requirements, due to changes in zoning
requirements after such mortgaged properties were constructed. These properties, as well as those for which variances or special
permits were issued or for which non-conformity with current zoning laws are otherwise permitted, are considered to be a “legal
non-conforming use” and/or the improvements are considered to be “legal non-conforming structures.” This means
that the borrower is not required to alter its use or structure to comply with the existing or new law; however, the borrower may
not be able to continue the non-conforming use or rebuild the non-conforming premises “as is” in the event of a substantial
casualty loss. Such limitations may adversely affect the ability of the mortgagor to meet its mortgage loan obligations from cash
flow of the property following the loss. If a substantial casualty were to occur, we cannot assure you that insurance proceeds
would be available to pay the mortgage loan in full. In addition, if a non-conforming use were to be discontinued and/or the mortgaged
property were repaired or restored in conformity with the current law, the value of the property or the revenue producing potential
of the property may not be equal to that before the casualty.
 
In addition, certain of the mortgaged properties
that do not conform to current zoning laws may not be “legal non-conforming uses” or “legal non-conforming structures.”
The failure of a mortgaged property to comply with zoning laws or to be a “legal non-conforming use” or “legal
non-conforming structure” may adversely affect market value of the mortgaged property or the borrower’s ability to
continue to use it in the manner it is currently being used or may necessitate material additional expenditures to remedy non conformities.
 


26

 

 
In addition, certain of the mortgaged properties
may be subject to certain restrictions imposed pursuant to restrictive covenants, reciprocal easement agreements or operating agreements
or historical landmark designations. Such use restrictions could include, for example, limitations on the character of the improvements
or the properties, limitations affecting noise and parking requirements, among other things, and limitations on the borrowers’
right to operate certain types of facilities within a prescribed radius. These limitations could adversely affect the ability of
the related borrower to lease the mortgaged property on favorable terms, thus adversely affecting the borrower’s ability
to fulfill its obligations under the related mortgage loan.
 
Inspections of the Mortgaged
Properties Will Be Limited
 
The mortgaged properties will generally
be inspected by licensed engineers at the time the mortgage loans will be originated to assess the structure, exterior walls, roofing
interior construction, mechanical and electrical systems and general condition of the site, buildings and other improvements located
on the mortgaged properties. There can be no assurance that all conditions requiring repair or replacement will be identified in
such inspections.
 
Compliance with Americans
with Disabilities Act May Result in Additional Losses
 
A borrower may be required to incur costs
to comply with various existing and future federal, state or local laws and regulations applicable to the related mortgaged property.
For example, under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal
requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. See “Certain Legal Aspects of Mortgage Loans—Americans
with Disabilities Act” in this prospectus. To the extent the mortgaged properties do not comply with the act, the borrowers
may be required to incur costs to comply with the act. In addition, noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the
federal government or an award of damages to private litigants. The expenditure of these costs or the imposition of injunctive
relief, penalties or fines in connection with the borrower’s noncompliance could negatively impact the borrower’s cash
flow and, consequently, its ability to pay its mortgage loan.
 
Litigation Concerns
 
There may be legal proceedings pending and,
from time to time, threatened against, or other past or present adverse regulatory circumstances experienced by the borrowers,
their sponsors and managers of the mortgaged properties or their respective affiliates relating to the business of or arising out
of the ordinary course of business of the borrowers, their sponsors, managers and affiliates. There can be no assurance that such
litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the distributions to certificateholders. In certain cases, principals and/or
affiliates of the borrowers are involved or may have been involved in prior litigation or property foreclosures or deed in lieu
of foreclosures. We cannot assure you that any litigation, other legal proceedings, or other adverse situations will not have a
material adverse effect on your investment.
 
Risks to the Financial Markets
Relating to Terrorist Attacks
 
On September 11, 2001, the United States
was subjected to multiple terrorist attacks, resulting in the loss of many lives and massive property damage and destruction in
New York City, the Washington, D.C. area and Pennsylvania. It is impossible to predict whether, or the extent to which, future
terrorist activities may occur in the United States.
 
It is uncertain what effects any future
terrorist activities in the United States or abroad and/or any consequent actions on the part of the United States Government and
others, including military action, could have on general economic conditions, real estate markets, particular business segments
(including those that are important to the performance of commercial mortgage loans) and/or insurance costs and the availability
of insurance coverage for terrorist acts. Among other things, reduced investor confidence could result in substantial volatility
in securities markets and a decline in real estate-related investments.
 


27

 

 
In addition,
reduced consumer confidence, as well as a heightened concern for personal safety, could result in a material decline in personal
spending and travel.
 
Risks to the Mortgaged Properties
Relating to Terrorist Attacks and Foreign Conflicts
 
The terrorist attacks in 2001 on the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon, as well as a number of reported thwarted planned attacks, suggest the possibility that large public
areas such as shopping centers or large office buildings could become the target of terrorist attacks in the future. The occurrence
or the possibility of such attacks could (i) lead to damage to one or more of the mortgaged properties if any such attacks occur,
(ii) result in higher costs for insurance premiums, particularly for large properties which could adversely affect the cash flow
at such mortgaged properties, or (iii) impact leasing patterns or shopping patterns which could adversely impact leasing revenue,
retail property traffic and percentage rent. As a result, the ability of the mortgaged properties to generate cash flow may be
adversely affected.
 
With respect to shopping patterns, attacks
in the United States, incidents of terrorism occurring outside the United States and the military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan
may continue to significantly reduce air travel throughout the United States, and, therefore, continue to have a negative effect
on revenues in areas heavily dependent on tourism. The decrease in air travel may have a negative effect on certain of the mortgaged
properties located in areas heavily dependent on tourism, which could reduce the ability of the affected mortgaged properties to
generate cash flow.
 
The United States continues to maintain
a military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is uncertain what effect the activities of the United States in Iraq, Afghanistan
or any future conflict with any other country or group will have on domestic and world financial markets, economies, real estate
markets, insurance costs or business segments. Foreign or domestic conflict of any kind could have an adverse effect on the performance
of the mortgaged properties.
 
Some Certificates May Not
Be Appropriate for Benefit Plans
 
Generally, ERISA applies to investments
made by employee benefit plans and transactions involving the assets of those plans. Even if ERISA does not apply, similar prohibited
transaction rules may apply under Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code or materially similar federal, state or local
laws. Due to the complexity of regulations that govern those plans, if you are subject to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Internal
Revenue Code or to any materially similar federal, state or local law, you are urged to consult your own counsel regarding consequences
under ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code or such other similar law of acquisition, ownership and disposition of the offered certificates
of any series. See “Certain ERISA Considerations” in this prospectus.
 
Material Federal Tax Considerations
Regarding Residual Certificates
 
If you hold certain classes of certificates
that constitute a residual interest in a “real estate mortgage investment conduit” for federal income tax purposes,
you will be required to report on your federal income tax returns as ordinary income your pro rata share of the taxable income
of the REMIC, regardless of the amount or timing of your receipt of cash payments, as described in “Material Federal Income
Tax Consequences—Federal Income Tax Consequences for REMIC Certificates” in this prospectus. Accordingly, under
certain circumstances, if you hold residual certificates you may have taxable income and tax liabilities arising from your investment
during a taxable year in excess of the cash received during that period. The requirement to report your pro rata share of the taxable
income and net loss of the REMIC will continue until the principal balances of all classes of certificates of the related series
have been reduced to zero, even though you, as a holder of residual certificates, have received full payment of your stated interest
and principal. A portion, or, in certain circumstances, all, of your share of the REMIC taxable income may be treated as “excess
inclusion” income to you, which:
 


·
generally, will not be subject to offset by losses
from other activities;




 
 




·
if you are a tax-exempt holder, will be treated as
unrelated business taxable income; and


 


28

 

 


·
if you are a foreign holder, will not qualify for
exemption from withholding tax.


 
If you are an individual and you hold a
class of residual certificates, you may be limited in your ability to deduct servicing fees and other expenses of the REMIC. In
addition, classes of residual certificates are subject to certain restrictions on transfer. Because of the special tax treatment
of classes of residual certificates, the taxable income arising in a given year on a class of residual certificates may substantially
exceed the taxable income associated with investment in a corporate bond or stripped instrument having similar cash flow characteristics
and pre-tax yield. As a result, the after-tax yield on the classes of residual certificates may be significantly less than that
of a corporate bond or stripped instrument having similar cash flow characteristics.
 
Material Federal Tax Considerations
Regarding Original Issue Discount
 
Certain classes of certificates of a series
may be issued with “original issue discount” for federal income tax purposes, which generally will result in recognition
of some taxable income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to that income. Accordingly, investors must have sufficient
sources of cash to pay any federal, state or local income taxes with respect to the original issue discount. See “Material
Federal Income Tax Consequences—Federal Income Tax Consequences for REMIC Certificates—Taxation of Regular Certificates”
in this prospectus.
 
Bankruptcy Proceedings Could
Adversely Affect Payments on Your Certificates
 
Under the federal bankruptcy code, the filing
of a petition in bankruptcy by or against a borrower will stay the pending sale of the mortgaged property owned by that borrower,
as well as the commencement or continuation of a foreclosure action and deficiency judgment proceedings. In addition, even if a
court determines that the value of the mortgaged property is less than the principal balance of the mortgage loan it secures, the
court may prevent a lender from foreclosing on the mortgaged property, subject to certain protections available to the lender.
As part of a restructuring plan, a court also may reduce the amount of secured indebtedness to the then-current value of the mortgaged
property. This action would make the lender a general unsecured creditor for the difference between the then-current value and
the amount of its outstanding mortgage indebtedness.
 
A bankruptcy court also may:
 


·
grant a debtor a reasonable time to cure a payment
default on a mortgage loan;




 
 




·
reduce periodic payments due under a mortgage loan;




 
 




·
change the rate of interest due on a mortgage loan;
or




 
 




·
otherwise alter the mortgage loan’s repayment
schedule.


 
Moreover, the filing of a petition in bankruptcy
by, or on behalf of, a junior lienholder may stay the senior lienholder from taking action to foreclose on the junior lien. Additionally,
the borrower’s trustee or the borrower, as debtor-in-possession, has certain special powers to avoid, subordinate or disallow
debts. In certain circumstances, the claims of the trustee may be subordinated to financing obtained by a debtor-in-possession
subsequent to its bankruptcy.
 
Under the federal bankruptcy code, the lender
will be stayed from enforcing a borrower’s (or with respect to any indemnity deed of trust structure, the related property
owner’s) assignment of rents and leases. The federal bankruptcy code also may interfere with the master servicer’s
or special servicer’s ability to enforce lockbox requirements. The legal proceedings necessary to resolve these issues can
be time consuming and costly and may significantly delay or diminish the receipt of rents. Rents also may escape an assignment
to the extent they are used by the borrower to maintain the mortgaged property or for other court authorized expenses.
 


29

 

 
Additionally, pursuant to subordination
agreements for certain of the mortgage loans, the subordinate lenders may have agreed that they will not take any direct actions
with respect to the related subordinated debt, including any actions relating to the bankruptcy of the borrower, and that the holder
of the mortgage loan will have all rights to direct all such actions. There can be no assurance that in the event of the borrower’s
bankruptcy, a court will enforce such restrictions against a subordinated lender.
 
In its decision in In re 203 North LaSalle
Street Partnership, 246 B.R. 325 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. March 10, 2000), the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District
of Illinois refused to enforce a provision of a subordination agreement that allowed a first mortgagee to vote a second mortgagee’s
claim with respect to a Chapter 11 reorganization plan on the grounds that pre-bankruptcy contracts cannot override rights expressly
provided by the federal bankruptcy code. This holding, which at least one court has already followed, potentially limits the ability
of a senior lender to accept or reject a reorganization plan or to control the enforcement of remedies against a common borrower
over a subordinated lender’s objections.
 
As a result of the foregoing, the trust’s
recovery with respect to borrowers in bankruptcy proceedings may be significantly delayed, and the aggregate amount ultimately
collected may be substantially less than the amount owed. See “Certain Legal Aspects of Mortgage Loans—Foreclosure”
in this prospectus.
 
Risks Relating to Enforceability
of Yield Maintenance Charges, Prepayment Premiums or Defeasance Provisions
 
Provisions requiring yield maintenance charges
or prepayment premiums may not be enforceable in some states and under federal bankruptcy law. Those provisions also may be interpreted
as constituting the collection of interest for usury purposes. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that the obligation to pay a yield
maintenance charge or prepayment premium will be enforceable. Also, we cannot assure you that foreclosure proceeds will be sufficient
to pay an enforceable yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium.
 
Additionally, although the collateral substitution
provisions related to defeasance do not have the same effect on the certificateholders as prepayment, we cannot assure you that
a court would not interpret those provisions as requiring a yield maintenance charge or prepayment premium. In certain jurisdictions,
those collateral substitution provisions might be deemed unenforceable under applicable law or public policy, or usurious.
 
Risks Relating to Borrower
Default
 
The rate and timing of delinquencies or
defaults on the mortgage loans will affect:
 


·
the aggregate amount of distributions on the offered
certificates;




 
 




·
their yield to maturity;




 
 




·
the rate of principal payments; and




 
 




·
their weighted average life.


 
If losses on the mortgage loans exceed the
aggregate principal amount of the classes of certificates subordinated to a particular class, that class will suffer a loss equal
to the full amount of the excess, up to the outstanding principal amount of that class.
 
If you calculate your anticipated yield
based on assumed rates of defaults and losses that are lower than the default rate and losses actually experienced and those losses
are allocated to your certificates, your actual yield to maturity will be lower than the assumed yield. Under certain extreme scenarios,
that yield could be negative. In general, the earlier a loss borne by you on your certificates occurs, the greater the effect on
your yield to maturity.
 


30

 

 
Even if losses on the mortgage loans are
not borne by your certificates, those losses may affect the weighted average life and yield to maturity of your certificates. This
may be so because those losses lead to your certificates having a higher percentage ownership interest in the trust and related
distributions of principal payments on the mortgage loans than would otherwise have been the case and the related prepayment may
affect the pass-through rate on your certificates. The effect on the weighted average life and yield to maturity of your certificates
will depend upon the characteristics of the remaining mortgage loans.
 
Delinquencies and defaults on the mortgage
loans may significantly delay the receipt of distributions by you on your certificates, unless advances are made to cover delinquent
payments or the subordination of another class of certificates fully offsets the effects of any delinquency or default.
 
Additionally, the courts of any state may
refuse the foreclosure of a mortgage or deed of trust when an acceleration of the indebtedness would be inequitable or unjust or
the circumstances would render the action unconscionable. See “Certain Legal Aspects of Mortgage Loans—Foreclosure”
in this prospectus.
 
Risks Relating to Certain
Payments
 
To the extent described in the related prospectus
supplement, the master servicer, the special servicer or the trustee, as applicable, will be entitled to receive interest on unreimbursed
P&I advances. This interest will generally accrue from the date on which the related advance is made or the related expense
is incurred through the date of reimbursement. In addition, under certain circumstances, including delinquencies in the payment
of principal and/or interest, a mortgage loan will be specially serviced and the special servicer is entitled to compensation for
special servicing activities. The right to receive interest on advances or special servicing compensation is generally senior to
the rights of certificateholders to receive distributions on the offered certificates. The payment of interest on advances and
the payment of compensation to the special servicer may lead to shortfalls in amounts otherwise distributable on the offered certificates.
 
Risks Relating to Enforceability
 
The mortgages will generally permit the
lender to accelerate the debt upon default by the borrower. The courts of all states will enforce acceleration clauses in the event
of a material payment default. Courts, however, may refuse to permit foreclosure or acceleration if a default is deemed immaterial
or the exercise of those remedies would be unjust or unconscionable.
 
If a mortgaged property has tenants, the
borrower typically assigns its income as landlord to the lender as further security, while retaining a license to collect rents
as long as there is no default. If the borrower defaults, the license terminates and the lender is entitled to collect rents. In
certain jurisdictions, such assignments may not be perfected as security interests until the lender takes actual possession of
the property’s cash flow. In some jurisdictions, the lender may not be entitled to collect rents until the lender takes possession
of the property and secures the appointment of a receiver. In addition, as previously discussed, if bankruptcy or similar proceedings
are commenced by or for the borrower, the lender’s ability to collect the rents may be adversely affected.
 
Book-Entry System for Certain
Classes May Decrease Liquidity and Delay Payment
 
If so provided in the related prospectus
supplement, one or more classes of the offered certificates of any series will be issued as book-entry certificates. Each class
of book-entry certificates will be initially represented by one or more certificates registered in the name of a nominee for The
Depository Trust Company, or DTC. Since transactions in the classes of book-entry certificates of any series generally can be effected
only through The Depository Trust Company, and its participating organizations:
 


·
the liquidity of book-entry certificates in secondary
trading market that may develop may be limited because investors may be unwilling to purchase certificates for which they cannot
obtain physical certificates;


 


31

 

 


·
your ability to pledge certificates to persons or
entities that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise to take action in respect of the certificates, may be limited
due to lack of a physical security representing the certificates;




 
 




·
your access to information regarding the certificates
may be limited since conveyance of notices and other communications by The Depository Trust Company to its participating organizations,
and directly and indirectly through those participating organizations to you, will be governed by arrangements among them, subject
to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect at that time; and




 
 




·
you may experience some delay in receiving distributions
of interest and principal on your certificates because distributions will be made by the trustee to DTC and DTC will then be required
to credit those distributions to the accounts of its participating organizations and only then will they be credited to your account
either directly or indirectly through DTC’s participating organizations.


 
See “Description of the Certificates—Book-Entry
Registration and Definitive Certificates” in this prospectus.
 
Delinquent and Non-Performing
Mortgage Loans Could Adversely Affect Payments on Your Certificates
 
If so provided in the related prospectus
supplement, the trust fund for a particular series of certificates may include mortgage loans that are past due. In no event will
the mortgage loans that are past due comprise 20 percent or more of the trust fund at the time the mortgage loans are transferred
to the trust fund. None of the mortgage loans will be non-performing (i.e., more than 90 days delinquent or in foreclosure)
at the time the mortgage loans are transferred by the Depositor to a trust fund for a series. If so specified in the related prospectus
supplement, a special servicer may perform the servicing of delinquent mortgage loans or mortgage loans that become non-performing
after the time they are transferred to a trust fund. Credit support provided with respect to a particular series of certificates
may not cover all losses related to those delinquent or non-performing mortgage loans. You should consider the risk that the inclusion
of those mortgage loans in the trust fund may adversely affect the rate of defaults and prepayments on the mortgage assets in the
trust fund and the yield on your certificates of that series. See “Description of the Trust Funds—Mortgage Loans—General”
in this prospectus.
 
Changes to REMIC Restrictions
on Loan Modifications May Impact an Investment in the Certificates
 
The IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2009-45
easing the tax requirements for a servicer to modify a commercial or multifamily mortgage loan held in a REMIC or grantor trust
by interpreting the circumstances when default is “reasonably foreseeable” to include those where the servicer reasonably
believes that there is a “significant risk of default” with respect to the mortgage loan upon maturity of the loan
or at an earlier date, and that by making such modification the risk of default is substantially reduced. Accordingly, if the servicer
or the special servicer determined that the mortgage loan was at significant risk of default and permitted one or more modifications
otherwise consistent with the terms of the related pooling and servicing agreement, any such modification may impact the timing
of payments and ultimate recovery on the mortgage loan, and likewise on one or more classes of certificates in the related series,
and the tax status of the REMIC.
 
In addition, final regulations were issued
under the REMIC provisions of the Code that modify the tax restrictions imposed on a servicer’s ability to modify the terms
of mortgage loans held by a REMIC relating to changes in the collateral, credit enhancement and recourse features to permit those
modifications so long as the mortgage loan remains “principally secured” by real property (within the meaning of the
final regulations). The IRS has also issued Revenue Procedure 2010-30, describing circumstances in which it will not challenge
the treatment of mortgage loans as “qualified mortgages” on the grounds that the mortgage loan is not “principally
secured by real property”, that is, has a real
 


32

 

 
property
loan-to-value ratio greater than 125% following a release of liens on some or all of the real property securing such mortgage
loan. The general rule is that a mortgage loan must continue to be “principally secured by real property” following
any such lien release, unless the lien release is pursuant to a defeasance permitted under the original loan documents and occurs
more than two years after the startup day of the REMIC, all in accordance with the REMIC provisions. Revenue Procedure 2010-30
also allows lien releases in certain “grandfathered transactions” and transactions in which the release is part of
a “qualified pay-down transaction” even if the mortgage loan after the transaction might not otherwise be treated
as principally secured by a lien on real property. If the value of the real property securing a mortgage loan were to decline,
the need to comply with the rules of Revenue Procedure 2010-30 could restrict the servicers’ actions in negotiating the
terms of a workout or in allowing minor lien releases in circumstances in which, after giving effect to the release, the mortgage
loan would not have a real property loan-to-value ratio of 125% or less. This could impact the timing and ultimate recovery on
a mortgage loan, and likewise on one or more classes of certificates.
 
In The Event of an Early
Termination of a Swap Agreement Due to Certain Swap Termination Events, a Trust May Be Required to Make a Large Termination Payment
to any Related Swap Counterparty
 
To the extent described in the related prospectus
supplement, a trust may enter into one or more interest rate swap agreements. A swap agreement generally may not be terminated
except upon the occurrence of enumerated termination events set forth in the applicable swap agreement which will be described
in the related prospectus supplement. Depending on the reason for the termination, however, a swap termination payment may be due
from either the trust or the related swap counterparty.
 
If a termination event under any of these
swap agreements occurs and the trust owes the related swap counterparty a large termination payment that is required to be paid
pro rata with interest due to the related securities, the trust may not have sufficient available funds on that or future distribution
dates to make required payments of interest or principal, and the holders of all classes of securities may suffer a loss.
 
Your Securities Will Have
Greater Risk if an Interest Rate Swap Agreement Terminates
 
If on any distribution date a payment is
due to the trust under an interest rate swap agreement, but the related swap counterparty defaults and the trust is unable to arrange
for a replacement swap agreement, holders of such securities will remain entitled to the established rate of interest and principal,
even though the related swap agreement has terminated. If this occurs, amounts available to make payments on the related securities
will be reduced to the extent the interest rates on those securities exceed the rates which the trust would have been required
to pay to the swap counterparty under the terminated interest rate swap agreement. In this event, the trust may not have sufficient
available funds on that or future distribution dates to make required payments of interest or principal to all classes of securities
and you may suffer a loss.
 
DESCRIPTION
OF THE TRUST FUNDS
 
General
 
The primary assets of each trust fund will
consist of:
 
1.      
one or more types of multifamily or commercial mortgage loans,
 
2.      
mortgage participations, pass-through certificates or other mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) that evidence
interests in, or that are secured by pledges of, one or more of various types of multifamily or commercial mortgage loans, or
 
3.      
a combination of mortgage loans and MBS.
 


33

 

 
J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage
Securities Corp. (the “Depositor”) will establish each trust fund. Each mortgage asset will be selected by the
Depositor for inclusion in a trust fund from among those purchased, either directly or indirectly, from a prior holder of the mortgage
asset (a “Mortgage Asset Seller”), which prior holder may or may not be the originator of that mortgage loan
or the issuer of that MBS and may be our affiliate. The mortgage assets will not be guaranteed or insured by the Depositor or any
of its affiliates and will be guaranteed or insured by a governmental agency or instrumentality or by any other person only to
the extent described in the related prospectus supplement. The discussion under the heading “—Mortgage Loans”
below, unless otherwise noted, applies equally to mortgage loans underlying any MBS included in a particular trust fund.
 
Mortgage Loans
 
General. The mortgage loans will
be evidenced by promissory notes (the “Mortgage Notes”) secured by mortgages, deeds of trust or similar security
instruments (the “Mortgages”) that create liens on fee or leasehold estates in properties (the “Mortgaged
Properties”) consisting of
 


·
Residential properties consisting of five or more
rental or cooperatively-owned dwelling units in high-rise, mid-rise or garden apartment buildings or other residential structures;
or




 
 




·
Office buildings, retail stores and establishments,
hotels or motels, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, continuum care facilities, day care centers, schools, hospitals or
other healthcare related facilities, mobile home parks and manufactured housing communities, warehouse facilities, mini-warehouse
facilities, self-storage facilities, distribution centers, transportation centers, industrial plants, parking facilities, entertainment
and/or recreation facilities, mixed use properties, cell phone tower properties, automobile dealerships and/or unimproved land.


 
The multifamily properties may include mixed
commercial and residential structures, apartment buildings owned by private cooperative housing corporations (“Cooperatives”),
and shares of the Cooperative allocable to one or more dwelling units occupied by non-owner tenants or to vacant units. Each Mortgage
will create a first priority or junior priority mortgage lien on a borrower’s fee estate in a Mortgaged Property. If a Mortgage
creates a lien on a borrower’s leasehold estate in a property, then, the term of that leasehold will generally exceed the
term of the Mortgage Note by at least two years. Generally, a person other than the Depositor will have originated each mortgage
loan, and the originator may be or may have been an affiliate of the Depositor. Each such unaffiliated originator that originated
10% or more of the mortgage loans of any series will be identified in the related prospectus supplement.
 
If so specified in the related prospectus
supplement, mortgage assets for a series of certificates may include mortgage loans made on the security of real estate projects
under construction. In that case, the related prospectus supplement will describe the procedures and timing for making disbursements
from construction reserve funds as portions of the related real estate project are completed. In addition, the mortgage assets
for a particular series of certificates may include mortgage loans that are delinquent or non-performing as of the date those certificates
are issued. In that case, the related prospectus supplement will set forth, as to those mortgage loans, available information as
to the period of the delinquency or non-performance of those loans, any forbearance arrangement then in effect, the condition of
the related Mortgaged Property and the ability of the Mortgaged Property to generate income to service the mortgage debt.
 
Default and Loss Considerations with
Respect to the Mortgage Loans. Mortgage loans secured by liens on income-producing properties are substantially different from
loans made on the security of owner-occupied single-family homes. The repayment of a loan secured by a lien on an income-producing
property is typically dependent upon the successful operation of that property (that is, its ability to generate income). Moreover,
some or all of the mortgage loans included in a particular trust fund may be non-recourse loans, which means that, absent special
facts, recourse in the case of default will be limited to the Mortgaged Property and those other assets, if any, that were pledged
to secure repayment of the mortgage loan.
 


34

 

 
Lenders typically look to the Debt Service
Coverage Ratio and the Debt Yield of a loan secured by income-producing property as important factors in evaluating the risk of
default on and / or losses related to that loan. The “Debt Service Coverage Ratio” or “DSCR”
of a mortgage loan at any given time is generally the ratio of (1) the Net Operating Income derived from the related Mortgaged
Property for a twelve-month period to (2) the annualized scheduled payments on the mortgage loan and any other loans senior
thereto that are secured by the related Mortgaged Property. The “Debt Yield” of a mortgage loan at any given
time is generally the ratio of (1) the Net Operating Income derived from the related Mortgaged Property for a twelve-month
period divided by (2) the outstanding principal amount of the mortgage loan secured by the related Mortgaged Property, expressed
in percentage terms. The prospectus supplement may describe certain variations in the calculation of Debt Service Coverage Ratio
and / or Debt Yield that are applicable to a specific series. “Net Operating Income” generally means, for any
given period, the total operating revenues derived from a Mortgaged Property during that period, minus the total operating expenses
incurred in respect of that Mortgaged Property during that period other than:
 


·
non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization,




 
 




·
capital expenditures, and




 
 




·
debt service on the related mortgage loan or on any
other loans that are secured by that Mortgaged Property.


 
The Net Operating Income of a Mortgaged
Property will fluctuate over time and may or may not be sufficient to cover debt service on the related mortgage loan at any given
time. The prospectus supplement may describe certain variations in the calculation of Net Operating Income that are applicable
to a specific series. As the primary source of the operating revenues of a non-owner occupied, income-producing property, rental
income (and, with respect to a mortgage loan secured by a Cooperative apartment building, maintenance payments from tenant-stockholders
of a Cooperative) may be affected by the condition of the applicable real estate market and/or area economy. In addition, properties
typically leased, occupied or used on a short-term basis, such as certain healthcare-related facilities, hotels and motels, and
mini-warehouse and self-storage facilities, tend to be affected more rapidly by changes in market or business conditions than do
properties typically leased for longer periods, such as warehouses, retail stores, office buildings and industrial plants. Commercial
properties may be owner-occupied or leased to a small number of tenants. Thus, the Net Operating Income of a commercial property
may depend substantially on the financial condition of the borrower or a tenant, and mortgage loans secured by liens on those properties
may pose greater risks than loans secured by liens on multifamily properties or on multi-tenant commercial properties.
 
Increases in operating expenses due to the
general economic climate or economic conditions in a locality or industry segment, such as increases in interest rates, real estate
tax rates, energy costs, labor costs and other operating expenses, and/or to changes in governmental rules, regulations and fiscal
policies, may also affect the risk of default on a mortgage loan. As may be further described in the related prospectus supplement,
in some cases leases of Mortgaged Properties may provide that the lessee, rather than the borrower/landlord, is responsible for
payment of operating expenses (“Net Leases”). However, the existence of these “net of expense” provisions
will result in stable Net Operating Income to the borrower/landlord only to the extent that the lessee is able to absorb operating
expense increases while continuing to make rent payments.
 
Lenders also look to the Loan-to-Value Ratio
of a mortgage loan as a factor in evaluating risk of loss if a property must be liquidated following a default. The “Loan-to-Value
Ratio” or “LTV” of a mortgage loan at any given time is generally the ratio (expressed as a percentage)
of
 


·
the then outstanding principal balance of the mortgage
loan and any other loans senior thereto that are secured by the related Mortgaged Property to




 
 




·
the Value of the related Mortgaged Property.


 


35

 

 
The prospectus supplement may describe certain
variations in the calculation of Loan-to-Value Ratio that are applicable to a specific series.
 
The “Value” of a Mortgaged
Property is generally its fair market value determined in an appraisal obtained by the originator at the origination of that loan.
The lower the Loan-to-Value Ratio, the greater the percentage of the borrower’s equity in a Mortgaged Property, and thus
 
(a)    
the greater the incentive of the borrower to perform under the terms of the related mortgage loan (in order to protect its
equity); and
 
(b)    
the greater the cushion provided to the lender against loss on liquidation following a default.
 
Loan-to-Value Ratios will not necessarily
constitute an accurate measure of the risk of liquidation loss in a pool of mortgage loans. For example, the value of a Mortgaged
Property as of the date of initial issuance of the related series of certificates may be less than the Value determined at loan
origination, and will likely continue to fluctuate from time to time based upon changes in economic conditions, the real estate
market and other factors described in this prospectus. Moreover, even when current, an appraisal is not necessarily a reliable
estimate of value. Appraised values of income-producing properties are generally based on:
 


·
the market comparison method (which compares recent
resale value of comparable properties at the date of the appraisal),




 
 




·
the cost replacement method which calculates the cost
of replacing the property at that date,




 
 




·
the income capitalization method which projects value
based upon the property’s projected net cash flow, or




 
 




·
upon a selection from or interpolation of the values
derived from those methods.


 
Each of these appraisal methods can present
analytical difficulties. It is often difficult to find truly comparable properties that have recently been sold; the replacement
cost of a property may have little to do with its current market value; and income capitalization is inherently based on inexact
projections of income and expense and the selection of an appropriate capitalization rate and discount rate. Where more than one
of these appraisal methods are used and provide significantly different results, an accurate determination of value and, correspondingly,
a reliable analysis of default and loss risks, is even more difficult.
 
While we believe that the foregoing considerations
are important factors that generally distinguish loans secured by liens on income-producing real estate from single-family mortgage
loans, we cannot assure you that all of these factors will in fact have been prudently considered by the originators of the mortgage
loans, or that, for a particular mortgage loan, they are complete or relevant. See “Risk Factors—Commercial and
Multifamily Mortgage Loans Have Risks That May Affect Payments on Your Certificates” and “—Borrowers May Be
Unable to Make Balloon Payments” in this prospectus.
 
Payment Provisions of the Mortgage Loans.
In general, each mortgage loan:
 


·
will provide for scheduled payments of principal,
interest or both, to be made on specified dates (“Due Dates”) that occur monthly, quarterly, semi-annually
or annually,




 
 




·
may provide for no accrual of interest or for accrual
of interest at an interest rate that is fixed over its term or that adjusts from time to time, or that may be converted at the
borrower’s election from an adjustable to a fixed interest rate, or from a fixed to an adjustable interest rate,




 
 




·
may provide for level payments to maturity or for
payments that adjust from time to time to accommodate changes in the interest rate or to reflect the occurrence of certain events,
and may permit negative amortization,


 


36

 

 


·
may be fully amortizing or partially amortizing or
non-amortizing, with a balloon payment due on its stated maturity date, and




 
 




·
may prohibit over its term or for a certain period
prepayments (the period of that prohibition, a “Lock-out Period” and its date of expiration, a “Lock-out
Date”) and/or require payment of a premium or a yield maintenance penalty (a “Prepayment Premium”)
in connection with certain prepayments, in each case as described in the related prospectus supplement.

In appropriate cases, the related prospectus
supplement will also contain certain information available to the Depositor that pertains to the provisions of leases and the nature
of tenants of the Mortgaged Properties. If we are unable to tabulate the specific information described above at the time offered
certificates of a series are initially offered, we will provide more general information of the nature described above in the related
prospectus supplement, and specific information will be set forth in a report which we will make available to purchasers of those
certificates at or before the initial issuance of the certificates and will be filed as part of a Current Report on Form 8-K with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) contemporaneously with the final prospectus.
 


37

 

 
MBS
 
MBS may include:
 


·
private (that is, not guaranteed or insured by the
United States or any agency or instrumentality of the United States) mortgage participations, mortgage pass-through certificates
or other mortgage-backed securities or




 
 




·
certificates insured or guaranteed by the Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”), the Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”),
the Governmental National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”) or the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (“FAMC”)
provided that, if so specified in the related prospectus supplement, each MBS will evidence an interest in, or will be secured
by a pledge of, mortgage loans that conform to the descriptions of the mortgage loans contained in this prospectus.


 
Any MBS will have been issued pursuant to
a pooling and servicing agreement, an indenture or similar agreement (an “MBS Agreement”). The issuer of the
MBS (the “MBS Issuer”) and/or the servicer of the underlying mortgage loans (the “MBS Servicer”)
will have entered into the MBS Agreement, generally with a trustee (the “MBS Trustee”) or, in the alternative,
with the original purchaser or purchasers of the MBS.
 
The MBS may have been issued in one or more
classes with characteristics similar to the classes of certificates described in this prospectus. The MBS Issuer, the MBS Servicer
or the MBS Trustee will make distributions in respect of the MBS on the dates specified in the related prospectus supplement. The
MBS Issuer or the MBS Servicer or another person specified in the related prospectus supplement may have the right or obligation
to repurchase or substitute assets underlying the MBS after a certain date or under other circumstances specified in the related
prospectus supplement.
 
Reserve funds, subordination or other credit
support similar to that described for the certificates under “Description of Credit Support” may have been provided
with respect to the MBS. The type, characteristics and amount of credit support, if any, will be a function of the characteristics
of the underlying mortgage loans and other factors and generally will have been established on the basis of the requirements of
any rating agency that may have assigned a rating to the MBS, or by the initial purchasers of the MBS.
 
The prospectus supplement for a series of
certificates that evidence interests in MBS will specify, to the extent available:
 


·
the aggregate approximate initial and outstanding
principal amount and type of the MBS to be included in the trust fund,




 
 




·
the original and remaining term to stated maturity
of the MBS, if applicable,




 
 




·
the pass-through or bond rate of the MBS or the formula
for determining the rates,




 
 




·
the payment characteristics of the MBS,




 
 




·
the MBS Issuer, MBS Servicer and MBS Trustee, as applicable,




 
 




·
a description of the credit support, if any,




 
 




·
the circumstances under which the related underlying
mortgage loans, or the MBS themselves, may be purchased prior to their maturity,




 
 




·
the terms on which mortgage loans may be substituted
for those originally underlying the MBS,


 


38

 

 


·
the type of mortgage loans underlying the MBS and
such other applicable information in respect of the underlying mortgage loans described under “—Mortgage Loans—Mortgage
Loan Information in Prospectus Supplements” above,




 
 




·
such other applicable information in respect of the
mortgage loans underlying the MBS required under Regulation AB, and




 
 




·
the characteristics of any cash flow agreements that
relate to the MBS.


 
Any MBS either will have been previously
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or each of the following will
have been satisfied with respect to the MBS:
 
1.      
neither the issuer of the MBS nor any of its affiliates has a direct or indirect agreement, arrangement, relationship or
understanding relating to the MBS and the related series of securities to be issued;
 
2.      
neither the issuer of the MBS nor any of its affiliates is an affiliate of the sponsor, Depositor, issuing entity or underwriter
of the related series of securities to be issued; and
 
3.      
the Depositor would be free to publicly resell the MBS without registration under the Securities Act.
 
If the issuer of the MBS is required to
file reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), the related prospectus
supplement will describe how to locate such reports of the MBS issuer. The MBS issuer generally will be a financial institution
or other entity engaged generally in the business of mortgage lending or the acquisition of mortgage loans, a public agency or
instrumentality of a state, local or federal government, or a limited purpose or other corporation organized for the purpose of,
among other things, establishing trusts and acquiring and selling housing loans to such trusts and selling beneficial interests
in such trusts. If the related prospectus supplement so specifies, the MBS issuer may be one of our affiliates where the MBS have
been previously registered under the Securities Act or the MBS themselves are exempt from registration under Section 3 of the Securities
Act. The obligations of the MBS issuer generally will be limited to certain representations and warranties with respect to the
assets it conveyed to the related trust or its assignment of the representations and warranties of another entity from which it
acquired the assets. The MBS issuer will not generally have guaranteed any of the assets conveyed to the related trust or any of
the private mortgage backed securities issued under the MBS pooling and servicing agreement. Additionally, although the mortgage
loans underlying the MBS may be guaranteed by an agency or instrumentality of the United States, the MBS themselves will not be
so guaranteed.
 
Certificate Accounts
 
Each trust fund will include one or more
certificate accounts established and maintained on behalf of the certificateholders into which the person or persons designated
in the related prospectus supplement will, to the extent described in this prospectus and in that prospectus supplement, deposit
all payments and collections received or advanced with respect to the mortgage assets and any interest rate or currency swap or
interest rate cap, floor or collar contracts in the trust fund. A certificate account may be maintained as an interest bearing
or a non-interest bearing account, and funds held in a certificate account may be held as cash or invested in certain obligations
acceptable to each rating agency rating one or more classes of the related series of offered certificates.
 
Other Accounts
 
The prospectus supplement for each trust
will also describe any other accounts established for such series.
 


39

 

 
Credit Support
 
If so provided in the prospectus supplement
for a series of certificates, partial or full protection against certain defaults and losses on the mortgage assets in the related
trust fund may be provided to one or more classes of certificates of that series in the form of subordination of one or more other
classes of certificates of that series or by one or more other types of credit support, such as letters of credit, overcollateralization,
insurance policies, guarantees, surety bonds or reserve funds, or a combination of them. The amount and types of credit support,
the identification of the entity providing it (if applicable) and related information with respect to each type of credit support,
if any, will be set forth in the prospectus supplement for a series of certificates. See “Risk Factors—Credit Support
May Not Cover Losses” and “Description of Credit Support” in this prospectus.
 
Cash Flow Agreements
 
If so provided in the prospectus supplement
for a series of certificates, the related trust fund may include guaranteed investment contracts pursuant to which moneys held
in the funds and accounts established for those series will be invested at a specified rate. The trust fund may also include interest
rate exchange agreements, interest rate cap or floor agreements, or currency exchange agreements, which agreements are designed
to reduce the effects of interest rate or currency exchange rate fluctuations on the mortgage assets on one or more classes of
certificates. The principal terms of a guaranteed investment contract or other agreement (any of these agreements, a “Cash
Flow Agreement”), and the identity of the Cash Flow Agreement obligor, will be described in the prospectus supplement
for a series of certificates.
 
YIELD
AND MATURITY CONSIDERATIONS
 
General
 
The yield on any offered certificate will
depend on the price you paid, the fixed, variable rate or adjustable pass-through interest rate of the certificate and the amount
and timing of distributions on the certificate. See “Risk Factors—Prepayments of the Mortgage Assets Will Affect
the Timing of Your Cash Flow and May Affect Your Yield” in this prospectus. The following discussion contemplates
a trust fund that consists solely of mortgage loans. While the characteristics and behavior of mortgage loans underlying an MBS
can generally be expected to have the same effect on the yield to maturity and/or weighted average life of a class of certificates
as will the characteristics and behavior of comparable mortgage loans, the effect may differ due to the payment characteristics
of the MBS. If a trust fund includes MBS, the related prospectus supplement will discuss the effect that the MBS payment characteristics
may have on the yield to maturity and weighted average lives of the offered certificates of the related series.
 
Pass-Through Rate
 
The certificates of any class within a series
may have a fixed, variable or adjustable pass-through interest rate, which may or may not be based upon the interest rates borne
by the mortgage loans in the related trust fund. The prospectus supplement with respect to any series of certificates will specify
the pass-through interest rate for each class of offered certificates of that series or, in the case of a class of offered certificates
with a variable or adjustable pass-through interest rate, the method of determining the pass-through interest rate; the effect,
if any, of the prepayment of any mortgage loan on the pass-through interest rate of one or more classes of offered certificates;
and whether the distributions of interest on the offered certificates of any class will be dependent, in whole or in part, on the
performance of any obligor under a Cash Flow Agreement.
 
Payment Delays
 
With respect to any series of certificates,
a period of time will elapse between the date upon which payments on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund are due and the
distribution date on which those
 


40

 

 
payments
are passed through to certificateholders. That delay will effectively reduce the yield that would otherwise be produced if payments
on those mortgage loans were distributed to certificateholders on or near the date they were due.
 
Certain Shortfalls in Collections
of Interest
 
When a principal prepayment in full or in
part is made on a mortgage loan, the borrower is generally charged interest on the amount of that prepayment only through the date
of prepayment, instead of through the Due Date for the next succeeding scheduled payment. However, interest accrued on any series
of certificates and distributable on them on any distribution date will generally correspond to interest accrued on the mortgage
loans to their respective Due Dates during the related Due Period. “Due Period” is a specified time period generally
corresponding in length to the time period between distribution dates, and all scheduled payments on the mortgage loans in
the related trust fund that are due during a given Due Period will, to the extent received by a specified date (the “Determination
Date”) or otherwise advanced by the related master servicer or other specified person, be distributed to the holders
of the certificates of that series on the next succeeding distribution date. Consequently, if a prepayment on any mortgage loan
is distributable to certificateholders on a particular distribution date, but that prepayment is not accompanied by interest on
it to the Due Date for that mortgage loan in the related Due Period, then the interest charged to the borrower (net of servicing
and administrative fees) may be less (that shortfall, a “Prepayment Interest Shortfall”) than the corresponding
amount of interest accrued and otherwise payable on the certificates of the related series. If that shortfall is allocated to a
class of offered certificates, their yield will be adversely affected. The prospectus supplement for each series of certificates
will describe the manner in which those shortfalls will be allocated among the classes of those certificates. If so specified in
the prospectus supplement for a series of certificates, the master servicer for that series will be required to apply some or all
of its servicing compensation for the corresponding period to offset the amount of those shortfalls. The related prospectus supplement
will also describe any other amounts available to offset those shortfalls. See “Description of the Pooling Agreements—Servicing
Compensation and Payment of Expenses” in this prospectus.
 
Yield and Prepayment Considerations
 
A certificate’s yield to maturity
will be affected by the rate of principal payments on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund and the allocation of principal
to reduce the principal balance (or notional amount, if applicable) of that certificate. The rate of principal payments on the
mortgage loans in any trust fund will in turn be affected by the amortization schedules of the mortgage loans (which, in the case
of ARM Loans, may change periodically to accommodate adjustments to their mortgage interest rates), the dates on which any balloon
payments are due, and the rate of principal prepayments on them (including for this purpose, prepayments resulting from liquidations
of mortgage loans due to defaults, casualties or condemnations affecting the Mortgaged Properties, or purchases of mortgage loans
out of the related trust fund). Because the rate of principal prepayments on the mortgage loans in any trust fund will depend on
future events and a variety of factors (as described more fully below), we cannot assure you as to that rate.
 
The extent to which the yield to maturity
of a class of offered certificates of any series may vary from the anticipated yield will depend upon the degree to which they
are purchased at a discount or premium and when, and to what degree, payments of principal on the mortgage loans in the related
trust fund are in turn distributed on those certificates, or, in the case of a class of interest-only certificates, result in the
reduction of its notional amount. An investor should consider, in the case of any offered certificate purchased at a discount,
the risk that a slower than anticipated rate of principal payments on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund could result
in an actual yield to that investor that is lower than the anticipated yield and, in the case of any offered certificate purchased
at a premium, the risk that a faster than anticipated rate of principal payments on those mortgage loans could result in an actual
yield to that investor that is lower than the anticipated yield. In addition, if an investor purchases an offered certificate at
a discount (or premium), and principal payments are made in reduction of the principal balance or notional amount of that investor’s
offered certificates at a rate slower (or faster) than the rate anticipated by the investor during any particular period, the consequent
adverse effects on that investor’s
 


41

 

 
yield
would not be fully offset by a subsequent like increase (or decrease) in the rate of principal payments.
 
A class of certificates, including a class
of offered certificates, may provide that on any distribution date the holders of those certificates are entitled to a pro rata
share of the prepayments on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund that are distributable on that date, to a disproportionately
large share (which, in some cases, may be all) of those prepayments, or to a disproportionately small share (which, in some cases,
may be none) of those prepayments. As described in the related prospectus supplement, the respective entitlements of the various
classes of certificates of any series to receive distributions in respect of payments (and, in particular, prepayments) of principal
of the mortgage loans in the related trust fund may vary based on the occurrence of certain events, such as, the retirement of
one or more classes of certificates of that series, or subject to certain contingencies, such as, prepayment and default rates
with respect to those mortgage loans.
 
In general, the notional amount of a class
of interest-only certificates will either (1) be based on the principal balances of some or all of the mortgage assets in
the related trust fund or (2) equal the principal balances of one or more of the other classes of certificates of the same
series. Accordingly, the yield on those interest-only certificates will be inversely related to the rate at which payments and
other collections of principal are received on those mortgage assets or distributions are made in reduction of the principal balances
of those classes of certificates, as the case may be.
 
Consistent with the foregoing, if a class
of certificates of any series consists of interest-only certificates or principal-only certificates, a lower than anticipated rate
of principal prepayments on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund will negatively affect the yield to investors in principal-only
certificates, and a higher than anticipated rate of principal prepayments on those mortgage loans will negatively affect the yield
to investors in interest-only certificates. If the offered certificates of a series include those certificates, the related prospectus
supplement will include a table showing the effect of various assumed levels of prepayment on yields on those certificates. Those
tables will be intended to illustrate the sensitivity of yields to various assumed prepayment rates and will not be intended to
predict, or to provide information that will enable investors to predict, yields or prepayment rates.
 
We are not aware of any relevant publicly
available or authoritative statistics with respect to the historical prepayment experience of a group of multifamily or commercial
mortgage loans. However, the extent of prepayments of principal of the mortgage loans in any trust fund may be affected by factors
such as:
 


·
the availability of mortgage credit,




 
 




·
the relative economic vitality of the area in which
the Mortgaged Properties are located,




 
 




·
the quality of management of the Mortgaged Properties,




 
 




·
the servicing of the mortgage loans,




 
 




·
possible changes in tax laws and other opportunities
for investment,




 
 




·
the existence of Lock-out Periods,




 
 




·
requirements that principal prepayments be accompanied
by Prepayment Premiums, and




 
 




·
by the extent to which these provisions may be practicably
enforced.


 
The rate of prepayment on a pool of mortgage
loans is also affected by prevailing market interest rates for mortgage loans of a comparable type, term and risk level. When the
prevailing market interest rate is below a mortgage loan’s interest rate, a borrower may have an increased incentive to refinance
its mortgage loan. Even in the case of ARM Loans, as prevailing market interest rates decline, and without regard to whether the
mortgage interest rates on the ARM Loans decline in a manner consistent
 


42

 

 
therewith,
the related borrowers may have an increased incentive to refinance for purposes of either (1) converting to a fixed rate
loan and thereby “locking in” that rate or (2) taking advantage of a different index, margin or rate cap or floor
on another adjustable rate mortgage loan.
 
Depending on prevailing market interest
rates, the outlook for market interest rates and economic conditions generally, some borrowers may sell Mortgaged Properties in
order to realize their equity in the Mortgaged Properties, to meet cash flow needs or to make other investments. In addition, some
borrowers may be motivated by federal and state tax laws (which are subject to change) to sell Mortgaged Properties prior to the
exhaustion of tax depreciation benefits. We will make no representation as to the particular factors that will affect the prepayment
of the mortgage loans in any trust fund, as to the relative importance of those factors, as to the percentage of the principal
balance of the mortgage loans that will be paid as of any date or as to the overall rate of prepayment on the mortgage loans.
 
Weighted Average Life and
Maturity
 
The rate at which principal payments are
received on the mortgage loans in any trust fund will affect the ultimate maturity and the weighted average life of one or more
classes of the certificates of that series. Weighted average life refers to the average amount of time that will elapse from the
date of issuance of an instrument until each dollar allocable as principal of that instrument is repaid to the investor.
 
The weighted average life and maturity of
a class of certificates of any series will be influenced by the rate at which principal on the related mortgage loans, whether
in the form of scheduled amortization or prepayments (for this purpose, the term “prepayment” includes voluntary
prepayments, liquidations due to default and purchases of mortgage loans out of the related trust fund), is paid to that class.
Prepayment rates on loans are commonly measured relative to a prepayment standard or model, such as the Constant Prepayment Rate
(“CPR”) prepayment model or the Standard Prepayment Assumption (“SPA”) prepayment model.
CPR represents an assumed constant rate of prepayment each month (expressed as an annual percentage) relative to the then outstanding
principal balance of a pool of loans for the life of those loans. SPA represents an assumed variable rate of prepayment each month
(expressed as an annual percentage) relative to the then outstanding principal balance of a pool of loans, with different prepayment
assumptions often expressed as percentages of SPA. For example, a prepayment assumption of 100% of SPA assumes prepayment rates
of 0.2% per annum of the then outstanding principal balance of the loans in the first month of the life of the loans and an additional
0.2% per annum in each month thereafter until the thirtieth month. Beginning in the thirtieth month, and in each month thereafter
during the life of the loans, 100% of SPA assumes a constant prepayment rate of 6% per annum each month.
 
Neither CPR nor SPA nor any other prepayment
model or assumption purports to be a historical description of prepayment experience or a prediction of the anticipated rate of
prepayment of any particular pool of loans. Moreover, the CPR and SPA models were developed based upon historical prepayment experience
for single-family loans. Thus, it is unlikely that the prepayment experience of the mortgage loans included in any trust fund will
conform to any particular level of CPR or SPA.
 
The prospectus supplement with respect to
each series of certificates will contain tables, if applicable, setting forth the projected weighted average life of each class
of offered certificates of those series and the percentage of the initial principal balance of each class that would be outstanding
on specified distribution dates based on the assumptions stated in that prospectus supplement, including assumptions that
prepayments on the related mortgage loans are made at rates corresponding to various percentages of CPR or SPA, or at other rates
specified in that prospectus supplement. Those tables and assumptions will illustrate the sensitivity of the weighted average lives
of the certificates to various assumed prepayment rates and will not be intended to predict, or to provide information that will
enable investors to predict, the actual weighted average lives of the certificates.
 


43

 

 
Controlled Amortization Classes
and Companion Classes
 
A series of certificates may include one
or more controlled amortization classes, which will entitle the holders of those certificates to receive principal distributions
according to a specified principal payment schedule, which schedule is supported by creating priorities, as described in the related
prospectus supplement, to receive principal payments from the mortgage loans in the related trust fund. If so specified in the
related prospectus supplement, each controlled amortization class will either be a planned amortization class or a targeted amortization
class. In general, a planned amortization class has a “prepayment collar,” that is, a range of prepayment rates that
can be sustained without disruption, that determines the principal cash flow of those certificates. That prepayment collar is not
static, and may expand or contract after the issuance of the planned amortization class depending on the actual prepayment experience
for the underlying mortgage loans. Distributions of principal on a planned amortization class would be made in accordance with
the specified schedule so long as prepayments on the underlying mortgage loans remain at a relatively constant rate within the
prepayment collar and, as described below, companion classes exist to absorb “excesses” or “shortfalls”
in principal payments on the underlying mortgage loans. If the rate of prepayment on the underlying mortgage loans from time to
time falls outside the prepayment collar, or fluctuates significantly within the prepayment collar, especially for any extended
period of time, that event may have material consequences in respect of the anticipated weighted average life and maturity for
a planned amortization class. A targeted amortization class is structured so that principal distributions generally will be payable
on it in accordance with its specified principal payments schedule so long as the rate of prepayments on the related mortgage assets
remains relatively constant at the particular rate used in establishing that schedule. A targeted amortization class will generally
afford the holders of those certificates some protection against early retirement or some protection against an extended average
life, but not both.
 
Although prepayment risk cannot be eliminated
entirely for any class of certificates, a controlled amortization class will generally provide a relatively stable cash flow so
long as the actual rate of prepayment on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund remains relatively constant at the rate,
or within the range of rates, of prepayment used to establish the specific principal payment schedule for those certificates. Prepayment
risk with respect to a given pool of mortgage assets does not disappear, however, and the stability afforded to a controlled amortization
class comes at the expense of one or more companion classes of the same series, any of which companion classes may also be a class
of offered certificates. In general, and as more particularly described in the related prospectus supplement, a companion class
will entitle the holders of those certificates to a disproportionately large share of prepayments on the mortgage loans in the
related trust fund when the rate of prepayment is relatively fast, and will entitle the holders of those certificates to a disproportionately
small share of prepayments on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund when the rate of prepayment is relatively slow. A class
of certificates that entitles the holders of those certificates to a disproportionately large share of the prepayments on the mortgage
loans in the related trust fund enhances the risk of early retirement of that class, or call risk, if the rate of prepayment is
relatively fast; while a class of certificates that entitles the holders of those certificates to a disproportionately small share
of the prepayments on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund enhances the risk of an extended average life of that class,
or extension risk, if the rate of prepayment is relatively slow. Thus, as described in the related prospectus supplement, a companion
class absorbs some (but not all) of the “call risk” and/or “extension risk” that would otherwise belong
to the related controlled amortization class if all payments of principal of the mortgage loans in the related trust fund were
allocated on a pro rata basis.
 
Other Factors Affecting Yield,
Weighted Average Life and Maturity
 
Balloon Payments; Extensions of Maturity.
Some or all of the mortgage loans included in a particular trust fund may require that balloon payments be made at maturity. Because
the ability of a borrower to make a balloon payment typically will depend upon its ability either to refinance the loan or to sell
the related Mortgaged Property, there is a risk that mortgage loans that require balloon payments may default at maturity, or that
the maturity of that mortgage loan may be extended in connection with a workout. In the case of defaults, recovery of proceeds
may be delayed by, among other things, bankruptcy of the borrower or adverse conditions in the market where the property is located.
In order to minimize losses
 


44

 

 
on defaulted
mortgage loans, the master servicer or a special servicer, to the extent and under the circumstances set forth in this prospectus
and in the related prospectus supplement, may be authorized to modify mortgage loans that are in default or as to which a payment
default is imminent. Any defaulted balloon payment or modification that extends the maturity of a mortgage loan may delay distributions
of principal on a class of offered certificates and thereby extend the weighted average life of your certificates and, if those
certificates were purchased at a discount, reduce your yield.
 
Negative Amortization. The weighted
average life of a class of certificates can be affected by mortgage loans that permit negative amortization to occur. A mortgage
loan that provides for the payment of interest calculated at a rate lower than the rate at which interest accrues on it would be
expected during a period of increasing interest rates to amortize at a slower rate (and perhaps not at all) than if interest rates
were declining or were remaining constant. This slower rate of mortgage loan amortization would correspondingly be reflected in
a slower rate of amortization for one or more classes of certificates of the related series. In addition, negative amortization
on one or more mortgage loans in any trust fund may result in negative amortization on the certificates of the related series.
The related prospectus supplement will describe, if applicable, the manner in which negative amortization in respect of the mortgage
loans in any trust fund is allocated among the respective classes of certificates of the related series. The portion of any mortgage
loan negative amortization allocated to a class of certificates may result in a deferral of some or all of the interest payable
on them, which deferred interest may be added to the principal balance of the certificates. Accordingly, the weighted average lives
of mortgage loans that permit negative amortization and that of the classes of certificates to which the negative amortization
would be allocated or that would bear the effects of a slower rate of amortization on those mortgage loans, may increase as a result
of that feature.
 
Negative amortization also may occur in
respect of an ARM Loan that limits the amount by which its scheduled payment may adjust in response to a change in its mortgage
interest rate, provides that its scheduled payment will adjust less frequently than its mortgage interest rate or provides for
constant scheduled payments notwithstanding adjustments to its mortgage interest rate. Accordingly, during a period of declining
interest rates, the scheduled payment on that mortgage loan may exceed the amount necessary to amortize the loan fully over its
remaining amortization schedule and pay interest at the then applicable mortgage interest rate, thereby resulting in the accelerated
amortization of that mortgage loan. This acceleration in amortization of its principal balance will shorten the weighted average
life of that mortgage loan and, correspondingly, the weighted average lives of those classes of certificates entitled to a portion
of the principal payments on that mortgage loan.
 
The extent to which the yield on any offered
certificate will be affected by the inclusion in the related trust fund of mortgage loans that permit negative amortization, will
depend upon (1) whether that offered certificate was purchased at a premium or a discount and (2) the extent to which
the payment characteristics of those mortgage loans delay or accelerate the distributions of principal on that certificate or,
in the case of an interest-only certificate, delay or accelerate the amortization of the notional amount of that certificate. See
“—Yield and Prepayment Considerations” above.
 
Foreclosures and Payment Plans. The
number of foreclosures and the principal amount of the mortgage loans that are foreclosed in relation to the number and principal
amount of mortgage loans that are repaid in accordance with their terms will affect the weighted average lives of those mortgage
loans and, accordingly, the weighted average lives of and yields on the certificates of the related series. Servicing decisions
made with respect to the mortgage loans, including the use of payment plans prior to a demand for acceleration and the restructuring
of mortgage loans in bankruptcy proceedings, may also have an effect upon the payment patterns of particular mortgage loans and
thus the weighted average lives of and yields on the certificates of the related series.
 
Losses and Shortfalls on the Mortgage
Assets. The yield on your certificates will directly depend on the extent to which you are required to bear the effects of
any losses or shortfalls in collections arising out of defaults on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund and the timing
of those losses and shortfalls. In general, the earlier that any loss or shortfall occurs, the greater will be the negative effect
on yield for any class of certificates that is required to bear the effects of the shortfall.
 


45

 

 
The amount of any losses or shortfalls in
collections on the mortgage assets in any trust fund, to the extent not covered or offset by draws on any reserve fund or under
any instrument of credit support, will be allocated among the respective classes of certificates of the related series in the priority
and manner, and subject to the limitations, if so specified in the related prospectus supplement. As described in the related prospectus
supplement, those allocations may be effected by a reduction in the entitlements to interest and/or principal balances of one or
more classes of certificates, or by establishing a priority of payments among those classes of certificates.
 
The yield to maturity on a class of Subordinate
Certificates may be extremely sensitive to losses and shortfalls in collections on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund.
 
Additional Certificate Amortization.
In addition to entitling the holders of one or more classes of a series of certificates to a specified portion, which may during
specified periods range from none to all, of the principal payments received on the mortgage assets in the related trust fund,
one or more classes of certificates of any series, including one or more classes of offered certificates of those series, may provide
for distributions of principal of those certificates from:
 
1.      
amounts attributable to interest accrued but not currently distributable on one or more classes of accrual certificates,
 
2.      
Excess Funds, or
 
3.      
any other amounts described in the related prospectus supplement.
 
“Excess Funds” will,
in general, represent that portion of the amounts distributable in respect of the certificates of any series on any distribution
date that represent (1) interest received or advanced on the mortgage assets in the related trust fund that is in excess of
the interest currently accrued on the certificates of that series, or (2) Prepayment Premiums or any other amounts received
on the mortgage assets in the related trust fund that do not constitute interest on, or principal of, those certificates. The prospectus
supplement may describe certain variations in the calculation of Excess Funds that are applicable to a specific series.
 
The amortization of any class of certificates
out of the sources described in the preceding paragraph would shorten the weighted average life of those certificates and,
if those certificates were purchased at a premium, reduce the yield on those certificates. The related prospectus supplement will
discuss the relevant factors to be considered in determining whether distributions of principal of any class of certificates out
of those sources would have any material effect on the rate at which those certificates are amortized.
 
Optional Early Termination. If so
specified in the related prospectus supplement, a series of certificates may be subject to optional early termination through the
repurchase of the mortgage assets in the related trust fund by the party or parties specified in the related prospectus supplement,
under the circumstances and in the manner set forth in the prospectus supplement. If so provided in the related prospectus supplement,
upon the reduction of the principal balance of a specified class or classes of certificates by a specified percentage or amount,
the specified party may be authorized or required to solicit bids for the purchase of all of the mortgage assets of the related
trust fund, or of a sufficient portion of those mortgage assets to retire that class or classes, as set forth in the related prospectus
supplement. In the absence of other factors, any early retirement of a class of offered certificates would shorten the weighted
average life of those certificates and, if those certificates were purchased at premium, reduce the yield on those certificates.
 
THE
SPONSOR
 
The related prospectus supplement will identify
the sponsor or sponsors of the applicable series. JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“JPMCB”), a national
banking association, may be a sponsor (in such capacity, the “Sponsor”). JPMCB is a national bank and acquires
and originates
 


46

 

 
mortgage
loans for public and private securitizations as well as being a commercial bank offering a wide range of banking services to its
customers, both domestically and internationally. JPMCB is a wholly owned bank subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co., a Delaware
corporation whose principal office is located in New York, New York. JPMCB is chartered and its business is subject to examination
and regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
 
Additional information, including the most
recent Form 10-K and Annual Report of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and additional annual, quarterly and current reports filed or furnished
with the SEC by JPMorgan Chase & Co., as they become available, may be obtained without charge by each person to whom this
prospectus is delivered upon the written request of any such person to the Office of the Secretary, JPMorgan Chase & Co., 270
Park Avenue, New York, New York 10017 or at the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov.
 
JPMCB may also act as a Mortgage Asset Seller
and may act as Servicer and/or a provider of any cashflow agreements with respect to the offered certificates. JPMCB is an affiliate
of the Depositor and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC.
 
THE
DEPOSITOR
 
J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage
Securities Corp., the Depositor, is a Delaware corporation organized on September 19, 1994. The Depositor is a wholly owned
subsidiary of JPMCB. The Depositor maintains its principal office at 383 Madison Avenue, 31st Floor, New York, New York 10179.
Its telephone number is (212) 272-6858. The Depositor does not have, nor is it expected in the future to have, any significant
assets.
 
The Depositor purchases commercial mortgage
loans and interests in commercial mortgage loans for the purpose of selling those assets to trusts created in connection with the
securitization of pools of assets and does not engage in any activities unrelated thereto.
 
On December 22, 2009, the Depositor merged
with its affiliate, Bear Stearns Commercial Mortgage Securities Inc. Prior to the merger, Bear Stearns Commercial Mortgage Securities
Inc. separately purchased commercial mortgage loans and interests in commercial mortgage loans for the purpose of selling those
assets to trusts created in connection with the securitization of pools of assets. The Depositor is the surviving entity of the
merger.
 
The Depositor remains responsible under
the Pooling Agreement for providing the master servicer, special servicer and trustee with certain information and other assistance
requested by those parties and reasonably necessary to performing their duties under the Pooling Agreement. The Depositor also
remains responsible for mailing notices to the Certificateholders upon the appointment of certain successor entities under the
Pooling Agreement.
 
THE
ISSUING ENTITY
 
The Issuing Entity will be a New York common
law trust, formed on the closing date of each series of certificates pursuant to a Pooling Agreement. The trust will have no officers
or directors and no continuing duties other than to hold the assets underlying the certificates and to issue the certificates.
The Issuing Entity will operate under a fiscal year ending each December 31st. The trustee, the master servicer and
the special servicer are the persons authorized to act on behalf of the Issuing Entity under the Pooling Agreement with respect
to the mortgage loans and the certificates.
 
USE
OF PROCEEDS
 
We will apply the net proceeds to be received
from the sale of the certificates of any series to the purchase of trust assets. We expect to sell the certificates from time to
time, but the timing and amount of
 


47

 


 
offerings
of certificates will depend on a number of factors, including the volume of mortgage assets we have acquired, prevailing interest
rates, availability of funds and general market conditions.
 
DESCRIPTION
OF THE CERTIFICATES
 
General
 
Each series of certificates will represent
the entire beneficial ownership interest in a trust fund. As described in the related prospectus supplement, the certificates of
each series, including the offered certificates of that series, may consist of one or more classes of certificates that, among
other things:
 


·
provide for the accrual of interest on the certificates
at a fixed rate, variable rate or adjustable rate;




 
 




·
are senior (collectively, “Senior Certificates”)
or subordinate (collectively, “Subordinate Certificates”) to one or more other classes of certificates in entitlement
to certain distributions on the certificates;




 
 




·
are principal-only certificates entitled to distributions
of principal, with disproportionately small, nominal or no distributions of interest;




 
 




·
are interest-only certificates entitled to distributions
of interest, with disproportionately small, nominal or no distributions of principal;




 
 




·
provide for distributions of interest on, or principal
of, those certificates that commence only after the occurrence of certain events, such as the retirement of one or more other
classes of certificates of that series;




 
 




·
provide for distributions of principal of those certificates
to be made, from time to time or for designated periods, at a rate that is faster, and, in some cases, substantially faster, or
slower, and, in some cases, substantially slower, than the rate at which payments or other collections of principal are received
on the mortgage assets in the related trust fund;




 
 




·
provide for controlled distributions of principal
of those certificates to be made based on a specified payment schedule or other methodology, subject to available funds; or




 
 




·
provide for distributions based on collections of
Prepayment Premiums on the mortgage assets in the related trust fund.


 
Each class of offered certificates of a
series will be issued in minimum denominations corresponding to the principal balances or, in case of certain classes of interest-only
certificates or residual certificates, notional amounts or percentage interests, specified in the related prospectus supplement.
As provided in the related prospectus supplement, one or more classes of offered certificates of any series may be issued in fully
registered, definitive form (those certificates, “Definitive Certificates”) or may be offered in book-entry
format (those certificates, “Book-Entry Certificates”) through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company
(“DTC”). The offered certificates of each series (if issued as Definitive Certificates) may be transferred or
exchanged, subject to any restrictions on transfer described in the related prospectus supplement, at the location specified in
the related prospectus supplement, without the payment of any service charges, other than any tax or other governmental charge
payable in connection therewith. Interests in a class of Book-Entry Certificates will be transferred on the book-entry records
of DTC and its participating organizations. See “Risk Factors—Your Ability to Resell Certificates May Be Limited
Because of Their Characteristics” and “—Book-Entry System for Certain Classes May Decrease Liquidity
and Delay Payment” in this prospectus.
 


48

 

 
Distributions
 
Distributions on the certificates of each
series will be made on each distribution date as specified in the related prospectus supplement from the Available Distribution
Amount for that series and that distribution date. The “Available Distribution Amount” for any distribution
date will generally refer to the total of all payments or other collections on or in respect of the mortgage assets and any interest
rate or currency swap or interest rate cap, floor or collar contracts included in the related trust fund that are available for
distribution to the holders of certificates of that series on that date. The particular components of the Available Distribution
Amount for any series on each distribution date will be more specifically described in the related prospectus supplement.
 
Distributions on the certificates, other
than the final distribution in retirement of that certificate, will generally be made to the persons in whose names those certificates
are registered at the close of business on the last business day of the month preceding the month in which the applicable distribution
date occurs (the “Record Date”), and the amount of each distribution will be determined as of the close of business
on the Determination Date specified in the related prospectus supplement. The Record Date for each series will be set forth in
the related prospectus supplement. All distributions with respect to each class of certificates on each distribution date will
be allocated pro rata among the outstanding certificates in that class. Payments will be made either by wire transfer in immediately
available funds to your account at a bank or other entity having appropriate facilities for the transfer, if you have provided
the person required to make those payments with wiring instructions no later than the date specified in the related prospectus
supplement (and, if so provided in the related prospectus supplement, that you hold certificates in the amount or denomination
specified in the prospectus supplement), or by check mailed to the address of that certificateholder as it appears on the certificate
register; provided, however, that the final distribution in retirement of any class of certificates (whether Definitive Certificates
or Book-Entry Certificates) will be made only upon presentation and surrender of those certificates at the location specified in
the notice to certificateholders of the final distribution.
 
Distributions of Interest
on the Certificates
 
Each class of certificates of each series,
other than certain classes of principal-only certificates and residual certificates (“Residual Certificates”)
that have no pass-through interest rate, may have a different pass-through interest rate, which in each case may be fixed, variable
or adjustable. The related prospectus supplement will specify the pass-through interest rate or, in the case of a variable or adjustable
pass-through interest rate, the method for determining the pass-through interest rate, for each class. If so specified in the related
prospectus supplement, interest on the certificates of each series will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting
of twelve 30-day months.
 
Distributions of interest in respect of
any class of certificates (other than certain classes of certificates that will be entitled to distributions of accrued interest
commencing only on the distribution date, or under the circumstances specified in the related prospectus supplement (“Accrual
Certificates”), and other than any class of principal-only certificates or Residual Certificates which are not entitled
to distributions of interest) will be made on each distribution date based on the Accrued Certificate Interest for that class and
that distribution date, subject to the sufficiency of the portion of the Available Distribution Amount allocable to that class
on that distribution date. Prior to the time interest is distributable on any class of Accrual Certificates, the amount of Accrued
Certificate Interest otherwise distributable on that class will be added to the principal balance of those certificates on each
distribution date. With respect to each class of certificates, other than certain classes of interest-only certificates and certain
classes of residual certificates, the “Accrued Certificate Interest” for each distribution date will be equal
to interest at the applicable pass-through interest rate accrued for a specified period of time, or accrual period, generally corresponding
in length to the time period between distribution dates, on the outstanding principal balance of that class of certificates
immediately prior to that distribution date.
 


49

 

 
The Accrued Certificate Interest for each
distribution date on a class of interest-only certificates will be similarly calculated except that it will accrue on a notional
amount that is either:
 
1.      
based on the principal balances of some or all of the mortgage assets in the related trust fund,
 
2.      
equal to the principal balances of one or more other classes of certificates of the same series, or
 
3.      
an amount or amounts specified in the applicable prospectus supplement.
 
Reference to a notional amount with respect
to a class of interest-only certificates is solely for convenience in making certain calculations and does not represent the right
to receive any distributions of principal. If so specified in the related prospectus supplement, the amount of Accrued Certificate
Interest that is otherwise distributable on, or, in the case of Accrual Certificates, that may otherwise be added to the principal
balance of, one or more classes of the certificates of a series will be reduced to the extent that any Prepayment Interest Shortfalls,
as described under “Yield and Maturity Considerations—Certain Shortfalls in Collections of Interest” in
this prospectus, exceed the amount of any sums that are applied to offset the amount of those shortfalls. The particular manner
in which those shortfalls will be allocated among some or all of the classes of certificates of that series will be specified in
the related prospectus supplement. The related prospectus supplement will also describe the extent to which the amount of Accrued
Certificate Interest that is otherwise distributable on (or, in the case of Accrual Certificates, that may otherwise be added to
the principal balance of) a class of offered certificates may be reduced as a result of any other contingencies, including delinquencies,
losses and deferred interest on or in respect of the mortgage assets in the related trust fund. Any reduction in the amount of
Accrued Certificate Interest otherwise distributable on a class of certificates by reason of the allocation to that class of a
portion of any deferred interest on or in respect of the mortgage assets in the related trust fund may result in a corresponding
increase in the principal balance of that class if so specified in the related prospectus supplement. See “Risk Factors—Prepayments
of the Mortgage Assets Will Affect the Timing of Your Cash Flow and May Affect Your Yield” and “Yield and
Maturity Considerations” in this prospectus.
 
Determination of Interest
Rates
 
Day Count Basis; Interest Rate
Change Dates; Interest Rate Determination Dates. The prospectus supplement for each series of certificates will specify the
applicable interest rates (or the methods by which interest will be determined) and day count conventions for each class of certificates.
For any class of certificates that bears interest at (i) a LIBOR-based rate, interest due for any accrual period generally
will be determined on the basis of an Actual/360 day year, and (ii) a fixed rate, interest due for any accrual period will
be determined on the basis of a 30/360 day year. The applicable day count convention will be determined in accordance with prevailing
market conventions and existing market conditions, but generally will be limited to the following accrual methods:
 


·
“30/360” which means that interest
is calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months;




 
 




·
“Actual/360” which means that interest
or any other relevant factor is calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days;




 
 




·
“Actual/365 (fixed)” which means
that interest is calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 365 days, regardless of whether accrual
or payment occurs in a leap year;




 
 




·
“Actual/Actual (accrual basis)”
which means that interest is calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 365 days, or 366 days for
every day in a leap year;


 


50

 

 


·
“Actual/Actual (payment basis)”
which means that interest is calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 365 days if the interest
period ends in a non-leap year, or 366 days if the interest period ends in a leap year, as the case may be; and




 
 




·
“Actual/Actual (ISMA)” is a calculation
in accordance with the definition of “Actual/Actual” adopted by the International Securities Market Association (“ISMA”),
which means that interest is calculated on the following basis:


 


·
where the number of days in the relevant accrual period
is equal to or shorter than the determination period during which such accrual period ends, the number of days in such accrual
period divided by the product of (A) the number of days in such determination period and (B) the number of distribution dates
that would occur in one calendar year; or




 
 




·
where the accrual period is longer than the determination
period during which the accrual period ends, the sum of:


 


(1)
the number of days in such accrual period falling in
the determination period in which the accrual period begins divided by the product of (x) the number of days in such determination
period and (y) the number of distribution dates that would occur in one calendar year; and




 
 




(2)
the number of days in such accrual period falling in
the next determination period divided by the product of (x) the number of days in such determination period and (y) the number
of distribution dates that would occur in one calendar year;


 
where “determination period” means the period from
and including one calculation date to but excluding the next calculation date and “calculation date” means, in each
year, each of those days in the calendar year that are specified herein as being the scheduled distribution dates.
 
For any class of securities that bears interest
at a LIBOR-based rate, the related interest rate determination dates will be LIBOR Determination Dates, as described under “—LIBOR”
below.
 
LIBOR. The prospectus supplement
for a series of certificates will set forth the definition of LIBOR, and how LIBOR will be determined. In most cases, we expect
that LIBOR, for any accrual period, will be the London interbank offered rate for deposits in U.S. Dollars for a period equal to
one month, which appears on the Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page as of 11:00 a.m. London time, on the related LIBOR Determination
Date. If an applicable rate does not appear on The Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page, the rate for that accrual period will be determined
on the basis of the rates at which deposits in U.S. Dollars, are offered at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that LIBOR
Determination Date, to prime banks in the London interbank market by the Reference Banks and in an amount that is representative
for a single such transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time. The trustee, the paying agent or another person performing
similar functions will request the principal London office of each Reference Bank to provide a quotation of its rate. If the Reference
Banks provide at least two quotations, the rate for that accrual period will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations. If the Reference
Banks provide fewer than two quotations, the rate for that day will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted by major banks in
New York City, selected by the trustee, the paying agent or another person performing similar functions, at approximately 11:00
a.m. New York time, on that LIBOR Determination Date, for loans in U.S. Dollars to leading European banks and in an amount that
is representative for a single such transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time. If the Reference Banks are not providing
quotations, LIBOR in effect for the applicable accrual period will be LIBOR for the specified maturity in effect for the previous
accrual period.
 


51

 

 
For this purpose:
 


·
“LIBOR Determination Date” means,
for each accrual period, the second business day before the beginning of that accrual period unless another day is specified in
the related prospectus supplement.




 
 




·
“Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page” means
the display on the Reuters service, or any successor service, on the page designated as “LIBOR01” or any replacement
page or pages on which London interbank rates of major banks for the relevant index currency are displayed.




 
 




·
“Reference Banks” means four major
banks in the London interbank market selected by the trustee, the paying agent or another person performing similar functions.


 
For purposes of calculating LIBOR, a business
day is any day on which banks in New York City and the City of London are open for the transaction of international business.
 
Commercial Paper Rate. If certificates
of any series bear interest based on the commercial paper rate (the “Commercial Paper Rate”), the Commercial
Paper Rate for any relevant interest determination date will be the Bond Equivalent Yield shown below of the rate for 90-day commercial
paper, as published in H.15 (519) prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on that interest determination date under the heading
“Commercial Paper—Financial”.
 
If the commercial paper rate cannot be determined
as described above, the following procedures will be observed:
 


·
If the rate described above is not published in H.15
(519) by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on that interest determination date, unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate
was available from that source at that time, then the commercial paper rate will be the bond equivalent yield of the rate on the
relevant interest determination date, for commercial paper having a similar index maturity, as published in H.15 Daily Update
or any other recognized electronic source used for displaying that rate under the heading “Commercial Paper— Financial”.
The “Bond Equivalent Yield” will be calculated as follows:


 
Bond Equivalent
Yield =        N x D      	 x 100
                      
    360 (D × 90)
 
where “D” refers to the per
annum rate determined as set forth above, quoted on a bank discount basis and expressed as a decimal and “N” refers
to 365 or 366, as the case may be.
 


·
If the rate described in the prior paragraph cannot
be determined, the Commercial Paper Rate will remain the commercial paper rate then in effect on that interest determination date.


 


·
The Commercial Paper Rate will be subject to a lock-in
period of six New York City business days.


 
CMT Rate. If the certificates of
any series bear interest based on the Treasury constant maturity rate (the “CMT Rate”), the CMT Rate for any
relevant interest determination date will be the rate displayed on the applicable Designated CMT Reuters Page shown below by 3:00
p.m., New York City time, on that interest determination date under the caption “Treasury Constant Maturities Federal Reserve
Board Release H.15...Mondays Approximately 3:45 p.m.,” under the column for:
 


·
If the Designated CMT Reuters Page is the Reuters
Screen FRBCMT Page, the rate on that interest determination date; or


 


·
If the Designated CMT Reuters Page is the Reuters
Screen FEDCMT Page, the average for the month ended immediately before the week in which the related interest determination date
occurs.


 


52

 

 
For this purpose:
 
“Designated CMT Reuters Page”
means the Reuters page specified in the applicable prospectus supplement that displays treasury constant maturities as reported
in H.15 (519). If no Reuters page is so specified, then the applicable page will be the Reuters Screen FEDCMT Page. If the Reuters
Screen FEDCMT Page applies but the applicable prospectus supplement does not specify whether the weekly or monthly average applies,
the weekly average will apply.
 
“Reuters Screen FEDCMT page”
means the display on the Reuters service, or any successor service, on the page designated as “FEDCMT” or any replacement
page or pages on which CMT Rates are displayed.
 
“Reuters Screen FRBCMT Page”
means the display on the Reuters service, or any successor service, on the page designated as “FRBCMT” or any replacement
page or pages on which CMT Rates are displayed.
 
The following procedures will apply if the
CMT Rate cannot be determined as described above:
 


·
If the rate described above is not displayed on the
relevant page by 3:00 p.m., New York City time on that interest determination date, unless the calculation is made earlier and
the rate is available from that source at that time on that interest determination date, then the CMT Rate will be the Treasury
constant maturity rate having the designated index maturity, as published in H.15 (519) or another recognized electronic source
for displaying the rate.




 
 




·
If the applicable rate described above is not published
in H.15 (519) or another recognized electronic source for displaying such rate by 3:00 p.m., New York City time on that interest
determination date, unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate is available from one of those sources at that time, then
the CMT Rate will be the Treasury constant maturity rate, or other United States Treasury rate, for the index maturity and with
reference to the relevant interest determination date, that is published by either the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System or the United States Department of the Treasury and that the trustee, the paying agent or another person performing similar
functions determines to be comparable to the rate formerly displayed on the Designated CMT Reuters Page shown above and published
in H.15 (519).




 
 




·
If the rate described in the prior paragraph cannot
be determined, then the CMT Rate will be determined to be a yield to maturity based on the average of the secondary market closing
offered rates as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the relevant interest determination date reported, according
to their written records, by leading primary United States government securities dealers in New York City. The trustee, the paying
agent or another person performing similar functions will select five such securities dealers and will eliminate the highest and
lowest quotations or, in the event of equality, one of the highest and lowest quotations, for the most recently issued direct
nonmalleable fixed rate obligations of the United States Treasury (“Treasury Notes”) with an original maturity
of approximately the designated index maturity and a remaining term to maturity of not less than the designated index maturity
minus one year in a representative amount.




 
 




·
If three Treasury Note quotations of the kind described
in the prior paragraph cannot be obtained, the CMT Rate will be determined to be the yield to maturity based on the average of
the secondary market bid rates for Treasury Notes with an original maturity longer than the designated CMT index maturity which
have a remaining term to maturity closest to the designated CMT index maturity and in a representative amount, as of approximately
3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the relevant interest determination date of leading primary United States government securities
dealers in New York City. In selecting these offered rates, the trustee, the paying agent or another person performing similar
functions will request quotations from at least five such securities dealers and will disregard the highest quotation (or if there
is equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or if there is equality, one of the lowest). If two Treasury 


 


53

 

 


 
 
Notes
with an original maturity longer than the designated CMT index maturity have remaining terms to maturity that are equally close
to the designated CMT index maturity, quotations will be obtained for the Treasury Note with the shorter remaining term to maturity.



 
 




·
If three or four but not five leading primary United
States government securities dealers are quoting as described in the prior paragraph, then the CMT Rate for the relevant interest
determination date will be based on the average of the bid rates obtained and neither the highest nor the lowest of those quotations
will be eliminated.




 
 




·
If fewer than three of the selected leading primary
United States government securities dealers selected are quoting as described above, the CMT Rate will remain the CMT Rate then
in effect on that interest determination date.


 
Federal Funds Rate. If the certificates
of any series bear interest based on the federal funds rate (the “Federal Funds Rate”), the Federal Funds Rate
for any relevant interest determination date will be the rate for U.S. dollar Federal funds, as published in H.15 (519) for that
day opposite the caption “Federal Funds (Effective)” as that rate is displayed on that interest determination date
on the display on the Reuters service, or any successor service, on the page designated as “FEDFUNDS1” or any replacement
page or pages on which U.S. dollar federal funds rates are displayed (the “Reuters Screen FEDFUNDS1 Page”) under
the heading “EFFECT”. The following procedures will be observed if the Federal Funds Rate cannot be determined as described
above:
 


·
If the rate described above does not appear on Reuters
Screen FEDFUNDS1 Page or is not yet published in H.15 (519) by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on that interest determination date,
unless the calculation is made earlier and the rate was available from that source at that time, then the Federal funds rate for
the relevant interest determination date will be the rate described above in H.15 Daily Update, or any other recognized electronic
source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, opposite the heading “Federal Funds (Effective)”.




 
 




·
If the rate described above does not appear on Reuters
Screen FEDFUNDS1 Page or is not yet published in H.15 (519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source for displaying
such rate by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on that interest determination date, the Federal Funds Rate for that interest determination
date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for the last transaction in overnight U.S. Dollar Federal funds arranged by three
leading brokers of Federal Funds transactions in New York City, selected by the trustee, the paying agent or another person performing
similar functions, on that interest determination date.




 
 




·
If fewer than three of the selected brokers are quoting
as described above, the Federal Funds Rate will remain the Federal Funds Rate then in effect on the relevant interest determination
date.


 
91-day Treasury Bill Rate. If the
certificates of any series bear interest at the 91-day Treasury Bill Rate (the “91-day Treasury Bill Rate”),
the 91-day Treasury Bill Rate for any relevant interest determination date will be the rate equal to the weighted average per annum
discount rate (expressed as a bond equivalent yield and applied on a daily basis) for direct obligations of the United States with
a maturity of thirteen weeks (“91-day Treasury Bills”) sold at the applicable 91-day Treasury Bill auction,
as published in H.15 (519) or otherwise or as reported by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
 
In the event that the results of the auctions
of 91-day Treasury Bills cease to be published or reported as provided above, or that no 91-day Treasury Bill auction is held in
a particular week, then the 91-day Treasury Bill Rate in effect as a result of the last such publication or report will remain
in effect until such time, if any, as the results of auctions of 91-day Treasury Bills will again be so published or reported or
such auction is held, as the case may be.
 
The 91-day Treasury Bill Rate will be subject
to a lock-in period of six New York City business days.
 
Prime Rate. If certificates of any
series bear interest based on the prime rate (the “Prime Rate”), the Prime Rate for any relevant interest determination
date is the prime rate or base lending rate on that date,
 


54

 

 
as published
in H.15 (519), prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on that interest determination date under the heading “Bank Prime
Loan.”
 
The following procedures will be observed
if the Prime Rate cannot be determined as described above:
 


·
If the rate described above is not published in H.15
(519) prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the relevant interest determination date, unless the calculation is made earlier
and the rate was available from that source at that time, then the Prime Rate will be the rate for that interest determination
date, as published in H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source for displaying such rate opposite the caption
“Bank Prime Loan.”




 
 




·
If the above rate is not published in either H.15
(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source for displaying such rate by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on
the relevant interest determination date, then the trustee, the paying agent or another person performing similar functions will
determine the Prime Rate to be the average of the rates of interest publicly announced by each bank that appears on the display
on the Reuters service, or any successor service, on the page designated as “US PRIME 1” or any replacement page or
pages on which prime rates or base lending rates of major U.S. banks are displayed (the “Reuters Screen US PRIME 1 Page”),
as that bank’s prime rate or base lending rate as in effect on that interest determination date.




 
 




·
If fewer than four rates appear on the Reuters Screen
US PRIME 1 Page on the relevant interest determination date, then the Prime Rate will be the average of the prime rates or base
lending rates quoted, on the basis of the actual number of days in the year divided by a 360-day year, as of the close of business
on that interest determination date by three major banks in New York City selected by the trustee, the paying agent or another
person performing similar functions.




 
 




·
If the selected banks are not quoting as mentioned
above, the Prime Rate will remain the prime rate then in effect on that interest determination date.


 
Distributions of Principal
on the Certificates
 
Each class of certificates of each series,
other than certain classes of interest-only certificates and Residual Certificates, will have a principal balance which, at any
time, will equal the then maximum amount that the holders of certificates of that class will be entitled to receive in respect
of principal out of the future cash flow on the mortgage assets and any interest rate or currency swap or interest rate cap, floor
or collar contracts included in the related trust fund. The outstanding principal balance of a class of certificates will be reduced
by distributions of principal made on the certificates from time to time and, if so provided in the related prospectus supplement,
further by any losses incurred in respect of the related mortgage assets allocated thereto from time to time. In turn, the outstanding
principal balance of a class of certificates may be increased as a result of any deferred interest on or in respect of the related
mortgage assets being allocated to that class from time to time, and will be increased, in the case of a class of Accrual Certificates
prior to the distribution date on which distributions of interest on the certificates are required to commence, by the amount of
any Accrued Certificate Interest in respect of those certificates (reduced as described above). The initial principal balance of
each class of a series of certificates will be specified in the related prospectus supplement. As described in the related prospectus
supplement, distributions of principal with respect to a series of certificates will be made on each distribution date to the holders
of the class or classes of certificates of that series entitled thereto until the principal balances of those certificates have
been reduced to zero. Distributions of principal with respect to one or more classes of certificates may be made at a rate that
is faster, and, in some cases, substantially faster, than the rate at which payments or other collections of principal are received
on the mortgage assets in the related trust fund. Distributions of principal with respect to one or more classes of certificates
may not commence until the occurrence of certain events, including the retirement of one or more other classes of certificates
of the same series, or may be made at a rate that is slower, and, in some cases, substantially slower, than the rate at which payments
or other collections of principal are
 


55

 

 
received
on the mortgage assets in the related trust fund. Distributions of principal with respect to one or more classes of certificates
may be made, subject to available funds, based on a specified principal payment schedule. Distributions of principal with respect
to one or more classes of certificates may be contingent on the specified principal payment schedule for another class of the
same series and the rate at which payments and other collections of principal on the mortgage assets in the related trust fund
are received. If so specified in the related prospectus supplement, distributions of principal of any class of offered certificates
will be made on a pro rata basis among all of the certificates of that class.
 
Distributions on the Certificates
in Respect of Prepayment Premiums
 
If so provided in the related prospectus
supplement, Prepayment Premiums received on or in connection with the mortgage assets in any trust fund will be distributed on
each distribution date to the holders of the class of certificates of the related series entitled thereto in accordance with the
provisions described in that prospectus supplement.
 
Allocation of Losses and
Shortfalls
 
The amount of any losses or shortfalls in
collections on the mortgage assets in any trust fund, to the extent not covered or offset by draws on any reserve fund or under
any instrument of credit support, will be allocated among the respective classes of certificates of the related series in the priority
and manner, and subject to the limitations, specified in the related prospectus supplement. As described in the related prospectus
supplement, those allocations may be effected by a reduction in the entitlements to interest and/or principal balances of one or
more classes of certificates, or by establishing a priority of payments among the classes of certificates.
 
Advances in Respect of Delinquencies
 
If provided in the related prospectus supplement,
if a trust fund includes mortgage loans, the master servicer, a special servicer, the trustee, any provider of credit support and/or
any other specified person may be obligated to advance, or have the option of advancing, on or before each distribution date, from
its or their own funds or from excess funds held in the related certificate account that are not part of the Available Distribution
Amount for the related series of certificates for that distribution date, an amount up to the aggregate of any payments of principal,
other than any balloon payments, and interest that were due on or in respect of those mortgage loans during the related Due Period
and were delinquent on the related Determination Date.
 
In addition, if a trust fund includes mortgage
loans, the master servicer, a special servicer, the trustee, any provider of credit support and/or any other specified person may
be obligated to advance, or have the option of advancing, in respect of any mortgage loan in connection with the servicing and
administration of any related Mortgaged Property or REO Property, amounts necessary to pay delinquent real estate taxes, assessments
and hazard insurance premiums, and to cover other similar costs and expenses necessary to preserve the priority of or enforce the
related mortgage loan documents, or to protect, lease, manage and maintain the related Mortgaged Property or REO Property, as described
in the related prospectus supplement.
 
Advances are intended to maintain a regular
flow of scheduled interest and principal payments to holders of the class or classes of certificates entitled thereto, rather than
to guarantee or insure against losses. Accordingly, all advances made out of a specific entity’s own funds will be reimbursable
out of related recoveries on the mortgage loans, including amounts received under any instrument of credit support, respecting
which those advances were made (as to any mortgage loan, “Related Proceeds”) and those other specific sources
as may be identified in the related prospectus supplement, including in the case of a series that includes one or more classes
of Subordinate Certificates, collections on other mortgage loans in the related trust fund that would otherwise be distributable
to the holders of one or more classes of those Subordinate Certificates. No advance will be required to be made by a master servicer,
special servicer or trustee if, in the good faith judgment of the master servicer, special servicer or trustee, as the case may
be, that advance would not be recoverable from Related Proceeds or another
 


56

 

 
specifically
identified source (each, a “Nonrecoverable Advance”); and, if previously made by a master servicer, special
servicer or trustee, a Nonrecoverable Advance will be reimbursable to the advancing party from any amounts in the related certificate
account prior to any distributions being made to the related series of certificateholders.
 
If advances have been made by a master servicer,
special servicer, trustee or other entity from excess funds in a certificate account, the advancing party will be required to replace
those funds in that certificate account on any future distribution date to the extent that funds in that certificate account on
that distribution date are less than payments required to be made to the related series of certificateholders on that date. If
so specified in the related prospectus supplement, the obligation of a master servicer, special servicer, trustee or other entity
to make advances may be secured by a cash advance reserve fund or a surety bond. If applicable, information regarding the characteristics
of a surety bond, and the identity of any obligor on that surety bond, will be set forth in the related prospectus supplement.
 
If so provided in the related prospectus
supplement, any entity making advances will be entitled to receive interest on those advances for the period that those advances
are outstanding at the rate specified in that prospectus supplement, and that entity will be entitled to payment of that interest
periodically from general collections on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund prior to any payment to the related series
of certificateholders or as described in the prospectus supplement.
 
The prospectus supplement for any series
of certificates evidencing an interest in a trust fund that includes MBS will describe any comparable advancing obligation.
 
Exchangeable Certificates
 
If specified in the related prospectus supplement,
a series of certificates may include one or more classes that are “exchangeable certificates” (“Exchangeable
Certificates”). In any of these series, the holders of one or more of the classes of Exchangeable Certificates will be
entitled, after notice and, to the extent set forth in the related prospectus supplement, payment to the trustee of an exchange
fee, to exchange all or a portion of those classes of Exchangeable Certificates for proportionate interests in one or more other
specified classes of Exchangeable Certificates in such series.
 
If a series includes Exchangeable Certificates
as described in the related prospectus supplement, all of these classes of Exchangeable Certificates will be listed in the related
prospectus supplement. The classes of certificates that are exchangeable for one another will be referred to in the related prospectus
supplement as “related” to each other, and each related grouping of Exchangeable Certificates will be referred to as
a “combination.” Each combination of Exchangeable Certificates will be issued by the related Trust Fund. At any time
after their initial issuance, any class of Exchangeable Certificates may be exchanged for the related class or classes of Exchangeable
Certificates. In some cases, multiple classes of Exchangeable Certificates may be exchanged for one or more classes of related
Exchangeable Certificates.
 
The descriptions in the related prospectus
supplement of the certificates of a series that includes Exchangeable Certificates, including descriptions of principal and interest
distributions, registration and denomination of certificates, credit enhancement, yield and prepayment considerations, tax and
legal investment considerations and considerations of ERISA also will apply to each class of Exchangeable Certificates. The related
prospectus supplement will separately describe the yield and prepayment considerations applicable to, and the risks of investment
in each class of Exchangeable Certificates. For example, separate decrement tables and yield tables, if applicable, will be included
for each class of Exchangeable Certificates.
 
Exchanges. If a holder of Exchangeable
Certificates elects to exchange its Exchangeable Certificates for related Exchangeable Certificates, then:
 


·
the aggregate principal balance of the related Exchangeable
Certificates received in the exchange, immediately after the exchange, will equal the aggregate principal balance, immediately
prior to the exchange, of the Exchangeable Certificates so exchanged (for purposes 


 


57

 

 


 
 
of an exchange, interest-only classes of Exchangeable
Certificates will have a principal balance of zero);



 
 




·
the aggregate amount of interest distributable on
each distribution date with respect to the related Exchangeable Certificates received in the exchange will equal the aggregate
amount of interest distributable on each distribution date with respect to the Exchangeable Certificates so exchanged; and




 
 




·
the class or classes of Exchangeable Certificates
will be exchanged in the applicable proportions, if any, described in the related prospectus supplement.


 
Different types of combinations may exist.
Any individual series of certificates may have multiple types of combinations. Some examples of combinations of Exchangeable Certificates
that differ in their interest characteristics include:
 


·
A class of Exchangeable Certificates with an interest
rate that varies directly with changes in an index and a class of Exchangeable Certificates with an interest rate that varies
indirectly with changes in the index may be exchangeable, together, for a related class of Exchangeable Certificates with a fixed
interest rate. In such a combination, the classes of Exchangeable Certificates with interest rates that vary with an index would
produce, in the aggregate, an annual interest amount equal to that generated by the related class of Exchangeable Certificates
with a fixed interest rate. In addition, the aggregate principal balance of the two classes of Exchangeable Certificates with
interest rates that vary with an index would equal the aggregate principal balance of the related class of Exchangeable Certificates
with the fixed interest rate.




 
 




·
An interest-only class and a principal-only class
of Exchangeable Certificates may be exchangeable, together, for a related class of Exchangeable Certificates that is entitled
to both principal and interest distributions. In such a combination, the aggregate principal balance of the related class would
be equal to the aggregate principal balance of the principal-only class of Exchangeable Certificates, and the interest rate on
the related class, when applied to the aggregate principal balance of this related class, would generate interest equal to the
annual interest amount of the interest-only class of Exchangeable Certificates.




 
 




·
Two or more classes of principal and interest classes
of Exchangeable Certificates with different fixed interest rates may be exchangeable, together, for a single class of related
Exchangeable Certificates that is entitled to both principal and interest distributions. In such a combination, the aggregate
principal balance of the single class of related Exchangeable Certificates would be equal to the aggregate principal balance of
the two or more classes of Exchangeable Certificates, and the single class of related Exchangeable Certificates would have a fixed
interest rate that, when applied to the principal balance of the single class of Exchangeable Certificates, would generate interest
equal to the aggregate annual interest amount of the two or more classes of Exchangeable Certificates.


 
In some series, a Certificateholder may
be able to exchange its Exchangeable Certificates for other related Exchangeable Certificates that have different principal distribution
characteristics. Some examples of combinations of Exchangeable Certificates that differ in the principal distribution characteristics
include:
 


·
A class of Exchangeable Certificates that accretes
all of its interest for a specified period, with the accreted amount added to the aggregate principal balance of the class of
Exchangeable Certificates, and a second class of Exchangeable Certificates that receives principal distributions from these accretions,
may be exchangeable, together, for a single class of related Exchangeable Certificates that receives distributions of interest
continuously from the first distribution date on which it receives interest until it is retired.




 
 




·
A class of Exchangeable Certificates that is a planned
amortization class, and a class of Exchangeable Certificates that only receives principal distributions on a distribution date
if 


 


58

 

 


 
 
scheduled payments have been made on the planned amortization class, may be exchangeable, together, for a class of related
Exchangeable Certificates that receives principal distributions without regard to the planned amortization schedule for the planned
amortization class from the first distribution date on which it receives principal until it is retired.

 
A number of factors may limit the ability
of a holder of Exchangeable Certificates to effect an exchange. For example, the Certificateholder must own, at the time of the
proposed exchange, the class or classes of Exchangeable Certificates necessary to make the exchange in the necessary proportions.
If a Certificateholder does not own the necessary classes of Exchangeable Certificates or does not own the necessary classes of
Exchangeable Certificates in the proper proportions, the Certificateholder may not be able to obtain the desired classes of Exchangeable
Certificates. The Certificateholder desiring to make the exchange may not be able to purchase the necessary class of Exchangeable
Certificates from the then current owner at a reasonable price, or the necessary proportion of the needed class of Exchangeable
Certificates may no longer be available due to principal payments or prepayments that have been applied to that class of Exchangeable
Certificates.
 
Procedures. The related prospectus
supplement will describe the procedures that must be followed to make an exchange of Exchangeable Certificates. A Certificateholder
will be required to provide notice to the trustee prior to the proposed exchange date within the time period specified in the related
prospectus supplement. The notice must include the outstanding principal or notional amount of the Exchangeable Certificates to
be exchanged and the related securities to be received, and the proposed exchange date. When the trustee receives this notice,
it will provide instructions to the Certificateholder regarding delivery of the Exchangeable Certificates and, to the extent set
forth in the related prospectus supplement, payment of the exchange fee. A Certificateholder’s notice to the trustee will
become irrevocable on the second business day prior to the proposed exchange date specified in the related prospectus supplement.
Any Exchangeable Certificates in book-entry form will be subject to the rules, regulations and procedures applicable to DTC’s
book entry securities.
 
If the related prospectus supplement describes
exchange proportions for a combination of classes of Exchangeable Certificates, these proportions will be based on the original,
rather than the outstanding, principal or notional amounts of these classes.
 
Distributions on an Exchangeable Certificate
received in an exchange will be made as described in the related prospectus supplement. Distributions will be made to the Certificateholder
of record as of the applicable record date.
 
Reports to Certificateholders
 
On each distribution date, together with
the distribution to the holders of each class of the offered certificates of a series, a master servicer or trustee, as provided
in the related prospectus supplement, will forward to each holder a statement (a “Distribution Date Statement”)
that will set forth, among other things, in each case to the extent applicable:
 


·
the amount of that distribution to holders of that
class of offered certificates that was applied to reduce the principal balance of those certificates, expressed as a dollar amount
per minimum denomination of the relevant class of offered certificates or per a specified portion of that minimum denomination;




 
 




·
the amount of that distribution to holders of that
class of offered certificates that is allocable to Accrued Certificate Interest, expressed as a dollar amount per minimum denomination
of the relevant class of offered certificates or per a specified portion of that minimum denomination;




 
 




·
the amount, if any, of that distribution to holders
of that class of offered certificates that is allocable to Prepayment Premiums expressed as a dollar amount per minimum denomination
of the relevant class of offered certificates or per a specified portion of that minimum denomination;


 


59

 

 


·
the amount, if any, by which that distribution is
less than the amounts to which holders of that class of offered certificates are entitled;




 
 




·
if the related trust fund includes mortgage loans,
the aggregate amount of advances included in that distribution;




 
 




·
if the related trust fund includes mortgage loans,
the amount of servicing compensation received by the related master servicer (and, if payable directly out of the related trust
fund, by any special servicer and any sub-servicer) and other customary information as the reporting party deems necessary or
desirable, or that a certificateholder reasonably requests, to enable certificateholders to prepare their tax returns;




 
 




·
information regarding the aggregate principal balance
of the related mortgage assets on or about that distribution date;




 
 




·
if the related trust fund includes mortgage loans,
information regarding the number and aggregate principal balance of those mortgage loans that are delinquent in varying degrees;




 
 




·
if the related trust fund includes mortgage loans,
information regarding the aggregate amount of losses incurred and principal prepayments made with respect to those mortgage loans
during the specified period, generally equal in length to the time period between distribution dates, during which prepayments
and other unscheduled collections on the mortgage loans in the related trust fund must be received in order to be distributed
on a particular distribution date;




 
 




·
the principal balance or notional amount, as the case
may be, of each class of certificates (including any class of certificates not offered hereby) at the close of business on that
distribution date, separately identifying any reduction in that principal balance or notional amount due to the allocation of
any losses in respect of the related mortgage assets, any increase in that principal balance or notional amount due to the allocation
of any negative amortization in respect of the related mortgage assets and any increase in the principal balance of a class of
Accrual Certificates, if any, in the event that Accrued Certificate Interest has been added to that balance;




 
 




·
if the class of offered certificates has a variable
pass-through interest rate or an adjustable pass-through interest rate, the pass-through interest rate applicable to that class
for that distribution date and, if determinable, for the next succeeding distribution date;




 
 




·
the amount deposited in or withdrawn from any reserve
fund on that distribution date, and the amount remaining on deposit in that reserve fund as of the close of business on that distribution
date;




 
 




·
if the related trust fund includes one or more instruments
of credit support, like a letter of credit, an insurance policy and/or a surety bond, the amount of coverage under that instrument
as of the close of business on that distribution date; and




 
 




·
to the extent not otherwise reflected through the
information furnished as described above, the amount of credit support being afforded by any classes of Subordinate Certificates.


 
The prospectus supplement for each series
of certificates may describe variations or additions to the type of information to be included in reports to the holders of the
offered certificates of that series.
 
Within a reasonable period of time after
the end of each calendar year, the master servicer or trustee for a series of certificates, as the case may be, will be required
to furnish to each person who at any time during the calendar year was a holder of an offered certificate of that series a statement
containing the information set forth in the first three categories described above, aggregated for that calendar year or the applicable
portion of that year during which that person was a certificateholder. This obligation will be deemed to have been satisfied to
the extent that substantially comparable information is provided pursuant to any requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the “Code”), as are
 


60

 

 
from time
to time in force. See, however, “Description of the Certificates—Book-Entry Registration and Definitive Certificates”
in this prospectus.
 
If the trust fund for a series of certificates
includes MBS, the ability of the related master servicer or trustee, as the case may be, to include in any Distribution Date Statement
information regarding the mortgage loans underlying that MBS will depend on the reports received with respect to that MBS. In those
cases, the related prospectus supplement will describe the loan-specific information to be included in the distribution date statements
that will be forwarded to the holders of the offered certificates of that series in connection with distributions made to them.
 
Voting Rights
 
The voting rights evidenced by each series
of certificates will be allocated among the respective classes of that series in the manner described in the related prospectus
supplement.
 
Certificateholders will generally not have
a right to vote, except with respect to required consents to certain amendments to the agreement pursuant to which the certificates
are issued and as specified in the related prospectus supplement. See “Description of the Pooling Agreements—Amendment”
in this prospectus. The holders of specified amounts of certificates of a particular series will have the right to act as a group to
remove the related trustee and also upon the occurrence of certain events which if continuing would constitute a termination event
with respect to the related master servicer. See “Description of the Pooling Agreements—Servicer Termination Events,”
and “—Resignation and Removal of the Trustee” in this prospectus.
 
Termination
 
The obligations created by the pooling and
servicing or other agreement creating a series of certificates will terminate following:
 


·
the final payment or other liquidation of the last
mortgage asset underlying the series or the disposition of all property acquired upon foreclosure of any mortgage loan underlying
the series, and




 
 




·
the payment to the certificateholders of the series
of all amounts required to be paid to them.


 
Written notice of termination will be given
to each certificateholder of the related series, and the final distribution will be made only upon presentation and surrender of
the certificates of that series at the location to be specified in the notice of termination.
 
If so specified in the related prospectus
supplement, a series of certificates may be subject to optional early termination through the repurchase of the mortgage assets
in the related trust fund by the party or parties specified in the prospectus supplement, in the manner set forth in the prospectus
supplement. If so provided in the related prospectus supplement, upon the reduction of the principal balance of a specified class
or classes of certificates by a specified percentage or amount, a party designated in the prospectus supplement may be authorized
or required to bid for or solicit bids for the purchase of all the mortgage assets of the related trust fund, or of a sufficient
portion of those mortgage assets to retire those class or classes, in the manner set forth in the prospectus supplement.
 
Book-Entry Registration and
Definitive Certificates
 
If so provided in the prospectus supplement
for a series of certificates, one or more classes of the offered certificates of that series will be offered in book-entry format
through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company, and that class will be represented by one or more global certificates registered
in the name of DTC or its nominee.
 
DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized
under the New York Banking Law, a “banking corporation” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of
the Federal Reserve System,
 


61

 

 
a “clearing
corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered
pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participating organizations
(“Participants”) and facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between Participants
through electronic computerized book-entry changes in their accounts, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities
certificates. “Direct Participants”, which maintain accounts with DTC, include securities brokers and dealers,
banks, trust companies and clearing corporations and may include certain other organizations. DTC is owned by a number of its
Direct Participants and by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the American Stock Exchange, Inc. and the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. Access to the DTC system also is available to others like banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies
that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect
Participants”).
 
Purchases of Book-Entry Certificates under
the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the Book-Entry Certificates on DTC’s
records.
 
The ownership interest of each actual purchaser
of a Book-Entry Certificate (a “Certificate Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’
records. Certificate Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchases, but Certificate Owners are expected
to receive written confirmations providing details of those transactions, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from
the Direct or Indirect Participant through which each Certificate Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interest
in the Book-Entry Certificates are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Participants acting on behalf of Certificate
Owners. Certificate Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in the Book-Entry Certificates,
except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Book-Entry Certificates of any series is discontinued as described
below.
 
DTC has no knowledge of the actual Certificate
Owners of the Book-Entry Certificates; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts
those certificates are credited, which may or may not be the Certificate Owners. The Participants will remain responsible for keeping
account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.
 
Conveyance of notices and other communications
by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants
to Certificate Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be
in effect from time to time.
 
Distributions on the Book-Entry Certificates
will be made to DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit Direct Participants’ accounts on the related distribution date in
accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records unless DTC has reason to believe that it will not receive
payment on that date. Disbursement of those distributions by Participants to Certificate Owners will be governed by standing instructions
and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street
name,” and will be the responsibility of that Participant (and not of DTC, the Depositor or any trustee or master servicer),
subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Under a book-entry system, Certificate
Owners may receive payments after the related distribution date.
 
Generally, with respect to Book-Entry Certificates,
the only certificateholder of record will be the nominee of DTC, and the Certificate Owners will not be recognized as certificateholders
under the agreement pursuant to which the certificates are issued. Certificate Owners will be permitted to exercise the rights
of certificateholders under that agreement only indirectly through the Participants who in turn will exercise their rights through
DTC. The Depositor is informed that DTC will take action permitted to be taken by a certificateholder under that agreement only
at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account with DTC interests in the Book-Entry Certificates are credited.
 
Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants,
who in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants and certain Certificate Owners, the ability of a Certificate Owner to pledge
its interest in Book-Entry Certificates to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions
in
 


62

 

 
respect
of its interest in Book-Entry Certificates, may be limited due to the lack of a physical certificate evidencing that interest.
 
If so specified in the related prospectus
supplement, certificates initially issued in book-entry form will be issued as Definitive Certificates to Certificate Owners or
their nominees, rather than to DTC or its nominee, only if
 


·
the Depositor advises the trustee in writing that
DTC is no longer willing or able to discharge properly its responsibilities as depository with respect to those certificates and
the Depositor is unable to locate a qualified successor or




 
 




·
the Depositor notifies DTC of its intent to terminate
the book-entry system through DTC and, upon receipt of notice of such intent from DTC, the Participants holding beneficial interests
in the Book-Entry Certificates agree to initiate such termination.




 
 


Upon the occurrence of either of the events
described above, DTC will be required to notify all Participants of the availability through DTC of Definitive Certificates. Upon
surrender by DTC of the certificate or certificates representing a class of Book-Entry Certificates, together with instructions
for registration, the trustee for the related series or other designated party will be required to issue to the Certificate Owners
identified in those instructions the Definitive Certificates to which they are entitled, and thereafter the holders of those Definitive
Certificates will be recognized as certificateholders of record under the related agreement pursuant to which the certificates
are issued.
 
Transfers between Participants of Euroclear
Bank, as operator of the Euroclear System, in Europe (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, société
anonyme (“Clearstream”) will occur in accordance with their applicable rules and operating procedures.
 
Cross-market transfers between persons holding
directly or indirectly through DTC, on the one hand, and directly through Clearstream Participants or Euroclear Participants, on
the other, will be effected in DTC in accordance with DTC rules on behalf of the relevant European international clearing system
by its Depository; however, these cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to the relevant European international
clearing system by the counterparty in that system in accordance with its rules and procedures. If the transaction complies with
all relevant requirements, Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will then deliver instructions to the Depository to take
action to effect final settlement on its behalf.
 
Because of time-zone differences, it is
possible that credits of securities in Clearstream or Euroclear as a result of a transaction with a DTC Participant will be made
during the subsequent securities settlement processing, dated the business day following the DTC settlement date, and those credits
or any transactions in those securities settled during this processing will be reported to the relevant Clearstream Participant
or Euroclear Participant on that business day. Cash received in Clearstream or Euroclear as a result of sales of securities by
or through a Clearstream Participant or a Euroclear Participant to a DTC Participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement
date but, due to time-zone differences, may be available in the relevant Clearstream or Euroclear cash account only as of the business
day following settlement in DTC.
 
Certificate Owners that are not Direct or
Indirect Participants but desire to purchase, sell or otherwise transfer ownership of, or other interests in, the offered certificates
may do so only through Direct and Indirect Participants. In addition, Certificate Owners will receive all distributions of principal
of and interest on the offered certificates from the Trustee through DTC and its Direct and Indirect Participants. Accordingly,
Certificate Owners may experience delays in their receipt of payments, since those payments will be forwarded by the Trustee to
Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. DTC will forward those payments to its Participants, which thereafter will forward them to Indirect
Participants or beneficial owners of offered certificates. Except as otherwise provided under “Description of the Certificates—Reports
to Certificateholders; Certain Available Information” in the related prospectus supplement, Certificate Owners will not
be recognized by the Trustee, the Special Servicer or the Master Servicer as holders of record of Certificates and Certificate
Owners will be permitted to receive information furnished
 


63

 

 
to Certificateholders
and to exercise the rights of Certificateholders only indirectly through DTC and its Direct and Indirect Participants.
 
Under the rules, regulations and procedures
creating and affecting DTC and its operations (the “Rules”), DTC is required to make book entry transfers of the offered
certificates among Participants and to receive and transmit distributions of principal of, and interest on, the offered certificates.
Direct and Indirect Participants with which Certificate Owners have accounts with respect to the offered certificates similarly
are required to make book entry transfers and receive and transmit the distributions on behalf of their respective Certificate
Owners. Accordingly, although Certificate Owners will not possess physical certificates evidencing their interests in the offered
certificates, the Rules provide a mechanism by which Certificate Owners, through their Direct and Indirect Participants, will receive
distributions and will be able to transfer their interests in the offered certificates.
 
Because DTC can only act on behalf of Participants,
who in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants and certain banks, the ability of Certificateholders to pledge the Certificates
to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC system, or to otherwise act with respect to the Certificates, may be
limited due to the lack of a physical certificate for the Certificates.
 
DTC has advised the Depositor that it will
take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of an offered certificate under the Pooling Agreement only at the direction of
one or more Participants to whose accounts with DTC the offered certificates are credited. DTC may take conflicting actions with
respect to other undivided interests to the extent that those actions are taken on behalf of Participants whose holdings include
the undivided interests.
 
Securities clearance accounts and cash accounts
with the Euroclear operator are governed by the Terms and Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear and the related operating procedures
of Euroclear and applicable Belgian law (collectively, the “Terms and Conditions”). The Terms and Conditions
govern transfers of securities and cash within Euroclear, withdrawal of securities and cash from Euroclear, and receipts of payments
with respect to securities in Euroclear.
 
Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream
have implemented the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in global Certificates among Participants
of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or to continue to comply with the foregoing procedures,
and the foregoing procedures may be discontinued at any time.
 
DESCRIPTION
OF THE POOLING AGREEMENTS
 
General
 
The certificates of each series will be
issued pursuant to a pooling and servicing agreement or other agreement specified in the related prospectus supplement (in either
case, a “Pooling Agreement”). In general, the parties to a Pooling Agreement will include the Depositor, a trustee,
a master servicer and, in some cases, a special servicer appointed as of the date of the Pooling Agreement. However, a Pooling
Agreement may include a Mortgage Asset Seller as a party, and a Pooling Agreement that relates to a trust fund that consists solely
of MBS may not include a master servicer or other servicer as a party. All parties to each Pooling Agreement under which certificates
of a series are issued will be identified in the related prospectus supplement. If so specified in the related prospectus supplement,
an affiliate of the Depositor, or the Mortgage Asset Seller or an affiliate of the Mortgage Asset Seller, may perform the functions
of master servicer or special servicer. Any party to a Pooling Agreement may own certificates.
 
A form of a Pooling Agreement has been filed
as an exhibit to the Registration Statement of which this prospectus is a part. However, the provisions of each Pooling Agreement
will vary depending upon the nature of the certificates to be issued and the nature of the related trust fund. The following summaries
describe certain provisions that may appear in a Pooling Agreement under which certificates that evidence interests in mortgage
loans will be issued. The prospectus supplement for a series of certificates will describe any provision of the related Pooling
Agreement that materially differs from the
 


64

 

 
description
contained in this prospectus and, if the related trust fund includes MBS, will summarize all of the material provisions of the
related Pooling Agreement. The summaries in this prospectus do not purport to be complete and are subject to, and are qualified
in their entirety by reference to, all of the provisions of the Pooling Agreement for each series of certificates and the description
of those provisions in the related prospectus supplement. We will provide a copy of the Pooling Agreement that relates to any
series of certificates without charge upon written request of a holder of a certificate of that series addressed to J.P. Morgan
Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., 383 Madison Avenue, 31st Floor, New York, New York 10179, Attention: President.
 
Assignment of Mortgage Loans;
Repurchases
 
At the time of issuance of any series of
certificates, we will assign (or cause to be assigned) to the designated trustee the mortgage loans to be included in the related
trust fund. The trustee will, concurrently with the assignment, deliver the certificates to or at the direction of the Depositor
in exchange for the mortgage loans and any interest rate or currency swap or interest rate cap, floor or collar contracts to be
included in the trust fund for that series. Each mortgage loan will be identified in a schedule. That schedule generally will include
detailed information that pertains to each mortgage loan included in the related trust fund, which information will typically include
the address of the related Mortgaged Property and type of that property; the mortgage interest rate and, if applicable, the applicable
index, gross margin, adjustment date and any rate cap information; the original and remaining term to maturity; the original amortization
term; and the original and outstanding principal balance.
 
With respect to each mortgage loan to be
included in a trust fund, we will deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the related trustee (or to a custodian appointed by the
trustee) certain loan documents which will generally include the original Mortgage Note endorsed, without recourse, to the order
of the trustee, the original Mortgage, or a certified copy, in each case with evidence of recording indicated on it and an assignment
of the Mortgage to the trustee in recordable form. The related Pooling Agreement will generally require us or another party to
the agreement to promptly cause each assignment of Mortgage to be recorded in the appropriate public office for real property records.
In the event a particular Pooling Agreement differs with respect to the mortgage file delivery requirements for a particular series,
the terms will be described in the related prospectus supplement.
 
The trustee (or a custodian appointed by
the trustee) for a series of certificates will be required to review the mortgage loan documents delivered to it within a specified
period of days after receipt of the mortgage loan documents, and the trustee (or that custodian) will hold those documents in trust
for the benefit of the certificateholders of that series. Generally, if that document is found to be missing or defective, and
that omission or defect, as the case may be, materially and adversely affects the interests of the certificateholders of the related
series or the value of the mortgage loan affected by such document defect, the trustee (or that custodian) will be required to
notify the master servicer and the Depositor, and one of those persons will be required to notify the relevant Mortgage Asset Seller.
In that case, and if the Mortgage Asset Seller cannot deliver the document or cure the defect within a specified number of days
after receipt of that notice, then, the Mortgage Asset Seller will generally be obligated to repurchase the related mortgage loan
from the trustee at a price that will be specified in the related prospectus supplement. A Mortgage Asset Seller, in lieu of repurchasing
a mortgage loan as to which there is missing or defective loan documentation, will generally have the option, exercisable upon
certain conditions and/or within a specified period after initial issuance of that series of certificates, to replace those mortgage
loans with one or more other mortgage loans, in accordance with standards that will be described in the prospectus supplement.
This repurchase or substitution obligation will generally constitute the sole remedy to holders of the certificates of any series
or to the related trustee on their behalf for missing or defective loan documentation and neither the Depositor nor, unless it
is the Mortgage Asset Seller, the master servicer will be obligated to purchase or replace a mortgage loan if a Mortgage Asset
Seller defaults on its obligation to do so. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a document has not been delivered to the related
trustee (or to a custodian appointed by the trustee) because that document has been submitted for recording, and neither that document
nor a certified copy, in either case with evidence of recording on it, can be obtained because of delays on the part of the applicable
recording office, then the Mortgage Asset Seller will generally not be required to repurchase or replace
 


65

 

 
the affected
mortgage loan on the basis of that missing document so long as it continues in good faith to attempt to obtain that document or
that certified copy. In the event a particular Pooling Agreement differs with respect to the above requirements for a particular
series, the terms will be described in the related prospectus supplement.
 
Representations and Warranties;
Repurchases
 
The Depositor will, with respect to each
mortgage loan in the related trust fund, make or assign, or cause to be made or assigned, certain representations and warranties
(the person making those representations and warranties, the “Warranting Party”) covering, by way of example:
 


·
the accuracy of the information set forth for that
mortgage loan on the schedule of mortgage loans delivered upon initial issuance of the certificates;




 
 




·
the enforceability of the related Mortgage Note and
Mortgage and the existence of title insurance insuring the lien priority of the related Mortgage;




 
 




·
the Warranting Party’s title to the mortgage
loan and the authority of the Warranting Party to sell the mortgage loan; and




 
 




·
the payment status of the mortgage loan.


 
A brief summary of additional representations
and warranties that are applicable to a particular series will be described in the prospectus supplement. It is expected that in
most cases the Warranting Party will be the Mortgage Asset Seller; however, the Warranting Party may also be an affiliate of the
Mortgage Asset Seller, the Depositor or an affiliate of the Depositor, the master servicer, a special servicer or another person
acceptable to the Depositor. The Warranting Party, if other than the Mortgage Asset Seller, will be identified in the related prospectus
supplement.
 
Each Pooling Agreement will generally provide
that the master servicer and/or trustee will be required to notify promptly any Warranting Party of any breach of any representation
or warranty made by it in respect of a mortgage loan that materially and adversely affects the interests of the certificateholders
of the related series or the value of the related mortgage loan. If that Warranting Party cannot cure that breach within a specified
period following the date on which it was notified of the breach, then it will be obligated to repurchase that mortgage loan from
the trustee at a price that will be specified in the related prospectus supplement. If so provided in the prospectus supplement
for a series of certificates, a Warranting Party, in lieu of repurchasing a mortgage loan as to which a breach has occurred, will
have the option, exercisable upon certain conditions and/or within a specified period after initial issuance of that series of
certificates, to replace that mortgage loan with one or more other mortgage loans, in accordance with standards that will be described
in the prospectus supplement. This repurchase or substitution obligation will constitute the sole remedy available to holders of
the certificates of any series or to the related trustee on their behalf for a breach of representation and warranty by a Warranting
Party and neither the Depositor nor the master servicer, in either case unless it is the Warranting Party, will be obligated to
purchase or replace a mortgage loan if a Warranting Party defaults on its obligation to do so.
 
In some cases, representations and warranties
will have been made in respect of a mortgage loan as of a date prior to the date upon which the related series of certificates
is issued, and thus may not address events that may occur following the date as of which they were made. However, we will not include
any mortgage loan in the trust fund for any series of certificates if anything has come to our attention that would cause us to
believe that the representations and warranties made in respect of that mortgage loan will not be accurate in all material respects
as of the date of issuance. The date as of which the representations and warranties regarding the mortgage loans in any trust fund
were made will be specified in the related prospectus supplement.
 


66

 

 
Collection and Other Servicing
Procedures
 
The master servicer for any trust fund,
directly or through sub-servicers, will be required to make reasonable efforts to collect all scheduled payments under the mortgage
loans in that trust fund, and will be required to follow the same collection procedures as it would follow with respect to mortgage
loans that are comparable to the mortgage loans in that trust fund and held for its own account, provided those procedures are
consistent with:
 
1.      
the terms of the related Pooling Agreement and any related instrument of credit support included in that trust fund,
 
2.      
applicable law, and
 
3.      
the servicing standard specified in the related Pooling Agreement and prospectus supplement (the “Servicing Standard”).
 
The master servicer for any trust fund,
directly or through sub-servicers, will also be required to perform as to the mortgage loans in that trust fund various other customary
functions of a servicer of comparable loans, including maintaining escrow or impound accounts, if required under the related Pooling
Agreement, for payment of taxes, insurance premiums, ground rents and similar items, or otherwise monitoring the timely payment
of those items; attempting to collect delinquent payments; supervising foreclosures; negotiating modifications; conducting property
inspections on a periodic or other basis; managing (or overseeing the management of) Mortgaged Properties acquired on behalf of
that trust fund through foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or otherwise (each, an “REO Property”); and
maintaining servicing records relating to those mortgage loans. The master servicer will generally be responsible for filing and
settling claims in respect of particular mortgage loans under any applicable instrument of credit support. See “Description
of Credit Support” in this prospectus.
 
Sub-Servicers
 
A master servicer may delegate its servicing
obligations in respect of the mortgage loans serviced thereby to one or more third-party servicers; provided that the master servicer
will generally remain obligated under the related Pooling Agreement. A sub-servicer for any series of certificates may be an affiliate
of the Depositor or master servicer. Each sub-servicing agreement between a master servicer and a sub-servicer (a “Sub-Servicing
Agreement”) will generally provide that, if for any reason the master servicer is no longer acting in that capacity,
the trustee or any successor master servicer may assume the master servicer’s rights and obligations under that Sub-Servicing
Agreement. A master servicer will be required to monitor the performance of sub-servicers retained by it and will have the right
to remove a sub-servicer retained by it at any time it considers removal to be in the best interests of certificateholders.
 
Generally, a master servicer will be solely
liable for all fees owed by it to any sub-servicer, irrespective of whether the master servicer’s compensation pursuant to
the related Pooling Agreement is sufficient to pay those fees. Each sub-servicer will be reimbursed by the master servicer that
retained it for certain expenditures which it makes, generally to the same extent the master servicer would be reimbursed under
a Pooling Agreement. See “—Certificate Account” and “—Servicing Compensation and Payment
of Expenses” in this prospectus.
 
Special Servicers
 
To the extent so specified in the related
prospectus supplement, one or more special servicers may be a party to the related Pooling Agreement or may be appointed by the
master servicer or another specified party. A special servicer for any series of certificates may be an affiliate of the Depositor
or the master servicer. A special servicer may be entitled to any of the rights, and subject to any of the obligations, described
in this prospectus in respect of a master servicer. The related prospectus supplement will describe the rights, obligations and
compensation of any special servicer for a particular series of certificates. The master servicer will not be liable for the performance
of a special servicer.
 


67

 

 
Certificate Account
 
General. The master servicer, the
trustee and/or a special servicer will, as to each trust fund that includes mortgage loans, establish and maintain or cause to
be established and maintained one or more separate accounts for the collection of payments on or in respect of those mortgage loans,
which will be established so as to comply with the standards of each rating agency that has rated any one or more classes of certificates
of the related series. A certificate account may be maintained as an interest-bearing or a non-interest-bearing account and the
funds held in a certificate account may be invested pending each succeeding distribution date in United States government securities
and other obligations that are acceptable to each rating agency that has rated any one or more classes of certificates of the related
series (“Permitted Investments”). Any interest or other income earned on funds in a certificate account will
generally be paid to the related master servicer, trustee or any special servicer as additional compensation. A certificate account
may be maintained with the related master servicer, special servicer or Mortgage Asset Seller or with a depository institution
that is an affiliate of any of the foregoing or of the Depositor, provided that it complies with applicable rating agency standards.
If permitted by the applicable rating agency or agencies and so specified in the related prospectus supplement, a certificate account
may contain funds relating to more than one series of mortgage pass-through certificates and may contain other funds representing
payments on mortgage loans owned by the related master servicer or any special servicer or serviced by either on behalf of others.
 
Deposits. A master servicer, trustee
or special servicer will generally be required to deposit or cause to be deposited in the certificate account for each trust fund
that includes mortgage loans, within a certain period following receipt (in the case of collections on or in respect of the mortgage
loans) or otherwise as provided in the related Pooling Agreement, the following payments and collections received or made by the
master servicer, the trustee or any special servicer subsequent to the cut-off date (other than payments due on or before the cut-off
date):
 
1.      
all payments on account of principal, including principal prepayments, on the mortgage loans;
 
2.      
all payments on account of interest on the mortgage loans, including any default interest collected, in each case net of
any portion retained by the master servicer or any special servicer as its servicing compensation or as compensation to the trustee;
 
3.      
all proceeds received under any hazard, title or other insurance policy that provides coverage with respect to a Mortgaged
Property or the related mortgage loan or in connection with the full or partial condemnation of a Mortgaged Property (other than
proceeds applied to the restoration of the property or released to the related borrower in accordance with the customary servicing
practices of the master servicer (or, if applicable, a special servicer) and/or the terms and conditions of the related Mortgage)
(collectively, “Insurance and Condemnation Proceeds”) and all other amounts received and retained in connection
with the liquidation of defaulted mortgage loans or property acquired by foreclosure or otherwise (“Liquidation Proceeds”),
together with the net operating income (less reasonable reserves for future expenses) derived from the operation of any Mortgaged
Properties acquired by the trust fund through foreclosure or otherwise;
 
4.      
any amounts paid under any instrument or drawn from any fund that constitutes credit support for the related series of certificates
as described under “Description of Credit Support” in this prospectus;
 
5.      
any advances made as described under “Description of the Certificates—Advances in Respect of Delinquencies”
in this prospectus;
 
6.      
any amounts paid under any Cash Flow Agreement, as described under “Description of the Trust Funds—Cash Flow
Agreements” in this prospectus;
 
7.      
all proceeds of the purchase of any mortgage loan, or property acquired in respect of a mortgage loan, by the Depositor,
any Mortgage Asset Seller or any other specified person as described under “—Assignment of Mortgage Loans; Repurchases”
and “—Representations and
 


68

 

 
Warranties;
Repurchases” in this prospectus, all proceeds of the purchase of any defaulted mortgage loan as described under “—Realization
Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans” in this prospectus, and all proceeds of any mortgage asset purchased as described under
“Description of the Certificates—Termination” in this prospectus (all of the foregoing, also “Liquidation
Proceeds”);
 
8.      
any amounts paid by the master servicer to cover Prepayment Interest Shortfalls arising out of the prepayment of mortgage
loans as described under “—Servicing Compensation and Payment of Expenses” in this prospectus;
 
9.      
to the extent that this item does not constitute additional servicing compensation to the master servicer or a special servicer,
any payments on account of modification or assumption fees, late payment charges or Prepayment Premiums with respect to the mortgage
loans;
 
10.  
all payments required to be deposited in the certificate account with respect to any deductible clause in any blanket
insurance policy described under “—Hazard Insurance Policies” in this prospectus;
 
11.  
any amount required to be deposited by the master servicer or the trustee in connection with losses realized on investments
for the benefit of the master servicer or the trustee, as the case may be, of funds held in the certificate account; and
 
12.  
any other amounts required to be deposited in the certificate account as provided in the related Pooling Agreement and described
in the related prospectus supplement.
 
Withdrawals. A master servicer, trustee
or special servicer may generally make withdrawals from the certificate account for each trust fund that includes mortgage loans
for any of the following purposes:
 
1.      
to make distributions to the certificateholders on each distribution date;
 
2.      
to pay the master servicer, the trustee or a special servicer any servicing fees not previously retained by them out of
payments on the particular mortgage loans as to which those fees were earned;
 
3.      
to reimburse the master servicer, a special servicer, the trustee or any other specified person for any unreimbursed amounts
advanced by it as described under “Description of the Certificates—Advances in Respect of Delinquencies”
in this prospectus, the reimbursement to be made out of amounts received that were identified and applied by the master servicer
or a special servicer, as applicable, as late collections of interest on and principal of the particular mortgage loans with respect
to which the advances were made or out of amounts drawn under any form of credit support with respect to those mortgage loans;
 
4.      
to reimburse the master servicer, the trustee or a special servicer for unpaid servicing fees earned by it and certain unreimbursed
servicing expenses incurred by it with respect to mortgage loans in the trust fund and properties acquired in respect of the mortgage
loans, the reimbursement to be made out of amounts that represent Liquidation Proceeds and Insurance and Condemnation Proceeds
collected on the particular mortgage loans and properties, and net income collected on the particular properties, with respect
to which those fees were earned or those expenses were incurred or out of amounts drawn under any form of credit support with respect
to those mortgage loans and properties;
 
5.      
to reimburse the master servicer, a special servicer, the trustee or other specified person for any advances described in
clause (3) above made by it and/or any servicing expenses referred to in clause (4) above incurred by it that, in the
good faith judgment of the master servicer, special servicer, trustee or other specified person, as applicable, will not be recoverable
from the amounts described in clauses (3) and (4), respectively, the reimbursement to be made from amounts collected on other mortgage
loans in the same trust fund or, if so provided by the related Pooling Agreement and described in the related prospectus supplement,
only from that portion of amounts collected on
 


69

 

 
those
other mortgage loans that is otherwise distributable on one or more classes of Subordinate Certificates of the related series;
 
6.      
if described in the related prospectus supplement, to pay the master servicer, a special servicer, the trustee or any other

in clause (4) above incurred by it while they remain outstanding and unreimbursed;
 
7.      
if and as described in the related prospectus supplement, to pay for costs and expenses incurred by the trust fund for environmental

any containment, clean-up or remediation of hazardous wastes and materials present on those Mortgaged Properties;
 
8.      
to reimburse the master servicer, the special servicer, the Depositor, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees
and agents, as the case may be, for certain expenses, costs and liabilities incurred thereby, as described under “—Certain
Matters Regarding the Master Servicer and the Depositor” in this prospectus;
 
9.      
if described in the related prospectus supplement, to pay the fees of trustee;

pay any federal, state or local taxes imposed on the trust fund or its assets or transactions, as described under “Material
Federal Income Tax Consequences—Federal Income Tax Consequences for REMIC Certificates—Taxes That May Be Imposed
on the REMIC Pool” in this prospectus;
 
16.  
to pay for the cost of an independent appraiser or other expert in real estate matters retained to determine a fair sale

of that mortgage loan or property;
 
17.  
to pay for the cost of various opinions of counsel obtained pursuant to the related Pooling Agreement for the benefit of
certificateholders;
 
18.  
to make any other withdrawals permitted by the related Pooling Agreement and described in the related prospectus supplement;
and
 
19.

70

 

 
Modifications, Waivers and
Amendments of Mortgage Loans
 
A master servicer or special servicer may
agree to modify, waive or amend any term of any mortgage loan serviced by it in a manner consistent with the applicable Servicing
Standard and the REMIC provisions, or grantor trust provisions, as applicable. For example, the related prospectus supplement may
provide that a mortgage loan may be amended to extend the maturity date or change the interest rate.
 
Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans
 
A borrower’s failure to make required
mortgage loan payments may mean that operating income is insufficient to service the mortgage debt, or may reflect the diversion
of that income from the servicing of the mortgage debt. In addition, a borrower that is unable to make mortgage loan payments may
also be unable to make timely payment of taxes and insurance premiums and to otherwise maintain the related Mortgaged Property.
In general, the master servicer or the special servicer, if any, for a series of certificates will be required to monitor any mortgage
loan in the related trust fund that is in default, evaluate whether the causes of the default can be corrected over a reasonable
period without significant impairment of the value of the related Mortgaged Property, initiate corrective action in cooperation
with the borrower if cure is likely, inspect the related Mortgaged Property and take any other actions as are consistent with the
Servicing Standard. A significant period of time may elapse before the servicer is able to assess the success of the corrective
action or the need for additional initiatives.
 
The time within which the servicer can make
the initial determination of appropriate action, evaluate the success of corrective action, develop additional initiatives, institute
foreclosure proceedings and actually foreclose (or accept a deed to a Mortgaged Property in lieu of foreclosure) on behalf of the
certificateholders may vary considerably depending on the particular mortgage loan, the Mortgaged Property, the borrower, the presence
of an acceptable party to assume the mortgage loan and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Mortgaged Property is located.
If a borrower files a bankruptcy petition, the master servicer may not be permitted to accelerate the maturity of the related mortgage
loan or to foreclose on the related Mortgaged Property for a considerable period of time, and that mortgage loan may be restructured
in the resulting bankruptcy proceedings. See “Certain Legal Aspects of Mortgage Loans” in this prospectus.
 
The related prospectus supplement will describe
the remedies available to a servicer in connection with a default on a mortgage loan. Such remedies include instituting foreclosure
proceedings, exercising any power of sale contained in mortgage, obtaining a deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise acquire title
to the related Mortgaged Property, by operation of law or otherwise.
 
Hazard Insurance Policies
 
Each Pooling Agreement will generally require
the master servicer to cause each mortgage loan borrower to maintain a hazard insurance policy that provides for the coverage required
under the related Mortgage or, if the Mortgage permits the mortgagee to dictate to the borrower the insurance coverage to be maintained
on the related Mortgaged Property, the coverage consistent with the requirements of the Servicing Standard. The coverage generally
will be in an amount equal to the lesser of the principal balance owing on that mortgage loan and the replacement cost of the related
Mortgaged Property. The ability of a master servicer to assure that hazard insurance proceeds are appropriately applied may be
dependent upon its being named as an additional insured under any hazard insurance policy and under any other insurance policy
referred to below, or upon the extent to which information concerning covered losses is furnished by borrowers. All amounts collected
by a master servicer under that policy (except for amounts to be applied to the restoration or repair of the Mortgaged Property
or released to the borrower in accordance with the master servicer’s normal servicing procedures and/or to the terms and
conditions of the related Mortgage and Mortgage Note) will be deposited in the related certificate account. The Pooling Agreement
may provide that the master servicer may satisfy its obligation to cause each borrower to maintain a hazard insurance policy by
maintaining a blanket policy insuring against hazard losses on all of the mortgage loans in a trust fund. If the blanket policy
contains a deductible clause, the master
 


71

 

 
servicer
will be required, in the event of a casualty covered by the blanket policy, to deposit in the related certificate account all
sums that would have been deposited in that certificate account but for that deductible clause.
 
In general, the standard form of fire and
extended coverage policy covers physical damage to or destruction of the improvements of the property by fire, lightning, explosion,
smoke, windstorm and hail, and riot, strike and civil commotion, subject to the conditions and exclusions specified in each policy.
Although the policies covering the Mortgaged Properties will be underwritten by different insurers under different state laws in
accordance with different applicable state forms, and therefore will not contain identical terms and conditions, most policies
typically do not cover any physical damage resulting from war, revolution, governmental actions, floods and other water-related
causes, earth movement (including earthquakes, landslides and mudflows), wet or dry rot, vermin, domestic animals and certain other
kinds of risks. Accordingly, a Mortgaged Property may not be insured for losses arising from that cause unless the related Mortgage
specifically requires, or permits the mortgagee to require, that coverage.
 
The hazard insurance policies covering the
Mortgaged Properties will typically contain co-insurance clauses that in effect require an insured at all times to carry insurance
of a specified percentage, generally 80% to 90%, of the full replacement value of the improvements on the property in order to
recover the full amount of any partial loss. If the insured’s coverage falls below this specified percentage, those clauses
generally provide that the insurer’s liability in the event of partial loss does not exceed the lesser of (1) the replacement
cost of the improvements less physical depreciation and (2) that proportion of the loss as the amount of insurance carried
bears to the specified percentage of the full replacement cost of those improvements.
 
Due-on-Sale and Due-on-Encumbrance
Provisions
 
Certain of the mortgage loans may contain
a due-on-sale clause that entitles the lender to accelerate payment of the mortgage loan upon any sale or other transfer of
the related Mortgaged Property made without the lender’s consent. Certain of the mortgage loans may also contain a due-on-encumbrance
clause that entitles the lender to accelerate the maturity of the mortgage loan upon the creation of any other lien or encumbrance
upon the Mortgaged Property. The master servicer will determine whether to exercise any right the trustee may have under that provision
in a manner consistent with the Servicing Standard. The master servicer will generally be entitled to retain as additional servicing
compensation any fee collected in connection with the permitted transfer of a Mortgaged Property. See “Certain Legal Aspects
of Mortgage Loans—Due-on-Sale and Due-on-Encumbrance” in this prospectus.
 
Servicing Compensation and
Payment of Expenses
 
A master servicer’s primary servicing
compensation with respect to a series of certificates generally will come from the periodic payment to it of a specified portion
of the interest payments on each mortgage loan in the related trust fund. Because that compensation is generally based on a percentage
of the principal balance of each mortgage loan outstanding from time to time, it will decrease in accordance with the amortization
of the mortgage loans. As additional compensation, the master servicer may retain all or a portion of late payment charges, Prepayment
Premiums, modification fees and other fees collected from borrowers and any interest or other income that may be earned on funds
held in the certificate account. Any sub-servicer will receive a portion of the master servicer’s compensation as its sub-servicing
compensation.
 
In addition to amounts payable to any sub-servicer,
a master servicer may be required, to the extent provided in the related prospectus supplement, to pay from amounts that represent
its servicing compensation certain expenses incurred in connection with the administration of the related trust fund, including,
without limitation, payment of the fees and disbursements of independent accountants and payment of expenses incurred in connection
with distributions and reports to certificateholders. Certain other expenses, including certain expenses related to mortgage loan
defaults and liquidations and, to the extent so provided in the related prospectus supplement, interest on those expenses at the
rate specified
 


72

 

 
in the
prospectus supplement, and the fees of any special servicer, may be required to be borne by the trust fund.
 
If provided in the related prospectus supplement,
a master servicer may be required to apply a portion of the servicing compensation otherwise payable to it in respect of any period
to Prepayment Interest Shortfalls. See “Yield and Maturity Considerations—Certain Shortfalls in Collections of Interest”
in this prospectus.
 
Evidence as to Compliance
 
The related prospectus supplement will identify
each party that will be required to deliver annually to the trustee, master servicer or us, as applicable, on or before the date
specified in the related Pooling Agreement, an officer’s certificate stating that (i) a review of that party’s servicing
activities during the preceding calendar year and of performance under the related Pooling Agreement has been made under the supervision
of the officer, and (ii) to the best of the officer’s knowledge, based on the review, such party has fulfilled all its obligations
under the related Pooling Agreement throughout the year, or, if there has been a default in the fulfillment of any obligation,
specifying the default known to the officer and the nature and status of the default.
 
In addition, each party that participates
in the servicing and administration of more than 5% of the mortgage loans and any interest rate or currency swap or interest rate
cap, floor or collar contracts comprising a trust for any series will be required to deliver annually to us and/or the trustee,
a report (an “Assessment of Compliance”) that assesses compliance by that party with the servicing criteria
set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB under the Securities Act (17 C.F.R. 229.1122) that contains the following:
 


(a)
a statement of the party’s responsibility for
assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to it;




 
 




(b)
a statement that the party used the criteria in Item
1122(d) of Regulation AB to assess compliance with the applicable servicing criteria;




 
 




(c)
the party’s assessment of compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria during and as of the end of the prior calendar month, setting forth any material instance of noncompliance
identified by the party; and




 
 




(d)
a statement that a registered public accounting firm
has issued an attestation report on the party’s assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria during and
as of the end of the prior calendar month.


 
Each party that is required to deliver an
Assessment of Compliance will also be required to simultaneously deliver a report (an “Attestation Report”)
of a registered public accounting firm, prepared in accordance with the standards for attestation engagements issued or adopted
by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, that expresses an opinion, or states that an opinion cannot be expressed, concerning
the party’s assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria.
 
Each Pooling Agreement will also require,
on or before a specified date in each year, the master servicer to furnish to the trustee a statement signed by one or more officers
of the master servicer to the effect that the master servicer has fulfilled its material obligations under that Pooling Agreement
throughout the preceding calendar year or other specified twelve month period.
 
Certain Matters Regarding
the Master Servicer and the Depositor
 
The related prospectus supplement will describe
certain protections afforded to a servicer under the related Pooling Agreement. For example, the Pooling Agreement may permit the
servicer to resign from its obligations under the Pooling Agreement provided certain conditions are met. In addition, the Pooling
Agreement may provide that none of the master servicer, the Depositor or any director, officer, employee or agent of either of
them will be under any liability to the related trust fund or certificateholders for any
 


73

 

 
action
taken, or not taken, in good faith pursuant to the Pooling Agreement or for errors in judgment. The Pooling Agreement may also
provide that the master servicer, the Depositor and any director, officer, employee or agent of either of them will be entitled
to indemnification by the related trust fund against any loss, liability or expense incurred in connection with any legal action
that relates to the Pooling Agreement or the related series of certificates. In addition, the Pooling Agreement may provide that
none of the servicer, special servicer or the depositor will be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal
action that is not incidental to its responsibilities under the Pooling Agreement.
 
Servicer Termination Events
 
Each prospectus supplement will describe
the events which will trigger a termination event (each a “Servicer Termination Event”). For example, the related
prospectus supplement may provide that a servicer termination event will occur if a servicer fails to make remittance as required
under the Pooling Agreement, if a special servicer fails to make the required deposit, or if either the servicer or special servicer
materially fails to perform any of its obligations contained in the related Pooling Agreement.
 
The related prospectus supplement will describe
the remedies available if a Servicer Termination Event occurs with respect to the master servicer under a Pooling Agreement, which
remedies may include the termination of all of the rights and obligations of the master servicer as master servicer under the Pooling
Agreement.
 
Amendment
 
Each Pooling Agreement generally may be
amended, without the consent of any of the holders of the related series of certificates for those purposes described in the related
prospectus supplement, which, among others, may include:
 
1.      
to cure any ambiguity,
 
2.      
to correct a defective provision in the Pooling Agreement or to correct, modify or supplement any of its provisions that
may be inconsistent with any other of its provisions,
 
3.      
to add any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the Pooling Agreement that are not inconsistent
with its provisions, or
 
4.      
to comply with any requirements imposed by the Code;
 
provided that the amendment (other than an amendment for the
specific purpose referred to in clause (4) above) may not (as evidenced by an opinion of counsel to an effect satisfactory
to the trustee) adversely affect in any material respect the interests of any holder; and provided further that the amendment (other
than an amendment for one of the specific purposes referred to in clauses (1) through (4) above) must be acceptable to
each applicable rating agency.
 
Each Pooling Agreement may also be amended,
with the consent of the holders of the related series of certificates entitled to not less than the percentage specified in the
related prospectus supplement of the voting rights for that series allocated to the affected classes, for any purpose. The related
prospectus supplement may provide that these types of amendments may not:
 
1.      
reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments received or advanced on mortgage loans that are required
to be distributed in respect of any certificate without the consent of the holder of that certificate,
 
2.      
adversely affect in any material respect the interests of the holders of any class of certificates, in a manner other than
as described in clause (1), without the consent of the holders of all certificates of that class, or
 


74

 

 
3.      
modify the amendment provisions of the Pooling Agreement described in this paragraph without the consent of the holders
of all certificates of the related series.
 
Generally, the trustee will be prohibited
from consenting to any amendment of a Pooling Agreement pursuant to which one or more REMIC elections are to be or have been made
unless the trustee shall first have received an opinion of counsel to the effect that the amendment will not result in the imposition
of a tax on the related trust fund or cause the related trust fund, or the designated portion, to fail to qualify as a REMIC at
any time that the related certificates are outstanding.
 
List of Certificateholders
 
Generally, upon written request of three
or more certificateholders of record made for purposes of communicating with other holders of certificates of the same series with
respect to their rights under the related Pooling Agreement, the trustee or other specified person will afford those certificateholders
access during normal business hours to the most recent list of certificateholders of that series held by that person. If that list
is of a date more than 90 days prior to the date of receipt of that certificateholder’s request, then that person, if
not the registrar for that series of certificates, will be required to request from that registrar a current list and to afford
those requesting certificateholders access thereto promptly upon receipt.
 
The Trustee
 
The trustee under each Pooling Agreement
will be named in the related prospectus supplement. The commercial bank, national banking association, banking corporation or trust
company that serves as trustee may have typical banking relationships with the Depositor and its affiliates and with any master
servicer or special servicer and its affiliates.
 
Duties of the Trustee
 
The trustee for each series of certificates
will make no representation as to the validity or sufficiency of the related Pooling Agreement, the certificates or any underlying
mortgage loan or related document and will not be accountable for the use or application by or on behalf of the master servicer
for that series of any funds paid to the master servicer or any special servicer in respect of the certificates or the underlying
mortgage loans, or any funds deposited into or withdrawn from the certificate account or any other account for that series by or
on behalf of the master servicer or any special servicer. If no Servicer Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, the
trustee for each series of certificates will be required to perform only those duties specifically required under the related Pooling
Agreement. However, upon receipt of any of the various certificates, reports or other instruments required to be furnished to it
pursuant to the related Pooling Agreement, a trustee will be required to examine those documents and to determine whether they
conform to the requirements of that agreement.
 
Certain Matters Regarding
the Trustee
 
As described in the related prospectus supplement,
the fees and normal disbursements of any trustee may be the expense of the related master servicer or other specified person or
may be required to be borne by the related trust fund.
 
The trustee for each series of certificates
will generally be entitled to indemnification, from amounts held in the certificate account for that series, for any loss, liability
or expense incurred by the trustee in connection with the trustee’s acceptance or administration of its trusts under the
related Pooling Agreement. However, the indemnification will not extend to any loss, liability or expense that constitutes a specific
liability imposed on the trustee pursuant to the related Pooling Agreement, or to any loss, liability or expense incurred by reason
of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the part of the trustee in the performance of its obligations and duties
under the Pooling Agreement, or by reason of its reckless disregard of those obligations or duties, or as may arise from a breach
of any representation, warranty or covenant of the trustee made in the Pooling Agreement.
 


75

 

 
The trustee for each series of certificates
will generally be entitled to execute any of its trusts or powers under the related Pooling Agreement or perform any of its duties
under that Pooling Agreement either directly or by or through agents or attorneys, and the trustee will not be relieved of any
of its duties or obligations by virtue of the appointment of any agents or attorneys.
 
Resignation and Removal of
the Trustee
 
A trustee will be permitted at any time
to resign from its obligations and duties under the related Pooling Agreement by giving written notice to the Depositor, the servicer,
the special servicer and to all certificateholders. Upon receiving this notice of resignation, the Depositor, or other person as
may be specified in the related prospectus supplement, will be required to use its best efforts to promptly appoint a successor
trustee. If no successor trustee shall have accepted an appointment within a specified period after the giving of notice of resignation,
the resigning trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor trustee.
 
If at any time a trustee ceases to be eligible
to continue as trustee under the related Pooling Agreement, or if at any time the trustee becomes incapable of acting, or if certain
events of, or proceedings in respect of, bankruptcy or insolvency occur with respect to the trustee, the Depositor will be authorized
to remove the trustee and appoint a successor trustee. In addition, holders of the certificates of any series entitled to at least
51% (or other percentage specified in the related prospectus supplement) of the voting rights for that series may at any time,
with or without cause, remove the trustee under the related Pooling Agreement and appoint a successor trustee.
 
Any resignation or removal of a trustee
and appointment of a successor trustee will not become effective until acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee.
 
DESCRIPTION
OF CREDIT SUPPORT
 
General
 
Credit support may be provided with respect
to one or more classes of the certificates of any series, or with respect to the related mortgage assets. Credit support may be
in the form of letters of credit, overcollateralization, the subordination of one or more classes of certificates, insurance policies,
surety bonds, guarantees or reserve funds, or any combination of the foregoing. If so provided in the related prospectus supplement,
any form of credit support may provide credit enhancement for more than one series of certificates to the extent described in that
prospectus supplement.
 
The credit support will not provide protection
against all risks of loss and will not guarantee payment to certificateholders of all amounts to which they are entitled under
the related Pooling Agreement. If losses or shortfalls occur that exceed the amount covered by the related credit support or that
are not covered by that credit support, certificateholders will bear their allocable share of deficiencies. Moreover, if a form
of credit support covers more than one series of certificates, holders of certificates of one series will be subject to the risk
that the credit support will be exhausted by the claims of the holders of certificates of one or more other series before the former
receive their intended share of that coverage.
 
If credit support is provided with respect
to one or more classes of certificates of a series, or with respect to the related mortgage assets, the related prospectus supplement
will include a description of
 


·
the nature and amount of coverage under the credit
support,




 
 




·
any conditions to payment under the credit support
not otherwise described in this prospectus,




 
 




·
any conditions under which the amount of coverage
under the credit support may be reduced and under which that credit support may be terminated or replaced and




 
 




·
the material provisions relating to the credit support.


 


76

 

 
Additionally, the related prospectus supplement
will set forth certain information with respect to the obligor under any instrument of credit support, including
 


·
a brief description of its principal business activities;




 
 




·
its principal place of business, place of incorporation
and the jurisdiction under which it is chartered or licensed to do business,




 
 




·
if applicable, the identity of regulatory agencies
that exercise primary jurisdiction over the conduct of its business and




 
 




·
its total assets, and its stockholders’ equity
or policyholders’ surplus, if applicable, as of a date that will be specified in the prospectus supplement. See “Risk
Factors—Credit Support May Not Cover Losses” in this prospectus.


 
Subordinate Certificates
 
If so specified in the related prospectus
supplement, one or more classes of certificates of a series may be Subordinate Certificates. To the extent specified in the related
prospectus supplement, the rights of the holders of Subordinate Certificates to receive distributions from the certificate account
on any distribution date will be subordinated to the corresponding rights of the holders of Senior Certificates. If so provided
in the related prospectus supplement, the subordination of a class may apply only in the event of (or may be limited to) certain
types of losses or shortfalls. The related prospectus supplement will set forth information concerning the method and amount of
subordination provided by a class or classes of Subordinate Certificates in a series and the circumstances under which that subordination
will be available.
 
Cross-Support Provisions
 
If the mortgage assets in any trust fund
are divided into separate groups, each supporting a separate class or classes of certificates of the related series, credit support
may be provided by cross-support provisions requiring that distributions be made on Senior Certificates evidencing interests in
one group of mortgage assets prior to distributions on Subordinate Certificates evidencing interests in a different group of
mortgage assets within the trust fund. The prospectus supplement for a series that includes a cross-support provision will describe
the manner and conditions for applying those provisions.
 
Insurance or Guarantees with
Respect to Mortgage Loans
 
If so provided in the prospectus supplement
for a series of certificates, mortgage loans included in the related trust fund will be covered for certain default risks by insurance
policies or guarantees. A copy of that instrument will accompany the Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC contemporaneously
with the final prospectus.
 
Letter of Credit
 
If so provided in the prospectus supplement
for a series of certificates, deficiencies in amounts otherwise payable on those certificates or certain classes of those certificates
may be covered by one or more letters of credit, issued by a bank or financial institution specified in the prospectus supplement
(the “L/C Bank”). Under a letter of credit, the L/C Bank will be obligated to honor draws under a letter of
credit in an aggregate fixed dollar amount, net of unreimbursed payments, generally equal to a percentage specified in the related
prospectus supplement of the aggregate principal balance of the mortgage assets on the related cut-off date or of the initial aggregate
principal balance of one or more classes of certificates. If so specified in the related prospectus supplement, the letter of credit
may permit draws only in the event of certain types of losses and shortfalls. The amount available under the letter of credit will,
in all cases, be reduced to the extent of the unreimbursed payments under the letter of credit and may otherwise be reduced as
described in the related prospectus supplement. The obligations of the L/C
 


77

 

 
Bank under
the letter of credit for each series of certificates will expire at the earlier of the date specified in the related prospectus
supplement or the termination of the trust fund. A copy of that letter of credit will accompany the Current Report on Form 8-K
to be filed with the SEC within 15 days of issuance of the certificates of the related series.
 
Certificate Insurance and
Surety Bonds
 
If so provided in the prospectus supplement
for a series of certificates, insurance policies and/or surety bonds provided by one or more insurance companies or sureties of
the insurance companies will cover deficiencies in amounts otherwise payable on those certificates or certain classes. Those instruments
may cover, with respect to one or more classes of certificates of the related series, timely distributions of interest and/or full
distributions of principal on the basis of a schedule of principal distributions set forth in or determined in the manner specified
in the related prospectus supplement. The related prospectus supplement will describe any limitations on the draws that may be
made under that instrument. A copy of that instrument will accompany the Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC within
15 days of issuance of the certificates of the related series.
 
Reserve Funds
 
If so provided in the prospectus supplement
for a series of certificates, deficiencies in amounts otherwise payable on those certificates or certain classes of those certificates
will be covered, to the extent of available funds, by one or more reserve funds in which cash, a letter of credit, short-term debt
obligations, a demand note or a combination of those features will be deposited, in the amounts specified in the prospectus supplement.
If so specified in the related prospectus supplement, the reserve fund for a series may also be funded over time by a specified
amount of the collections received on the related mortgage assets.
 
Amounts on deposit in any reserve fund for
a series, together with the reinvestment income on those amounts, if any, will be applied for the purposes, in the manner, specified
in the related prospectus supplement. If so specified in the related prospectus supplement, reserve funds may be established to
provide protection only against certain types of losses and shortfalls. Following each distribution date, amounts in a reserve
fund in excess of any amount required to be maintained in that reserve fund may be released from it under the conditions specified
in the related prospectus supplement.
 
Amounts deposited in any reserve fund will
generally be invested in short-term debt obligations. Any reinvestment income or other gain from those investments will generally
be credited to the related reserve fund for that series, and any loss resulting from those investments will be charged to that
reserve fund. However, that income may be payable to any related master servicer or another service provider as additional compensation
for its services. The reserve fund, if any, for a series will not be a part of the trust fund.
 
Credit Support with Respect
to MBS
 
If so provided in the prospectus supplement
for a series of certificates, any MBS included in the related trust fund and/or the related underlying mortgage loans may be covered
by one or more of the types of credit support described in this prospectus. The related prospectus supplement will specify, as
to each form of credit support, the information indicated above with respect to the credit support for each series, to the extent
that information is material and available.
 
CERTAIN
LEGAL ASPECTS OF MORTGAGE LOANS
 
The following discussion contains general
summaries of certain legal aspects of loans secured by commercial and multifamily residential properties. Because those legal aspects
are governed by applicable state law, which laws may differ substantially, the summaries do not purport to be complete, to reflect
the laws of any particular state, or to encompass the laws of all states in which the security for the mortgage loans, or mortgage
loans underlying any MBS, is situated. Accordingly, the summaries are
 


78

 

 
qualified
in their entirety by reference to the applicable laws of those states. See “Description of the Trust Funds—Mortgage
Loans” in this prospectus.
 
General
 
Each mortgage loan will be evidenced by
a promissory note or bond and secured by an instrument granting a security interest in real property, which may be a mortgage,
deed of trust or a deed to secure debt, depending upon the prevailing practice and law in the state in which the related Mortgaged
Property is located. Mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt are in this prospectus collectively referred to as “mortgages.”
A mortgage creates a lien upon, or grants a title interest in, the real property covered thereby, and represents the security for
the repayment of the indebtedness customarily evidenced by a promissory note. The priority of the lien created or interest granted
will depend on the terms of the mortgage and, in some cases, on the terms of separate subordination agreements or intercreditor
agreements with others that hold interests in the real property, the knowledge of the parties to the mortgage and, generally, the
order of recordation of the mortgage in the appropriate public recording office. However, the lien of a recorded mortgage will
generally be subordinate to later-arising liens for real estate taxes and assessments and other charges imposed under governmental
police powers.
 
Types of Mortgage Instruments
 
There are two parties to a mortgage: a mortgagor
who is the borrower and usually the owner of the subject property, and a mortgagee, who is the lender. In contrast, a deed of trust
is a three-party instrument, among a trustor who is the equivalent of a borrower, a trustee to whom the real property is conveyed,
and a beneficiary, who is the lender, for whose benefit the conveyance is made. Under a deed of trust, the trustor grants the property,
irrevocably until the debt is paid, in trust and generally with a power of sale, to the trustee to secure repayment of the indebtedness
evidenced by the related mortgage note. A deed to secure debt typically has two parties. The grantor (the borrower) conveys title
to the real property to the grantee (the lender) generally with a power of sale, until the time the debt is repaid. In a case where
the borrower is a land trust, there would be an additional party because a land trustee holds legal title to the property under
a land trust agreement for the benefit of the borrower. At origination of a mortgage loan involving a land trust, the borrower
executes a separate undertaking to make payments on the mortgage note. The mortgagee’s authority under a mortgage, the trustee’s
authority under a deed of trust and the grantee’s authority under a deed to secure debt are governed by the express provisions
of the related instrument, the law of the state in which the real property is located, certain federal laws (including, without
limitation, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act) and, in some deed of trust transactions, the directions of the beneficiary.
 
Leases and Rents
 
Mortgages that encumber income-producing
property often contain an assignment of rents and leases, pursuant to which the borrower (or with respect to any indemnity deed
of trust structure, the related property owner) assigns to the lender the its right, title and interest as landlord under each
lease and the income derived therefrom, while, unless rents are to be paid directly to the lender, retaining a revocable license
to collect the rents for so long as there is no default. If the borrower defaults, the license terminates and the lender is entitled
to collect the rents. Local law may require that the lender take possession of the property and/or obtain a court-appointed receiver
before becoming entitled to collect the rents.
 
In most states, hotel and motel room revenue
are considered accounts receivable under the Uniform Commercial Code, also known as the UCC. In cases where hotels or motels constitute
loan security, the borrower as additional security for the loan generally pledges the revenue. In general, the lender must file
financing statements in order to perfect its security interest in the revenue and must file continuation statements, generally
every five years, to maintain perfection of that security interest. Even if the lender’s security interest in room revenue
is perfected under the UCC, it may be required to commence a foreclosure action or otherwise take possession of the property in
order to collect the room revenue following a default. See “—Bankruptcy Laws” below.
 


79

 

 
Personalty
 
In the case of certain types of mortgaged
properties, for instance hotels, motels and nursing homes, personal property (to the extent owned by the borrower and not previously
pledged) may constitute a significant portion of the property’s value as security. The creation and enforcement of liens
on personal property are governed by the UCC. Accordingly, if a borrower pledges personal property as security for a mortgage loan,
the lender generally must file UCC financing statements in order to perfect its security interest in that personal property, and
must file continuation statements, generally every five years, to maintain that perfection.
 
Foreclosure
 
General. Foreclosure is a legal procedure
that allows the lender to recover its mortgage debt by enforcing its rights and available legal remedies under the mortgage. If
the borrower defaults in payment or performance of its obligations under the mortgage note or mortgage, the lender has the right
to institute foreclosure proceedings to sell the real property at public auction to satisfy the indebtedness.
 
Foreclosure procedures vary from state to
state. Two primary methods of foreclosing a mortgage are judicial foreclosure, involving court proceedings, and non-judicial foreclosure
pursuant to a power of sale granted in the mortgage instrument. Other foreclosure procedures are available in some states, but
they are either infrequently used or available only in limited circumstances.
 
A foreclosure action is subject to most
of the delays and expenses of other lawsuits if defenses are raised or counterclaims are interposed, and sometimes requires several years
to complete. Moreover, as discussed below, even a non-collusive, regularly conducted foreclosure sale may be challenged as a fraudulent
conveyance, regardless of the parties’ intent, if a court determines that the sale was for less than fair consideration and
that the sale occurred while the borrower was insolvent and within a specified period prior to the borrower’s filing for
bankruptcy protection.
 
Judicial Foreclosure. A judicial
foreclosure proceeding is conducted in a court having jurisdiction over the Mortgaged Property. Generally, the action is initiated
by the service of legal pleadings upon all parties having a subordinate interest of record in the real property and all parties
in possession of the property, under leases or otherwise, whose interests are subordinate to the mortgage. Delays in completion
of the foreclosure may occasionally result from difficulties in locating defendants. When the lender’s right to foreclose
is contested, the legal proceedings can be time-consuming. Upon successful completion of a judicial foreclosure proceeding, the
court generally issues a judgment of foreclosure and appoints a referee or other officer to conduct a public sale of the Mortgaged
Property, the proceeds of which are used to satisfy the judgment. Those sales are made in accordance with procedures that vary
from state to state.
 
Equitable Limitations on Enforceability
of Certain Provisions. United States courts have traditionally imposed general equitable principles to limit the remedies available
to lenders in foreclosure actions. These principles are generally designed to relieve borrowers from the effects of mortgage defaults
perceived as harsh or unfair. Relying on those principles, a court may alter the specific terms of a loan to the extent it considers
necessary to prevent or remedy an injustice, undue oppression or overreaching, or may require the lender to undertake affirmative
actions to determine the cause of the borrower’s default and the likelihood that the borrower will be able to reinstate the
loan. In some cases, courts have substituted their judgment for the lenders and have required that lenders reinstate loans or recast
payment schedules in order to accommodate borrowers who are suffering from a temporary financial disability. In other cases, courts
have limited the right of the lender to foreclose in the case of a non-monetary default, such as a failure to adequately maintain
the mortgaged property or an impermissible further encumbrance of the mortgaged property. Finally, some courts have addressed the
issue of whether federal or state constitutional provisions reflecting due process concerns for adequate notice require that a
borrower receive notice in addition to statutorily-prescribed minimum notice. For the most part, these cases have upheld the reasonableness
of the notice provisions or have found that a public sale under a mortgage providing for a power of sale does not involve sufficient
state action to trigger constitutional protections.
 


80

 

 
Non-Judicial Foreclosure/Power of Sale.
Foreclosure of a deed of trust is generally accomplished by a non-judicial trustee’s sale pursuant to a power of sale typically
granted in the deed of trust. A power of sale may also be contained in any other type of mortgage instrument if applicable law
so permits. A power of sale under a deed of trust allows a non-judicial public sale to be conducted generally following a request
from the beneficiary/lender to the trustee to sell the property upon default by the borrower and after notice of sale is given
in accordance with the terms of the mortgage and applicable state law. In some states, prior to that sale, the trustee under the
deed of trust must record a notice of default and notice of sale and send a copy to the borrower and to any other party who has
recorded a request for a copy of a notice of default and notice of sale. In addition, in some states the trustee must provide notice
to any other party having an interest of record in the real property, including junior lienholders. A notice of sale must be posted
in a public place and, in most states, published for a specified period of time in one or more newspapers. The borrower or junior
lienholder may then have the right, during a reinstatement period required in some states, to cure the default by paying the entire
actual amount in arrears (without regard to the acceleration of the indebtedness), plus the lender’s expenses incurred in
enforcing the obligation. In other states, the borrower or the junior lienholder is not provided a period to reinstate the loan,
but has only the right to pay off the entire debt to prevent the foreclosure sale. Generally, state law governs the procedure for
public sale, the parties entitled to notice, the method of giving notice and the applicable time periods.
 
Public Sale. A third party may be
unwilling to purchase a mortgaged property at a public sale because of the difficulty in determining the value of that property
at the time of sale, due to, among other things, redemption rights which may exist and the possibility of physical deterioration
of the property during the foreclosure proceedings. Potential buyers may be reluctant to purchase property at a foreclosure sale
as a result of the 1980 decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Durrett v. Washington National
Insurance Company and other decisions that have followed its reasoning. The court in Durrett held that even a non-collusive, regularly
conducted foreclosure sale was a fraudulent transfer under the federal bankruptcy code, as amended from time to time (11 U.S.C.
§§ 101-1532) (the “Bankruptcy Code”) and, thus, could be rescinded in favor of the bankrupt’s
estate, if (1) the foreclosure sale was held while the debtor was insolvent and not more than one year prior to the filing
of the bankruptcy petition and (2) the price paid for the foreclosed property did not represent “fair consideration,”
which is “reasonably equivalent value” under the Bankruptcy Code. Although the reasoning and result of Durrett in respect
of the Bankruptcy Code was rejected by the United States Supreme Court in BFP v. Resolution Trust Corp., 511 U.S. 531 (1994), the
case could nonetheless be persuasive to a court applying a state fraudulent conveyance law which has provisions similar to those
construed in Durrett. For these reasons, it is common for the lender to purchase the mortgaged property for an amount equal to
the lesser of fair market value and the underlying debt and accrued and unpaid interest plus the expenses of foreclosure. Generally,
state law controls the amount of foreclosure costs and expenses which may be recovered by a lender. Thereafter, subject to the
mortgagor’s right in some states to remain in possession during a redemption period, if applicable, the lender will become
the owner of the property and have both the benefits and burdens of ownership of the mortgaged property. For example, the lender
will have the obligation to pay debt service on any senior mortgages, to pay taxes, obtain casualty insurance and to make those
repairs at its own expense as are necessary to render the property suitable for sale. Frequently, the lender employs a third party
management company to manage and operate the property. The costs of operating and maintaining a commercial or multifamily residential
property may be significant and may be greater than the income derived from that property. The costs of management and operation
of those mortgaged properties which are hotels, motels or restaurants, nursing or convalescent homes, hospitals or casinos may
be particularly significant because of the expertise, knowledge and, with respect to nursing or convalescent homes, hospitals or
casinos, regulatory compliance, required to run those operations and the effect which foreclosure and a change in ownership may
have on the public’s and the industry’s, including franchisors’, perception of the quality of those operations.
The lender will commonly obtain the services of a real estate broker and pay the broker’s commission in connection with the
sale of the property. Depending upon market conditions, the ultimate proceeds of the sale of the property may not equal the amount
of the mortgage against the property. Moreover, a lender commonly incurs substantial legal fees and court costs in acquiring a
mortgaged property through contested foreclosure and/or bankruptcy proceedings. Furthermore, an increasing number of states require
that any environmental contamination at certain types of properties
 


81

 

 
be cleaned
up before a property may be resold. In addition, a lender may be responsible under federal or state law for the cost of cleaning
up a mortgaged property that is environmentally contaminated. See “—Environmental Risks” below.
 
The holder of a junior mortgage that forecloses
on a mortgaged property does so subject to senior mortgages and any other prior liens, and may be obliged to keep senior mortgage
loans current in order to avoid foreclosure of its interest in the property. In addition, if the foreclosure of a junior mortgage
triggers the enforcement of a “due-on-sale” clause contained in a senior mortgage, the junior mortgagee could
be required to pay the full amount of the senior mortgage indebtedness or face foreclosure.
 
Rights of Redemption. The purposes
of a foreclosure action are to enable the lender to realize upon its security and to bar the borrower, and all persons who have
interests in the property that are subordinate to that of the foreclosing lender, from exercise of their “equity of redemption.”
The doctrine of equity of redemption provides that, until the property encumbered by a mortgage has been sold in accordance with
a properly conducted foreclosure and foreclosure sale, those having interests that are subordinate to that of the foreclosing lender
have an equity of redemption and may redeem the property by paying the entire debt with interest. Those having an equity of redemption
must generally be made parties and joined in the foreclosure proceeding in order for their equity of redemption to be terminated.
 
The equity of redemption is a common-law
(non-statutory) right which should be distinguished from post-sale statutory rights of redemption. In some states, after sale pursuant
to a deed of trust or foreclosure of a mortgage, the borrower and foreclosed junior lienors are given a statutory period in which
to redeem the property. In some states, statutory redemption may occur only upon payment of the foreclosure sale price. In other
states, redemption may be permitted if the former borrower pays only a portion of the sums due. The effect of a statutory right
of redemption is to diminish the ability of the lender to sell the foreclosed property because the exercise of a right of redemption
would defeat the title of any purchaser through a foreclosure. Consequently, the practical effect of the redemption right is to
force the lender to maintain the property and pay the expenses of ownership until the redemption period has expired. In some states,
a post-sale statutory right of redemption may exist following a judicial foreclosure.
 
Anti-Deficiency Legislation. Some
or all of the mortgage loans may be nonrecourse loans, as to which recourse in the case of default will be limited to the Mortgaged
Property and those other assets, if any, that were pledged to secure the mortgage loan. However, even if a mortgage loan by its
terms provides for recourse to the borrower’s other assets, a lender’s ability to realize upon those assets may be
limited by state law. For example, in some states a lender cannot obtain a deficiency judgment against the borrower following foreclosure
or sale under a deed of trust. A deficiency judgment is a personal judgment against the former borrower equal to the difference
between the net amount realized upon the public sale of the real property and the amount due to the lender. Other statutes may
require the lender to exhaust the security afforded under a mortgage before bringing a personal action against the borrower. In
certain other states, the lender has the option of bringing a personal action against the borrower on the debt without first exhausting
that security; however, in some of those states, the lender, following judgment on that personal action, may be deemed to have
elected a remedy and thus may be precluded from foreclosing upon the security. Consequently, lenders in those states where an election
of remedy provision exists will usually proceed first against the security. Finally, other statutory provisions, designed to protect
borrowers from exposure to large deficiency judgments that might result from bidding at below-market values at the foreclosure
sale, limit any deficiency judgment to the excess of the outstanding debt over the fair market value of the property at the time
of the sale.
 
Leasehold Risks. Mortgage loans may
be secured by a mortgage on the borrower’s leasehold interest in a ground lease. Leasehold mortgage loans are subject to
certain risks not associated with mortgage loans secured by a lien on the fee estate of the borrower. The most significant of these
risks is that if the borrower’s leasehold were to be terminated upon a lease default, the leasehold mortgagee would lose
its security. This risk may be lessened if the ground lease requires the lessor to give the leasehold mortgagee notices of lessee
defaults and an opportunity to cure them, permits the leasehold estate to be assigned to and by the leasehold mortgagee or the
purchaser at a foreclosure sale, and contains certain other protective provisions typically included in a “mortgageable”
ground lease.
 


82

 

 
Cooperative Shares. Mortgage loans
may be secured by a security interest on the borrower’s ownership interest in shares, and the proprietary leases appurtenant
thereto, allocable to cooperative dwelling units that may be vacant or occupied by non-owner tenants. Those loans are subject to
certain risks not associated with mortgage loans secured by a lien on the fee estate of a borrower in real property. This kind
of loan typically is subordinate to the mortgage, if any, on the Cooperative’s building which, if foreclosed, could extinguish
the equity in the building and the proprietary leases of the dwelling units derived from ownership of the shares of the Cooperative.
Further, transfer of shares in a Cooperative are subject to various regulations as well as to restrictions under the governing
documents of the Cooperative, and the shares may be cancelled in the event that associated maintenance charges due under the related
proprietary leases are not paid. Typically, a recognition agreement between the lender and the Cooperative provides, among other
things, the lender with an opportunity to cure a default under a proprietary lease.
 
Under the laws applicable in many states,
“foreclosure” on Cooperative shares is accomplished by a sale in accordance with the provisions of Article 9 of
the UCC and the security agreement relating to the shares. Article 9 of the UCC requires that a sale be conducted in a “commercially
reasonable” manner, which may be dependent upon, among other things, the notice given the debtor and the method, manner,
time, place and terms of the sale. Article 9 of the UCC provides that the proceeds of the sale will be applied first to pay
the costs and expenses of the sale and then to satisfy the indebtedness secured by the lender’s security interest. A recognition
agreement, however, generally provides that the lender’s right to reimbursement is subject to the right of the Cooperative
to receive sums due under the proprietary leases.
 
Bankruptcy Laws
 
Generally. The Bankruptcy Code and
related state laws may interfere with or affect the ability of a lender to realize upon collateral and/or to enforce a deficiency
judgment. For example, under the Bankruptcy Code, virtually all actions (including foreclosure actions and deficiency judgment
proceedings) are automatically stayed upon the filing of the bankruptcy petition, and, usually, no interest or principal payments
are made during the course of the bankruptcy case. The delay and the consequences of a delay caused by an automatic stay can be
significant. Also, under the Bankruptcy Code, the filing of a petition in bankruptcy by or on behalf of a junior lienor may stay
the senior lender from taking action to foreclose out a junior lien.
 
Under the Bankruptcy Code, provided certain
substantive and procedural safeguards for the lender are met, the amount and terms of a mortgage secured by property of the debtor
may be modified. In addition under certain circumstances, the outstanding amount of the loan secured by the real property may be
reduced to the then-current value of the property (with a corresponding partial reduction of the amount of the lender’s security
interest) pursuant to a confirmed plan or lien avoidance proceeding, thus leaving the lender a general unsecured creditor for the
difference between the value and the outstanding balance of the loan. Other modifications may include the reduction in the amount
of each scheduled payment, which reduction may result from a reduction in the rate of interest and/or the alteration of the repayment
schedule (with or without affecting the unpaid principal balance of the loan), and/or an extension (or reduction) of the final
maturity date. Some courts have approved bankruptcy plans, based on the particular facts of the reorganization case, that effected
the curing of a mortgage loan default by paying arrearages over a number of years. Also, under federal bankruptcy law, a bankruptcy
court may permit a debtor through its rehabilitative plan to de-accelerate a secured loan and to reinstate the loan even though
the lender accelerated the mortgage loan and final judgment of foreclosure had been entered in state court (provided no sale of
the property had yet occurred) prior to the filing of the debtor’s petition. This may be done even if the plan of reorganization
does not provide for payment in full of the amount due under the original loan. Thus, the full amount due under the original loan
may never be repaid. Other types of significant modifications to the terms of the mortgage may be acceptable to the bankruptcy
court, such as making distributions to the mortgage holder of property other than cash, or the substitution of collateral which
is the “indubitable equivalent” of the real property subject to the mortgage or the subordination of the mortgage to
liens securing new debt (provided that the lender’s secured claim
 


83

 

 
is “adequately
protected” as such term is defined and interpreted under the Bankruptcy Code), often depending on the particular facts and
circumstances of the specific case.
 
The Bankruptcy Code provides that a lender’s
perfected pre-petition security interest in leases, rents and hotel revenues continues in the post-petition leases, rents and hotel
revenues, unless a bankruptcy court orders to the contrary “based on the equities of the case.” The equities of a particular
case may permit the discontinuance of security interests in pre-petition leases and rents. Thus, unless a court orders otherwise,
revenues from a mortgaged property generated after the date the bankruptcy petition is filed will normally constitute “cash
collateral” under the Bankruptcy Code. Debtors may only use cash collateral upon obtaining the lender’s consent or
a prior court order finding that the lender’s interest in the mortgaged property and the cash collateral is “adequately
protected” as the term is defined and interpreted under the Bankruptcy Code. In addition to post-petition rents, any cash
held by a lender in a lockbox or reserve account would also constitute “cash collateral” under the Bankruptcy Code.
So long as the lender is adequately protected, a debtor’s use of cash collateral may be for its own benefit or for the benefit
of any affiliated entity group that is also subject to bankruptcy proceedings, including use as collateral for new debt. It should
be noted, however, that the court may find that the lender has no security interest in either pre-petition or post-petition revenues
if the court finds that the loan documents do not contain language covering accounts, room rents, or other forms of personalty
necessary for a security interest to attach to hotel revenues.
 
Federal bankruptcy law provides generally
that rights and obligations under an unexpired lease of the debtor/lessee may not be terminated or modified at any time after the
commencement of a case under the Bankruptcy Code solely because of a provision in the lease to that effect or because of certain
other similar events. This prohibition on so-called “ipso facto clauses” could limit the ability of the trustee to
exercise certain contractual remedies with respect to the leases on any mortgaged property. In addition, Section 362 of the
Bankruptcy Code operates as an automatic stay of, among other things, any act to obtain possession of property from a debtor’s
estate, which may delay a trustee’s exercise of those remedies, including foreclosure, in the event that a lessee becomes
the subject of a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code. For example, a mortgagee would be stayed from enforcing an assignment by
a borrower of rents and leases related to a mortgaged property if the related borrower was in a bankruptcy proceeding. The legal
proceedings necessary to resolve the issues could be time-consuming and might result in significant delays in the receipt of the
assigned rents. Similarly, the filing of a petition in bankruptcy by or on behalf of a lessee of a mortgaged property would result
in a stay against the commencement or continuation of any state court proceeding for past due rent, for accelerated rent, for damages
or for a summary eviction order with respect to a default under the related lease that occurred prior to the filing of the lessee’s
petition. While relief from the automatic stay to enforce remedies may be requested, it can be denied for a number of reasons,
including where the collateral is “necessary to an effective reorganization” for the debtor, and if a debtor’s
case has been administratively consolidated with those of its affiliates, the court may also consider whether the property is “necessary
to an effective reorganization” of the debtor and its affiliates, taken as a whole.
 
Rents and leases may also escape an assignment
(i) if the assignment is not fully perfected under state law prior to commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding, (ii) to the extent
such rents and leases are used by the borrower to maintain the mortgaged property or for other court authorized expenses, (iii)
to the extent other collateral may be substituted for the rents and leases, or (iv) to the extent the bankruptcy court determines
that the lender is adequately protected.
 
In addition, the Bankruptcy Code generally
provides that a trustee or debtor-in-possession may, with respect to an unexpired lease of non-residential real property, before
the earlier of (i) 120 days after the filing of a bankruptcy case or (ii) the entry of an order confirming a plan, subject to approval
of the court, (a) assume the lease and retain it or assign it to a third party or (b) reject the lease. If the trustee
or debtor-in-possession fails to assume or reject the lease within the time specified in the preceding sentence, subject to any
extensions by the bankruptcy court, the lease will be deemed rejected and the property will be surrendered to the lessor. The bankruptcy
court may for cause shown extend the 120-day period up to 90 days for a total of 210 days. If the lease is assumed, the trustee
in bankruptcy on behalf of the lessee, or the lessee as debtor-in-possession, or the assignee, if applicable, must cure any
 


84

 

 
defaults
under the lease, compensate the lessor for its losses and provide the lessor with “adequate assurance” of future performance.
However, these remedies may, in fact, be insufficient and the lessor may be forced to continue under the lease with a lessee that
is a poor credit risk or an unfamiliar tenant if the lease was assigned. If the lease is rejected, the rejection generally constitutes
a breach of the executory contract or unexpired lease immediately before the date of filing the petition. As a consequence, the
other party or parties to the lease, such as the borrower, as lessor under a lease, generally would have only an unsecured claim
against the debtor for damages resulting from the breach, which could adversely affect the security for the related mortgage loan.
In addition, pursuant to Section 502(b)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code, a lessor’s damages for lease rejection in respect
of future rent installments are limited to the rent reserved by the lease, without acceleration, for the greater of one year or
15 percent, not to exceed three years, of the remaining term of the lease.
 
If a trustee in bankruptcy on behalf of
a lessor, or a lessor as debtor-in-possession, rejects an unexpired lease of real property, the lessee may treat the lease as terminated
by the rejection or, in the alternative, the lessee may remain in possession of the leasehold for the balance of the term and for
any renewal or extension of the term that is enforceable by the lessee under applicable non-bankruptcy law. The Bankruptcy Code
provides that if a lessee elects to remain in possession after a rejection of a lease, the lessee may offset against rents reserved
under the lease for the balance of the term after the date of rejection of the lease, and the related renewal or extension of the
lease, any damages occurring after that date caused by the nonperformance of any obligation of the lessor under the lease after
that date.
 
In a bankruptcy or similar proceeding involving
a borrower, action may be taken seeking the recovery as a preferential transfer of any payments made by such borrower, or made
directly by the related lessee, under the related mortgage loan to the trust fund. Payments on long term debt may be protected
from recovery as preferences if they qualify for the “ordinary course” exception under the Bankruptcy Code or if certain
of the other defenses in the Bankruptcy Code are applicable. Whether any particular payment would be protected depends upon the
facts specific to a particular transaction.
 
In addition, in a bankruptcy or similar
proceeding involving any borrower, an action may be taken to avoid the transaction (or any component of the transaction, such as
joint and several liability on the related mortgage loan) as an actual or constructive fraudulent conveyance under state or federal
law. Any payment by a borrower in excess of its allocated share of the loan could be challenged as a fraudulent conveyance by creditors
of that borrower in an action outside a bankruptcy case or by the representative of the borrower’s bankruptcy estate in a
bankruptcy case. Generally, under federal and most state fraudulent conveyance statutes, the incurrence of an obligation or the
transfer of property by a person will be subject to avoidance under certain circumstances if the person did not receive fair consideration
or reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such obligation or transfer and (i) was insolvent or was rendered insolvent by such
obligation or transfer, (ii) was engaged in business or a transaction, or was about to engage in business or a transaction, for
which any property remaining with the person constituted unreasonably small capital, or (iii) intended to, or believed that it
would, incur debts that would be beyond the person’s ability to pay as such debts matured. The measure of insolvency will
vary depending on the law of the applicable jurisdiction. However, an entity will generally be considered insolvent if the present
fair salable value of its assets is less than (x) the sum of its debts or (y) the amount that would be required to pay its probable
liabilities on its existing debts as they become absolute and matured. Accordingly, a lien granted by a borrower to secure repayment
of the loan in excess of its allocated share could be avoided if a court were to determine that (i) such borrower was insolvent
at the time of granting the lien, was rendered insolvent by the granting of the lien, was left with inadequate capital, or was
not able to pay its debts as they matured and (ii) the borrower did not, when it allowed its property to be encumbered by a lien
securing the entire indebtedness represented by the loan, receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for pledging
such property for the equal benefit of each other borrower.
 
Under Sections 363(b) and (f) of the Bankruptcy
Code, a trustee, or a borrower as debtor in possession, may, under certain circumstances, despite the provisions of the related
mortgage to the contrary, sell the related mortgaged property free and clear of all liens, which liens would then attach to
 


85

 

 
the proceeds
of such sale. Such a sale may be approved by a bankruptcy court even if the proceeds are insufficient to pay the secured debt
in full.
 
Pursuant to Section 364 of the Bankruptcy
Code, a bankruptcy court may, under certain circumstances, authorize a debtor to obtain credit after the commencement of a bankruptcy
case, secured among other things, by senior, equal or junior liens on property that is already subject to a lien. In the bankruptcy
case of General Growth Properties filed on April 16, 2009, the debtors initially sought approval of a debtor-in-possession loan
to the corporate parent entities guaranteed by the property-level special purpose entities and secured by second liens on their
properties. Although the debtor-in-possession loan subsequently was modified to eliminate the subsidiary guarantees and second
liens, there can be no assurance that, in the event of a bankruptcy of the sponsor of the borrower, the sponsor of the borrower
would not seek approval of a similar debtor-in-possession loan, or that a bankruptcy court would not approve a debtor-in-possession
loan that included such subsidiary guarantees and second liens on such subsidiaries’ properties.
 
A trustee in bankruptcy, in some cases,
may be entitled to collect its costs and expenses in preserving or selling the mortgaged property ahead of payment to the lender.
In certain circumstances, a debtor in bankruptcy may have the power to grant liens senior to the lien of a mortgage, and analogous
state statutes and general principles of equity may also provide a borrower with means to halt a foreclosure proceeding or sale
and to force a restructuring of a mortgage loan on terms a lender would not otherwise accept. Moreover, the laws of certain states
also give priority to certain tax liens over the lien of a mortgage or deed of trust. Under the Bankruptcy Code, if the court finds
that actions of the mortgagee have been unreasonable, the lien of the related mortgage may be subordinated to the claims of unsecured
creditors.
 
Certain of the Borrowers May Be
Partnerships. The laws governing limited partnerships in certain states provide that the commencement of a case under the Bankruptcy
Code with respect to a general partner will cause a person to cease to be a general partner of the limited partnership, unless
otherwise provided in writing in the limited partnership agreement. This provision may be construed as an “ipso facto”
clause and, in the event of the general partner’s bankruptcy, may not be enforceable. Certain limited partnership agreements
of the borrowers may provide that the commencement of a case under the Bankruptcy Code with respect to the related general partner
constitutes an event of withdrawal (assuming the enforceability of the clause is not challenged in bankruptcy proceedings
or, if challenged, is upheld) that might trigger the dissolution of the limited partnership, the winding up of its affairs and
the distribution of its assets, unless (i) at the time there was at least one other general partner and the written provisions
of the limited partnership permit the business of the limited partnership to be carried on by the remaining general partner and
that general partner does so or (ii) the written provisions of the limited partnership agreement permit the limited partners
to agree within a specified time frame (often 60 days) after the withdrawal to continue the business of the limited partnership
and to the appointment of one or more general partners and the limited partners do so. In addition, the laws governing general
partnerships in certain states provide that the commencement of a case under the Bankruptcy Code or state bankruptcy laws with
respect to a general partner of the partnerships triggers the dissolution of the partnership, the winding up of its affairs and
the distribution of its assets. Those state laws, however, may not be enforceable or effective in a bankruptcy case. The dissolution
of a borrower, the winding up of its affairs and the distribution of its assets could result in an acceleration of its payment
obligation under the borrower’s mortgage loan, which may reduce the yield on the certificates in the same manner as a principal
prepayment.
 
In addition, the bankruptcy of the general
or limited partner of a borrower that is a partnership, or the bankruptcy of a member of a borrower that is a limited liability
company or the bankruptcy of a shareholder of a borrower that is a corporation may provide the opportunity in the bankruptcy case
of the partner, member or shareholder to obtain an order from a court consolidating the assets and liabilities of the partner,
member or shareholder with those of the mortgagor pursuant to the doctrines of substantive consolidation or piercing the corporate
veil. In such a case, the respective mortgaged property, for example, would become property of the estate of the bankrupt partner,
member or shareholder. Not only would the mortgaged property be available to satisfy the claims of creditors of the partner, member
or
 


86

 

 
shareholder,
but an automatic stay would apply to any attempt by the trustee to exercise remedies with respect to the mortgaged property. However,
such an occurrence should not affect the trustee’s status as a secured creditor with respect to the mortgagor or its security
interest in the mortgaged property.
 
A borrower that is a limited partnership,
in many cases, may be required by the loan documents to have a special purpose entity as its sole general partner, and a borrower
that is a general partnership, in many cases, may be required by the loan documents to have as its general partners only entities
that are special purpose entities. A borrower that is a limited liability company may be required by the loan documents to have
a special purpose member or a springing member. All borrowers that are tenants-in-common may be required by the loan documents
to be special purpose entities. These provisions are designed to mitigate the risk of the dissolution or bankruptcy of the borrower
partnership or its general partner, a borrower limited liability company or its member (if applicable), or a borrower that is a
tenant-in-common. However, we cannot assure you that any borrower partnership or its general partner, or any borrower limited liability
company or its member (if applicable), or a borrower that is a tenant-in-common, will not dissolve or become a debtor under the
Bankruptcy Code.
 
Environmental Risks
 
Real property pledged as security for a
mortgage loan may be subject to certain environmental risks. Under federal law, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (also known as “CERCLA”) and the laws of certain states,
failure to perform the remediation required or demanded by the state or federal government of any condition or circumstance that:
 


·
may pose an imminent or substantial endangerment to
human health or welfare or the environment,




 
 




·
may result in a release or threatened release of any
hazardous material,




 
 




·
may give rise to any environmental claim or demand,
or




 
 




·
may give rise to a lien on the property to ensure
the reimbursement of remedial costs incurred by the federal or state government. In several states, the lien has priority over
the lien of an existing mortgage against the property. Of particular concern may be those mortgaged properties which are, or have
been, the site of manufacturing, industrial or hazardous material treatment, storage or disposal activity. Those environmental
risks may give rise to (a) a diminution in value of property securing a mortgage note or the inability to foreclose against
the property or (b) in certain circumstances as more fully described below, liability for clean-up costs or other remedial
actions, which liability could exceed the value of the property, the aggregate assets of the owner or operator, or the principal
balance of the related indebtedness.


 
The state of the law is currently unclear
as to whether and under what circumstances cleanup costs, or the obligation to take remedial actions, could be imposed on a secured
lender. Under the laws of some states and under CERCLA, a lender may become liable as an “owner” or an “operator”
of a contaminated mortgaged property for the costs of remediation of releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at
the mortgaged property. The liability may attach if the lender or its agents or employees have participated in the management of
the operations of the borrower, even though the environmental damage or threat was caused by a prior owner, operator, or other
third party.
 
Excluded from CERCLA’s definition
of “owner or operator” is any person “who, without participating in the management of a vessel or facility, holds
indicia of ownership primarily to protect his security interest” (the “secured-creditor exemption”). This
exemption for holders of a security interest such as a secured lender applies only in circumstances when the lender seeks to protect
its security interest in the contaminated facility or property. Thus, if a lender’s activities encroach on the actual management
of that facility or property or of the borrower, the lender faces potential liability as an “owner or operator” under
CERCLA. Similarly, when a lender forecloses and takes title to a contaminated facility or property
 


87

 

 
(whether
it holds the facility or property as an investment or leases it to a third party), under some circumstances the lender may incur
potential CERCLA liability.
 
Amendments to CERCLA provide examples of
permissible actions that may be undertaken by a lender holding security in a contaminated facility without exceeding the bounds
of the secured-creditor exemption, subject to certain conditions and limitations. Additionally, the amendments provide certain
protections from CERCLA liability as an “owner or operator” to a lender who forecloses on contaminated property, as
long as it seeks to divest itself of the facility at the earliest practicable commercially reasonable time on commercially reasonable
terms. The amendments also limit the potential liability of lenders under the federal Solid Waste Disposal Act for costs of responding
to leaking underground storage tanks. However, the protections afforded lenders under the amendments are subject to terms and conditions
that have not been clarified by the courts. Moreover, the CERCLA secured-creditor exemption does not necessarily affect the potential
for liability in actions under other federal or state laws which may impose liability on “owners or operators” but
do not incorporate the secured-creditor exemption. Furthermore, the secured-creditor exemption does not protect lenders from other
bases of CERCLA liability, such as that imposed on “generators” or “transporters” of hazardous substances.
 
Environmental clean-up costs may be substantial.
It is possible that those costs could become a liability of the applicable trust fund and occasion a loss to certificateholders
if those remedial costs were incurred.
 
In a few states, transfers of some types
of properties are conditioned upon clean-up of contamination prior to transfer. It is possible that a property securing a mortgage
loan could be subject to these transfer restrictions. If this occurs, and if the lender becomes the owner upon foreclosure, the
lender may be required to clean up the contamination before selling the property.
 
The cost of remediating hazardous substance
contamination at a property can be substantial. If a lender is or becomes liable, it can bring an action for contribution against
the owner or operator that created the environmental hazard, but that person or entity may be without substantial assets. Accordingly,
it is possible that these costs could become a liability of a trust fund and occasion a loss to certificateholders of the related
series.
 
To reduce the likelihood of this kind of
loss, the related Pooling Agreement may provide that the master servicer may not, on behalf of the trust fund, acquire title to
a Mortgaged Property or take over its operation unless the master servicer, based on a report prepared by a person who regularly
conducts environmental site assessments, has made the determination that it is appropriate to do so. There can be no assurance
that any environmental site assessment obtained by the master servicer will detect all possible environmental contamination or
conditions or that the other requirements of the related pooling and servicing agreement, even if fully observed by the master
servicer, will in fact insulate the related trust fund from liability with respect to environmental matters.
 
Even when a lender is not directly liable
for cleanup costs on property securing loans, if a property securing a loan is contaminated, the value of the security is likely
to be affected. In addition, a lender bears the risk that unanticipated cleanup costs may jeopardize the borrower’s repayment.
Neither of these two issues is likely to pose risks exceeding the amount of unpaid principal and interest of a particular loan
secured by a contaminated property, particularly if the lender declines to foreclose on a mortgage secured by the property.
 
If a lender forecloses on a mortgage secured
by a property the operations of which are subject to environmental laws and regulations, the lender will be required to operate
the property in accordance with those laws and regulations. Compliance could be complicated and may entail substantial expense.
 
In addition, a lender may be obligated to
disclose environmental conditions on a property to government entities and/or to prospective buyers, including prospective buyers
at a foreclosure sale or following foreclosure. That disclosure may decrease the amount that prospective buyers are willing to
pay for the affected property and thereby lessen the ability of the lender to recover its investment in a loan upon foreclosure.

Due-on-Sale and Due-on-Encumbrance
 
Certain of the mortgage loans may contain
“due-on-sale” and “due-on-encumbrance” clauses that purport to permit the lender to accelerate the maturity
of the loan if the borrower transfers or encumbers the related Mortgaged Property. The Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions
Act of 1982 (the “Garn Act”) generally preempts state laws that prohibit the enforcement of due-on-sale clauses
by providing, among other things, that “due-on-sale” clauses in certain loans are enforceable within certain limitations
as set forth in the Garn Act. Therefore, subject to those limitations, a master servicer may have the right to accelerate the maturity
of a mortgage loan that contains a “due-on-sale” provision upon transfer of an interest in the property, whether or
not the master servicer can demonstrate that the transfer threatens its security interest in the property.
 
Subordinate Financing
 
Certain of the mortgage loans may not restrict
the ability of the borrower to use the Mortgaged Property as security for one or more additional loans. Where a borrower encumbers
a mortgaged property with one or more junior liens, the senior lender is subjected to additional risk. First, the borrower may
have difficulty servicing and repaying multiple loans. Moreover, if the subordinate financing permits recourse to the borrower,
as is frequently the case, and the senior loan does not, a borrower may have more incentive to repay sums due on the subordinate
loan. Second, acts of the senior lender that prejudice the junior lender or impair the junior lender’s security may create
a superior equity in favor of the junior lender. For example, if the borrower and the senior lender agree to an increase in the
principal amount of or the interest rate payable on the senior loan, the senior lender may lose its priority to the extent any
existing junior lender is harmed or the borrower is additionally burdened. Third, if the borrower defaults on the senior loan and/or
any junior loan or loans, the existence of junior loans and actions taken by junior lenders can impair the security available to
the senior lender and can interfere with or delay the taking of action by the senior lender. Moreover, the bankruptcy of a junior
lender may operate to stay foreclosure or similar proceedings by the senior lender.
 
Default Interest and Limitations
on Prepayments
 
Mortgage notes and mortgages may contain
provisions that obligate the borrower to pay a late charge or additional interest if payments are not timely made, and in some
circumstances, may prohibit prepayments for a specified period and/or condition prepayments upon the borrower’s payment of
prepayment fees or yield maintenance penalties. In certain states, there are or may be specific limitations upon the late charges
which a lender may collect from a borrower for delinquent payments. Certain states also limit the amounts that a lender may collect
from a borrower as an additional charge or fee if the loan is prepaid. In addition, the enforceability of provisions that provide
for prepayment fees or penalties upon an involuntary prepayment is unclear under the laws of many states.
 
Applicability of Usury Laws
 
Title V of the Depository Institutions
Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 (“Title V”) provides that state usury limitations shall not
apply to certain types of residential, including multifamily but not commercial, first mortgage loans originated by certain lenders
after March 31, 1980. A similar Federal statute was in effect with respect to mortgage loans made during the first three months
of 1980. The statute authorized any state to reimpose interest rate limits by adopting, before April 1, 1983, a law or constitutional
provision that expressly rejects application of the federal law. In addition, even where Title V is not so rejected, any state
is authorized by the law to adopt a provision limiting discount points or other charges on mortgage loans covered by Title V.
Certain states have taken action to reimpose interest rate limits and/or to limit discount points or other charges.
 
In any state in which application of Title V
has been expressly rejected or a provision limiting discount points or other charges has been adopted, no mortgage loan originated
after the date of that state action will (if originated after that rejection or adoption) be eligible for inclusion in a trust
fund unless (1) the mortgage loan provides for an interest rate, discount points and charges as are permitted in that state
or
 


89

 

 
(2) the
mortgage loan provides that the terms are to be construed in accordance with the laws of another state under which the interest
rate, discount points and charges would not be usurious and the borrower’s counsel has rendered an opinion that the choice
of law provision would be given effect.
 
Statutes differ in their provisions as to
the consequences of a usurious loan. One group of statutes requires the lender to forfeit the interest due above the applicable
limit or impose a specified penalty. Under this statutory scheme, the borrower may cancel the recorded mortgage or deed of trust
upon paying its debt with lawful interest, and the lender may foreclose, but only for the debt plus lawful interest. A second group of
statutes is more severe. A violation of this type of usury law results in the invalidation of the transaction, thereby permitting
the borrower to cancel the recorded mortgage or deed of trust without any payment or prohibiting the lender from foreclosing.
 
Servicemembers Civil Relief
Act
 
Under the terms of the Servicemembers Civil
Relief Act (the “Relief Act”), a borrower who enters military service after the origination of that borrower’s
mortgage loan, including a borrower who was in reserve status and is called to active duty after origination of the mortgage loan,
upon notification by such borrower, shall not be charged interest, including fees and charges, in excess of 6% per annum during
the period of that borrower’s active duty status. In addition to adjusting the interest, the lender must forgive any such
interest in excess of 6% unless a court or administrative agency orders otherwise upon application of the lender. The Relief Act
applies to individuals who are members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, National Guard, Reserves, Coast Guard and officers
of the U.S. Public Health Service or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration assigned to duty with the military. Because
the Relief Act applies to individuals who enter military service, including reservists who are called to active duty, after origination
of the related mortgage loan, no information can be provided as to the number of loans with individuals as borrowers that may be
affected by the Relief Act. Application of the Relief Act would adversely affect, for an indeterminate period of time, the ability
of any servicer to collect full amounts of interest on certain of the mortgage loans. Any shortfalls in interest collections resulting
from the application of the Relief Act would result in a reduction of the amounts distributable to the holders of the related series
of certificates, and would not be covered by advances or, any form of credit support provided in connection with those certificates.
In addition, the Relief Act imposes limitations that would impair the ability of the servicer to foreclose on an affected mortgage
loan during the borrower’s period of active duty status, and, under certain circumstances, during an additional three-month
period thereafter.
 
Type of Mortgaged Property
 
The lender may be subject to additional
risk depending upon the type and use of the Mortgaged Property in question. For instance, Mortgaged Properties which are hospitals,
nursing homes or convalescent homes may present special risks to lenders in large part due to significant governmental regulation
of the operation, maintenance, control and financing of health care institutions. Mortgages on Mortgaged Properties which are owned
by the borrower under a condominium form of ownership are subject to the declaration, by-laws and other rules and regulations of
the condominium association. Mortgaged Properties which are hotels or motels may present additional risk to the lender in that:
 
1.      
hotels and motels are typically operated pursuant to franchise, management and operating agreements which may be terminable
by the operator; and
 
2.      
the transferability of the hotel’s operating, liquor and other licenses to the entity acquiring the hotel either through
purchase or foreclosure is subject to the vagaries of local law requirements.
 
In addition, Mortgaged Properties which
are multifamily properties or cooperatively owned multifamily properties may be subject to rent control laws, which could impact
the future cash flows of those properties.
 


90

 

 
Americans with Disabilities
Act
 
Under Title III of the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990 and rules promulgated under this act (the “ADA”), in order to protect individuals with
disabilities, public accommodations (such as hotels, restaurants, shopping centers, hospitals, schools and social service center
establishments) must remove architectural and communication barriers which are structural in nature from existing places of public
accommodation to the extent “readily achievable.” In addition, under the ADA, alterations to a place of public accommodation
or a commercial facility are to be made so that, to the maximum extent feasible, the altered portions are readily accessible to
and usable by disabled individuals. The “readily achievable” standard takes into account, among other factors, the
financial resources of the affected site, owner, landlord or other applicable person. In addition to imposing a possible financial
burden on the borrower in its capacity as owner or landlord, the ADA may also impose these requirements on a foreclosing lender
who succeeds to the interest of the borrower as owner or landlord. Furthermore, since the “readily achievable” standard
may vary depending on the financial condition of the owner or landlord, a foreclosing lender who is financially more capable than
the borrower of complying with the requirements of the ADA may be subject to more stringent requirements than those to which the
borrower is subject.
 
Anti-Money Laundering, Economic
Sanctions and Bribery
 
Many jurisdictions have adopted wide-ranging
anti-money laundering, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, and regulations (collectively,
the “Requirements”).  Any of the Depositor, the Issuing Entity, the Underwriters, the Master Servicer,
the Special Servicer or the Trustee could be requested or required to obtain certain assurances from prospective investors intending
to purchase Certificates and to retain such information or to disclose information pertaining to them to governmental, regulatory
or other authorities or to financial intermediaries or engage in due diligence or take other related actions in the future. 
It is the policy of the Depositor, the Issuing Entity, the Underwriters, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Trustee
to comply with Requirements to which they are or may become subject and to interpret such Requirements broadly in favor of disclosure. 
Failure to honor any request by the Depositor, the Issuing Entity, the Underwriters, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer
or the Trustee to provide requested information or take such other actions as may be necessary or advisable for the Depositor,
the Issuing Entity, the Underwriters, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee to comply with any Requirements,
related legal process or appropriate requests (whether formal or informal) may result in, among other things, a forced sale to
another investor of such investor’s Certificates.  In addition, each of the Depositor, the Issuing Entity, the Underwriters,
the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Trustee intends to comply with the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, the United and Strengthening
America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”)
and any other anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws,
and regulations of the United States and other countries, and will disclose any information required or requested by authorities
in connection therewith.
 
Potential Forfeiture of Assets
 
Federal law provides that assets (including
property purchased or improved with assets) derived from criminal activity or otherwise tainted, or used in the commission of
certain offenses, is subject to the blocking requirements of economic sanctions laws and regulations, and can be blocked and/or
seized and ordered forfeited to the United States of America. A number of offenses can trigger such a blocking and/or seizure
and forfeiture including, among others, violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the Bank Secrecy
Act, the Money Laundering Control Act, the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations issued pursuant to all of them, as well as the
controlled substance laws. In many instances, the United States may seize the property civilly
without a criminal prosecution. 
 
In the event of a forfeiture proceeding,
a financial institution that is a lender may be able to establish its interest in the property by proving that (a) its Mortgage
was executed and recorded before the commission of the illegal conduct from which the assets used to purchase or improve the property
were
 


91

 

 
derived
or before the commission of any other crime upon which the forfeiture is based, or (b) at the time of the execution of the Mortgage,
despite appropriate due diligence, it “did not know or was reasonably without cause to believe that the property was subject
to forfeiture.” However, there is no assurance that such a defense will be successful. 
 
MATERIAL
FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES
 
The following is a general discussion of
the anticipated material federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of certificates. The discussion
below does not purport to address all federal income tax consequences that may be applicable to particular categories of investors,
some of which may be subject to special rules. Further, the authorities on which this discussion is based are subject to change
or differing interpretations, and any change or interpretation could apply retroactively. No rulings have been or will be sought
from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) with respect to any of the federal income tax consequences discussed
below. Accordingly, the IRS may take contrary positions. This discussion reflects the applicable provisions of the Code as well
as regulations (the “REMIC Regulations”) promulgated by the U.S. Department of Treasury (the “Treasury”).
Investors should consult their own tax advisors in determining the federal, state, local and other tax consequences to them of
the purchase, ownership and disposition of certificates.
 
For purposes of this discussion, (1) references
to the mortgage loans include references to the mortgage loans underlying MBS included in the mortgage assets and (2) where
the applicable prospectus supplement provides for a fixed retained yield with respect to the mortgage loans underlying a series
of certificates, references to the mortgage loans will be deemed to refer to that portion of the mortgage loans held by the trust
fund which does not include the Retained Interest. References to a “holder” or “certificateholder” in this
discussion generally mean the beneficial owner of a certificate.
 
Federal
Income Tax Consequences for REMIC Certificates
 
General
 
With respect to a particular series of certificates,
an election may be made to treat the trust fund or one or more segregated pools of assets in the trust fund as one or more REMICs
within the meaning of Code Section 860D. A trust fund or a portion of a trust fund as to which a REMIC election is made will
be referred to as a “REMIC Pool.” For purposes of this discussion, certificates of a series as to which one
or more REMIC elections are made are referred to as “REMIC Certificates” and will consist of one or more classes
of “Regular Certificates” and one class of Residual Certificates in the case of each REMIC Pool. Qualification
as a REMIC requires ongoing compliance with certain conditions. With respect to each series of REMIC Certificates, Cadwalader,
Wickersham & Taft LLP, counsel to the Depositor, will deliver its opinion generally to the effect that, assuming:
 
1.      
the making of an election,
 
2.      
compliance with the Pooling Agreement and any other governing documents and
 
3.      
compliance with any changes in the law, including any amendments to the Code or applicable Treasury regulations under the
Code,
 
each REMIC Pool will qualify as
a REMIC.
 
In that case, the Regular Certificates will
be considered to be “regular interests” in the REMIC Pool and generally will be treated for federal income tax purposes
as if they were newly originated debt instruments, and the Residual Certificates will be considered to be “residual interests”
in the REMIC Pool. The prospectus supplement for each series of certificates will indicate whether one or more REMIC elections
with respect to the related trust fund will be made, in which event references to “REMIC” or “REMIC
Pool” below shall be deemed to refer to that REMIC Pool. If so specified in the applicable
 


92

 

 
prospectus
supplement, the portion of a trust fund as to which a REMIC election is not made may be treated as a grantor trust for federal
income tax purposes. See “—Federal Income Tax Consequences for Certificates as to Which No REMIC Election Is Made”
below.
 
Characterization
of Investments in REMIC Certificates
 
REMIC Certificates held by a domestic building
and loan association will constitute “a regular or residual interest in a REMIC” within the meaning of Code Section 7701(a)(19)(C)(xi),
but only in the same proportion that the assets of the REMIC Pool would be treated as “loans . . . secured by an interest
in real property which is . . . residential real property” (such as single family or multifamily properties, but not commercial
properties) within the meaning of Code Section 7701(a)(19)(C)(v) or as other assets described in Code Section 7701(a)(19)(C),
and otherwise will not qualify for that treatment. REMIC Certificates held by a real estate investment trust will constitute “real
estate assets” within the meaning of Code Section 856(c)(5)(B), and interest, including original issue discount, on
the Regular Certificates and income with respect to Residual Certificates will be considered “interest on obligations secured
by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property” within the meaning of Code Section 856(c)(3)(B) if received
by a real estate investment trust in the same proportion that, for both purposes, the assets of the REMIC Pool would be so treated.
If at all times 95% or more of the assets of the REMIC Pool qualify for each of the foregoing respective treatments, the REMIC
Certificates will qualify for the corresponding status in their entirety. Mortgage Loans held by the REMIC Pool that have been
defeased with U.S. Treasury obligations will not qualify for the foregoing treatments. For purposes of Code Section 856(c)(5)(B),
payments of principal and interest on the mortgage loans that are reinvested pending distribution to holders of REMIC Certificates
qualify for that treatment. Where two REMIC Pools are a part of a tiered structure they will be treated as one REMIC for purposes
of the tests described above respecting asset ownership of more or less than 95%. Regular Certificates will be “qualified
mortgages” for another REMIC for purposes of Code Section 860G(a)(3). REMIC Certificates held by a regulated investment
company will not constitute “Government Securities” within the meaning of Code Section 851(b)(3)(A)(i). REMIC
Certificates held by certain financial institutions will constitute an “evidence of indebtedness” within the meaning
of Code Section 582(c)(1).
 
Qualification
as a REMIC
 
In order for the REMIC Pool to qualify as
a REMIC, there must be ongoing compliance on the part of the REMIC Pool with the requirements set forth in the Code. The REMIC
Pool must fulfill an asset test, which requires that no more than a de minimis portion of the assets of the REMIC Pool,
as of the close of the third calendar month beginning after the “Startup Day” (which for purposes of this discussion
is the date of issuance of the REMIC Certificates) and at all times thereafter, may consist of assets other than “qualified
mortgages” and “permitted investments.” The REMIC Regulations provide a safe harbor pursuant to which the de
minimis requirement is met if at all times the aggregate adjusted basis of the nonqualified assets is less than 1% of the aggregate
adjusted basis of all the REMIC Pool’s assets. An entity that fails to meet the safe harbor may nevertheless demonstrate
that it holds no more than a de minimis amount of nonqualified assets. A REMIC also must provide “reasonable arrangements”
to prevent its residual interest from being held by “disqualified organizations” and must furnish applicable tax information
to transferors or agents that violate this requirement. The Pooling Agreement for each series will contain a provision designed
to meet this requirement. See “—Taxation of Residual Certificates—Tax-Related Restrictions on Transfer of
Residual Certificates—Disqualified Organizations” below.
 
A qualified mortgage is any obligation that
is principally secured by an interest in real property and that is either transferred to the REMIC Pool on the Startup Day in exchange
for regular or residual interests, or is either purchased by the REMIC Pool within a three-month period thereafter or represents
an increase in the loan advanced to the obligor under its original terms, in each case pursuant to a fixed price contract in effect
on the Startup Day. Qualified mortgages include (i) whole mortgage loans, such as the mortgage loans, (ii) certificates
of beneficial interest in a grantor trust that holds mortgage loans, including certain of the MBS, (iii) regular interests
in another REMIC, such as MBS in a trust as to which a REMIC election has been made, (iv) loans secured by timeshare interests
and (v) loans secured by shares held by a tenant stockholder in a cooperative housing corporation, provided, in general:
 


93

 

 
1.      
the fair market value of the real property security (including buildings and structural components) is at least 80% of the
principal balance of the related mortgage loan or mortgage loan underlying the mortgage certificate either at origination or as
of the Startup Day (an original loan-to-value ratio of not more than 125% with respect to the real property security), or
 
2.      
substantially all the proceeds of the mortgage loan or the underlying mortgage loan were used to acquire, improve or protect
an interest in real property that, at the origination date, was the only security for the mortgage loan or underlying mortgage
loan.
 
If the mortgage loan has been significantly
modified prior to the closing date other than in connection with a default or reasonably foreseeable default, it must meet the
loan-to-value test in the first bullet point of the preceding sentence as of the date of the last modification or at closing. A
qualified mortgage includes a qualified replacement mortgage, which is any obligation that would have been treated as a qualified
mortgage if it were transferred to the REMIC Pool on the Startup Day and that is received either (1) in exchange for any qualified
mortgage within a three-month period thereafter or (2) in exchange for a defective obligation within a two-year period thereafter.
A “defective obligation” includes:
 


·
a mortgage in default or as to which default is reasonably
foreseeable,




 
 




·
a mortgage as to which a customary representation
or warranty made at the time of transfer to the REMIC Pool has been breached,




 
 




·
a mortgage that was fraudulently procured by the mortgagor,
and




 
 




·
a mortgage that was not in fact principally secured
by real property (but only if the mortgage is disposed of within 90 days of discovery).


 
A mortgage loan that is defective as described
in the 4th clause in the immediately preceding sentence that is not sold or, if within two years of the Startup Day,
exchanged, within 90 days of discovery, ceases to be a qualified mortgage after that 90-day period.
 
Permitted investments include cash flow
investments, qualified reserve assets, and foreclosure property. A cash flow investment is an investment, earning a return in the
nature of interest, of amounts received on or with respect to qualified mortgages for a temporary period, not exceeding 13 months,
until the next scheduled distribution to holders of interests in the REMIC Pool. A qualified reserve asset is any intangible property
held for investment that is part of any reasonably required reserve maintained by the REMIC Pool to provide for payments of expenses
of the REMIC Pool or amounts due on the regular or residual interests in the event of defaults (including delinquencies) on the
qualified mortgages, lower than expected reinvestment returns, prepayment interest shortfalls and certain other contingencies.
In addition, a reserve fund (limited to not more than 50% of the REMIC Pool’s initial assets) may be used to provide a source
of funds for the purchase of increases in the balances of qualified mortgages pursuant to their terms. A reserve fund will be disqualified
if more than 30% of the gross income from the assets in the fund for the year is derived from the sale or other disposition of
property held for less than three months, unless required to prevent a default on the regular interests caused by a default on
one or more qualified mortgages. A reserve fund must be reduced “promptly and appropriately” to the extent no longer
required. Foreclosure property is real property acquired by the REMIC Pool in connection with the default or imminent default of
a qualified mortgage, provided the Depositor had no knowledge that the mortgage loan would go into default at the time it was transferred
to the REMIC Pool. Foreclosure property generally must be disposed of prior to the close of the third calendar year following the
acquisition of the property by the REMIC Pool, with an extension that may be granted by the IRS.
 
In addition to the foregoing requirements,
the various interests in a REMIC Pool also must meet certain requirements. All of the interests in a REMIC Pool must be either
of the following: (1) one or more classes of regular interests or (2) a single class of residual interests on which distributions,
if any, are made pro rata. A regular interest is an interest in a REMIC Pool that is issued on the Startup Day with fixed terms,
is designated as a regular interest, and unconditionally entitles the holder to receive a specified principal amount (or other
similar amount), and provides that interest payments (or other similar
 


94

 

 
amounts),
if any, at or before maturity either are payable based on a fixed rate or a qualified variable rate, or consist of a specified,
nonvarying portion of the interest payments on qualified mortgages. The specified portion may consist of a fixed number of basis
points, a fixed percentage of the total interest, or a fixed or qualified variable or inverse variable rate on some or all of
the qualified mortgages minus a different fixed or qualified variable rate. The specified principal amount of a regular interest
that provides for interest payments consisting of a specified, nonvarying portion of interest payments on qualified mortgages
may be zero. A residual interest is an interest in a REMIC Pool other than a regular interest that is issued on the Startup Day
and that is designated as a residual interest. An interest in a REMIC Pool may be treated as a regular interest even if payments
of principal with respect to that interest are subordinated to payments on other regular interests or the residual interest in
the REMIC Pool, and are dependent on the absence of defaults or delinquencies on qualified mortgages or permitted investments,
lower than reasonably expected returns on permitted investments, unanticipated expenses incurred by the REMIC Pool or prepayment
interest shortfalls. Accordingly, the Regular Certificates of a series will constitute one or more classes of regular interests,
and the Residual Certificates for each REMIC Pool of that series will constitute a single class of residual interests on which
distributions are made pro rata.
 
If an entity, such as the REMIC Pool, fails
to comply with one or more of the ongoing requirements of the Code for REMIC status during any taxable year, the Code provides
that the entity will not be treated as a REMIC for that year and thereafter. In this event, an entity with multiple classes of
ownership interests may be treated as a separate association taxable as a corporation under Treasury regulations, and the Regular
Certificates may be treated as equity interests in the REMIC Pool. The Code, however, authorizes the Treasury Department to issue
regulations that address situations where failure to meet one or more of the requirements for REMIC status occurs inadvertently
and in good faith, and disqualification of the REMIC Pool would occur absent regulatory relief. Investors should be aware, however,
that the Conference Committee Report to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (the “Reform Act”) indicates that the relief
may be accompanied by sanctions, such as the imposition of a corporate tax on all or a portion of the REMIC Pool’s income
for the period of time in which the requirements for REMIC status are not satisfied.
 
Exchangeable Certificates. If a series
of certificates includes Exchangeable Certificates, each class of Exchangeable Certificates will represent beneficial ownership
of one or more interests in one or more REMIC regular interests. The related prospectus supplement will specify whether each class
of Exchangeable Certificates represents a proportionate or disproportionate interest in each underlying REMIC regular interest.
The exchangeable certificates will be created, sold and administered pursuant to an arrangement that will be treated as a grantor
trust under subpart E, part I of subchapter J of the Code. The tax treatment of Exchangeable Certificates is discussed under “—Tax
Treatment of Exchangeable Certificates” below.
 
Taxation
of Regular Certificates
 
General.
 
A regular interest will be treated as a
newly originated debt instrument for federal income tax purposes. In general, interest, original issue discount and market discount
on a Regular Certificate will be treated as ordinary income to a holder of the Regular Certificate (the “Regular Certificateholder”)
as they accrue, and principal payments on a Regular Certificate will be treated as a return of capital to the extent of the Regular
Certificateholder’s basis in the Regular Certificate allocable thereto (other than accrued market discount not yet reported
as ordinary income). Regular Certificateholders must use the accrual method of accounting with regard to Regular Certificates,
regardless of the method of accounting otherwise used by those Regular Certificateholders.
 
Original Issue Discount.
 
Accrual Certificates and principal-only
certificates will be, and other classes of Regular Certificates may be, issued with “original issue discount” within
the meaning of Code Section 1273(a). Holders of any class of Regular Certificates having original issue discount generally
must include original issue discount in ordinary income for federal income tax purposes as it accrues, in accordance with the constant
yield
 


95

 

 
method
that takes into account the compounding of interest, in advance of receipt of the cash attributable to that income. The following
discussion is based in part on Treasury regulations (the “OID Regulations”) under Code Sections 1271 through
1275 and in part on the provisions of the Reform Act. Regular Certificateholders should be aware, however, that the OID Regulations
do not adequately address certain issues relevant to prepayable securities, such as the Regular Certificates. To the extent those
issues are not addressed in those regulations, the Depositor intends to apply the methodology described in the Conference Committee
Report to the Reform Act. We cannot assure you that the IRS will not take a different position as to those matters not currently
addressed by the OID Regulations. Moreover, the OID Regulations include an anti-abuse rule allowing the IRS to apply or depart
from the OID Regulations where necessary or appropriate to ensure a reasonable tax result in light of the applicable statutory
provisions. A tax result will not be considered unreasonable under the anti-abuse rule in the absence of a substantial effect
on the present value of a taxpayer’s tax liability. Investors are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the discussion
in this prospectus and the appropriate method for reporting interest and original issue discount with respect to the Regular Certificates.
 
Each Regular Certificate, except to the
extent described below with respect to a Regular Certificate on which principal is distributed by random lot (“Random
Lot Certificates”), will be treated as a single installment obligation for purposes of determining the original issue
discount includible in a Regular Certificateholder’s income. The total amount of original issue discount on a Regular Certificate
is the excess of the “stated redemption price at maturity” of the Regular Certificate over its “issue price.”
The issue price of a class of Regular Certificates offered pursuant to this prospectus generally is the first price at which a
substantial amount of Regular Certificates of that class is sold to the public (excluding bond houses, brokers and underwriters).
Although unclear under the OID Regulations, the Depositor intends to treat the issue price of a class as to which there is no substantial
sale as of the issue date or that is retained by the Depositor as the fair market value of that class as of the issue date. The
issue price of a Regular Certificate also includes the amount paid by an initial Regular Certificateholder for accrued interest
that relates to a period prior to the issue date of the Regular Certificate, unless the Regular Certificateholder elects on its
federal income tax return to exclude that amount from the issue price and to recover it on the first distribution date. The stated
redemption price at maturity of a Regular Certificate always includes the original principal amount of the Regular Certificate,
but generally will not include distributions of stated interest if those interest distributions constitute “qualified stated
interest.” Under the OID Regulations, qualified stated interest generally means interest payable at a single fixed rate or
a qualified variable rate (as described below) provided that those interest payments are unconditionally payable at intervals of
one year or less during the entire term of the Regular Certificate. Because there is no penalty or default remedy in the case of
nonpayment of interest with respect to a Regular Certificate, it is possible that no interest on any class of Regular Certificates
will be treated as qualified stated interest. However, except as provided in the following three sentences or in the applicable
prospectus supplement, because the underlying mortgage loans provide for remedies in the event of default, we intend to treat interest
with respect to the Regular Certificates as qualified stated interest. Distributions of interest on an Accrual Certificate, or
on other Regular Certificates with respect to which deferred interest will accrue, will not constitute qualified stated interest,
in which case the stated redemption price at maturity of the Regular Certificates includes all distributions of interest as well
as principal on those Regular Certificates. Likewise, we intend to treat an “interest only” class, or a class on which
interest is substantially disproportionate to its principal amount, a so-called “super-premium” class, as having no
qualified stated interest. Where the interval between the issue date and the first distribution date on a Regular Certificate is
shorter than the interval between subsequent distribution dates, the interest attributable to the additional days will
be included in the stated redemption price at maturity.
 
Under a de minimis rule, original
issue discount on a Regular Certificate will be considered to be zero if the original issue discount is less than 0.25% of the
stated redemption price at maturity of the Regular Certificate multiplied by the weighted average maturity of the Regular Certificate.
For this purpose, the weighted average maturity of the Regular Certificate is computed as the sum of the amounts determined by
multiplying the number of full years (i.e., rounding down partial years) from the issue date until each distribution
is scheduled to be made by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of each distribution included in the stated redemption
price at maturity of the Regular Certificate and the denominator of which is the stated redemption price at maturity of the Regular
Certificate. The
 


96

 

 
Conference
Committee Report to the Reform Act provides that the schedule of distributions should be determined in accordance with the assumed
rate of prepayment of the mortgage loans (the “Prepayment Assumption”) and the anticipated reinvestment rate,
if any, relating to the Regular Certificates. The Prepayment Assumption with respect to a Series of Regular Certificates will
be set forth in the related prospectus supplement. Holders generally must report de minimis original issue discount pro
rata as principal payments are received, and that income will be capital gain if the Regular Certificate is held as a capital
asset. However, under the OID Regulations, Regular Certificateholders may elect to accrue all de minimis original issue
discount as well as market discount and market premium under the constant yield method. See “—Election to Treat
All Interest Under the Constant Yield Method” below.
 
A Regular Certificateholder generally must
include in gross income for any taxable year the sum of the “daily portions,” as defined below, of the original issue
discount on the Regular Certificate accrued during an accrual period for each day on which it holds the Regular Certificate, including
the date of purchase but excluding the date of disposition. We intend to treat the monthly period ending on the day before each
distribution date as the accrual period. With respect to each Regular Certificate, a calculation will be made of the original issue
discount that accrues during each successive full accrual period, or shorter period from the date of original issue, that ends
on the day before the related distribution date on the Regular Certificate. The Conference Committee Report to the Reform Act states
that the rate of accrual of original issue discount is intended to be based on the Prepayment Assumption. Other than as discussed
below with respect to a Random Lot Certificate, the original issue discount accruing in a full accrual period would be the excess,
if any, of:
 
1.      
the sum of (a) the present value of all of the remaining distributions to be made on the Regular Certificate as of
the end of that accrual period that are included in the Regular Certificate’s stated redemption price at maturity and (b) the
distributions made on the Regular Certificate during the accrual period that are included in the Regular Certificate’s stated
redemption price at maturity, over
 
2.      
the adjusted issue price of the Regular Certificate at the beginning of the accrual period.
 
The present value of the remaining distributions
referred to in the preceding sentence is calculated based on:
 
1.      
the yield to maturity of the Regular Certificate at the issue date,
 
2.      
events (including actual prepayments) that have occurred prior to the end of the accrual period, and
 
3.      
the Prepayment Assumption.
 
For these purposes, the adjusted issue price
of a Regular Certificate at the beginning of any accrual period equals the issue price of the Regular Certificate, increased by
the aggregate amount of original issue discount with respect to the Regular Certificate that accrued in all prior accrual periods
and reduced by the amount of distributions included in the Regular Certificate’s stated redemption price at maturity that
were made on the Regular Certificate in those prior periods. The original issue discount accruing during any accrual period (as
determined in this paragraph) will then be divided by the number of days in the period to determine the daily portion of original
issue discount for each day in the period. With respect to an initial accrual period shorter than a full accrual period, the daily
portions of original issue discount must be determined according to an appropriate allocation under any reasonable method.
 
Under the method described above, the daily
portions of original issue discount required to be included in income by a Regular Certificateholder generally will increase to
take into account prepayments on the Regular Certificates as a result of prepayments on the mortgage loans that exceed the Prepayment
Assumption, and generally will decrease, but not below zero for any period, if the prepayments are slower than the Prepayment Assumption.
An increase in prepayments on the mortgage loans with respect to a series of Regular Certificates can result in both a change in
the priority of principal
 


97

 

 
payments
with respect to certain classes of Regular Certificates and either an increase or decrease in the daily portions of original issue
discount with respect to those Regular Certificates.
 
In the case of a Random Lot Certificate,
we intend to determine the yield to maturity of that certificate based upon the anticipated payment characteristics of the class
as a whole under the Prepayment Assumption. In general, the original issue discount accruing on each Random Lot Certificate in
a full accrual period would be its allocable share of the original issue discount with respect to the entire class, as determined
in accordance with the preceding paragraph. However, in the case of a distribution in retirement of the entire unpaid principal
balance of any Random Lot Certificate, or portion of that unpaid principal balance, (a) the remaining unaccrued original issue
discount allocable to that certificate (or to that portion) will accrue at the time of that distribution, and (b) the accrual
of original issue discount allocable to each remaining certificate of the class (or the remaining unpaid principal balance of a
partially redeemed Random Lot Certificate after a distribution of principal has been received) will be adjusted by reducing the
present value of the remaining payments on that class and the adjusted issue price of that class to the extent attributable to
the portion of the unpaid principal balance of the class that was distributed. We believe that the foregoing treatment is consistent
with the “pro rata prepayment” rules of the OID Regulations, but with the rate of accrual of original issue discount
determined based on the Prepayment Assumption for the class as a whole. You are advised to consult your tax advisors as to this
treatment.
 
The Treasury proposed regulations on August
24, 2004 that create a special rule for accruing original issue discount on Regular Certificates providing for a delay between
record and payment dates, such that the period over which original issue discount accrues coincides with the period over which
the Regular Certificateholder’s right to interest payment accrues under the governing contract provisions rather than over
the period between distribution dates. If the proposed regulations are adopted in the same form as proposed, taxpayers would
be required to accrue interest from the issue date to the first record date, but would not be required to accrue interest after
the last record date. The proposed regulations are limited to Regular Certificates with delayed payment for periods of fewer than
32 days. The proposed regulations are proposed to apply to any Regular Certificate issued after the date the final regulations
are published in the Federal Register.
 
Acquisition Premium.
 
A purchaser of a Regular Certificate at
a price greater than its adjusted issue price but less than its stated redemption price at maturity will be required to include
in gross income the daily portions of the original issue discount on the Regular Certificate reduced pro rata by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the excess of its purchase price over the adjusted issue price and the denominator of which is the excess
of the remaining stated redemption price at maturity over the adjusted issue price. Alternatively, a subsequent purchaser may elect
to treat all of the acquisition premium under the constant yield method, as described below under the heading “—Election
to Treat All Interest Under the Constant Yield Method” below.
 
Variable Rate Regular
Certificates.
 
Regular Certificates may provide for interest
based on a variable rate. Under the OID Regulations, interest is treated as payable at a variable rate if, generally:
 
1.      
the issue price does not exceed the original principal balance by more than a specified amount, and
 
2.      
the interest compounds or is payable at least annually at current values of
 
(a)    
one or more “qualified floating rates,”
 
(b)    
a single fixed rate and one or more qualified floating rates,
 
(c)    
a single “objective rate,” or
 


98

 

 
(d)    
a single fixed rate and a single objective rate that is a “qualified inverse floating rate.”
 
A floating rate is a qualified floating
rate if variations in the rate can reasonably be expected to measure contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds,
where the rate is subject to a fixed multiple that is greater than 0.65, but not more than 1.35. The rate may also be increased
or decreased by a fixed spread or subject to a fixed cap or floor, or a cap or floor that is not reasonably expected as of the
issue date to affect the yield of the instrument significantly. An objective rate (other than a qualified floating rate) is a rate
that is determined using a single fixed formula and that is based on objective financial or economic information, provided that
the information is not (1) within the control of the depositor or a related party or (2) unique to the circumstances
of the depositor or a related party. A qualified inverse floating rate is a rate equal to a fixed rate minus a qualified floating
rate that inversely reflects contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds; an inverse floating rate that is not
a qualified floating rate may nevertheless be an objective rate. A class of Regular Certificates may be issued under this prospectus
that does not have a variable rate under the OID Regulations, for example, a class that bears different rates at different times
during the period it is outstanding so that it is considered significantly “front-loaded” or “back-loaded”
within the meaning of the OID Regulations. It is possible that a class of this type may be considered to bear “contingent
interest” within the meaning of the OID Regulations. The OID Regulations, as they relate to the treatment of contingent interest,
are by their terms not applicable to Regular Certificates. However, if final regulations dealing with contingent interest with
respect to Regular Certificates apply the same principles as the current regulations, those regulations may lead to different timing
of income inclusion than would be the case under the variable interest regulations. Furthermore, application of those principles
could lead to the characterization of gain on the sale of contingent interest Regular Certificates as ordinary income. Investors
should consult their tax advisors regarding the appropriate treatment of any Regular Certificate that does not pay interest at
a fixed rate or variable rate as described in this paragraph.
 
Under the REMIC Regulations, a Regular Certificate
(1) bearing a rate that qualifies as a qualified floating rate under the OID Regulations that is tied to current values of
a variable rate (or the highest, lowest or average of two or more variable rates), including a rate based on the average cost of
funds of one or more financial institutions, or a positive or negative multiple of a rate (plus or minus a specified number of
basis points), or that represents a weighted average of rates on some or all of the mortgage loans, including a rate that is subject
to one or more caps or floors (each, a “variable rate”), or (2) bearing one or more of these variable rates
for one or more periods or one or more fixed rates for one or more periods, and a different variable rate or fixed rate for other
periods qualifies as a regular interest in a REMIC. Accordingly, if so indicated in the related prospectus supplement, we intend
to treat Regular Certificates that qualify as regular interests under this rule in the same manner as obligations bearing a variable
rate for original issue discount reporting purposes.
 
The amount of original issue discount with
respect to a Regular Certificate bearing a variable rate of interest will accrue in the manner described above under “—Original
Issue Discount” with the yield to maturity and future payments on that Regular Certificate generally to be determined
by assuming that interest will be payable for the life of the Regular Certificate based on the initial rate (or, if different,
the value of the applicable variable rate as of the pricing date) for the relevant class. Generally, we intend to treat variable
interest as qualified stated interest, other than variable interest on an interest-only or super-premium class, which will be treated
as non-qualified stated interest includible in the stated redemption price at maturity. Ordinary income reportable for any period
will be adjusted based on subsequent changes in the applicable interest rate index.
 
Although unclear under the OID Regulations,
unless required otherwise by applicable final regulations, we intend to treat Regular Certificates bearing an interest rate that
is a weighted average of the net interest rates on mortgage loans or mortgage certificates having fixed or adjustable rates, as
having qualified stated interest, except to the extent that initial “teaser” rates cause sufficiently “back-loaded”
interest to create more than de minimis original issue discount. The yield on those Regular Certificates for purposes of
accruing original issue discount will be a hypothetical fixed rate based on the fixed rates, in the case of fixed rate mortgage
loans, and initial “teaser rates” followed by fully indexed rates, in the case of adjustable rate mortgage loans. In
the case of adjustable rate mortgage loans, the
 


99

 

 
applicable
index used to compute interest on the mortgage loans will be the index in effect on the pricing date (or possibly the issue date),
and in the case of initial teaser rates, will be deemed to be in effect beginning with the period in which the first weighted
average adjustment date occurring after the issue date occurs. Adjustments will be made in each accrual period either increasing
or decreasing the amount of ordinary income reportable to reflect the actual pass-through interest rate on the Regular Certificates.
 
Deferred Interest.
 
Under the OID Regulations, all interest
on a Regular Certificate as to which there may be deferred interest is includible in the stated redemption price at maturity thereof.
Accordingly, any deferred interest that accrues with respect to a class of Regular Certificates may constitute income to the holders
of such Regular Certificates prior to the time distributions of cash with respect to such deferred interest are made.
 
Market Discount.
 
A purchaser of a Regular Certificate also
may be subject to the market discount rules of Code Section 1276 through 1278. Under these Code sections and the principles
applied by the OID Regulations in the context of original issue discount, “market discount” is the amount by which
the purchaser’s original basis in the Regular Certificate (exclusive of accrued qualified stated interest) (1) is exceeded
by the then-current principal amount of the Regular Certificate or (2) in the case of a Regular Certificate having original
issue discount, is exceeded by the adjusted issue price of that Regular Certificate at the time of purchase. The purchaser generally
will be required to recognize ordinary income to the extent of accrued market discount on the Regular Certificate as distributions
includible in the stated redemption price at maturity of the Regular Certificate are received, in an amount not exceeding that
distribution. The market discount would accrue in a manner to be provided in Treasury regulations and should take into account
the Prepayment Assumption. The Conference Committee Report to the Reform Act provides that until regulations are issued, the market
discount would accrue either (1) on the basis of a constant interest rate or (2) in the ratio of stated interest allocable
to the relevant period to the sum of the interest for that period plus the remaining interest as of the end of that period, or
in the case of a Regular Certificate issued with original issue discount, in the ratio of original issue discount accrued for the
relevant period to the sum of the original issue discount accrued for that period plus the remaining original issue discount as
of the end of that period. You also generally will be required to treat a portion of any gain on a sale or exchange of the Regular
Certificate as ordinary income to the extent of the market discount accrued to the date of disposition under one of the foregoing
methods, less any accrued market discount previously reported as ordinary income as partial distributions in reduction of the stated
redemption price at maturity were received. You will be required to defer deduction of a portion of the excess of the interest
paid or accrued on indebtedness incurred to purchase or carry a Regular Certificate over the interest distributable on those Regular
Certificates. The deferred portion of an interest expense in any taxable year generally will not exceed the accrued market discount
on the Regular Certificate for that year. The deferred interest expense is, in general, allowed as a deduction not later than the
year in which the related market discount income is recognized or the Regular Certificate is disposed of. As an alternative to
the inclusion of market discount in income on the foregoing basis, you may elect to include market discount in income currently
as it accrues on all market discount instruments you acquired in that taxable year or thereafter, in which case the interest deferral
rule will not apply. See “—Election to Treat All Interest Under the Constant Yield Method” below regarding
an alternative manner in which that election may be deemed to be made.
 
Market discount with respect to a Regular
Certificate will be considered to be zero if the market discount is less than 0.25% of the remaining stated redemption price at
maturity of the Regular Certificate multiplied by the weighted average maturity of the Regular Certificate (determined as described
above in the third paragraph under “—Original Issue Discount”) remaining after the date of purchase.
It appears that de minimis market discount would be reported in a manner similar to de minimis original issue discount.
See “—Original Issue Discount” above. Treasury regulations implementing the market discount rules have
not yet been issued, and therefore investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules. You
should also consult Revenue Procedure 92-67 concerning the
 


100

 

 
elections
to include market discount in income currently and to accrue market discount on the basis of the constant yield method.
 
Premium.
 
A Regular Certificate purchased at a cost,
excluding any portion of the cost attributable to accrued qualified stated interest, greater than its remaining stated redemption
price at maturity generally is considered to be purchased at a premium. If you hold a Regular Certificate as a “capital asset”
within the meaning of Code Section 1221, you may elect under Code Section 171 to amortize that premium under the constant
yield method. The election to amortize premium applies to all the premium bonds you hold at the beginning of the taxable year and
to all premium bonds you acquire thereafter. Final regulations with respect to amortization of bond premium do not by their terms
apply to prepayable obligations such as the Regular Certificates. However, the Conference Committee Report to the Reform Act indicates
a Congressional intent that the same rules that will apply to the accrual of market discount on installment obligations will also
apply to amortizing bond premium under Code Section 171 on installment obligations such as the Regular Certificates, although
it is unclear whether the alternatives to the constant yield method described above under “—Market Discount”
are available. Amortizable bond premium will be treated as an offset to interest income on a Regular Certificate rather than as
a separate deduction item. See “—Election to Treat All Interest Under the Constant Yield Method” below
regarding an alternative manner in which the Code Section 171 election may be deemed to be made.
 
Election to Treat All
Interest Under the Constant Yield Method.
 
A holder of a debt instrument such as a
Regular Certificate may elect to treat all interest that accrues on the instrument using the constant yield method, with none of
the interest being treated as qualified stated interest. For purposes of applying the constant yield method to a debt instrument
subject to an election, (1) “interest” includes stated interest, original issue discount, de minimis original
issue discount, market discount and de minimis market discount, as adjusted by any amortizable bond premium or acquisition
premium and (2) the debt instrument is treated as if the instrument were issued on the holder’s acquisition date in
the amount of the holder’s adjusted basis immediately after acquisition. It is unclear whether, for this purpose, the initial
Prepayment Assumption would continue to apply or if a new prepayment assumption as of the date of the holder’s acquisition
would apply. A holder generally may make an election on an instrument by instrument basis or for a class or group of debt
instruments. However, if you make the election with respect to a premium bond, then you are deemed to make the election to amortize
premium for all the premium bonds you hold at the beginning of the taxable year and all premium bonds you acquire thereafter. If
you make the election with respect to a market discount bond, then you are deemed to make the election to accrue market discount
for all the market discount bonds you acquire at the beginning of the taxable year and all market discount bonds you acquire thereafter.
The election is made on the holder’s federal income tax return for the year in which the debt instrument is acquired and
is irrevocable except with the approval of the IRS. You should consult their own tax advisors regarding the advisability of making
an election.
 
Prepayment Premiums.
 
Prepayment Premiums actually collected on
the mortgage loans will be distributed to the Regular Certificates as described in “Description of the Offered Certificates—Distributions”
in the prospectus supplement. It is not entirely clear under the Code when the amount of prepayment premiums so allocated should
be taxed to the holders of the Regular Certificates, but it is not expected, for federal income tax reporting purposes, that prepayment
premiums will be treated as giving rise to any income to the holder of such Classes of Certificates prior to the Trustee’s
actual receipt of a prepayment premium. Prepayment Premiums, if any, may be treated as paid upon the retirement or partial retirement
of the Regular Certificates. The IRS may disagree with these positions. Certificateholders should consult their own tax advisors
concerning the treatment of prepayment premiums.
 


101

 

 
Sale or Exchange of Regular
Certificates.
 
If you sell or exchange a Regular Certificate,
you will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount received (other than amounts allocable to accrued
interest) and your adjusted basis in the Regular Certificate. The adjusted basis of a Regular Certificate generally will equal
the cost of the Regular Certificate to the seller, increased by any original issue discount or market discount previously included
in the seller’s gross income with respect to the Regular Certificate and reduced by amounts included in the stated redemption
price at maturity of the Regular Certificate that were previously received by the seller, by any amortized premium and by previously
recognized losses.
 
Except as described above with respect to
market discount, and except as provided in this paragraph, any gain or loss on the sale or exchange of a Regular Certificate realized
by an investor who holds the Regular Certificate as a capital asset will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term or short-term
depending on whether the Regular Certificate has been held for the applicable holding period (described below). That gain will
be treated as ordinary income as follows:
 
1.      
if a Regular Certificate is held as part of a “conversion transaction” as defined in Code Section 1258(c),
up to the amount of interest that would have accrued on the Regular Certificateholder’s net investment in the conversion
transaction at 120% of the appropriate applicable Federal rate under Code Section 1274(d) in effect at the time the taxpayer
entered into the transaction minus any amount previously treated as ordinary income with respect to any prior disposition of property
that was held as a part of that transaction,
 
2.      
in the case of a non-corporate taxpayer, to the extent the taxpayer has made an election under Code Section 163(d)(4)
to have net capital gains taxed as investment income at ordinary rates, or
 
3.      
to the extent that the gain does not exceed the excess, if any, of (a) the amount that would have been includible in
the gross income of the holder if its yield on the Regular Certificate were 110% of the applicable Federal rate as of the date
of purchase, over (b) the amount of income actually includible in the gross income of that holder with respect to the Regular
Certificate.
 
In addition, gain or loss recognized from
the sale of a Regular Certificate by certain banks or thrift institutions will be treated as ordinary income or loss pursuant to
Code Section 582(c). Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate taxpayers generally are taxed at lower rates than ordinary
income or short-term capital gains of those taxpayers for property held for more than one year. The maximum tax rate for corporations
is the same with respect to both ordinary income and capital gains.
 
Treatment of Losses.
 
Holders of Regular Certificates will be
required to report income with respect to Regular Certificates on the accrual method of accounting, without giving effect to delays
or reductions in distributions attributable to defaults or delinquencies on the mortgage loans allocable to a particular class
of Regular Certificates, except to the extent it can be established that those losses are uncollectible. Accordingly, the holder
of a Regular Certificate may have income, or may incur a diminution in cash flow as a result of a default or delinquency, but may
not be able to take a deduction (subject to the discussion below) for the corresponding loss until a subsequent taxable year. In
this regard, investors are cautioned that while they may generally cease to accrue interest income if it reasonably appears that
the interest will be uncollectible, the IRS may take the position that original issue discount must continue to be accrued in spite
of its uncollectibility until the debt instrument is disposed of in a taxable transaction or becomes worthless in accordance with
the rules of Code Section 166.
 
Under Code Section 166, holders of
Regular Certificates that are corporations or that otherwise hold the Regular Certificates in connection with a trade or business
should in general be allowed to deduct, as an ordinary loss, a loss sustained during the taxable year on account of those Regular
Certificates becoming wholly or partially worthless, and, in general, holders of Regular Certificates that are not corporations
and do not hold the Regular Certificates in connection with a trade or business will be
 


102

 

 
allowed
to deduct as a short-term capital loss any loss with respect to principal sustained during the taxable year on account of a portion
of any class or subclass of those Regular Certificates becoming wholly worthless. Although the matter is not free from doubt,
non-corporate holders of Regular Certificates should be allowed a bad debt deduction at that time as the principal balance of
any class or subclass of those Regular Certificates is reduced to reflect losses resulting from any liquidated mortgage loans
below a holder’s basis in the Regular Certificates. The IRS, however, could take the position that non-corporate holders
will be allowed a bad debt deduction to reflect those losses only after all mortgage loans remaining in the trust fund have been
liquidated or that class of Regular Certificates has been otherwise retired. The IRS could also assert that losses on the Regular
Certificates are deductible based on some other method that may defer those deductions for all holders, such as reducing future
cash flow for purposes of computing original issue discount. This may have the effect of creating “negative” original
issue discount which would be deductible only against future positive original issue discount or otherwise upon termination of
the class. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is not clear whether holders of interest-only certificates are entitled to any deduction
under Code Section 166 for bad debt losses. You are urged to consult your own tax advisors regarding the appropriate timing, amount
and character of any loss sustained with respect to the Regular Certificates. Special loss rules are applicable to banks and thrift
institutions, including rules regarding reserves for bad debts. Banks and thrift institutions are advised to consult their tax
advisors regarding the treatment of losses on Regular Certificates.
 
Tax
Treatment of Exchangeable Certificates
 
In General. The Exchangeable Certificates
for a series may represent either (1) beneficial ownership of proportionate interests in each related Exchangeable Certificate
corresponding to that Exchangeable Certificate or (2) beneficial ownership of disproportionate interests in the related Exchangeable
Certificates corresponding to that Exchangeable Certificate. The prospectus supplement for any series offering Exchangeable Certificates
will specify whether the Exchangeable Certificates for such series represent either proportionate or disproportionate interests
in the related Exchangeable Certificates. An Exchangeable Certificate may be (1) a REMIC Regular Certificate or (2) a Standard
Certificate representing beneficial ownership in one or more uncertificated REMIC regular interests.
 
Exchangeable Certificates Representing
Proportionate Interests in Two or More Related Exchangeable Certificates. If an Exchangeable Certificate represents beneficial
ownership of a proportionate interest in each related Exchangeable Certificate corresponding to that Exchangeable Certificate,
then each beneficial owner of such an Exchangeable Certificate should account separately for its ownership interest in each related
Exchangeable Certificate underlying that Exchangeable Certificate as if such related Exchangeable Certificate were a Regular Certificate,
as described under “—Taxation of Regular Certificates.” If a beneficial owner of an Exchangeable Certificate
acquires an interest in two or more underlying related Exchangeable Certificates other than in an exchange described under “Description
of the Certificates—Exchangeable Certificates” in this prospectus, the beneficial owner must allocate its cost
to acquire that Exchangeable Certificate among the underlying related Exchangeable Certificates in proportion to their relative
fair market values at the time of acquisition. When such a beneficial owner sells the Exchangeable Certificate, the owner must
allocate the sale proceeds among the underlying related Exchangeable Certificates in proportion to their relative fair market values
at the time of sale.
 
Under the OID Regulations, if two or more
debt instruments are issued in connection with the same transaction or related transaction (determined based on all the facts and
circumstances), those debt instruments are treated as a single debt instrument for purposes of the provisions of the Code applicable
to OID, unless an exception applies. Under this rule, if an Exchangeable Certificate represents beneficial ownership of two or
more related Exchangeable Certificates, those related Exchangeable Certificates could be treated as a single debt instrument for
OID purposes. In addition, if the two or more related Exchangeable Certificates underlying an Exchangeable Certificate were aggregated
for OID purposes and a beneficial owner of an Exchangeable Certificate were to (i) exchange that Exchangeable Certificate for the
underlying related Exchangeable Certificates, (ii) sell one of those related Exchangeable Certificates and (iii) retain one or
more of the remaining related Exchangeable Certificates, the beneficial owner might be treated as having engaged in a “coupon
stripping” or “bond stripping” transaction within
 


103

 

 
the meaning
of Code Section 1286. Under Code Section 1286, a beneficial owner of an Exchangeable Certificate that engages in a coupon stripping
or bond stripping transaction must allocate its basis in the original Exchangeable Certificate between the underlying related
Exchangeable Certificates sold and the related Exchangeable Certificates retained in proportion to their relative fair market
values as of the date of the stripping transaction. The beneficial owner then must recognize gain or loss on the related Exchangeable
Certificates sold using its basis allocable to those related Exchangeable Certificates. Also, the beneficial owner then must treat
the related Exchangeable Certificates underlying the Exchangeable Certificates retained as a newly issued debt instrument that
was purchased for an amount equal to the beneficial owner’s basis allocable to those related Exchangeable Certificates.
Accordingly, the beneficial owner must accrue interest and OID with respect to the related Exchangeable Certificates retained
based on the beneficial owner’s basis in those related Exchangeable Certificates.
 
As a result, when compared to treating each
related Exchangeable Certificate underlying an Exchangeable Certificate as a separate debt instrument, aggregating the related
Exchangeable Certificates underlying an Exchangeable Certificate could affect the timing and character of income recognized by
a beneficial owner of such an Exchangeable Certificate. Moreover, if Code Section 1286 were to apply to a beneficial owner of an
Exchangeable Certificate, much of the information necessary to perform the related calculations for information reporting purposes
generally would not be available to the Trustee. Because it may not be clear whether the aggregation rule in the OID Regulations
applies to the Exchangeable Certificates and due to the Trustee’s lack of information necessary to report computations that
might be required by Code Section 1286, the Trustee will treat each related Exchangeable Certificate underlying an Exchangeable
Certificate as a separate debt instrument for information reporting purposes. Prospective investors should note that, if the two
or more related Exchangeable Certificates underlying an Exchangeable Certificate were aggregated, the timing of accruals of OID
applicable to such an Exchangeable Certificate could be different than that reported to holders and the IRS. Prospective investors
are advised to consult their own tax advisors regarding any possible tax consequences to them if the IRS were to assert that the
related Exchangeable Certificates underlying an Exchangeable Certificate should be aggregated for OID purposes.
 
Exchangeable Certificates Representing
Disproportionate Interests in Related Exchangeable Certificates. If an Exchangeable Certificate represents beneficial ownership
of a disproportionate interest in the related Exchangeable Certificates corresponding to that Exchangeable Certificate, then the
tax consequences to the beneficial owner of the Exchangeable Certificate will be determined under Code Section 1286, except as
discussed below. Under Code Section 1286, a beneficial owner of an Exchangeable Certificate will be treated as owning “stripped
bonds” to the extent of its share of principal payments and “stripped coupons” to the extent of its share of
interest payment on the underlying related Exchangeable Certificates. If an Exchangeable Certificate entitles the holder to payments
of principal and interest on an underlying related Exchangeable Certificate, the IRS could contend that the Exchangeable Certificate
should be treated (i) as an interest in the underlying related Exchangeable Certificate to the extent that the Exchangeable Certificate
represents an equal pro rata portion of principal and interest on the underlying related Exchangeable Certificate, and (ii) with
respect to the remainder, as an installment obligation consisting of “stripped bonds” to the extent of its share of
principal payments or “stripped coupons” to the extent of its share of interest payments. For purposes of information
reporting, however, each Exchangeable Certificate will be treated as a single debt instrument, regardless of whether it entitles
the holder to payments of principal and interest.
 
Under Code Section 1286, each beneficial
owner of an Exchangeable Certificate must treat the Exchangeable Certificate as a debt instrument originally issued on the date
the owner acquires it and as having OID equal to the excess, if any, of its “stated redemption price at maturity” over
the price paid by the owner to acquire it. The stated redemption price at maturity for an Exchangeable Certificate is determined
in the same manner as described with respect to Regular Certificates under “—Taxation of Regular Certificates—Original
Issue Discount.”
 
If the Exchangeable Certificate has OID,
the beneficial owner must include the OID in its ordinary income for federal income tax purposes as the OID accrues, which may
be prior to the receipt of the cash attributable to that income. Although the matter is not entirely clear, a beneficial owner
should accrue OID
 


104

 

 
using
a method similar to that described with respect to the accrual of OID on a Regular Certificate under “—Taxation
of Regular Certificates—Original Issue Discount.” A beneficial owner, however, determines its yield to maturity
based on its purchase price. For a particular beneficial owner, it is not clear whether the prepayment assumption used for calculating
OID would be one determined at the time the Exchangeable Certificate is acquired or would be the prepayment assumption for the
underlying related Exchangeable Certificates.
 
In light of the application of Code Section
1286, a beneficial owner of an Exchangeable Certificate generally will be required to compute accruals of OID based on its yield,
possibly taking into account its own prepayment assumption. The information necessary to perform the related calculations for information
reporting purposes, however, generally will not be available to the Trustee. Accordingly, any information reporting provided by
the Trustee with respect to the Exchangeable Certificates, which information will be based on pricing information as of the closing
date, will largely fail to reflect the accurate accruals of OID for these certificates. Prospective investors therefore should
be aware that the timing of accruals of OID applicable to an Exchangeable Certificate generally will be different than that reported
to holders and the IRS. Prospective investors are advised to consult their own tax advisors regarding their obligation to compute
and include in income the correct amount of OID accruals and any possible tax consequences should they fail to do so.
 
The rules of Code Section 1286 also apply
if (i) a beneficial owner of one or more Exchangeable Certificates exchanges them for another Exchangeable Certificate, (ii) the
beneficial owner sells some, but not all, of such exchanged Exchangeable Certificates, and (iii) the combination of retained Exchangeable
Certificates cannot be exchanged for the related underlying Exchangeable Certificates. As of the date of such a sale, the beneficial
owner must allocate its basis in the underlying related Exchangeable Certificates between the part of the related Exchangeable
Certificates underlying the Exchangeable Certificates sold and the part of the related Exchangeable Certificates underlying the
Exchangeable Certificates retained in proportion to their relative fair market values. Code Section 1286 treats the beneficial
owner as purchasing the Exchangeable Certificates retained for the amount of the basis allocated to the retained Exchangeable Certificates,
and the beneficial owner must then accrue any OID with respect to the retained Exchangeable Certificates as described above. Code
Section 1286 does not apply, however, if a beneficial owner exchanges the underlying related Exchangeable Certificates for other
Exchangeable Certificates and retains all such Exchangeable Certificates, see “—Treatment of Exchanges”
below.
 
Upon the sale of an Exchangeable Certificate,
a beneficial owner will realize gain or loss on the sale in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized and its
adjusted basis in the Exchangeable Certificate. The owner’s adjusted basis generally is equal to the owner’s cost of
the Exchangeable Certificate (or portion of the cost of the related Exchangeable Certificates allocable to the Exchangeable Certificate),
increased by income previously included, and reduced (but not below zero) by distributions previously received and by any amortized
premium. If the beneficial owner holds the Exchangeable Certificate as a capital asset, any gain or loss realized will be capital
gain or loss, except to the extent provided under “—Sale or Exchange of Regular Certificates.”
 
Although the matter is not free from doubt,
if a beneficial owner acquires in one transaction (other than an exchange described under “—Treatment of Exchanges”
below) a combination of Exchangeable Certificates that may be exchanged for underlying related Exchangeable Certificates, the owner
should be treated as owning the underlying related Exchangeable Certificates, in which case Code Section 1286 would not apply.
If a beneficial owner acquires such a combination in separate transactions, the law is unclear as to whether the combination should
be aggregated or each Exchangeable Certificate should be treated as a separate debt instrument. You should consult your tax advisors
regarding the proper treatment of Exchangeable Certificates in this regard.
 
Treatment of Exchanges. If a beneficial
owner of one or more Exchangeable Certificates exchanges them for the related Exchangeable Certificates in the manner described
under “Description of the Certificates—Exchangeable Certificates” in this prospectus, the exchange will
not be taxable. In such a case, the beneficial owner will be treated as continuing to own after the exchange the same combination
 


105

 

 
of interests
in each underlying related Exchangeable Certificate that it owned immediately prior to the exchange.
 
Taxation
of Residual Certificates
 
Taxation of REMIC Income.
 
Generally, the “daily portions”
of REMIC taxable income or net loss will be includible as ordinary income or loss in determining the federal taxable income of
holders of Residual Certificates (“Residual Certificateholders”), and will not be taxed separately to the REMIC
Pool. The daily portions of REMIC taxable income or net loss of a Residual Certificateholder are determined by allocating the REMIC
Pool’s taxable income or net loss for each calendar quarter ratably to each day in that quarter and by allocating that daily
portion among the Residual Certificateholders in proportion to their respective holdings of Residual Certificates in the REMIC
Pool on that day. REMIC taxable income is generally determined in the same manner as the taxable income of an individual using
the accrual method of accounting, except that:
 
1.      
the limitations on deductibility of investment interest expense and expenses for the production of income do not apply,
 
2.      
all bad loans will be deductible as business bad debts, and
 
3.      
the limitation on the deductibility of interest and expenses related to tax-exempt income will apply.
 
The REMIC Pool’s gross income includes
interest, original issue discount income and market discount income, if any, on the mortgage loans, reduced by amortization of
any premium on the mortgage loans, plus income from amortization of issue premium, if any, on the Regular Certificates, plus income
on reinvestment of cash flows and reserve assets, plus any cancellation of indebtedness income upon allocation of realized losses
to the Regular Certificates. The REMIC Pool’s deductions include interest and original issue discount expense on the Regular
Certificates, servicing fees on the mortgage loans, other administrative expenses of the REMIC Pool and realized losses on the
mortgage loans. The requirement that Residual Certificateholders report their pro rata share of taxable income or net loss of the
REMIC Pool will continue until there are no certificates of any class of the related series outstanding.
 
The taxable income recognized by a Residual
Certificateholder in any taxable year will be affected by, among other factors, the relationship between the timing of recognition
of interest and original issue discount or market discount income or amortization of premium with respect to the mortgage loans,
on the one hand, and the timing of deductions for interest (including original issue discount) on the Regular Certificates or income
from amortization of issue premium on the Regular Certificates, on the other hand. In the event that an interest in the mortgage
loans is acquired by the REMIC Pool at a discount, and one or more of those mortgage loans is prepaid, the Residual Certificateholder
may recognize taxable income without being entitled to receive a corresponding amount of cash because (1) the prepayment may
be used in whole or in part to make distributions in reduction of principal on the Regular Certificates and (2) the discount
on the mortgage loans which is includible in income may exceed the deduction allowed upon those distributions on those Regular
Certificates on account of any unaccrued original issue discount relating to those Regular Certificates. When there is more than
one class of Regular Certificates that distribute principal sequentially, this mismatching of income and deductions is particularly
likely to occur in the early years following the issuance of the Regular Certificates when distributions in reduction of principal
are being made in respect of earlier classes of Regular Certificates to the extent that those classes are not issued with substantial
discount. If taxable income attributable to that kind of mismatching is realized, in general, losses would be allowed in later years
as distributions on the later classes of Regular Certificates are made. Taxable income may also be greater in earlier years
than in later years as a result of the fact that interest expense deductions, expressed as a percentage of the outstanding
principal amount of that series of Regular Certificates, may increase over time as distributions in reduction of principal are
made on the lower yielding classes of Regular Certificates, whereas to the extent that the REMIC Pool includes fixed rate mortgage
loans, interest income with
 


106

 

 
respect
to any given mortgage loan will remain constant over time as a percentage of the outstanding principal amount of that loan. Consequently,
Residual Certificateholders must have sufficient other sources of cash to pay any federal, state or local income taxes due as
a result of that mismatching or unrelated deductions against which to offset that income, subject to the discussion of “excess
inclusions” below under “—Limitations on Offset or Exemption of REMIC Income.” The timing of that
mismatching of income and deductions described in this paragraph, if present with respect to a series of certificates, may have
a significant adverse effect upon the Residual Certificateholder’s after-tax rate of return.
 
Basis and Losses.
 
The amount of any net loss of the REMIC
Pool that you may take into account is limited to the adjusted basis of the Residual Certificate as of the close of the quarter
(or time of disposition of the Residual Certificate if earlier), determined without taking into account the net loss for the quarter.
The initial adjusted basis of a purchaser of a Residual Certificate is the amount paid for that Residual Certificate. The adjusted
basis will be increased by the amount of taxable income of the REMIC Pool reportable by the Residual Certificateholder and will
be decreased (but not below zero), first, by a cash distribution from the REMIC Pool and, second, by the amount of loss of the
REMIC Pool reportable by the Residual Certificateholder. Any loss that is disallowed on account of this limitation may be carried
over indefinitely with respect to the Residual Certificateholder as to whom that loss was disallowed and may be used by that Residual
Certificateholder only to offset any income generated by the same REMIC Pool.
 
You will not be permitted to amortize directly
the cost of your Residual Certificate as an offset to its share of the taxable income of the related REMIC Pool. However, that
taxable income will not include cash received by the REMIC Pool that represents a recovery of the REMIC Pool’s basis in its
assets. That recovery of basis by the REMIC Pool will have the effect of amortization of the issue price of the Residual Certificates
over their life. However, in view of the possible acceleration of the income of Residual Certificateholders described under “—Taxation
of REMIC Income” above, the period of time over which the issue price is effectively amortized may be longer than the
economic life of the Residual Certificates.
 
A Residual Certificate may have a negative
value if the net present value of anticipated tax liabilities exceeds the present value of anticipated cash flows. The REMIC Regulations
appear to treat the issue price of a residual interest as zero rather than a negative amount for purposes of determining the REMIC
Pool’s basis in its assets. Regulations have been issued addressing the federal income tax treatment of “inducement
fees” received by transferees of noneconomic REMIC residual interests. These regulations require inducement fees to be included
in income over a period reasonably related to the period in which the related REMIC residual interest is expected to generate taxable
income or net loss to its holder. Under two safe harbor methods, inducement fees are permitted to be included in income (i) in
the same amounts and over the same period that the taxpayer uses for financial reporting purposes, provided that such period is
not shorter than the period the REMIC is expected to generate taxable income or (ii) ratably over the remaining anticipated
weighted average life of all the regular and residual interests issued by the REMIC, determined based on actual distributions projected
as remaining to be made on such interests under the Prepayment Assumption. If the holder of a residual interest sells or otherwise
disposes of the residual interest, any unrecognized portion of the inducement fee would be required to be taken into account at
the time of the sale or disposition. Prospective purchasers of the Residual Certificates should consult with their tax advisors
regarding the effect of these regulations.
 
Further, to the extent that your initial
adjusted basis (other than an original holder) in the Residual Certificate is greater than the corresponding portion of the REMIC
Pool’s basis in the mortgage loans, you will not recover a portion of that basis until termination of the REMIC Pool unless
future Treasury regulations provide for periodic adjustments to the REMIC income otherwise reportable by that holder. The REMIC
Regulations currently in effect do not so provide. See “—Treatment of Certain Items of REMIC Income and Expense—Market
Discount” below regarding the basis of mortgage loans to the REMIC Pool and “—Sale or Exchange of a Residual
Certificate” below regarding possible treatment of a loss upon termination of the REMIC Pool as a capital loss.
 


107

 

 
Treatment of Certain Items
of REMIC Income and Expense.
 
Although we intend to compute REMIC income
and expense in accordance with the Code and applicable regulations, the authorities regarding the determination of specific items
of income and expense are subject to differing interpretations. We make no representation as to the specific method that will be
used for reporting income with respect to the mortgage loans and expenses with respect to the Regular Certificates, and different
methods could result in different timing of reporting of taxable income or net loss to you or differences in capital gain versus
ordinary income.
 
Original Issue Discount and Premium.
Generally, the REMIC Pool’s deductions for original issue discount and income from amortization of issue premium on the Regular
Certificates will be determined in the same manner as original issue discount income on Regular Certificates as described under
“—Taxation of Regular Certificates—Original Issue Discount” and “—Variable Rate Regular
Certificates,” without regard to the de minimis rule described in that section, and “—Premium”
above.
 
Deferred Interest. Any deferred interest
that accrues with respect to any adjustable rate mortgage loans held by the REMIC Pool will constitute income to the REMIC Pool
and will be treated in a manner similar to the deferred interest that accrues with respect to Regular Certificates as described
under “—Taxation of Regular Certificates—Deferred Interest” above.
 
Market Discount. The REMIC Pool will
have market discount income in respect of mortgage loans if, in general, their unpaid principal balances exceed the basis of the
REMIC Pool allocable to those mortgage loans. The REMIC Pool’s basis in those mortgage loans is generally the fair market
value of the mortgage loans immediately after the transfer of the mortgage loans to the REMIC Pool. The REMIC Regulations provide
that the basis is equal in the aggregate to the issue prices of all regular and residual interests in the REMIC Pool (or the fair
market value at the closing date, in the case of a retained class). In respect of mortgage loans that have market discount to which
Code Section 1276 applies, the accrued portion of the market discount would be recognized currently as an item of ordinary
income in a manner similar to original issue discount. Market discount income generally should accrue in the manner described under
“—Taxation of Regular Certificates—Market Discount” above.
 
Premium. Generally, if the basis
of the REMIC Pool in the mortgage loans exceeds the unpaid principal balances of the mortgage loans, the REMIC Pool will be considered
to have acquired those mortgage loans at a premium equal to the amount of that excess. As stated above, the REMIC Pool’s
basis in mortgage loans is the fair market value of the mortgage loans, based on the aggregate of the issue prices (or the fair
market value of retained classes) of the regular and residual interests in the REMIC Pool immediately after the transfer of the
mortgage loans to the REMIC Pool. In a manner analogous to the discussion above under “—Taxation of Regular Certificates—Premium,”
a REMIC Pool that holds a mortgage loan as a capital asset under Code Section 1221 may elect under Code Section 171 to
amortize premium on whole mortgage loans or mortgage loans underlying MBS or MBS that are REMIC regular interests under the constant
yield method. Amortizable bond premium will be treated as an offset to interest income on the mortgage loans, rather than as a
separate deduction item. Premium with respect to those mortgage loans may be deductible in accordance with a reasonable method
regularly employed by the related holder. The allocation of the premium pro rata among principal payments should be considered
a reasonable method; however, the IRS may argue that the premium should be allocated in a different manner, such as allocating
the premium entirely to the final payment of principal.
 
Limitations on Offset
or Exemption of REMIC Income.
 
A portion or all of the REMIC taxable income
includible in determining your federal income tax liability will be subject to special treatment. That portion, referred to as
the “excess inclusion,” is equal to the excess of REMIC taxable income for the calendar quarter allocable to a Residual
Certificate over the daily accruals for that quarterly period of (1) 120% of the long-term applicable Federal rate that would
have applied to the Residual Certificate if it were a debt instrument, on the Startup Day under Code Section 1274(d), multiplied
by (2) the adjusted issue price of such Residual Certificate at the beginning of that quarterly period. For this purpose,
the adjusted issue price of a Residual Certificate at the beginning
 


108

 

 
of a quarter
is the issue price of the Residual Certificate, plus the amount of those daily accruals of REMIC income described in this paragraph for
all prior quarters, decreased by any distributions made with respect to that Residual Certificate prior to the beginning of that
quarterly period. Accordingly, the portion of the REMIC Pool’s taxable income that will be treated as excess inclusions
will be a larger portion of that income as the adjusted issue price of the Residual Certificates diminishes and all such taxable
income will be so treated if the adjusted issue price of the Residual Certificate is zero.
 
The portion of your REMIC taxable income
consisting of the excess inclusions generally may not be offset by other deductions, including net operating loss carryforwards,
on your return. However, net operating loss carryovers are determined without regard to excess inclusion income. Further, if you
are an organization subject to the tax on unrelated business income imposed by Code Section 511, the excess inclusions will
be treated as unrelated business taxable income to you for purposes of Code Section 511. In addition, REMIC taxable income
is subject to 30% withholding tax with respect to certain persons who are not U.S. Persons, as defined below under “—Tax-Related
Restrictions on Transfer of Residual Certificates—Foreign Investors” below, and that portion attributable to excess
inclusions is not eligible for any reduction in the rate of withholding tax, by treaty or otherwise. See “—Taxation
of Certain Foreign Investors—Residual Certificates” below. Finally, if a real estate investment trust or a regulated
investment company owns a Residual Certificate, a portion (allocated under Treasury regulations yet to be issued) of dividends
paid by the real estate investment trust or a regulated investment company could not be offset by net operating losses of its shareholders,
would constitute unrelated business taxable income for tax-exempt shareholders, and would be ineligible for reduction of withholding
to certain persons who are not U.S. Persons.
 
In addition, the Code provides three rules
for determining the effect of excess inclusions on your alternative minimum taxable income of a Residual Certificateholder. First,
your alternative minimum taxable income is determined without regard to the special rule, discussed above, that taxable income
cannot be less than excess inclusions. Second, your alternative minimum taxable income for a taxable year cannot be less than the
excess inclusions for the year. Third, the amount of any alternative minimum tax net operating loss deduction must be computed
without regard to any excess inclusions.
 
Tax-Related Restrictions
on Transfer of Residual Certificates.
 
Disqualified Organizations. If any
legal or beneficial interest in a Residual Certificate is transferred to a Disqualified Organization (as defined below), a tax
would be imposed in an amount equal to the product of (1) the present value of the total anticipated excess inclusions with
respect to that Residual Certificate for periods after the transfer and (2) the highest marginal federal income tax rate applicable
to corporations. The REMIC Regulations provide that the anticipated excess inclusions are based on actual prepayment experience
to the date of the transfer and projected payments based on the Prepayment Assumption. The present value rate equals the applicable
Federal rate under Code Section 1274(d) as of the date of the transfer for a term ending with the last calendar quarter in
which excess inclusions are expected to accrue. The tax generally would be imposed on the transferor of the Residual Certificate,
except that where the transfer is through an agent, including a broker, nominee or other middleman, for a Disqualified Organization,
the tax would instead be imposed on that agent. However, a transferor of a Residual Certificate would in no event be liable for
the tax with respect to a transfer if the transferee furnishes to the transferor an affidavit that the transferee is not a Disqualified
Organization and, as of the time of the transfer, the transferor does not have actual knowledge that the affidavit is false. The
tax also may be waived by the Treasury Department if the Disqualified Organization promptly disposes of the residual interest and
the transferor pays income tax at the highest corporate rate on the excess inclusions for the period the Residual Certificate is
actually held by the Disqualified Organization.
 
In addition, if a Pass-Through Entity (as
defined below) has excess inclusion income with respect to a Residual Certificate during a taxable year and a Disqualified Organization
is the record holder of an equity interest in that entity, then a tax is imposed on the entity equal to the product of (1) the
amount of excess inclusions on the Residual Certificate that are allocable to the interest in the Pass-Through Entity during the
period the interest is held by the Disqualified Organization, and (2) the highest marginal federal corporate income tax rate.
This tax would be deductible from the ordinary gross income of the
 


109

 

 
Pass-Through
Entity for the taxable year. The Pass-Through Entity would not be liable for the tax if it has received an affidavit from the
record holder that it is not a Disqualified Organization or stating the holder’s taxpayer identification number and, during
the period that person is the record holder of the Residual Certificate, the Pass-Through Entity does not have actual knowledge
that the affidavit is false.
 
If an “electing large partnership”
as defined in Code Section 775 holds a Residual Certificate, all interests in the electing large partnership are treated as held
by Disqualified Organizations for purposes of the tax imposed upon a Pass-Through Entity by Code Section 860E(c). An exception
to this tax, otherwise available to a Pass-Through Entity that is furnished certain affidavits by record holders of interests in
the entity and that does not know the affidavits are false, is not available to an electing partnership.
 
For these purposes:
 
1.      
“Disqualified Organization” means any of (i) the United States, any State or political subdivision thereof,
any possession of the United States or any agency or instrumentality of any of the foregoing (other than an instrumentality which
is a corporation if all of its activities are subject to tax and a majority of its board of directors is not selected by such governmental
unit), (ii) a foreign government, any international organization or any agency or instrumentality of any of the foregoing, (iii)
any organization (other than certain farmers’ cooperatives described in Section 521 of the Code) which is exempt from the
tax imposed by Chapter 1 of the Code (including the tax imposed by Section 511 of the Code on unrelated business taxable income)
on any excess inclusions (as defined in Section 860E(c)(1) of the Code) with respect to the Class R Certificates (except certain
farmers’ cooperatives described in Section 521 of the Code), (iv) rural electric and telephone cooperatives described in
Section 1381(a)(2)(C) of the Code, (v) an “electing large partnership”, as defined in Section 775 of the Code and (vi)
any other person so designated by the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator based upon an opinion of counsel as provided to
the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator (at no expense to the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator) that the holding of
an ownership interest in a Class R Certificate by such person may cause either (i) any REMIC Pool to fail to qualify as a REMIC
at any time that the Certificates are outstanding or (ii) any person having an ownership interest in any Class of Certificates
(other than such person) to incur a liability for any federal tax imposed under the Code that would not otherwise be imposed but
for the transfer of an ownership interest in a Class R Certificate to such person. The terms “United States,” “State”
and “international organization” shall have the meanings set forth in Section 7701 of the Code or successor provisions,
and
 
2.      
“Pass-Through Entity” means any regulated investment company, real estate investment trust, common trust
fund, partnership, trust or estate and certain corporations operating on a cooperative basis. Except as may be provided in Treasury
regulations, any person holding an interest in a Pass-Through Entity as a nominee for another will, with respect to that interest,
be treated as a Pass-Through Entity.
 
The Pooling Agreement with respect to a
series of certificates will provide that no legal or beneficial interest in a Residual Certificate may be transferred unless (1) the
proposed transferee provides to the transferor and the trustee an affidavit providing its taxpayer identification number and stating
that the transferee is the beneficial owner of the Residual Certificate, is not a Disqualified Organization and is not purchasing
the Residual Certificates on behalf of a Disqualified Organization (i.e., as a broker, nominee or other middleman), and (2) the
transferor provides a statement in writing to the Depositor and the trustee that it has no actual knowledge that the affidavit
is false. Moreover, the Pooling Agreement will provide that any attempted or purported transfer in violation of these transfer
restrictions will be null and void and will vest no rights in any purported transferee. Each Residual Certificate with respect
to a series will bear a legend referring to the restrictions on transfer, and each Residual Certificateholder will be deemed to
have agreed, as a condition of ownership of the Residual Certificates, to any amendments to the related Pooling Agreement required
under the Code or applicable Treasury regulations to effectuate the foregoing restrictions. Information necessary to compute an
applicable excise tax must be furnished to the IRS and to the requesting party within 60 days of the request, and the Depositor
or the trustee may charge a fee for computing and providing that information.
 


110

 

 
Noneconomic Residual Interests. The
REMIC Regulations would disregard certain transfers of Residual Certificates, in which case the transferor would continue to be
treated as the owner of the Residual Certificates and thus would continue to be subject to tax on its allocable portion of the
net income of the REMIC Pool. Under the REMIC Regulations, a transfer of a “noneconomic residual interest” (as defined
below) to a Residual Certificateholder (other than a Residual Certificateholder who is not a U.S. Person, as defined under “—Foreign
Investors” below) is disregarded for all federal income tax purposes if a significant purpose of the transferor is to
impede the assessment or collection of tax. A residual interest in a REMIC, including a residual interest with a positive value
at issuance, is a “noneconomic residual interest” unless, at the time of the transfer, (1) the present value of
the expected future distributions on the residual interest at least equals the product of the present value of the anticipated
excess inclusions and the highest corporate income tax rate in effect for the year in which the transfer occurs, and (2) the
transferor reasonably expects that the transferee will receive distributions from the REMIC at or after the time at which taxes
accrue on the anticipated excess inclusions in an amount sufficient to satisfy the accrued taxes. The anticipated excess inclusions
and the present value rate are determined in the same manner as set forth under “—Disqualified Organizations”
above. The REMIC Regulations explain that a significant purpose to impede the assessment or collection of tax exists if the transferor,
at the time of the transfer, either knew or should have known that the transferee would be unwilling or unable to pay taxes due
on its share of the taxable income of the REMIC. Under the REMIC Regulations, a safe harbor is provided if (1) the transferor
conducted, at the time of the transfer, a reasonable investigation of the financial condition of the transferee and found that
the transferee historically had paid its debts as they came due and found no significant evidence to indicate that the transferee
would not continue to pay its debts as they came due in the future, (2) the transferee represents to the transferor that it
understands that, as the holder of the noneconomic residual interest, the transferee may incur tax liabilities in excess of cash
flows generated by the interest and that the transferee intends to pay taxes associated with holding the residual interest as they
become due, (3) the transferee represents to the transferor that it will not cause income from the Residual Certificate to
be attributable to a foreign permanent establishment or fixed base (within the meaning of an applicable income tax treaty) of the
transferee or any other person and (4) either the “formula test” or the “assets test,” (each described
below) is satisfied. The Pooling Agreement with respect to each series of certificates will require the transferee of a Residual
Certificate to certify to the matters in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of the preceding sentence as part of the affidavit described
under the heading “—Disqualified Organizations” above. The transferor must have no actual knowledge or
reason to know that those statements are false.
 
The formula test is satisfied if the present
value of the anticipated tax liabilities associated with holding the noneconomic residual interest cannot exceed the sum of
 
(i)         the
present value of any consideration given to the transferee to acquire the interest;
 
(ii)      the present value of the expected future distributions on the interest; and
 
(iii)       the present value of the anticipated tax savings associated with holding the interest as the REMIC generates losses.
 
For purposes of these computations, the
transferee is assumed to pay tax at the highest rate of tax specified in Code Section 11(b)(1) (currently 35%) or, in certain
circumstances, the alternative minimum tax rate. Further, present values generally are computed using a discount rate equal to
the short-term Federal rate set forth in Code Section 1274(d) for the month of the transfer and the compounding period used
by the transferee.
 
The assets test is satisfied if (i) the
transferee must be a domestic “C” corporation (other than a corporation exempt from taxation or a regulated investment
company or real estate investment trust) that meets certain gross and net asset tests (generally, $100 million of gross assets
and $10 million of net assets for the current year and the two preceding fiscal years); (ii) the transferee must
agree in writing that any subsequent transferee of the residual interest would meet the requirements for a safe harbor transfer;
and (iii) the facts and circumstances known to the transferor on or before the date of the transfer
 


111

 

 
must not
reasonably indicate that the taxes associated with ownership of the residual interest will not be paid by the transferee.
 
Foreign Investors. The REMIC Regulations
provide that the transfer of a Residual Certificate that has “tax avoidance potential” to a “foreign person”
will be disregarded for all federal tax purposes. This rule appears intended to apply to a transferee who is not a U.S. Person
(a “Non-U.S. Person”), unless the transferee’s income is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade
or business within the United States. A Residual Certificate is deemed to have tax avoidance potential unless, at the time of the
transfer, (1) the future value of expected distributions equals at least 30% of the anticipated excess inclusions after the
transfer, and (2) the transferor reasonably expects that the transferee will receive sufficient distributions from the REMIC
Pool at or after the time at which the excess inclusions accrue and prior to the end of the next succeeding taxable year for the
accumulated withholding tax liability to be paid. If the Non-U.S. Person transfers the Residual Certificates back to a U.S. Person,
the transfer will be disregarded and the foreign transferor will continue to be treated as the owner unless arrangements are made
so that the transfer does not have the effect of allowing the transferor to avoid tax on accrued excess inclusions.
 
Unless otherwise stated in the related prospectus
supplement, a Residual Certificate may not be purchased by or transferred to any person that is not a U.S. Person. The term “U.S.
Person” means a citizen or resident of the United States, a corporation or partnership (except to the extent provided
in applicable Treasury regulations) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state, or the District
of Columbia, including any entity treated as a corporation or partnership for federal income tax purposes, an estate that is subject
to United States federal income tax regardless of the source of its income, or a trust if a court within the United States is able
to exercise primary supervision over the administration of that trust, and one or more such U.S. Persons have the authority to
control all substantial decisions of that trust (or, to the extent provided in applicable Treasury regulations, certain trusts
in existence on August 20, 1996 that have elected to be treated as U.S. Persons).
 
In addition, under temporary and final Treasury
regulations, effective August 1, 2006, a U.S. partnership having a partner who is not a U.S. Person will be required to pay withholding
tax in respect of excess inclusion income allocable to such non-U.S. partner, even if no cash distributions are made to such partner.
Accordingly, the Pooling Agreement will prohibit transfer of a Residual Certificate to a U.S. Person treated as a partnership for
federal income tax purposes, any beneficial owner of which (other than through a U.S. corporation) is (or is permitted to be under
the related partnership agreement) a non-U.S. Person.
 
Sale or Exchange of a
Residual Certificate.
 
Upon the sale or exchange of a Residual
Certificate, you will recognize gain or loss equal to the excess, if any, of the amount realized over your adjusted basis, as described
under “—Basis and Losses” above, in the Residual Certificate at the time of the sale or exchange. In addition
to reporting the taxable income of the REMIC Pool, you will have taxable income to the extent that any cash distribution to you
from the REMIC Pool exceeds the adjusted basis on that distribution date. That income will be treated as gain from the sale or
exchange of the Residual Certificates. It is possible that the termination of the REMIC Pool may be treated as a sale or exchange
of Residual Certificates, in which case, you will have an adjusted basis in the Residual Certificates remaining when your interest
in the REMIC Pool terminates, and if you hold the Residual Certificate as a capital asset under Code Section 1221, then you
will recognize a capital loss at that time in the amount of the remaining adjusted basis.
 
Any gain on the sale of Residual Certificates
will be treated as ordinary income (1) if you hold the Residual Certificates as part of a “conversion transaction”
as defined in Code Section 1258(c), up to the amount of interest that would have accrued on your net investment in the conversion
transaction at 120% of the appropriate applicable Federal rate in effect at the time the taxpayer entered into the transaction
minus any amount previously treated as ordinary income with respect to any prior disposition of property that was held as a part
of that transaction or (2) if you are a non-corporate taxpayer, to the extent that you have made an election under Code Section 163(d)(4)
to have net capital gains taxed as investment
 


112

 

 
income
at ordinary income rates. In addition, gain or loss recognized from the sale of a Residual Certificate by certain banks or thrift
institutions will be treated as ordinary income or loss pursuant to Code Section 582(c).
 
The Conference Committee Report to the Reform
Act provides that, except as provided in Treasury regulations yet to be issued, the wash sale rules of Code Section 1091 will
apply to dispositions of Residual Certificates where the seller of those certificates, during the period beginning six months before
the sale or disposition of the Residual Certificate and ending six months after the sale or disposition, acquires (or enters into
any other transaction that results in the application of Section 1091) any residual interest in any REMIC or any interest
in a “taxable mortgage pool” (such as a non-REMIC owner trust) that is economically comparable to a Residual Certificate.
 
Mark to Market Regulations.
 
The Treasury has issued regulations, the
“Mark to Market Regulations,” under Code Section 475 relating to the requirement that a securities dealer mark
to market securities held for sale to customers. This mark-to-market requirement applies to all securities of a dealer, except
to the extent that the dealer has specifically identified a security as held for investment. The Mark to Market Regulations provide
that, for purposes of this mark-to-market requirement, a Residual Certificate is not treated as a security and thus may not be
marked to market.
 
Taxes
That May Be Imposed on the REMIC Pool
 
Prohibited Transactions.
 
Income from certain transactions by the
REMIC Pool, called prohibited transactions, will not be part of the calculation of income or loss includible in the federal income
tax returns of Residual Certificateholders, but rather will be taxed directly to the REMIC Pool at a 100% rate. Prohibited transactions
generally include
 
1.      
the disposition of a qualified mortgage other than for:
 
(a)    
substitution within two years of the Startup Day for a defective (including a defaulted) obligation (or repurchase
in lieu of substitution of a defective (including a defaulted) obligation at any time) or for any qualified mortgage within three
months of the Startup Day,
 
(b)    
foreclosure, default or imminent default of a qualified mortgage,
 
(c)    
bankruptcy or insolvency of the REMIC Pool, or
 
(d)    
a qualified (complete) liquidation,
 
2.      
the receipt of income from assets that are not the type of mortgages or investments that the REMIC Pool is permitted to
hold,
 
3.      
the receipt of compensation for services or
 
4.      
the receipt of gain from disposition of cash flow investments other than pursuant to a qualified liquidation.
 
Notwithstanding (1) and (4) it is not
a prohibited transaction to sell REMIC Pool property to prevent a default on Regular Certificates as a result of a default on qualified
mortgages or to facilitate a clean-up call, generally, an optional termination to save administrative costs when no more than a
small percentage of the certificates is outstanding. The REMIC Regulations indicate that the modification of a mortgage loan generally
will not be treated as a disposition if it is occasioned by a default or reasonably foreseeable default, an assumption of the mortgage
loan, the waiver of a due-on-sale or
 


113

 

 
due-on-encumbrance
clause or the conversion of an interest rate by a mortgagor pursuant to the terms of a convertible adjustable rate mortgage
loan.
 
Contributions to the REMIC
Pool After the Startup Day.
 
In general, the REMIC Pool will be subject
to a tax at a 100% rate on the value of any property contributed to the REMIC Pool after the Startup Day. Exceptions are provided
for cash contributions to the REMIC Pool:
 
1.      
during the three months following the Startup Day,
 
2.      
made to a qualified reserve fund by a Residual Certificateholder,
 
3.      
in the nature of a guarantee,
 
4.      
made to facilitate a qualified liquidation or clean-up call, and
 
5.      
as otherwise permitted in Treasury regulations yet to be issued.
 
Net Income from Foreclosure
Property.
 
The REMIC Pool will be subject to federal
income tax at the highest corporate rate on “net income from foreclosure property,” determined by reference to the
rules applicable to real estate investment trusts. Generally, property acquired by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure would
be treated as “foreclosure property” for a period ending with the third calendar year following the year of acquisition
of that property, with a possible extension. Net income from foreclosure property generally means gain from the sale of a foreclosure
property that is inventory property and gross income from foreclosure property other than qualifying rents and other qualifying
income for a real estate investment trust.
 
It is not anticipated that the REMIC Pool
will receive income or contributions subject to tax under the preceding three paragraphs, except as described in the applicable
prospectus supplement with respect to net income from foreclosure property on a commercial or multifamily residential property
that secured a mortgage loan. In addition, if so disclosed in the applicable prospectus supplement, it is not anticipated that
any material state income or franchise tax will be imposed on a REMIC Pool.
 
Liquidation
of the REMIC Pool
 
If a REMIC Pool adopts a plan of complete
liquidation, within the meaning of Code Section 860F(a)(4)(A)(i), which may be accomplished by designating in the REMIC Pool’s
final tax return a date on which that adoption is deemed to occur, and sells all of its assets (other than cash) within a 90-day
period beginning on the date of the adoption of the plan of liquidation, the REMIC Pool will not be subject to the prohibited transaction
rules on the sale of its assets, provided that the REMIC Pool credits or distributes in liquidation all of the sale proceeds plus
its cash (other than amounts retained to meet claims) to holders of Regular Certificates and Residual Certificateholders within
the 90-day period.
 
Administrative
Matters
 
The REMIC Pool will be required to maintain
its books on a calendar year basis and to file federal income tax returns for federal income tax purposes in a manner similar to
a partnership. The form for that income tax return is Form 1066, U.S. Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit (REMIC) Income Tax
Return. The trustee will be required to sign the REMIC Pool’s returns. Treasury regulations provide that, except where there
is a single Residual Certificateholder for an entire taxable year, the REMIC Pool will be subject to the procedural and administrative
rules of the Code applicable to partnerships, including the determination by the IRS of any adjustments to, among other things,
items of REMIC income, gain, loss, deduction or credit in a unified administrative proceeding. The Residual Certificateholder owning
the largest percentage interest in the Residual Certificates will be obligated to act as “tax matters person,” as defined
in applicable Treasury regulations, with respect to the REMIC Pool. Each Residual
 


114

 

 
Certificateholder
will be deemed, by acceptance of the Residual Certificates, to have agreed (1) to the appointment of the tax matters person
as provided in the preceding sentence and (2) to the irrevocable designation of the trustee as agent for performing the functions
of the tax matters person.
 
Limitations
on Deduction of Certain Expenses
 
An investor who is an individual, estate
or trust will be subject to limitation with respect to certain itemized deductions described in Code Section 67, to the extent
that those itemized deductions, in the aggregate, do not exceed 2% of the investor’s adjusted gross income. In addition,
Code Section 68 provides that itemized deductions otherwise allowable for a taxable year of an individual taxpayer with income
above certain thresholds will be reduced by the lesser of (1) 3% of the excess, if any, of adjusted gross income over a statutory
threshold or (2) 80% of the amount of itemized deductions otherwise allowable for that year. In the case of a REMIC Pool,
those deductions may include deductions under Code Section 212 for the servicing fee and all administrative and other expenses
relating to the REMIC Pool, or any similar expenses allocated to the REMIC Pool with respect to a regular interest it holds in
another REMIC. Those investors who hold REMIC Certificates either directly or indirectly through certain pass-through entities
may have their pro rata share of those expenses allocated to them as additional gross income, but may be subject to those limitations
on deductions. In addition, those expenses are not deductible at all for purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax, and
may cause those investors to be subject to significant additional tax liability. Temporary Treasury regulations provide that the
additional gross income and corresponding amount of expenses generally are to be allocated entirely to the holders of Residual
Certificates in the case of a REMIC Pool that would not qualify as a fixed investment trust in the absence of a REMIC election.
However, that additional gross income and limitation on deductions will apply to the allocable portion of those expenses to holders
of Regular Certificates, as well as holders of Residual Certificates, where those Regular Certificates are issued in a manner that
is similar to pass-through certificates in a fixed investment trust. In general, that allocable portion will be determined based
on the ratio that a REMIC Certificateholder’s income, determined on a daily basis, bears to the income of all holders of
Regular Certificates and Residual Certificates with respect to a REMIC Pool. As a result, individuals, estates or trusts holding
REMIC Certificates (either directly or indirectly through a grantor trust, partnership, S corporation, REMIC, or certain other
pass-through entities described in the foregoing temporary Treasury regulations) may have taxable income in excess of the interest
income at the pass-through rate on Regular Certificates that are issued in a single class or otherwise consistently with fixed
investment trust status or in excess of cash distributions for the related period on Residual Certificates. If so indicated in
the related prospectus supplement, all those expenses will be allocable to the Residual Certificates.
 
Taxation
of Certain Foreign Investors
 
Regular Certificates.
 
Interest, including original issue discount,
distributable to Regular Certificateholders who are non-resident aliens, foreign corporations, or other Non-U.S. Persons, will
be considered “portfolio interest” and, therefore, generally will not be subject to 30% United States withholding tax,
provided that the Non-U.S. Person (1) is not a “10-percent shareholder” within the meaning of Code Section 871(h)(3)(B)
of, or a controlled foreign corporation described in Code Section 881(c)(3)(C) related to, the REMIC (or possibly one or more
borrowers) and (2) provides the trustee, or the person who would otherwise be required to withhold tax from those distributions
under Code Section 1441 or 1442, with an appropriate statement, signed under penalties of perjury, identifying the beneficial
owner and stating, among other things, that the beneficial owner of the Regular Certificate is a Non-U.S. Person. The appropriate
documentation includes Form W-8BEN (in the case of an individual) or Form W-8BEN-E (in the case of an entity) if the Non-U.S. Person
is eligible for the benefits of the portfolio interest exemption or an exemption based on a treaty; Form W-8ECI if the Non-U.S.
Person is eligible for an exemption on the basis of its income from the Regular Certificate being effectively connected to a United
States trade or business; Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-8IMY if the Non-U.S. Person is a trust, depending on whether such trust is classified
as the beneficial owner of the Regular Certificate; and Form W-8IMY, with supporting documentation as specified in the Treasury
Regulations, required to substantiate exemptions
 


115

 

 
from withholding
on behalf of its partners, if the Non-U.S. Person is a partnership. An intermediary (other than a partnership) must provide Form
W-8IMY, revealing all required information, including its name, address, taxpayer identification number, the country under the
laws of which it is created, and certification that it is not acting for its own account. A “qualified intermediary”
must certify that it has provided, or will provide, a withholding statement as required under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1441-1(e)(5)(v),
but need not disclose the identity of its account holders on its Form W-8IMY, and may certify its account holders’ status
without including each beneficial owner’s certification. A non-“qualified intermediary” must additionally certify
that it has provided, or will provide, a withholding statement that is associated with the appropriate Forms W-8 and W-9 required
to substantiate exemptions from withholding on behalf of its beneficial owners. The term “intermediary” means a person
acting as a custodian, a broker, nominee or otherwise as an agent for the beneficial owner of a Regular Certificate. A “qualified
intermediary” is generally a foreign financial institution or clearing organization or a non-U.S. branch or office of a
U.S. financial institution or clearing organization that is a party to a withholding agreement with the IRS.
 
If that statement, or any other required
statement, is not provided, 30% withholding will apply unless the interest on the Regular Certificate is effectively connected
with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States by the Non-U.S. Person. In that latter case, the Non-U.S. Person
will be subject to United States federal income tax at regular rates. Prepayment Premiums distributable to Regular Certificateholders
who are Non-U.S. Persons may be subject to 30% United States withholding tax. Investors who are Non-U.S. Persons should consult
their own tax advisors regarding the specific tax consequences to them of owning a Regular Certificate.
 
Residual Certificates.
 
The Conference Committee Report to the Reform
Act indicates that amounts paid to Residual Certificateholders who are Non-U.S. Persons are treated as interest for purposes of
the 30% (or lower treaty rate) United States withholding tax. Treasury regulations provide that amounts distributed to Residual
Certificateholders may qualify as “portfolio interest,” subject to the conditions described in “—Regular
Certificates” above, but only to the extent that (1) the mortgage loans (including mortgage loans underlying certain
MBS) were issued after July 18, 1984 and (2) the trust fund or segregated pool of assets in the trust fund (as to which
a separate REMIC election will be made), to which the Residual Certificate relates, consists of obligations issued in “registered
form” within the meaning of Code Section 163(f)(1). Generally, whole mortgage loans will not be, but MBS and regular
interests in another REMIC Pool will be, considered obligations issued in registered form. Furthermore, a Residual Certificateholder
will not be entitled to any exemption from the 30% withholding tax (or lower treaty rate) to the extent of that portion of REMIC
taxable income that constitutes an “excess inclusion.” See “—Taxation of Residual Certificates—Limitations
on Offset or Exemption of REMIC Income” above. If the amounts paid to Residual Certificateholders who are Non-U.S. Persons
are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States by Non-U.S. Persons, 30% (or lower treaty
rate) withholding will not apply. Instead, the amounts paid to Non-U.S. Persons will be subject to United States federal income
tax at regular rates. If 30% (or lower treaty rate) withholding is applicable, those amounts generally will be taken into account
for purposes of withholding only when paid or otherwise distributed (or when the Residual Certificate is disposed of) under rules
similar to withholding upon disposition of debt instruments that have original issue discount. See “—Taxation of
Residual Certificates—Tax-Related Restrictions on Transfer of Residual Certificates—Foreign Investors” above
concerning the disregard of certain transfers having “tax avoidance potential” and the withholding tax obligations
of U.S. partnerships having Non-U.S. Persons as partners. Investors who are Non-U.S. Persons should consult their own tax advisors
regarding the specific tax consequences to them of owning Residual Certificates.
 
FATCA.
 
Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the
Code (“FATCA”) “foreign financial institutions” will be required to enter into an agreement with
the IRS requiring them to obtain and to disclose to the IRS information about certain of their U.S. investors, if any. FATCA also
requires certain other foreign entities to obtain and disclose information about their investors to the relevant withholding agent
who would, in turn, be required to provide such information to the IRS. FATCA imposes a 30% withholding tax on
 


116

 

 
certain
payments of income and gross proceeds to an applicable foreign entity (which includes foreign financial institutions as well as
certain other financial entities) if that foreign entity fails to enter into an information sharing agreement with the IRS or
otherwise fails to comply with the requirements of the legislation. Withholding under FATCA will be effective for payments of
income made after June 30, 2014, and for gross proceeds realized after December 31, 2018. Non-U.S. Persons should consult
their tax advisors regarding their requirements with respect to the new legislation and related Treasury regulations and announcements.
 
3.8%
Medicare Tax On “Net Investment Income”
 
U.S. holders of REMIC Certificates that
are individuals, estates or certain trusts are subject to an additional 3.8% tax on all or a portion of their “net investment
income,” which may include any income or gain with respect to the REMIC Certificates, to the extent that their net investment
income, when added to their other modified adjusted gross income, exceeds $200,000 for an unmarried individual, $250,000 for a
married taxpayer filing a joint return (or a surviving spouse), or $125,000 for a married individual filing a separate return.
The 3.8% Medicare tax is determined in a different manner than the regular income tax. U.S. Persons should consult their advisors
with respect to the application of the 3.8% Medicare tax to their income and gains, if any, with respect to the REMIC Certificates.
 
Backup
Withholding
 
Distributions made on the Regular Certificates,
and proceeds from the sale of the Regular Certificates to or through certain brokers, may be subject to a “backup”
withholding tax under Code Section 3406 at a current rate of 28% on “reportable payments” (including interest
distributions, original issue discount, and, under certain circumstances, principal distributions) unless the Regular Certificateholder
is a U.S. Person and provides Form W-9 with the correct taxpayer identification number; is a Non-U.S. Person and provides Form
W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, identifying the Non-U.S. Person and stating that the beneficial owner is not a U.S. Person;
or can be treated as an exempt recipient within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii). Any amounts to
be withheld from distribution on the Regular Certificates would be refunded by the IRS or allowed as a credit against the Regular
Certificateholder’s federal income tax liability. The New Regulations will change certain of the rules relating to certain
presumptions currently available relating to information reporting and backup withholding. Information reporting requirements may
also apply regardless of whether withholding is required. Non-U.S. Persons are urged to contact their own tax advisors regarding
the application to them of backup and withholding and information reporting.
 
Reporting
Requirements
 
Reports of accrued interest, original issue
discount and information necessary to compute the accrual of any market discount on the Regular Certificates will be made annually
to the IRS and to individuals, estates, non-exempt and non-charitable trusts, and partnerships who are either holders of record
of Regular Certificates or beneficial owners who own Regular Certificates through a broker or middleman as nominee. All brokers,
nominees and all other non-exempt holders of record of Regular Certificates (including corporations, non-calendar year taxpayers,
securities or commodities dealers, real estate investment trusts, investment companies, common trust funds, thrift institutions
and charitable trusts) may request that information for any calendar quarter by telephone or in writing by contacting the person
designated in IRS Publication 938 with respect to a particular series of Regular Certificates. Holders through nominees must request
that information from the nominee.
 
Form 1066 has an accompanying Schedule Q,
Quarterly Notice to Residual Interest Holders of REMIC Taxable Income or Net Loss Allocation. Treasury regulations require that
Schedule Q be furnished by the REMIC Pool to each Residual Certificateholder by the end of the month following the close of
each calendar quarter (41 days after the end of a quarter under proposed Treasury regulations) in which the REMIC Pool is
in existence.
 


117

 

 
Treasury regulations require that, in addition
to the foregoing requirements, information must be furnished quarterly to Residual Certificateholders, furnished annually, if applicable,
to holders of Regular Certificates, and filed annually with the IRS concerning Code Section 67 expenses, see “—Limitations
on Deduction of Certain Expenses” above, allocable to those holders. Furthermore, under those regulations, information
must be furnished quarterly to Residual Certificateholders, furnished annually to holders of Regular Certificates, and filed annually
with the IRS concerning the percentage of the REMIC Pool’s assets meeting the qualified asset tests described under “—Qualification
as a REMIC” above.
 
Federal
Income Tax Consequences
for Certificates as to which No REMIC Election Is Made
 
Standard
Certificates
 
General.
 
In the event that no election is made to
treat a trust fund (or a segregated pool of assets in the trust fund) with respect to a series of certificates that are not designated
as “—Stripped Certificates,” as described below, as a REMIC (certificates of that kind of series are referred
to as “Standard Certificates”), in the opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP the trust fund
will be classified as a grantor trust under subpart E, Part 1 of subchapter J of the Code and not as an association taxable as
a corporation or a “taxable mortgage pool” within the meaning of Code Section 7701(i). Where there is no fixed
retained yield with respect to the mortgage loans underlying the Standard Certificates, the holder of a Standard Certificate (a
“Standard Certificateholder”) in that series will be treated as the owner of a pro rata undivided interest in
the ordinary income and corpus portions of the trust fund represented by its Standard Certificate and will be considered the beneficial
owner of a pro rata undivided interest in each of the mortgage loans, subject to the discussion under “—Recharacterization
of Servicing Fees” below. Accordingly, the holder of a Standard Certificate of a particular series will be required to
report on its federal income tax return its pro rata share of the entire income from the mortgage loans represented by its Standard
Certificate, including interest at the coupon rate on those mortgage loans, original issue discount (if any), prepayment fees,
assumption fees, and late payment charges received by the master servicer, in accordance with that Standard Certificateholder’s
method of accounting. A Standard Certificateholder generally will be able to deduct its share of the servicing fee and all administrative
and other expenses of the trust fund in accordance with its method of accounting, provided that those amounts are reasonable compensation
for services rendered to that trust fund. However, investors who are individuals, estates or trusts who own Standard Certificates,
either directly or indirectly through certain pass-through entities, will be subject to limitation with respect to certain itemized
deductions described in Code Section 67, including deductions under Code Section 212 for the servicing fee and all the
administrative and other expenses of the trust fund, to the extent that those deductions, in the aggregate, do not exceed two percent
of an investor’s adjusted gross income. In addition, Code Section 68 provides that itemized deductions otherwise allowable
for a taxable year of an individual taxpayer with income above certain thresholds will be reduced by the lesser of (1) 3%
of the excess, if any, of adjusted gross income over a statutory threshold, or (2) 80% of the amount of itemized deductions
otherwise allowable for that year. As a result, those investors holding Standard Certificates, directly or indirectly through a
pass-through entity, may have aggregate taxable income in excess of the aggregate amount of cash received on those Standard Certificates
with respect to interest at the pass-through rate on those Standard Certificates. In addition, those expenses are not deductible
at all for purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax, and may cause the investors to be subject to significant additional
tax liability. Moreover, where there is fixed retained yield with respect to the mortgage loans underlying a series of Standard
Certificates or where the servicing fee is in excess of reasonable servicing compensation, the transaction will be subject to the
application of the “stripped bond” and “stripped coupon” rules of the Code, as described under “—Stripped
Certificates” and “—Recharacterization of Servicing Fees,” below.
 


118

 

 
Tax Status.
 
In the opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham &
Taft LLP, Standard Certificates will have the following status for federal income tax purposes:
 
1.      
Standard Certificate owned by a “domestic building and loan association” within the meaning of Code Section 7701(a)(19)
will be considered to represent “loans....secured by an interest in real property which is . . . residential real property”
within the meaning of Code Section 7701(a)(19)(C)(v), provided that the real property securing the mortgage loans represented
by that Standard Certificate is of the type described in that section of the Code.
 
2.      
Standard Certificate owned by a real estate investment trust will be considered to represent “real estate assets”
within the meaning of Code Section 856(c)(5)(B) to the extent that the assets of the related trust fund consist of qualified
assets, and interest income on those assets will be considered “interest on obligations secured by mortgages on real property”
to such extent within the meaning of Code Section 856(c)(3)(B).
 
3.      
Standard Certificate owned by a REMIC will be considered to represent an “obligation . . . which is principally secured
by an interest in real property” within the meaning of Code Section 860G(a)(3)(A) to the extent that the assets of the
related trust fund consist of “qualified mortgages” within the meaning of Code Section 860G(a)(3).
 
Premium and Discount.
 
Standard Certificateholders are advised
to consult with their tax advisors as to the federal income tax treatment of premium and discount arising either upon initial acquisition
of Standard Certificates or thereafter.
 
Premium. The treatment of premium
incurred upon the purchase of a Standard Certificate will be determined generally as described under “—Federal Income
Tax Consequences for REMIC Certificates—Taxation of Residual Certificates—Treatment of Certain Items of REMIC Income
and Expense—Premium” above.
 
Original Issue Discount. The original
issue discount rules will be applicable to a Standard Certificateholder’s interest in those mortgage loans originated with
original issue discount. Under the OID Regulations, the original issue discount could arise by the charging of points by the originator
of the mortgages in an amount greater than a statutory de minimis exception, including a payment of points currently deductible
by the borrower under applicable Code provisions or, under certain circumstances, by the presence of “teaser rates”
on the mortgage loans.
 
Original issue discount must generally be
reported as ordinary gross income as it accrues under a constant interest method that takes into account the compounding of interest,
in advance of the cash attributable to that income. If so indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, no prepayment assumption
will be assumed for purposes of that accrual. However, Code Section 1272 provides for a reduction in the amount of original
issue discount includible in the income of a holder of an obligation that acquires the obligation after its initial issuance at
a price greater than the sum of the original issue price and the previously accrued original issue discount, less prior payments
of principal. Accordingly, if the mortgage loans acquired by a Standard Certificateholder are purchased at a price equal to the
then unpaid principal amount of the mortgage loans, no original issue discount attributable to the difference between the issue
price and the original principal amount of the mortgage loans (i.e., points) will be includible by that holder.
 
Market Discount. Standard Certificateholders
also will be subject to the market discount rules to the extent that the conditions for application of those sections are met.
Market discount on the mortgage loans will be determined and will be reported as ordinary income generally in the manner described
under “—Federal Income Tax Consequences for REMIC Certificates—Taxation of Regular Certificates—Market
Discount” above, except that the ratable accrual methods described there will not apply and it is unclear
 


119

 

 
whether
a Prepayment Assumption would apply. Rather, the holder will accrue market discount pro rata over the life of the mortgage loans,
unless the constant yield method is elected. If so indicated in the related prospectus supplement, no prepayment assumption will
be assumed for purposes of that accrual.
 
Recharacterization of
Servicing Fees.
 
If the servicing fee paid to the master
servicer were deemed to exceed reasonable servicing compensation, the amount of that excess would represent neither income nor
a deduction to certificateholders. In this regard, there are no authoritative guidelines for federal income tax purposes as to
either the maximum amount of servicing compensation that may be considered reasonable in the context of this or similar transactions
or whether, in the case of the Standard Certificate, the reasonableness of servicing compensation should be determined on a weighted
average or loan-by-loan basis. If a loan-by-loan basis is appropriate, the likelihood that the amount would exceed reasonable servicing
compensation as to some of the mortgage loans would be increased. IRS guidance indicates that a servicing fee in excess of reasonable
compensation (“excess servicing”) will cause the mortgage loans to be treated under the “stripped bond”
rules. That guidance provides safe harbors for servicing deemed to be reasonable and requires taxpayers to demonstrate that the
value of servicing fees in excess of those amounts is not greater than the value of the services provided.
 
Accordingly, if the IRS’s approach
is upheld, a servicer who receives a servicing fee in excess of those amounts would be viewed as retaining an ownership interest
in a portion of the interest payments on the mortgage loans. Under the rules of Code Section 1286, the separation of ownership
of the right to receive some or all of the interest payments on an obligation from the right to receive some or all of the principal
payments on the obligation would result in treatment of those mortgage loans as “stripped coupons” and “stripped
bonds.” Subject to the de minimis rule discussed under “—Stripped Certificates” below, each
stripped bond or stripped coupon could be considered for this purpose as a non-interest bearing obligation issued on the date of
issue of the Standard Certificates, and the original issue discount rules of the Code would apply to that holder. While Standard
Certificateholders would still be treated as owners of beneficial interests in a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes,
the corpus of the trust could be viewed as excluding the portion of the mortgage loans the ownership of which is attributed to
the master servicer, or as including that portion as a second class of equitable interest. Applicable Treasury regulations treat
that arrangement as a fixed investment trust, since the multiple classes of trust interests should be treated as merely facilitating
direct investments in the trust assets and the existence of multiple classes of ownership interests is incidental to that purpose.
In general, a recharacterization should not have any significant effect upon the timing or amount of income reported by a Standard
Certificateholder, except that the income reported by a cash method holder may be slightly accelerated. See “—Stripped
Certificates” below for a further description of the federal income tax treatment of stripped bonds and stripped coupons.
 
Sale or Exchange of Standard
Certificates.
 
Upon sale or exchange of a Standard Certificate,
a Standard Certificateholder will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale (other
than amounts allocable to accrued interest) and its aggregate adjusted basis in the mortgage loans and the other assets represented
by the Standard Certificate. In general, the aggregate adjusted basis will equal the Standard Certificateholder’s cost for
the Standard Certificate, increased by the amount of any income previously reported with respect to the Standard Certificate and
decreased by the amount of any losses previously reported with respect to the Standard Certificate and the amount of any distributions
received on those Standard Certificates. Except as provided above with respect to market discount on any mortgage loans, and except
for certain financial institutions subject to the provisions of Code Section 582(c), that gain or loss would be capital gain
or loss if the Standard Certificate was held as a capital asset. However, gain on the sale of a Standard Certificate will be treated
as ordinary income (1) if a Standard Certificate is held as part of a “conversion transaction” as defined in Code
Section 1258(c), up to the amount of interest that would have accrued on the Standard Certificateholder’s net investment
in the conversion transaction at 120% of the appropriate applicable Federal rate in effect at the time the taxpayer entered into
the transaction minus any amount previously treated as ordinary income with respect to any prior disposition
 


120

 

 
of property
that was held as a part of that transaction or (2) in the case of a non-corporate taxpayer, to the extent the taxpayer has
made an election under Code Section 163(d)(4) to have net capital gains taxed as investment income at ordinary income rates.
Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate taxpayers generally are subject to lower tax rates than ordinary income or short-term
capital gains of those taxpayers for property held for more than one year. The maximum tax rate for corporations is the same with
respect to both ordinary income and capital gains.
 
Stripped
Certificates
 
General.
 
Pursuant to Code Section 1286, the
separation of ownership of the right to receive some or all of the principal payments on an obligation from ownership of the right
to receive some or all of the interest payments results in the creation of “stripped bonds” with respect to principal
payments and “stripped coupons” with respect to interest payments. For purposes of this discussion, certificates that
are subject to those rules will be referred to as “Stripped Certificates.” Stripped Certificates include interest-only
certificates entitled to distributions of interest, with disproportionately small, nominal or no distributions of principal and
principal-only certificates entitled to distributions of principal, with disproportionately small, nominal or no distributions
of interest as to which no REMIC election is made.
 
The certificates will be subject to those
rules if:
 
1.      
we or any of our affiliates retain, for our own account or for purposes of resale, in the form of fixed retained yield or
otherwise, an ownership interest in a portion of the payments on the mortgage loans,
 
2.      
the master servicer is treated as having an ownership interest in the mortgage loans to the extent it is paid, or retains,
servicing compensation in an amount greater than reasonable consideration for servicing the mortgage loans (See “—Standard
Certificates—Recharacterization of Servicing Fees” above), and
 
3.      
certificates are issued in two or more classes or subclasses representing the right to non-pro-rata percentages of the interest
and principal payments on the mortgage loans.
 
In general, a holder of a Stripped Certificate
will be considered to own “stripped bonds” with respect to its pro rata share of all or a portion of the principal
payments on each mortgage loan and/or “stripped coupons” with respect to its pro rata share of all or a portion of
the interest payments on each mortgage loan, including the Stripped Certificate’s allocable share of the servicing fees paid
to the master servicer, to the extent that those fees represent reasonable compensation for services rendered. See discussion under
“—Standard Certificates—Recharacterization of Servicing Fees” above. Although not free from doubt,
for purposes of reporting to Stripped Certificateholders, the servicing fees will be allocated to the Stripped Certificates in
proportion to the respective entitlements to distributions of each class, or subclass, of Stripped Certificates for the related
period or periods. The holder of a Stripped Certificate generally will be entitled to a deduction each year in respect of the servicing
fees, as described under “—Standard Certificates—General” above, subject to the limitation described
there.
 
Code Section 1286 treats a stripped
bond or a stripped coupon as an obligation issued at an original issue discount on the date that the stripped interest is purchased.
Although the treatment of Stripped Certificates for federal income tax purposes is not clear in certain respects at this time,
particularly where the Stripped Certificates are issued with respect to a mortgage pool containing variable-rate mortgage loans,
in the opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP (1) the trust fund will be treated as a grantor trust under subpart
E, Part 1 of subchapter J of the Code and not as an association taxable as a corporation or a “taxable mortgage pool”
within the meaning of Code Section 7701(i), and (2) each Stripped Certificate should be treated as a single installment
obligation for purposes of calculating original issue discount and gain or loss on disposition. This treatment is based on the
interrelationship of Code Section 1286, Code Sections 1272 through 1275, and the OID Regulations. While under Code Section 1286
computations with respect to Stripped Certificates arguably should be made in one of the
 


121

 

 
ways described
under “—Taxation of Stripped Certificates—Possible Alternative Characterizations” below, the OID
Regulations state, in general, that two or more debt instruments issued by a single issuer to a single investor in a single transaction
should be treated as a single debt instrument for original issue discount purposes. The applicable Pooling Agreement will require
that the trustee make and report all computations described below using this aggregate approach, unless substantial legal authority
requires otherwise.
 
Furthermore, Treasury regulations provide
for the treatment of a Stripped Certificate as a single debt instrument issued on the date it is purchased for purposes of calculating
any original issue discount. In addition, under these regulations, a Stripped Certificate that represents a right to payments of
both interest and principal may be viewed either as issued with original issue discount or market discount, as described below,
at a de minimis original issue discount, or, presumably, at a premium. This treatment suggests that the interest component
of that Stripped Certificate would be treated as qualified stated interest under the OID Regulations, other than in the case of
an interest-only Stripped Certificate or a Stripped Certificate on which the interest is substantially disproportionate to the
principal amount. Further, these final regulations provide that the purchaser of a Stripped Certificate will be required to account
for any discount as market discount rather than original issue discount if either (1) the initial discount with respect to
the Stripped Certificate was treated as zero under the de minimis rule, or (2) no more than 100 basis points in excess
of reasonable servicing is stripped off the related mortgage loans. This market discount would be reportable as described under
“—Federal Income Tax Consequences for REMIC Certificates—Taxation of Regular Certificates—Market Discount”
above, without regard to the de minimis rule there, assuming that a prepayment assumption is employed in that computation.
 
Status of Stripped Certificates.
 
No specific legal authority exists as to
whether the character of the Stripped Certificates, for federal income tax purposes, will be the same as that of the mortgage loans.
Although the issue is not free from doubt, in the opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, Stripped Certificates
owned by applicable holders should be considered to represent “real estate assets” within the meaning of Code Section 856(c)(5)(B),
“obligation[s] principally secured by an interest in real property” within the meaning of Code Section 860G(a)(3)(A),
and “loans . . . secured by an interest in real property which is . . . residential real property” within the meaning
of Code Section 7701(a)(19)(C)(v), and interest (including original issue discount) income attributable to Stripped Certificates
should be considered to represent “interest on obligations secured by mortgages on real property” within the meaning
of Code Section 856(c)(3)(B), provided that in each case the mortgage loans and interest on those mortgage loans qualify for
that treatment.
 
Taxation of Stripped Certificates.
 
Original Issue Discount. Except as
described under “—General” above, each Stripped Certificate will be considered to have been issued at
an original issue discount for federal income tax purposes. Original issue discount with respect to a Stripped Certificate must
be included in ordinary income as it accrues, in accordance with a constant interest method that takes into account the compounding
of interest, which may be prior to the receipt of the cash attributable to that income. Based in part on the OID Regulations and
the amendments to the original issue discount sections of the Code made by the Reform Act, the amount of original issue discount
required to be included in the income of a holder of a Stripped Certificate (referred to in this discussion as a “Stripped
Certificateholder”) in any taxable year likely will be computed generally as described under “—Federal
Income Tax Consequences for REMIC Certificates—Taxation of Regular Certificates—Original Issue Discount”
and “—Variable Rate Regular Certificates” above. However, with the apparent exception of a Stripped Certificate
qualifying as a market discount obligation, as described under “—General” above, the issue price of a
Stripped Certificate will be the purchase price paid by each holder of the Stripped Certificate, and the stated redemption price
at maturity will include the aggregate amount of the payments, other than qualified stated interest to be made on the Stripped
Certificate to that Stripped Certificateholder, presumably under the Prepayment Assumption.
 


122

 

 
If the mortgage loans prepay at a rate either
faster or slower than that under the Prepayment Assumption, a Stripped Certificateholder’s recognition of original issue
discount will be either accelerated or decelerated and the amount of the original issue discount will be either increased or decreased
depending on the relative interests in principal and interest on each mortgage loan represented by that Stripped Certificateholder’s
Stripped Certificate. While the matter is not free from doubt, the holder of a Stripped Certificate should be entitled in the year
that it becomes certain, assuming no further prepayments, that the holder will not recover a portion of its adjusted basis in that
Stripped Certificate to recognize an ordinary loss, if it is a corporation, or a short-term capital loss, if it is not a corporation
and does not hold the Stripped Certificate in connection with a trade or business, equal to that portion of unrecoverable basis.
 
As an alternative to the method described
above, the fact that some or all of the interest payments with respect to the Stripped Certificates will not be made if the mortgage
loans are prepaid could lead to the interpretation that the interest payments are “contingent” within the meaning of
the OID Regulations. The OID Regulations, as they relate to the treatment of contingent interest, are by their terms not applicable
to prepayable securities such as the Stripped Certificates. However, if final regulations dealing with contingent interest with
respect to the Stripped Certificates apply the same principles as the OID Regulations, those regulations may lead to different
timing of income inclusion that would be the case under the OID Regulations. Furthermore, application of those principles could
lead to the characterization of gain on the sale of contingent interest Stripped Certificates as ordinary income. Investors should
consult their tax advisors regarding the appropriate tax treatment of Stripped Certificates.
 
In light of the application of Code Section 1286,
a beneficial owner of a Stripped Certificate generally will be required to compute accruals of original issue discount based on
its yield, possibly taking into account its own prepayment assumption. The information necessary to perform the related calculations
for information reporting purposes, however, generally will not be available to the trustee. Accordingly, any information reporting
provided by the trustee with respect to the Stripped Certificates, which information will be based on pricing information as of
the closing date, will largely fail to reflect the accurate accruals of original issue discount for these certificates. Prospective
investors therefore should be aware that the timing of accruals of original issue discount applicable to a Stripped Certificate
generally will be different than that reported to holders and the IRS. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors
regarding their obligation to compute and include in income the correct amount of original issue discount accruals and any possible
tax consequences to them if they should fail to do so.
 
Sale or Exchange of Stripped Certificates.
Sale or exchange of a Stripped Certificate prior to its maturity will result in gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between
the amount received and the Stripped Certificateholder’s adjusted basis in that Stripped Certificate, as described under
“—Federal Income Tax Consequences for REMIC Certificates—Taxation of Regular Certificates—Sale or Exchange
of Regular Certificates” above. To the extent that a subsequent purchaser’s purchase price is exceeded by the remaining
payments on the Stripped Certificates by more than the statutory de minimis amount, that subsequent purchaser will be required
for federal income tax purposes to accrue and report that excess as if it were original issue discount in the manner described
above. It is not clear for this purpose whether the assumed prepayment rate that is to be used in the case of a Stripped Certificateholder
other than an original Stripped Certificateholder should be the Prepayment Assumption or a new rate based on the circumstances
at the date of subsequent purchase.
 
Purchase of More Than One Class of
Stripped Certificates. Where an investor purchases more than one class of Stripped Certificates, it is currently unclear whether
for federal income tax purposes those classes of Stripped Certificates should be treated separately or aggregated for purposes
of the rules described above.
 


123

 

 
Possible Alternative Characterizations.
The characterizations of the Stripped Certificates discussed above are not the only possible interpretations of the applicable
Code provisions. For example, the Stripped Certificateholder may be treated as the owner of
 
1.      
one installment obligation consisting of that Stripped Certificate’s pro rata share of the payments attributable to
principal on each mortgage loan and a second installment obligation consisting of that Stripped Certificate’s pro rata share
of the payments attributable to interest on each mortgage loan,
 
2.      
as many stripped bonds or stripped coupons as there are scheduled payments of principal and/or interest on each mortgage
loan or
 
3.      
a separate installment obligation for each mortgage loan, representing the Stripped Certificate’s pro rata share of
payments of principal and/or interest to be made with respect thereto.
 
Alternatively, the holder of one or more
classes of Stripped Certificates may be treated as the owner of a pro rata fractional undivided interest in each mortgage loan
to the extent that the Stripped Certificate, or classes of Stripped Certificates in the aggregate, represent the same pro rata
portion of principal and interest on that mortgage loan, and a stripped bond or stripped coupon (as the case may be), treated as
an installment obligation or contingent payment obligation, as to the remainder. Final regulations issued regarding original issue
discount on stripped obligations make the foregoing interpretations less likely to be applicable. The preamble to those regulations
states that they are premised on the assumption that an aggregation approach is appropriate for determining whether original issue
discount on a stripped bond or stripped coupon is de minimis, and solicits comments on appropriate rules for aggregating
stripped bonds and stripped coupons under Code Section 1286.
 
Because of these possible varying characterizations
of Stripped Certificates and the resultant differing treatment of income recognition, Stripped Certificateholders are urged to
consult their own tax advisors regarding the proper treatment of Stripped Certificates for federal income tax purposes.
 
3.8%
Medicare Tax On “Net Investment Income”
 
Certain non-corporate U.S. Persons may be
subject to an additional 3.8% Medicare Tax on “net investment income”. See “—Federal Income Tax Consequences
for REMIC Certificates—3.8% Medicare Tax on “Net Investment Income”, above.
 
Reporting
Requirements and Backup Withholding
 
The trustee will furnish, within a reasonable
time after the end of each calendar year, to each Standard Certificateholder or Stripped Certificateholder at any time during that
year, the information, prepared on the basis described above, as the trustee deems to be necessary or desirable to enable those
certificateholders to prepare their federal income tax returns. The information will include the amount of original issue discount
accrued on certificates held by persons other than certificateholders exempted from the reporting requirements. The amounts required
to be reported by the trustee may not be equal to the proper amount of original issue discount required to be reported as taxable
income by a certificateholder, other than an original certificateholder that purchased at the issue price. In particular, in the
case of Stripped Certificates, if so provided in the applicable prospectus supplement, the reporting will be based upon a representative
initial offering price of each class of Stripped Certificates. The trustee will also file the original issue discount information
with the IRS. If a certificateholder fails to supply an accurate taxpayer identification number or if the Secretary of the Treasury
determines that a certificateholder has not reported all interest and dividend income required to be shown on his federal income
tax return, backup withholding at a current rate of 28% may be required in respect of any reportable payments, as described under
“—Federal Income Tax Consequences for REMIC Certificates—Backup Withholding” above.
 
The IRS has published final regulations
which establish a reporting framework for interests in “widely held fixed investment trusts” and place the responsibility
of reporting on the person in the ownership chain
 


124

 

 
who holds
an interest for a beneficial owner. A widely-held fixed investment trust is defined as an arrangement classified as an “investment
trust” under Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-4(c), in which any interest is held by a middleman, which includes, but
is not limited to (i) a custodian of a person’s account, (ii) a nominee and (iii) a broker holding an interest for a customer
in street name.
 
Under these regulations, in connection with
a grantor trust, the trustee will be required to file Form 1099 (or any successor form) with the IRS with respect to holders of
the certificates who are not “exempt recipients” (a term that includes corporations, trusts, securities dealers, middlemen
and certain other non-individuals) and do not hold such certificates through a middleman, to report, in accordance with the provisions
of the pooling and servicing agreement, the grantor trust’s gross income and, in certain circumstances, unless the trustee
reports under the safe harbor as described in the last sentence of this paragraph, if any trust assets were disposed of or certificates
are sold in secondary market sales, the portion of the gross proceeds relating to the trust assets that are attributable to such
holder. The same requirements would be imposed on middlemen holding certificates on behalf of holders. Under certain circumstances,
the trustee may report under the safe harbor for widely-held mortgage trusts, as such term is defined under Treasury Regulations
Section 1.671-5.
 
These regulations also require that the
trustee make available information regarding interest income and information necessary to compute any original issue discount to
(i) exempt recipients (including middlemen) and non-calendar year taxpayers, upon request, in accordance with the requirements
of the regulations and (ii) holders who do not hold their certificates through a middleman. The information must be provided to
parties specified in clause (i) on or before (a) the later of the 44th day after the close of the calendar year to which the request
relates and 28 days after the receipt of the request if any trust assets are interests in another widely-held fixed investment
trust or REMIC regular interests, and otherwise (b) the later of the 30th day after the close of the calendar year to which the
request relates and 14 days after the receipt of the request. The information must be provided to parties specified in clause (ii)
on or before March 15th of the calendar year for which the statement is being furnished.
 
Taxation
of Certain Foreign Investors
 
Treasury regulations provide that interest
or original issue discount paid by the trustee or other withholding agent to a Non-U.S. Person evidencing ownership interest in
mortgage loans will be “portfolio interest” and will be treated in the manner, and those persons will be subject to
the same certification and reporting requirements, described under “—Federal Income Tax Consequences for REMIC Certificates—Taxation
of Certain Foreign Investors—Regular Certificates” above.
 
Holders that are “foreign financial
institutions” may be required to provide additional information under FATCA. See “—Federal Income Tax Consequences
for REMIC Certificates—Taxation of Certain Foreign Investors—FATCA”, above.
 
STATE
AND OTHER TAX CONSIDERATIONS
 
In addition to the federal income tax consequences
described in “Material Federal Income Tax Consequences”, you should consider the state and local tax consequences
of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of the offered certificates. State and local tax law may differ substantially from
the corresponding federal law, and the discussion above does not purport to describe any aspect of the tax laws of any state or
other jurisdiction. Thus, you should consult your own tax advisors with respect to the various tax consequences of investments
in the offered certificates.
 
CERTAIN
ERISA CONSIDERATIONS
 
General
 
The Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended, or ERISA, and the Code impose certain requirements on retirement plans, and on certain other employee
benefit plans and arrangements, including individual retirement accounts and annuities, Keogh plans, collective investment
 


125

 

 
funds,
insurance company separate accounts and some insurance company general accounts in which those plans, accounts or arrangements
are invested that are subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code (all of which
are referred to as “Plans”), and on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to Plans, in connection with the
investment of Plan assets. Certain employee benefit plans, such as governmental plans (as defined in ERISA Section 3(32)),
and, if no election has been made under Section 410(d) of the Code, church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA)
are not subject to ERISA requirements. However, those plans may be subject to the provisions of other applicable federal, state
or local law (“Similar Law”) materially similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA or the Code. Moreover,
those plans, if qualified and exempt from taxation under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code, are subject to the prohibited
transaction rules set forth in Section 503 of the Code.
 
ERISA generally imposes on Plan fiduciaries
certain general fiduciary requirements, including those of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that a Plan’s
investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the Plan. In addition, ERISA and the Code prohibit a broad range
of transactions involving assets of a Plan and persons (“Parties in Interest”) who have certain specified relationships
to the Plan, unless a statutory, regulatory or administrative exemption is available. Certain Parties in Interest that participate
in a prohibited transaction may be subject to an excise tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 of the Code, unless a statutory,
regulatory or administrative exemption is available. These prohibited transactions generally are set forth in Section 406
of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. Special caution should be exercised before the assets of a Plan are used to purchase
an offered certificate if, with respect to those assets, the Depositor, the master servicer or the trustee or one of their affiliates,
either: (a) has investment discretion with respect to the investment of those assets of that Plan; or (b) has authority
or responsibility to give, or regularly gives, investment advice with respect to those assets for a fee and pursuant to an agreement
or understanding that the advice will serve as a primary basis for investment decisions with respect to those assets and that the
advice will be based on the particular investment needs of the Plan; or (c) is an employer maintaining or contributing to
the Plan.
 
Before purchasing any offered certificates
with Plan assets, a Plan fiduciary should consult with its counsel and determine whether there exists any prohibition to that purchase
under the requirements of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, whether any prohibited transaction class exemption or any individual
administrative prohibited transaction exemption (as described below) applies, including whether the appropriate conditions set
forth in those exemptions would be met, or whether any statutory prohibited transaction exemption is applicable, and further should
consult the applicable prospectus supplement relating to that series of offered certificates. Fiduciaries of plans subject to a
Similar Law should consider the need for, and the availability of, an exemption under such applicable Similar Law.
 
Plan Asset Regulations
 
A Plan’s investment in offered certificates
may cause the trust assets to be deemed Plan assets. Section 2510.3-101 of the regulations of the United States Department
of Labor (“DOL”), as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, provides that when a Plan acquires an equity interest
in an entity, the Plan’s assets include both the equity interest and an undivided interest in each of the underlying assets
of the entity, unless certain exceptions not applicable to this discussion apply, or unless the equity participation in the entity
by “benefit plan investors” (that is, Plans and entities whose underlying assets include plan assets) is not “significant.”
For this purpose, in general, equity participation in a trust fund will be “significant” on any date if, immediately
after the most recent acquisition of any certificate, 25% or more of any class of certificates is held by benefit plan investors.
 
In general, any person who has discretionary
authority or control respecting the management or disposition of Plan assets, and any person who provides investment advice with
respect to those assets for a fee, is a fiduciary of the investing Plan. If the trust assets constitute Plan assets, then any party
exercising management or discretionary control regarding those assets, such as a master servicer, a special servicer or any sub-servicer,
may be deemed to be a Plan “fiduciary” with respect to the investing Plan, and thus subject to the fiduciary responsibility
provisions and prohibited transaction provisions of
 


126

 

 
ERISA
and the Code. In addition, if the Trust Assets constitute Plan assets, the purchase of offered certificates by a Plan, as well
as the operation of the trust fund, may constitute or involve a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code.
 
Administrative Exemptions
 
Several underwriters of mortgage-backed
securities have applied for and obtained individual administrative ERISA prohibited transaction exemptions (the “Exemptions”)
which can only apply to the purchase and holding of mortgage-backed securities which, among other conditions, are sold in an offering
with respect to which that underwriter serves as the sole or a managing underwriter, or as a selling or placement agent. If one
of the Exemptions might be applicable to a series of certificates, the related prospectus supplement will refer to the possibility,
as well as provide a summary of the conditions to the applicability. Plan fiduciaries should, and other potential investors who
may be analyzing the potential liquidity of their investment may wish to, consult with their advisors regarding the Exemptions.
 
Insurance Company General
Accounts
 
Sections I and III of Prohibited Transaction
Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 95-60 exempt from the application of the prohibited transaction provisions of
Sections 406(a), 406(b) and 407(a) of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code transactions in connection with the acquisition
of a security (such as a certificate issued by a trust fund) as well as the servicing, management and operation of a trust (such
as the trust fund) in which an insurance company general account has an interest as a result of its acquisition of certificates
issued by the trust, provided that certain conditions are satisfied. If these conditions are met, insurance company general accounts
investing assets that are treated as assets of Plans would be allowed to purchase certain classes of certificates which do not
meet the ratings requirements of the Exemptions. All other conditions of the Exemptions would have to be satisfied in order for
PTCE 95-60 to be available. Before purchasing any class of offered certificates, an insurance company general account seeking to
rely on Sections I and III of PTCE 95-60 should itself confirm that all applicable conditions and other requirements have
been satisfied.
 
Section 401(c) to ERISA provides certain
exemptive relief from the provisions of Part 4 of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, including the prohibited
transaction restrictions imposed by ERISA and the related excise taxes imposed by the Code, for transactions involving an insurance
company general account. Pursuant to Section 401(c) of ERISA, the DOL issued regulations (“401(c) Regulations”),
generally effective July 5, 2001, to provide guidance for the purpose of determining, in cases where insurance policies supported
by an insured’s general account are issued to or for the benefit of a Plan on or before December 31, 1998, which general
account assets constitute Plan assets. Any assets of an insurance company general account which support insurance policies issued
to a Plan after December 31, 1998 or issued to Plans on or before December 31, 1998 for which the insurance company does
not comply with the 401(c) Regulations may be treated as Plan assets. In addition, because Section 401(c) of ERISA does not
relate to insurance company separate accounts, separate account assets are still generally treated as Plan assets of any Plan invested
in that separate account. Insurance companies contemplating the investment of general account assets in the offered certificates
should consult with their counsel with respect to the applicability of Section 401(c) of ERISA.
 
Unrelated Business Taxable
Income; Residual Certificates
 
The purchase of a Residual Certificate by
any employee benefit plan qualified under Code Section 401(a) and exempt from taxation under Code Section 501(a), including
most varieties of Plans, may give rise to “unrelated business taxable income” as described in Code Sections 511-515
and 860E. Further, prior to the purchase of Residual Certificates, a prospective transferee may be required to provide an affidavit
to a transferor that it is not, nor is it purchasing a Residual Certificate on behalf of, a “Disqualified Organization,”
which term as defined above includes certain tax-exempt entities not subject to Code Section 511 including certain governmental
plans, as discussed above under the caption “Material Federal Income Tax Consequences—Federal Income Tax Consequences
for REMIC
 


127

 

 
Certificates—Taxation
of Residual Certificates—Tax-Related Restrictions on Transfer of Residual Certificates—Disqualified Organizations.”
 
Due to the complexity of these rules and
the penalties imposed upon persons involved in prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that potential investors who
are Plan fiduciaries or who are investing Plan assets consult with their counsel regarding the consequences under ERISA and the
Code of their acquisition and ownership of certificates.
 
The sale of certificates to a Plan is in
no respect a representation by the Depositor or the Underwriter that this investment meets all relevant legal requirements with
respect to investments by Plans generally or by any particular Plan, or that this investment is appropriate for Plans generally
or for any particular Plan.
 
LEGAL
INVESTMENT
 
If so specified in the related prospectus
supplement, certain classes of offered certificates will constitute “mortgage related securities” for purposes of the
Secondary Mortgage Market Enhancement Act of 1984, as amended (“SMMEA”). Generally, the only classes of offered
certificates which will qualify as “mortgage related securities” will be those that (1) are rated in one of the
two highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization, as defined in Section 3(a)(62)
of the Exchange Act (“NRSRO”); and (2) are part of a series evidencing interests in a trust fund consisting
of loans originated by certain types of originators specified in SMMEA and secured by first liens on real estate.
 
While Section 939(e) of the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act amended SMMEA, effective July 21, 2012, so as to require the SEC to establish creditworthiness
standards by that date in substitution for the foregoing ratings test, the SEC has neither proposed nor adopted a rule establishing
new creditworthiness standards for purposes of SMMEA as of the date of this prospectus. However, the SEC has issued a transitional
interpretation (Release No. 34-67448 (effective July 20, 2012)), which provides that, until such time as final rules establishing
new standards of creditworthiness become effective, the standard of creditworthiness for purposes of the definition of the term
“mortgage related security” is a security that is rated in one of the two highest rating categories by at least one
NRSRO. Depending on the standards of creditworthiness that are ultimately established by the SEC, it is possible that certain classes
of offered certificates specified to be “mortgage related securities” for purposes of SMMEA in the related prospectus
supplement, may no longer qualify as such as of the time such new standards are effective.
 
The appropriate characterization of the
offered certificates under various legal investment restrictions, and thus the ability of investors subject to those restrictions
to purchase the offered certificates, are subject to significant interpretive uncertainties. Except as may be specified in the
related prospectus supplement with regard to the status of certain classes of offered certificates as “mortgage related securities”
for purposes of SMMEA, no representations are made as to the proper characterization of the offered certificates for legal investment,
financial institution regulatory, or other purposes, or as to the ability of particular investors to purchase any offered certificates
under applicable legal investment restrictions. Further, any ratings downgrade of a class of offered certificates by an NRSRO to
less than an “investment grade” rating (i.e., lower than the top four rating categories) may adversely affect the ability
of an investor to purchase or retain, or otherwise impact the regulatory characteristics of, that class. The uncertainties described
above (and any unfavorable future determinations concerning the legal investment or financial institution regulatory characteristics
of the offered certificates) may adversely affect the liquidity and market value of the offered certificates.
 
Accordingly, all investors whose investment
activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, regulatory capital requirements, or review by regulatory authorities
should consult with their own legal advisors in determining whether and to what extent the offered certificates constitute legal
investments or are subject to investment, capital, or other regulatory restrictions.
 


128

 

 
METHOD
OF DISTRIBUTION
 
The offered certificates offered by this
prospectus and by the related prospectus supplements will be offered in series, each consisting of one or more classes of certificates,
through one or more of the methods described below. The prospectus supplement prepared for each series will describe the method
of offering being utilized for that series, including the initial public offering or purchase price of each class or the method
by which the price will be determined, and our net proceeds from that sale.
 
We intend that offered certificates will
be offered through the following methods from time to time and that offerings may be made concurrently through more than one of
these methods or that an offering of a particular series of certificates may be made through a combination of two or more of these
methods. Those methods are as follows:
 
1.      
by negotiated firm commitment or best efforts underwriting and public offering by one or more underwriters specified in
the related prospectus supplement;
 
2.      
by placements through one or more placement agents specified in the related prospectus supplement primarily with institutional
investors and dealers; and
 
3.      
through direct offerings by the Depositor.
 
In addition, if specified in the related
prospectus supplement, the offered certificates of a series may be offered in whole or in part to the seller of the related
mortgage assets that would comprise the trust fund for such certificates.
 
If underwriters are used in a sale of any
offered certificates (other than in connection with an underwriting on a best efforts basis), those certificates will be acquired
by the underwriters for their own account and may be resold from time to time in one or more transactions, including negotiated
transactions, at fixed public offering prices or at varying prices to be determined at the time of sale or at the time of commitment.
The managing underwriter or underwriters with respect to the offer and sale of a particular series of offered certificates will
be set forth on the cover of the prospectus supplement relating to that series and the members of the underwriting syndicate, if
any, will be named in that prospectus supplement.
 
In connection with the sale of the offered
certificates, the underwriters may receive compensation from us or from purchasers of the offered certificates in the form of discounts,
concessions or commissions. Underwriters and dealers participating in the distribution of the offered certificates may be deemed
to be underwriters in connection with those offered certificates, and any discounts or commissions received by them from us and
any profit on the resale of offered certificates by them may be deemed to be underwriting discounts and commissions under the Securities
Act. The related prospectus supplement will describe any discounts, concessions or commissions to be allowed or paid by us to the
underwriters, any other items constituting underwriting compensation, and any discounts and commissions to be allowed or paid to
the dealers.
 
If so specified in the related prospectus
supplement, the offered certificates may be underwritten by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, acting as sole underwriter or together
with such other underwriters as may be named in the prospectus supplement, or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC may act as a dealer with
regard to the offered certificates. The depositor is an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and, as such, J.P. Morgan Securities
LLC will have potential conflicts of interest in underwriting or acting as a dealer with regard to any offered certificates. Any
potential conflicts of interest pertaining to J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, any of the other underwriters of the offered certificates,
and their respective affiliates will be described in the related prospectus supplement.
 
It is anticipated that the underwriting
agreement pertaining to the sale of any series of offered certificates will provide that the obligations of the underwriters will
be subject to certain conditions precedent, that the underwriters will be obligated to purchase all offered certificates if any
are purchased (other than in connection with an underwriting on a best efforts basis) and that we will indemnify the
 


129

 

 
several
underwriters, and each person, if any, who controls that underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act,
and the underwriters will indemnify us and our controlling persons, against certain civil liabilities, including liabilities under
the Securities Act, or will contribute to payments required to be made in respect of these liabilities.
 
The prospectus supplement with respect to
any series offered by placements through dealers will contain information regarding the nature of that offering and any agreements
to be entered into between us and purchasers of offered certificates of that series.
 
We anticipate that the offered certificates
offered by this prospectus and the related prospectus supplement will be sold primarily to institutional investors. Purchasers
of offered certificates, including dealers, may, depending on the facts and circumstances of those purchases, be deemed to be “underwriters”
within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with reoffers and resales by them of offered certificates. If you purchase
offered certificates, you should consult with your legal advisors in this regard prior to any reoffer or resale.
 
All or part of any class of offered certificates
may be acquired by us or by one or more of our affiliates in a secondary market transaction or from an affiliate. Such
offered certificates may then be included in a trust fund, the beneficial ownership of which will be evidenced by one
or more classes of mortgage-backed certificates, including subsequent series of certificates offered pursuant to this
prospectus and a prospectus supplement.
 
As to each series of certificates, only
those classes rated in an investment grade rating category by an NRSRO will be offered by this prospectus and the related prospectus
supplement. We may initially retain any class rated below investment grade, or any unrated class, and we may sell it at any time
to one or more institutional investors.
 
If and to the extent required by applicable
law or regulation, this prospectus will be used by an underwriter in connection with offers and sales related to market-making
transactions in the offered certificates with respect to which such underwriter acts as principal. An underwriter may also
act as agent in such transactions. Sales may be made at negotiated prices determined at the time of sale.
 
INCORPORATION
OF CERTAIN INFORMATION BY REFERENCE
 
With respect to each series of certificates
offered by this prospectus, there are incorporated in this prospectus and in the related prospectus supplement by reference all
documents and reports (other than annual reports on Form 10-K) filed or caused to be filed by the Depositor with respect to a trust
fund before the end of the related offering pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act,
that relate specifically to the related series of certificates. The Depositor will provide or cause to be provided without charge
to each person to whom this prospectus is delivered in connection with the offering of one or more classes of offered certificates,
upon written or oral request of that person, a copy of any or all documents or reports incorporated in this prospectus by reference,
in each case to the extent the documents or reports relate to one or more of the classes of offered certificates, other than the
exhibits to those documents (unless the exhibits are specifically incorporated by reference in those documents). Requests to the
Depositor should be directed in writing to its principal executive offices at 383 Madison Avenue, 31st Floor, New York, New York
10179, Attention: President, or by telephone at (212) 272-6858. The Depositor has determined that its financial statements will
not be material to the offering of any offered certificates.
 
The Depositor filed a registration statement
(the “Registration Statement”) relating to the certificates with the SEC. This prospectus is part of the Registration
Statement, but the Registration Statement includes additional information.

WHERE
YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION
 
Copies of the Registration Statement and
other filed materials, including distribution reports on Form 10-D, annual reports on Form 10-K, current reports on Form 8-K, and
any amendments for these reports may be read and copied at the Public Reference Section of the SEC, 100 F Street N.W., Washington,
D.C. 20549. Information regarding the operation of the Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
The SEC also maintains a site on the World Wide Web at “http://www.sec.gov” at which you can view and download copies
of reports, proxy and information statements and other information filed electronically through the Electronic Data Gathering,
Analysis and Retrieval (“EDGAR”) system. The Depositor has filed the Registration Statement (SEC File No. 333-190246),
including all exhibits thereto, through the EDGAR system, so the materials should be available by logging onto the SEC’s
Web site. The SEC maintains computer terminals providing access to the EDGAR system at each of the offices referred to above.
 
If so specified in the related prospectus
supplement, copies of all filings through the EDGAR system of the related issuing entity on Forms 10-D, 10-K and 8-K will be made
available on the applicable Trustee’s or other identified party’s website.
 
LEGAL
MATTERS
 
The validity of the certificates of each
series and material federal income tax matters will be passed upon for us by Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP or such
other counsel as may be specified in the applicable prospectus supplement.
 
FINANCIAL
INFORMATION
 
A new trust fund will be formed with respect
to each series of certificates, and no trust fund will engage in any business activities or have any assets or obligations prior
to the issuance of the related series of certificates. Accordingly, no financial statements with respect to any trust fund will
be included in this prospectus or in the related prospectus supplement.
 
RATING
 
It is a condition to the issuance of any
class of offered certificates that they shall have been rated not lower than investment grade, that is, in one of the four highest
rating categories, by at least one NRSRO.
 
Other NRSROs that have not been engaged
to rate any class of offered certificates may issue unsolicited credit ratings on one or more classes of offered certificates,
relying on information they obtain pursuant to Rule 17g-5 under the Exchange Act or otherwise.
 
Ratings on mortgage pass-through certificates
address the likelihood of receipt by the holders of those certificates of all collections on the underlying mortgage assets to
which those holders are entitled. These ratings address the structural, legal and issuer-related aspects associated with those
certificates, the nature of the underlying mortgage assets and the credit quality of the guarantor, if any. Ratings on mortgage
pass-through certificates do not represent any assessment of the likelihood of principal prepayments by borrowers or of the degree
by which those prepayments might differ from those originally anticipated. As a result, you might suffer a lower than anticipated
yield, and, in addition, holders of stripped interest certificates in extreme cases might fail to recoup their initial investments.
 
A security rating is not a recommendation
to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning NRSRO. Each security
rating should be evaluated independently of any other security rating.
