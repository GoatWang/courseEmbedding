Pan Lei - Wikipedia






















 






Pan Lei

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

This is a Chinese name; the family name is Pan.




Pan Lei.


Pan Lei (Chinese: 潘耒; pinyin: Pān Lěi) (1646 – 1708) was a Qing dynasty scholar. He wrote the prefaces for a number of works that appeared in his time. In the preface to writer Qu Dajun's book Guangdong Xinyu, widely regarded as a valuable source on the economic and social conditions of Guangdong in 1700, Pan wrote about the beauty, natural resources, and unique history of East Guangdong.[1] Pan was also involved in the study of mathematics. In the preface to Mei Wending's Fangchenglun, a treatise on linear algebra written in 1690, he wrote:

Although mathematics is the last of the Six Arts (liui ), it has wide applications. Without mathematics, it is impossible to understand the measurement of Heaven and the survey of the Earth; it is impossible to regulate taxes and to manage finances; it is impossible to raise armies and dispose troops; it is impossible to administer civil engineering.[2]

Pan Lei's collected works also included the opinions of women who believed that poetry writing was considered unnecessary for women, which led to their works being kept secret.[3]

Who is vouching for the input voucher? : decentralized targeting and elite capture in Tanzania by Lei Pan(

                              Input subsidy programs carry support as instruments to increase agricultural productivity, provided they are market-smart.
                                 This requires especially proper targeting to contain the fiscal pressure, with decentralized targeting of input vouchers currently
                                 the instrument of choice. Nonetheless, despite clear advantages in administrative costs, the fear of elite capture persists.
                                 These fears are borne out in the experience from the 2008 input voucher pilot program in Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, examined here.
                                 Elected village officials received about 60 percent of the distributed vouchers, a factor that significantly reduced the targeting
                                 performance of the program, especially in more unequal and remote communities. When targeting the poor, greater coverage and
                                 a focus on high trust settings helped mitigate these concerns. The findings highlight the continuing need for scrutiny when
                                 relying on decentralized targeting. A clearer sense of purpose (increasing productivity among poorer farmers versus increasing
                                 aggregate output) could also enhance the targeting performance

Vivo Per Lei Facial Peeling - FREE SHIPPING

I would recommend this item to a friend.





Vivo Per Lei Facial Peel is the best.
6/12/2012


I had bought Vivo products at the mall and loved it.  It improved my skin to where my daughter noticed.  When I ran out I went back and the kiosk was gone.  I hunted until I found it at Cleopatra's.  It works instantly and I can't be without it now.
        
Pros:It is so clean and fresh and you see results immediately. 








Vivo Per Lei Moisturizing Day Cream

Love this
1/20/2013


This moisturizer is fantastic.  A little does go a long way.  It lasts me about 7 months. My skin feels so soft and smooth.  I was very skeptical about it, but I from the first week I was hooked!  It doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy and doesn't break me out.  I really have to read labels of products that I use on my skin as /i have allergies.  If you have tried everything else and nothing seems to work.  Definitely give it a try.
        
Pros:The price is reasonable.  I looked for this product in the mall and it was twice the price as here. 
Cons:Nothing.

does not irritate the skin.
3/18/2012


Love this product would sell it , its  that good, no irritations or rashes from the product. Most creams cause problems that make me stop using them.
        
Pros:Nice fragrance. You dont need much to smooth skin.
