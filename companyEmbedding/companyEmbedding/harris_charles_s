Product Description:

Julie Harris reprises her Tony Award-winning Broadway role as Emily Dickinson in this one-woman interpretation of the great literary figure's life. Set against a re-creation of Dickinson's 19th-century Amherst, Massachusetts home, Harris reads from the reclusive poet's poems, letters, and diaries to offer a fully nuanced portrait of the artist as both a real human being and an often-tortured genius.
Plot Synopsis:

This fascinating video explores the life and work of poet Emily Dickinson. Reprising the role that earned her a Tony Award, Julie Harris reads some of Dickinson's most famous verses, as well as excerpts from her diaries and letters. With the writer's Massachusetts house as a backdrop, the program also dramatizes moments from "the belle of Amherst's" life.
