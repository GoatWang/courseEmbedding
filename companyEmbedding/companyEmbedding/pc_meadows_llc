Both types are economical and convenient to use.VIEW FULL DATA SHEETREQUEST PRODUCT SAMPLEREQUEST PRODUCT LITERATURETechnical LiteratureProject ProfileProduct Submittal SystemData SheetsProduct Data Sheet Safety Data Sheet Product Data Sheet07 10 00No. 712PROTECTION COURSE Waterproofing ProtectionDESCRIPTION PROTECTION COURSE is a multi-ply, semi-rigid core composed of a mineral-fortified asphalt core formed between two outside layers of asphalt-impregnated reinforced mats, manufactured in accordance with ASTM D 6506.When properly applied by personnel trained in good waterproofing techniques, PROTECTION COURSE will absorb the impact of aggregate shock and normal jobsite foot traffic. It also protects the membrane waterproofing from penetration by sharp aggregate during backfilling and later settlement. PROTECTION COURSE is available in two types: PC-2, Standard Duty and PC-3, Heavy Duty. Both types are economical and convenient to use.USES PROTECTION COURSE is used in between slab construction, such as plaza decks, roof terraces, promenade decks, pedestrian concourses, tunnels, bathroom floors, showers, kitchens, mechanical rooms, parking garage decks, planter boxes, reflective pools, and foundation walls. PROTECTION COURSE is compatible with most currently popular dampproofing and waterproofing materials.FEATURES/BENEFITSTough, durable and lightweight … panels are easily handled, quickly installed.Full width fiberglass matting improves flexural strength.Highly resistant to chemical action.Performance is equally effective in above- or below-grade installations.Unique dual facing offers compatibility with most currently popular waterproofing materials.Economical and convenient to use.PACKAGING 4′ x 8′ (1.22 m x 2.44 m) PanelsTECHNICAL DATA ASTM D 6506, Class B PROTECTION BOARD REQUIREMENTSPC-2PC-3Puncture Strength312 N (70 1bf) minimum365 N (82 1bf) minimumThickness2.4 – 3.9 mm (0.095″ – 0.155″)5.6 – 7.1 mm (0.220″ – 0.280″)Water Absorption10.0% maximum10.0% maximumAsphalt, % by weight40% minimum40% minimumResistance to Decay (Classes A & B)Meets puncture requirements after completion of testMeets puncture requirements after completion of testProduct conforming to ASTM D 6506, Class A also available by special order.APPLICATION NOTE: Prior to application, consult the waterproofing manufacturer to determine whether the polyethylene film facing on one side, or the asphalt-impregnated reinforced mat on the other side of PROTECTION COURSE, is approved as “compatible” to the specific waterproofing product being protected.PROTECTION COURSE is installed to form a continuous protective layer over the membrane waterproofing. The sheets can be easily cut with a roofer’s knife for fitting at protrusions.Surface Condition … The waterproofing membrane must be free of sharp projections, dirt, and dust. If water testing is desired, it should be made prior to placing PROTECTION COURSE. Note: PROTECTION COURSE should be applied at the end of each day’s waterproofing to both horizontal and vertical surfaces.Horizontal Surfaces … PROTECTION COURSE should be installed over the waterproofing membrane as soon as permissible by the membrane applicator or manufacturer. PROTECTION COURSE sheets should be butted together and cut to fit all intersecting surfaces and protrusions. If desired, joints may be covered with DETAIL STRIP from W. R. MEADOWS or roofer’s glass reinforced tape embedded in hot asphalt as a secondary waterproofing system. (See PRECAUTIONS.)Vertical Surfaces … For dampproofed and/or waterproofed vertical walls to receive backfill, PROTECTION COURSE should be butt jointed and, if necessary, temporarily held in place while backfilling.Backfilling … Backfilling against vertical walls should be done immediately using care and caution to avoid damaging the waterproofing application. Backfill material should not be dropped against PROTECTION COURSE in such a manner that it could drag the sheet down as the backfill drops. For horizontal applications, the waterproofing and PROTECTION COURSE should be installed just prior to the installation of the wearing surface.PRECAUTIONS Where PROTECTION COURSE is adhered to a waterproofing membrane, use an approved adhesive. Where taped joints are desired with tape set in hot asphalt, consult membrane manufacturer. PROTECTION COURSE is shipped on pallets with the polyethylene anti-stick sheet on the top or exposed side. PROTECTION COURSE should be stored on pallets and placed on a level surface. CAUTION: Do not apply PROTECTION COURSE over liquid waterproofing membranes containing volatile solvents until all of the solvent has evaporated. Consult membrane manufacturer for specific application details prior to placing PROTECTION COURSE. Read and follow application information and precautions.

IMPORTANT for AOL and Comcast Email Users
Some of our users who use AOL and Comcast have reported that they are not receiving our mail, even in their Spam folder. 
This is because those providers are very strict in rejecting mail that it thinks is spam.

If you experience this issue, you can adjust your Spam settings to allow our mail into your spam folder:

For AOL:

Go to your AOL account and log in.
Near the top right in "Options" choose "Mail Settings". 
On the left choose "Spam Settings".
Select "Deliver blocked mail to Spam folder".
Click "Save Settings" at the bottom.


For Comcast/Xfinity

Please read this help page:
 Comcast Spam Filters


You should choose this setting:
"Spam Filtering with Save a copy of emails marked as spam," which "places emails designated as spam in a separate Spam folder. 
You can check and see if any legitimate email was designated as spam by accident and use the toolbar to mark it Not Spam."


When you receive one of our emails in your spam folder, PLEASE mark it as NOT-SPAM. 


Thank you.

Product Description
PROTECTION COURSE from W. R. MEADOWS is a multi-ply semi-rigid core composed of a mineral-fortified asphalt core formed between two outside layers of asphalt-impregnated reinforced mats, manufactured in accordance with ASTM D 6506.

When properly applied by personnel trained in good waterproofing techniques, PROTECTION COURSE will absorb the impact of aggregate shock and normal jobsite foot traffic. It also protects the membrane waterproofing from penetration by sharp aggregate during backfilling and later settlement. PROTECTION COURSE is available in two types: PC-2, Standard Duty and PC-3, Heavy Duty. Both types are economical and convenient to use.
