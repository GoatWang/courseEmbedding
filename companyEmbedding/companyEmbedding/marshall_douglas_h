Excellent Bible dictionary save for ONE flaw that may be a no-go for some.

            An exceptional Bible dictionary that has loads of information beautifully written and VERY useful.  The one flaw I detect is that the font size is quite small (6 or 6.5).  However the small font size is offset by a nice DARK and CLEAR print which makes reading a tad easier for those of us in the evening of our lives.  I find that after about an hour of reading I am done even if I use a page magnifier.   I understand that a larger font would have added to the cost. 


I would recommend this dictionary in a heartbeat with a caveat about the font size which could be a big deal for some.  Thank you IVP Press for another great product. 


This is a superb

            I was known this from my husband.  He went to Seminar school 15 years a go and his Professor used Theologian Marshall books to teach him a long with others wellknown Theologians  (Millar and Paker...etc) .  It's really helpfull when you want to know more details about words in Bible.  It helps me when I used it for reference lessons of Sunday school class or Bible group disscusion.  I thank God for these Theologians.

            Much more than I was expecting. We took a class and this was recommended as a resource to learn more and to help dig into the Bible. I'm so glad we got it, I was actually surprised with the information content and just drills in our God is so real with all the history, facts, maps, etc in it. It will be a study resource for a lifetime, thank you!

            It's honest, a complete work, and it's done very nicely. It lets me search a term/word/subject and I know I have a balanced knowledge truthful understanding after reading it. Great work! I don't have to get another Bible Dictionary.


Thank you to all the people who worked on this book!

HartelSpringer Science & Business Media, 2003 - Technology & Engineering - 371 pages 3 Reviewshttps://books.google.com/books/about/Ice_Cream.html?id=DN9Ju6oiSWkCCompletely re-written with two new co-authors who provide expertise in physical chemistry and engineering, the Sixth Edition of this textbook/reference explores the entire scope of the ice cream industry, from the chemical, physical, engineering and biological principles of the production process, to the marketing and distribution of the finished product. This Sixth Edition builds on the strengths of previous editions with its coverage of the history, production and consumption, composition, ingredients, calculation and preparation of mixes, equipment, processing, freezing, hardening, storage, distribution, regulations, cleaning and sanitizing, safety, and quality of ice cream and related frozen desserts. Specifically, the chapters on composition and properties, ingredients, calculations, freezing, refrigeration, analyzing frozen desserts, and microbiological quality and safety are expanded. SI units have been incorporated throughout, also with easy reference to US equivalents, where appropriate. The Sixth Edition includes a more thorough treatment of industrial production, incorporating the latest research reports and the newest equipment produced by the supplying industry. Data on the composition of typical frozen desserts is presented, including more than 50 formulas and 85 special recipes. Outstanding in its breadth and coherence, Ice Cream, Sixth Edition continues to serve as a primary educational authority for students in food science and dairy science, as well as an authoritative resource for all aspects of the ice cream industry.  Preview this book » What people are saying - Write a reviewUser Review -  Flag as inappropriatei am gladUser Review -  Flag as inappropriategreat narration of ice cream freezing ..... helpful in project work ....ContentsThe Ice Cream Industry1 Historical Background2 Production and Consumption7 Our Thoughts9 Composition and Properties11 Classifications of Ice Cream and Related Products12 Descriptions of Commercial Frozen Desserts14 Flavor Categories for Ice Cream17 Terms Used in Refrigeration222 Packaging Labeling Hardening and Shipping225 Labeling227 The Packaging Operation232 The Hardening Process240 Handling Storing and Shipping246 Quality is the Goal251 References252 MoreComplexities of Composition18 Energy Value and Nutrients20 Characteristics of a Satisfactory Composition26 The Roles of the Constituents27 Importance of Flavor37 The Balanced Mix38 Physical Properties of Mixes44 References50 Ice Cream Ingredients55 Milk Products Used in Ice Cream60 NonDairy Fats69 Fat Replacers70 Sweeteners73 Salt79 Stabilizers80 Ice Cream Improvers84 Ice Structuring Proteins85 References86 Flavoring and Coloring Materials89 Flavors for Frozen Desserts91 Vanilla92 Chocolate and Cocoa96 Fruits in Frozen Desserts101 Procedures and Recipes107 Nuts112 Spices and Salt113 Flavoring Lowfat Nonfat and Special Frozen Desserts114 Color in Frozen Desserts115 Comments116 Calculation of Ice Cream Mixes119 Standardizing Milk and Cream120 Mix Formulation Calculations122 Use of Computers to Solve Mix Formulation Calculations138 Freezing Point Depression Calculations139 Overrun Calculations143 References147 Mix Processing149 Pasteurization of the Mix157 Homogenization161 Aging Mixes167 Flavoring Mixes168 The Freezing Process171 Changes that Take Place During the Dynamic Freezing Process173 Refrigeration Needed to Freeze Ice Cream183 Types of Freezers186 The Continuous Freezer187 The Batch Freezer202 References205 Refrigeration207 Types of Refrigerants208 Mechanical Refrigeration213 SoftFrozen Dairy Desserts253 Freezers for SoftServe Freezers256 Cleaning and Sanitizing SoftServe Freezers260 The Heat Treatment Freezer261 SoftServe Blended Products262 Reference263 Sherbets Sorbets and Ices265 The Composition of Sherbets Sorbets and Ices266 Preparation of Ices269 Freezing Ices and Sherbets271 Defects272 Reference273 Fancy Molded Ice Creams Novelties and Specials275 Production Systems276 Ice and Fudge Stick Items285 Other Special Products289 Reference294 Analyzing Frozen Desserts295 Physical Properties296 Microbiological Properties301 Sampling for Microbiological Tests303 Sensory Properties304 Flavor Defects305 Body and Texture Defects309 Color315 Melting Quality316 Methods of Determining Sensory Quality317 Ice Cream Clinics323 References324 Cleaning Sanitizing Microbiological Quality and Safety327 Cleaning Equipment330 Major Detergent Components and Their Functions331 Principles of Cleaning332 Sanitization of Equipment337 Controlling and Monitoring Plant Sanitation339 Hygienic Personnel340 Summary342 Formulas and Recipes343 Candy or Confection Ice Cream344 Chocolate Ice Cream345 Frozen Yogurt346 Nut Ice Creams347 Puddings348 Parfait349 Granite350 Spumoni351 Low or ReducedLactose Ice Cream352 Ice Creams of Lowered Fat Content353 References355 Index357 Copyright LessOther editions - View allIce CreamH Douglas Goff,Richard W HartelLimited preview - 2013Ice CreamRobert T.
