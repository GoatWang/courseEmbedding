Excellent food. Having celiacs I can't remember the last time I had a fried shrimp basket. SO GOOD. What a hidden treasure.

I hate to do this...I really do. It's so hard to find healthy and fresh food places and I had high hopes for this one. I usually will not "blast" a restaurant if I get one of two things: good food OR good service...I got neither here. Our waitress was awful, not altogether rude, just slightly irritated and let you know she hated her job. Any questions were met with a 15 second long blank stare then a sigh followed by a murmured response that was below my level of hearing. It was uncomfortable for us both.Now the food...I was excited about gluten free options. I'm not a health nut on a diet...I have celiacs and a very real allergy to wheat. I ordered gluten free pasta...I honestly got rice noodles in milky water with a weird "chicken like" meat item on top. Not only was it gross...it was cold, while my husbands pizza was burnt. So my advice...don't bother.

We stopped on our way thru town. Place was unassuming but I thought it worth the risk. Food and service was excellent. Great choice and will stop again.

If I could give no stars I would. I have celiacs disease and ordered a gluten free pizza. In a nutshell it was inedible. It was burnt, tough and flavorless. I eat at many different restaurants and have sampled various gluten free options, some are better than others, this is honestly the worst I have ever had and I paid $24.00 for it (14"). I can't believe they served this to me with a straight face.

I suffer from various arthritic and inflammation issues and my movement became significantly limited. Thanks to Jeanine and her extensive knowledge and training my mobility and strength have increased while my pain and weight has decreased significantly....30 pounds! I HIGHLY recommend Via-Pilates AND Jeanine.

        2/6/2016
    

If I could give this hotel no stars I would. Front desk was rude, rooms were dirty, shower still had hair in it, closets were broken, cable didn't work. The only thing that this hotel invested money in was the reception area. Breakfast was $16.95 per person...the exact same breakfast I received last year for free from a competing hotel down the street.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
