As of September 30, 2016, the Company's two affiliation options for financial advisors are the employee option and the independent contractor option. Employee financial advisors provide services to individual clients. Its independent contractor financial advisor option is designed to allow its advisors build their businesses with as much or as little of its support as they determine they need. With specific approval, they are permitted to conduct, on a limited basis, certain other approved business activities, such as offering insurance products, independent registered investment advisory services, and accounting and tax services. Irrespective of the affiliation choice, its financial advisors offer a range of investments and services, including both third party and proprietary products, and a variety of financial planning services.The Company's Private Client Group segment provides investment services and investment advisory services. Its United States financial advisors provide insurance and annuity products through its general insurance agency, Raymond James Insurance Group, Inc. The United States financial advisors offer a number of professionally managed load and no-load mutual funds. The Company provides margin loans to clients that are collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client. The Company provides custodial, trading, research and other back office support and services, (including access to clients' account information and the services of the Asset Management segment) to the independent contractor registered investment advisors with whom it is affiliated. It conducts securities lending activities through RJ&A, in which it borrows and lends securities from and to broker-dealers, financial institutions, and other counterparties.

This research primarily focuses on the United States and Canadian companies in specific industries, including agricultural, consumer, energy, clean energy, energy services, financial services, healthcare, industrial, mining and natural resources, forest products, real estate, technology, and communication and transportation.The Company earns institutional sales commissions from institutional clients who purchase both taxable and tax-exempt fixed income products, primarily municipal, corporate, government agency and mortgage-backed bonds.

In addition, it conducts a matched book derivatives business where it may enter into derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps, options, and combinations of those instruments, primarily with government entities and not-for-profit counterparties. In this matched book business, for every derivative transaction it enters into with a client, it enters into an offsetting derivative transaction with a credit support provider that is a third party financial institution. The Company through its fixed income public finance operations, enters into forward commitments to purchase Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) or Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Such MBS securities are issued on behalf of various state and local housing finance agencies (HFA) clients and consist of the mortgages originated through their lending programs. In its syndication of tax credit investments, its subsidiaries acts as the general partner or managing member in partnerships and limited liability companies that invest in real estate project entities. The Company earns fees for the origination and sale of these investment products, as well as for the oversight and management of the investments over the statutory tax credit compliance period.Asset ManagementThe Company's Asset Management segment provides investment advisory and asset management services to individual and institutional investment portfolios, and sponsors mutual funds under the name Eagle (Eagle Funds).
