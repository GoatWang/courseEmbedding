          Arjan          

          June 1, 2015          





At Core we’ve been getting more and more excited about insurance – not too worry, we’re not becoming actuaries anytime soon – and the potential for start-ups to disrupt that incredibly boring, but entirely gigantic whole industry. I owe a special gratitude to Thomas Smyth – who dropped into Core on a lark…

Everyone in the financial services industry is very excited about the digitization of money.  How exciting it would be to forego cash (and those annoying checks), in favor of a more efficient world of commerce and assets.  At the hand of Bitcoin, the argument goes, or Apple Pay, or what-not…

          February 11, 2015          





We’re all underbanked.  A lion-share of Americans aren’t “making bank.”  Most of us simply don’t earn enough to support a basic standard of living.  Yes, there is a big part of our population that poorly utilizes banks and therefore over-utilizes expensive solutions that leave most of their customers poorer.  The larger reality is that the…

Last year, I woke up to the sleeping giant of auto finance. Over the last decade, we’ve witnessed an explosion of startups building software that dramatically cuts inefficiencies in the exchange of information, goods, and services – disrupting industry incumbents in the process. In the last year, Silicon Valley is…

Bill Gates gave a speech at Sibos today, and for some unexpected reason Bloomberg TV reached out to me to comment on why the unbanked are important.  It turned into a cool 7 minute segment on Core, how our portfolio companies are improving people’s lives and how Visionaries, like Amex,…

There are, no doubt, many influences that play out on anyone’s career.  No different for me.  One of my most important ones was Babak Armajani.  He died a year ago, today. Babak had nothing to do with financial services for the emerging middle class, economic development, or financial inclusion.  To make…

I began to explore new solutions for payday lending in this op-ed in the American Banker. The response (at least based on my Twitter feed) has been outspoken, with many perspectives for and against.

        Carving up the Gecko      



          Arjan          

          June 1, 2015          





At Core we’ve been getting more and more excited about insurance – not too worry, we’re not becoming actuaries anytime soon – and the potential for start-ups to disrupt that incredibly boring, but entirely gigantic whole industry.

I owe a special gratitude to Thomas Smyth – who dropped into Core on a lark and has left us in favor of another lark, but has also left us smarter about insurance, and a litany of other matter that passed before his able young eyes.  

We’re so excited — and had so many thoughts — that we wrote a whitepaper.  You can download it here: Slicing Up the Gecko.
The Cliff Notes: Insurance is going to be the next revolution in fintech. Just as start-ups have begun to dismantle retail banking, consumer-focused, technology-first companies will redefine how we shop for, purchase, use, and even think about insurance.
In this post I’d like to air some speculative ideas I’ve had about insurance, specifically for middle-class and working-class folks, and also explain why we care so much about such a hidebound industry.
Building a safety net for all Americans
Imagine the daily lives of Americans. What goes wrong? We get into car accidents; our roofs are blown away by hurricanes; our TVs are stolen; we die. These are the traditional problems that insurance tries to solve for. But there are others, aren’t there? Our cars break down unexpectedly. A phone is stolen. A job is lost, or hours cut back.
Many of the problems that cause folks to utilize incredibly expensive short-term credit can be alleviated by insurance – at a radically lower cost, basically by defraying the risk over a larger population. The trick is figuring out how to sell an extended vehicle warranty in a market in which all extended warranties today are scams, or how to sell a wage insurance policy that workers can actually believe in.
Aspiring to stability
I’ve been puzzling over a new Pew survey that asked Americans about their hopes and dreams in the context of their financial lives. 
“When asked whether it was more important to them to have financial stability or to move up the income ladder, 92 percent of Americans choose security, an increase of 7 percentage points since 2011.”
The mythical ethos of America is that we are a nation of strivers: constantly trying to make it big, catch a break, risk it all to get ahead. Maybe this was always a myth — but it’s become even more mythical since the 2008 financial crisis and recession. Even during the so-called recovery (from 2011-2014), 7% of Americans — that’s 20 million people! — changed their priorities to focus on keeping what they have, not getting more.
Re-focusing on the big problems
That’s a big shift. Smart, new insurance and savings products should (and will) be created to meet this growing demand. With my investing hat on, I am excited about many of the deals Core is seeing.
With my civic hat on, I think: Many Americans are struggling. Many start-ups are working to alleviate the symptoms, but few are addressing the biggest problems. What does it mean to have a “good job” today? What kind of a life should the average American aspire to? What kind of economic systems and processes and, perhaps, companies can imbue the next generation with the grit, character, and creativity they need to flourish in a time of great technological progress — and economic upheaval?
I am optimistic that we will find a way, and that technology can help us build solutions to the biggest problems. But they are hard! How could technology solve unemployment, or reduce income inequality, or ensure an economic baseline for all Americans? As we have looked deeply at insurance, I am reminded again of how much change is yet to come — and how much possibility remains for growth and development.

    AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) today showcased the power of its upcoming Ryzen™ and Radeon™ products during its press conference at COMPUTEX TAIPEI 2017. The company delivered a series of never-before-seen product demonstrations, showed new Ryzen processor-based high-end gaming systems from top global OEMs, and announced launch timelines for several of its upcoming datacenter, prosumer, and consumer products."We celebrate 30 years of AMD in Taiwan at Computex this year with great momentum around our new high-performance computing and graphics products,” said AMD President and CEO Dr. Lisa Su. “At Computex we highlighted the next wave of AMD products that will come to market, including our upcoming EPYC family of processors for datacenters, high-end Radeon ‘Vega’-based graphics cards, and new AMD Ryzen Threadripper and Ryzen mobile processors. We were  thrilled to be joined by customers and partners including Acer, Asus, Dell, HP and Lenovo to showcase their latest AMD Ryzen-powered PCs.”  EPYC LaunchAt Computex 2017, AMD announced the worldwide launch date for 
    EPYC™, the new AMD family of high-performance processors for cloud-based and traditional on-premise datacenters, previously codenamed Naples, which will deliver the highly-successful "Zen" x86 processing engine scaling up to 32 physical cores. The first EPYC processor-based servers are scheduled to launch on June 20th 2017, with widespread support expected from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and channel partners, ushering in a new era for high-performance server processors and the datacenter. With its high core count, superior memory bandwidth, and unparalleled support for high-speed input/output (I/O) channels in a single chip, EPYC aims to revolutionize the dual-socket server market while simultaneously reshaping expectations for single-socket servers.  Ryzen Momentum Following the recent launches of seven AMD Ryzen desktop processors, including AMD Ryzen™ 7 and AMD Ryzen™ 5, designed to bring innovation and competition back to the full spectrum of premium PC markets, AMD outlined continued momentum for Ryzen. Building on the Ryzen channel foundation, AMD announced that all of the top global PC OEMs expect to have Ryzen-based designs in the market by end of Q2 2017, giving consumers a wide range of premium and gaming towers, and all-in-ones, powered by Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 desktop processors. The Ryzen-powered Windows®-based systems from Acer, Asus, Dell and Lenovo on display at Computex 2017 include:
Acer Aspire GX-281 Desktop 
 ASUS G11DF Desktop & ASUS Republic of Gamers Strix GL702ZC desktop replacement – the world's first 8-core gaming notebook

"We look forward to continuing our partnership with AMD to bring more exciting products to the market together." "ASUS Republic of Gamers (ROG) is dedicated to delivering the most innovative hardcore hardware for truly dedicated gamers," said the Chief Operating Officer of ASUS, S.Y. Shian. "We are excited to announce our brand new powerful ROG mobile platform – the Strix GL702ZC. This system, equipped with AMD's latest 8-core Ryzen™ processor and an AMD Radeon™ RX580 GPU, is the first ROG product that we've designed around AMD and it is a gaming powerhouse."Dell is excited to implement AMD Ryzen™ solutions in our new Dell Inspiron Gaming Desktop and Computex d&i award winner, the Inspiron 27 7000 AIO," said Ray Wah, senior vice president and general manager, Dell Consumer and Small Business Product Group. "Dell is committed to providing the best Ready for VR and PC Gaming solutions for all budgets and levels of play; AMD's Ryzen™ processor delivers fast responsiveness and performance at a great price for gaming, VR and other computing needs.""HP is focused on delivering bold innovation in the gaming space, including virtual reality and eSports, with a portfolio that offers extreme performance and the best possible experience for all gamers," said Kevin Frost, vice president and general manager of consumer personal systems, HP Inc. "AMD's recent launch of Ryzen™ processors has generated great excitement in the market and we believe there is a set of customers who will benefit from devices powered by Ryzen™.""Desktop PCs are no longer just for work – consumers use them for watching their favorite movie on Netflix, editing their digital photo collection and even gaming. They expect top performance and a smooth experience," said Tony Chen, executive director of Lenovo's Consumer PC Product and Portfolio Management. "Our Lenovo IdeaCentre desktops with the latest AMD Ryzen processor give users outstanding multitasking capabilities, alongside the high performance they need for next-gen personalized computing experiences, such as VR and high-quality streaming."          Ryzen Threadripper AMD's revitalization of ultra-premium PCs for the high-end desktop (HEDT) market was recently cemented with the announcement of Ryzen™ Threadripper™, targeted at the world's fastest ultra-premium desktop systems, and scheduled for release in summer 2017. At Computex 2017, AMD delivered several Ryzen Threadripper and Radeon "Vega" demonstrations, including Ryzen Threadripper and dual Radeon "Vega" based-GPUs seamlessly running Bethesda's new Prey® title at 4K resolution. In addition, AMD announced cutting-edge high-performance motherboard designs from ASRock, Asus, Gigabyte and MSI, built upon the X399 chipset. The X399 chipset motherboards for the new socketTR4 platform are designed for the highest tier of PC enthusiast society, who demand cutting-edge features such as 16 core/32 thread processors, quad channel memory with support up to 2TB of RAM1, superior IO, and who choose the ultimate processor and motherboards as an extension of their personal brand. "The reception and response from both consumers and enthusiasts for Ryzen has been remarkable, and we're just getting started as we roll out a full line-up of Ryzen processors that deliver exceptional performance for premium and high-performance desktops and notebooks," said 
    Jim Anderson, senior vice president and general manager, AMD Compute and Graphics business group. "Additionally, the ecosystem enthusiasm is evident as we start to see the first wave of Ryzen-based systems from top OEMs join the hundreds of motherboards and system integrator systems already in-market. It's clear that the industry and consumers were hungry for the innovation Ryzen has brought back to the PC market." Ryzen MobileAMD also demonstrated publicly for the first time a Ryzen mobile APU in an ultraportable reference design, bringing 4 cores, 8-threads and "Vega" architecture-based graphics into a sub-15mm thickness notebook design. The demo featured the Ryzen mobile-powered notebook playing HD video content.AMD VR-Ready ProcessorsVirtual reality demands the latest technologies for realistic VR experiences and AMD announced that all Ryzen™ desktop processors are Oculus approved.

(AMD) including the features, functionality, availability, timing, expected OEM and channel partner support, and expected benefits of AMD future products, including AMD's EPYC, Ryzen, Ryzen Threadripper, and Radeon "Vega", and the continued momentum of recently launched AMD products, which are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are commonly identified by words such as "would," "intends," "believes," "expects," "may," "will," "should," "seeks," "intends," "plans," "pro forma," "estimates," "anticipates," or the negative of these words and phrases, other variations of these words and phrases or comparable terminology. Investors are cautioned that the forward-looking statements in this document are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the date of this document and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. Such statements are subject to certain known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond AMD's control, that could cause actual results and other future events to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements. Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: Intel Corporation's dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit AMD's ability to compete effectively; AMD has a wafer supply agreement with GF with obligations to purchase all of its microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a certain portion of its GPU product requirements, from GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) with limited exceptions. If GF is not able to satisfy AMD's manufacturing requirements, its business could be adversely impacted; AMD relies on third parties to manufacture its products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, AMD's business could be materially adversely affected; failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for AMD's products could negatively impact its financial results; the success of AMD's business is dependent upon its ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to its customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions; if AMD cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, it may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of its planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments; the loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on AMD; AMD's receipt of revenue from its semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon its technology being designed into third-party products and the success of those products; global economic uncertainty may adversely impact AMD's business and operating results; the markets in which AMD's products are sold are highly competitive; AMD may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service its debt obligations or meet its working capital requirements; AMD has a large amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial position and prevent it from implementing its strategy or fulfilling its contractual obligations; the agreements governing AMD's notes and the Secured Revolving Line of Credit impose restrictions on AMD that may adversely affect its ability to operate its business; AMD's issuance to West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH) of warrants to purchase 75 million shares of its common stock, if and when exercised, will dilute the ownership interests of its existing stockholders, and the conversion of the 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 may dilute the ownership interest of its existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of its common stock; uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of AMD's products could materially adversely affect it; the demand for AMD's products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. Fluctuations in demand for AMD's products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations; AMD's ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property; AMD depends on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software and other computer platform components to support its business; if AMD loses Microsoft Corporation's support for its products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on AMD's products, its ability to sell its products could be materially adversely affected; and AMD's reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects it to certain risks.  Investors are urged to review in detail the risks and uncertainties in AMD's Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including but not limited to AMD's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 1, 2017.
