This page shows a list of all the recent 13D/G filings made by Liu Steven Qiang .
                Schedule 13D is commonly referred to as a “beneficial ownership report.” The term "beneficial owner" is defined under SEC rules.
                It includes any person who directly or indirectly shares voting power or investment power (the power to sell the security).
When a person or group of persons acquires beneficial ownership of more than 5% of a voting class of a company’s equity securities,
                they are required to file a Schedule 13D within ten days after the purchase.

Research
My research area is machine learning and statistics, with interests spreading over the pipeline of 
data collection (e.g., by crowdsourcing), 
learning, 
inference, 
decision making, 
and various applications





using probabilistic modeling. 

Examples of topics of interest: probabilistic graphical models; variational and Monte Carlo inference; deep learning; distributed learning; big data problems; kernel and nonparametric methods; applications: crowdsourcing, vision, bioinformatics, etc.
I am an action editor of Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR).
