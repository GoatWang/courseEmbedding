Biography[edit]
David MacLean Parry was born on a farm near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He worked briefly as a clerk, a traveling salesman, a reporter on The New York Herald and later became a successful businessman. He was president of Parry Manufacturing Co., and Parry Oil and Pipe Line Co., the Parry Auto Co., and served for a time as president of the American Educational Society, the Citizens' Industrial Association of America[2] and the National Association of Manufacturers. Parry was well known for being extremely hostile to labor unions and workers' rights.[3][4] He authored the anti-socialistic dystopian novel The Scarlet Empire.[5][6][7][8] The book was written as a satirical counterblast to Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward.[9][10] He was a thirty-second degree Mason, a Shriner, and an Odd Fellow.[11]

The program of getting more, however, involves the strike and the violence attendant upon it; the boycott and the intolerable cowardice attendant upon it; the picket, and the marauding and murder about the mill which are attendant upon it. The peaceful strike, which might be called the walkout pure and simple, is purely a misnomer. If the men simply walked out and did no more, their places could be filled, and doubtless would be filled; sometimes, possibly, by a considerable proportion, perhaps seventy per cent., of the union men themselves who had walked out, because of the belief on, the part of that majority that as well as they could do under the circumstances was well enough for the present. The strike can not be made effective without the picket or the boycott. The strike can not help breeding violence; the boycott can not help becoming a conspiracy." — "Manufacturers Organizing against Labor-Unionism," The Literary Digest, April 25, 1903, p. 609.

Ultimately, they would lead to tyranny and, if we take Parry literally, to cataclysmic disaster.

David M. Parry*

MILTON RUBINCAM
Thirty years ago one of the Titans of Indiana industry was David Maclean Parry of Indianapolis. Few men in the Hoosier State had risen to such an exalted position
                    in the business world, or had enjoyed more the confidence of the political and
                    financial leaders of the nation. His course in life was steadily upward. The
                    author of a biographical sketch aptly wrote: The record of Mr. Parry's life shows that from the time he was
                            fifteen years of age his career has been marked by a series of successes
                            —never of a failure. He disclosed from the first,
                            self-reliance—obstacles were overcome as they appeared. His
                            head and his heart and his hands were always in harmonious alliance.
                            Under his masterful mind order and system predominated. … 1
Inasmuch as we are all the products of our ancestors, his success may be ascribed
                    in part to his heredity. Towards the close of the eighteenth century, there
                    lived in Wales a civil engineer of "uncommon ability" named
                    Henry Parry. This man resolved to try his luck in America. He accordingly
                    settled in Pennsylvania where he followed his occupation. During the War of 1812 he is said
                    to have served as an artilleryman. Afterwards he became a wheelwright and
                    carpenter and built the first courthouse in Pennsylvania west of the Alleghany Mountains. According to family records, his
                    wife was Sarah, the youngest daughter of Brigadier-General John Cadwalader, Pennsylvania Militia, of Revolutionary fame. This union allied him to some of
                    the foremost families of the Keystone State, while his brother-in-law was a
                    British Peer, the second Baron Erskine.
Twelve children were born to Henry and Sarah Parry. The youngest, Thomas J.
                    Parry, who was born September 24, 1822, became a farmer. He married Lydia, the
                    daughter of David Maclean, who, from 1822 to 1829, was editor and proprietor of
                    The PittsburghGazette. After the birth of two of their children, Edward R.
                    and David M. (the subject of this sketch), the family of Thomas Parry moved to
                    Indiana 


* This article is condensed from the
                            manuscript, "David M. Parry, of Indianapolis, and his Family," by Milton Eubincam, the original of which has been presented to Mr.
                            Parry's widow, who is still a resident of Indianapolis. As the writer plans to issue a complete biography of Mr.
                            Parry in the distant future, any additional information relative to him
                            will be highly welcome.

1Men of Progress, Indiana, ed. Will Cumback and Jacob
                            B. Maynard (Indianapolis, 1899), 311–312.
 and settled on a farm near Laurel, in Franklin County. He was first a Whig and then a Republican. Of the latter
                    party he was an ardent member. In religious faith he was a Presbyterian. His
                    death occurred on September 21, 1899. The children of Thomas and Lydia Maclean
                    Parry were: Edward R.; David M.; Jennie, who married C. F. Griffith; Thomas H.;
                    and St. Clair. Of these, Edward and David were born in Pennsylvania, the others in Indiana.
David Maclean Parry, second son of Thomas, was born at Ridgeville, near Pittsburgh,
                            Pennsylvania, on
                    March 26, 1852. It was the following year that the family settled in Indiana.
                    Until he was sixteen or seventeen years of age, David lived on his
                    father's farm, attending school in the winter, but also receiving
                    instructions from his mother, who apparently was a woman of fine education and
                    superior intelligence. As he grew older, the boy began to realize that if he
                    were to tie himself to a farm he would get nowhere in life. Therefore, he sought
                    and obtained from his father permission to break loose and strike out for
                    himself. The elder Parry had faith in his son.
In 1869 he secured his first real job as a clerk in Laurel at $10.00 a month. For two years he worked in a drygoods
                    store in Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Afterwards, in rapid succession, he was employed by his
                    brother Edward in Columbia City, Iowa, and as bookkeeper for the New York Paint and Enamel Company of New York City, which he left to take a position with the wholesale drygoods
                    firm of Oberholser and Keeper. While residing in New York in the early eighteen-seventies, he was the room-mate of Robert G.
                    Dun, afterwards the founder of the great mercantile house bearing his name. In
                    1873 Parry located in Connersville, Indiana, where he established a hardware business with his brother
                    Edward on capital furnished by their father.
He was not entirely devoted to business, however, for on October 13, 1875, in
                            Brooklyn, New York, he was married to
                    Cora Harbottle, daughter of Thomas and Cora (McIntosh) Harbottle. The ceremony
                    was performed by Mr Parry's friend, the famous clergyman, Henry Ward
                    Beecher. Of this union were born two daughters: Helen, who married Frank H.
                    Fitzgerald, of Indianapolis; and Cora, who became the wife of Warren D. Oakes, of the same city.
In 1876 Thomas J. Parry experienced financial reverses which left him bankrupt.
                    David and Edward promptly sold their business and gave the
                    proceeds—$13,000—to their father.
                    "Such acts of filial devotion are more eloquent than words, however
                    fitly spoken, and D. M. Parry when he surrendered all his savings to relieve his
                    father of debt, disclosed the nobility of his nature and designated himself as
                    one who in the lottery of life ought to draw a capital prize."2
From 1876 to 1878 David Parry was a traveling salesman for the Pappenheimer and
                    Ludlow Hardware Company, of Cincinnati, Ohio. The next four years he spent as a partner with Marion Jamison in a hardware firm at Rushville, Indiana. In 1882 he sold out his share of the business and planned
                    to sell agricultural implements in South America. But in July of that year he
                    suffered a great domestic affliction in the death of his wife at the early age
                    of twenty-four years —an event which completely altered his plans. He
                    now bought the C. Spring Cart Company at Rushville, and from this humble beginning sprang the great
                    vehicle-manufacturing firm which in the course of a few years was destined to
                    astonish the world with its immensity.
On October 3, 1885, Mr. Parry took as his second wife Hessie Daisy Maxwell,
                    daughter of John Milton and Isabella Maxwell, of Indianapolis. Mrs. Maxwell was the daughter of William and Isabella (Read)
                    Moffett. The new Mrs. Parry was a well-born as her husband. The Maxwells were of
                    an ancient Scottish house, one branch of which, in the person of Bezaleel
                    Maxwell, the First, emigrated to Philadelphia about the beginning of the eighteenth century, afterwards removing
                    to Albemarle County, Virginia. His grandson, Bezaleel III, a veteran of the Revolutionary War,
                    was the founder of the Indiana line. His wife, Margaret, was the granddaughter
                    of the Reverend James Anderson (1678–1740), a famous Presbyterian
                    clergyman, whose wife, Miss Sudt Garland, was descended from the noted Verplanck
                    family of New Amsterdam, now New York. Of the many children of Bezaleel and Margaret Maxwell, the most
                    noted was Dr. David Hervey Maxwell (1786–1854), who won fame not only
                    as a physician and surgeon, but likewise as a member of the Constitutional
                    Convention of Indiana, and a founder of Indiana University at Bloomington. John Milton Maxwell (1825–1912), a son of 


2Ibid., 311.
 Edward Russell Maxwell and grandson of
                    Bezaleel III, was for many years engaged in the iron business in Indianapolis. His wife, Isabella Read Moffett, was descended from the Honorable
                    George Read, of Delaware, a Signer of the Declaration of Independence and of the
                    Constitution of the United States. Thus it will be seen that Mrs. Parry's family was not
                    only inextricably associated with the history of the State of Indiana but had
                    contributed towards starting the infant republic on its historic career. She was
                    born on April 22, 1856, and, at more than eighty-one years of age, still lives
                    in Indianapolis, beloved alike by her family and friends.
David M. and Hessie Daisy (Maxwell) Parry were the parents of seven children:
                    Lydia Maxwell, who married William Carey Teasdale, Jr., of Saint Louis; Maxwell
                    Oswald, an aviator killed in action in the World War; Addison Julius; Isabella
                    Maxwell; Ruth, the wife of Victor Gorton; Jeanette, who married Emmert Daniels;
                    and David M., Jr.
In 1886 Addison Byber and J. P. Pratt became interested in Parry's
                    venture. Upon their request he removed to Indianapolis, where, with his brother Thomas, he established The Parry
                    Manufacturing Company of which he became President. He started with only forty
                    men on the payroll, but in a few years his firm was the largest
                    vehicle-manufacturing company of its kind in the world, covering a territory of
                    twenty-two acres and employing 2800 men.
According to a newspaper article of about 1893, the plant consisted of offices, a
                    store and repository, piano-box buggy department, gear and wheels department,
                    shipping-rooms, spring department, surrey department, wood-working department,
                    spring and road-wagon department, boiler house, iron-working department,
                    trimming department, and road-cart department. The anonymous writer of the
                    article adds: 
This bare enumeration of departments and buildings … at least
                            conveys an idea of what is, in its entirety, the largest plant in the
                            world for the manufacture of pleasure vehicles.
An inspection of the premises on foot is a good day's work in
                            itself, and such is the multiplicity of departments that the mind
                            becomes somewhat confused, and fails to retain more than an impression
                            that it is something huge.
Unlike other establishments there is a plan followed here that consists
                            in duplicate departments, so that you are going into one paint shop, or
                            trim shop, which you regard large enough in all truth, only to stumble
                            across a duplicate of it in another building. This looks like  bad arrangement at first thought,
                            but it is the outcome of wise planning. If fire should consume a third
                            or more of the plant, the following day work could be shipped with the
                            customary regularity, and there would be enough of a completely appointed shop remaining, to continue to turn out
                            in all departments without interruption.
I never saw so many wheels and gears under one roof as is contained in
                            the gear and wheel department. Actually the wheels are stored so thick
                            and in such quantity, that it would seem as if they were moving about in
                            a continual stream, propelled by boys. To stand at a given point and
                            observe the movement is to get dizzy. In the gear room
                            the axle arms of thousands sticking up in close array gives one the idea
                            of regiments of soldiers standing at "shoulder arms"
                            with the barrels of the guns alone visible. It's a great sight!
I saw what was perhaps the largest trim-shop on earth, but it was not so
                            impressive as the other departments. In one building where stuff is
                            gotten out for bodies and gears you would suppose you were in a
                            wood-working factory, so numerous are the machines.
Now, as to work. Of course, when work is built for the million at popular
                            prices, it is hardly expected that the latest refinements in
                            construction will be glaringly conspicuous, but there can be no question
                            that the facilities at hand enable the company to put exceptional
                            wearing value into the work for the price asked. And that is probably
                            the secret of the phenomenal success of the company.
The system of work seems to be about perfection. In all the vast place
                            affairs progress without friction or confusion. Nothing short of
                            executive genius could organize such a plant into its present
                            perfection, and it is to President D. M. Parry that the palm of success
                            must be awarded for producing this highly organized plant.3

In 1890 the Parry Company commenced the manufacture of four-wheeled vehicles on a
                    larger scale than ever before. They Company now produced surries, phaetons,
                    piano-box buggies, spring wagons, etc. The foreign trade was
                    stupendous—Parry buggies and carts being shipped to many other
                    countries, as well as to every state in the Union.
Meanwhile, Mr. Parry was engaged in other activities. He founded and was the
                    President of the Overland Automobile Company, which he later sold to John Willys
                    for $250,000. Becoming interested in the ideas of Henry Ford, he is
                    said to have given that indefatigable manufacturer of
                    "flivvers" his first financial assistance. He also owned an
                    interest in the Claypool Hotel in Indianapolis.
In the political field, D. M. Parry was a very active and enthusiastic adherent
                    of the Republican party. It is believed that he was more fully responsible for
                    the nomination of his friend, General Benjamin Harrison for the presidency of
                    the

                            newspaper of 1893, but unfortunately the date and name of the newspaper

United States than anyone else. Also he was the one who put forward
                    Vice-President Charles W. Fairbanks, Senator Albert J. Beveridge, and others. He
                    had the opportunity to become Mayor of Indianapolis, Member of Congress from Indiana, to serve as ambassador to several
                    foreign governments, and nominee for Vice-President of the United States—but declined all these proferred honors.
In the struggle between capitalism and labor, Mr. Parry was quite naturally an
                    ardent champion of the former. It is not to be inferred that he was radically
                    antagonistic to the laboring classes. On the contrary, the ordinary workmen
                    found him quite sympathetic and sincerely desirous to better labor conditions.
                    But he was warmly opposed to organized labor unions, which he denounced in a
                    speech delivered on August 13, 1903, as decidedly lowering "the tone of
                    American citizenship," consigning `the Declaration of Independence to
                    the scrap pile," making "the people foot their enormous bills
                    for enhanced prices," crushing "liberty and aiming at
                    sovereignty." After 1902 he held the office of President of The
                    National Association of Manufacturers of the United States of America, and as such, was a vital factor in capitalistic
                    circles. Many industrial leaders combatted labor organizations for their own
                    gain, but such an accusation could not be truthfully hurled at Mr. Parry. As
                    stated by one who knew him: "His high personal character and well-known
                    principles as well as his labors in behalf of the improvements and conditions
                    among the working classes, absolved him from any charge of undue self interest
                    in the position he took, which was for justice to all concerned."
Neverthless, labor chieftains were so agitated by his outspoken comments at the
                    time that he believed a conspiracy had been formed to kidnap his children and
                    wreak vengance upon him through them. The situation was such that whenever he
                    ventured about the streets of the city he carried an automatic revolver in each
                    coat pocket, and was accompanied by a heavily-armed bodyguard. He was a
                    sharpshooter and feared no man, while his brother Thomas was the crack pistol
                    shot of the National Guard of Indiana. His beautiful mansion in Golden Hill was
                    guarded night and day. Finally, as the danger seemed to increase, he felt
                    compelled to send his family to the city of Stuttgart, Germany, for safety.



4New YorkTribune, Aug. 14, 1903.

Similar precautions were taken at the Parry plant. A correspondent of the New YorkTimes wrote: 
Barring Parry's general office is a wrought iron fence, the
                            entrance through which is a heavy gate which fastens with a spring lock.
                            Back of the gate is a big, burly "bouncer." A flight
                            of steps leads to Parry's office, and at the head of the steps
                            sits a negro with a Winchester rifle across his knees. One cannot interview Parry without
                            first stating his business to two persons, and being questioned, scanned
                            and quizzed.
And when one is face to face with D. M. Parry! He is short and of slight
                            build. His skin resembles parchment. His face is sphinxlike. He is
                            always faultlessly dressed. He never utters an unnecessary word, except
                            when he launches forth in a tirade against labor unions.5

In October, 1903, Mr. Parry was elected President of the Industrial Association
                    of America, consisting of a federation of employers' associations and
                    citizens' alliances throughout the United States—intended to resist the demands of organized labor.
                    "Meet organization with organization!" was the motto. In 1904
                    he founded the American Manufacturers' Mutual Life Insurance Company,
                    with headquarters in Indianapolis, of which he was elected president.
As a lineal descendant of distinguished colonial and Revolutionary families,
                    David M. Parry was naturally interested in the work done by patriotic
                    organizations to preserve the memory of the achievements of our heroic forebears
                    of a century and a half ago. He was a member of the Indiana Society of the Sons
                    of the Revolution, of which he was elected Vice-President in 1902, and, in
                    1909–1910, President.
Always an enthusiastic student of sociology, and devoting much thought to the
                    subject, he produced a book in 1905 entitled: The Scarlet
                    Empire—an attack on Socialism in the form of a novel. The theme
                    concerns a young Socialist who plunges into the sea, descends to a lost Atlantis
                        (The Scarlet Empire), a social democracy where people
                    dwell in slavery, the government grudgingly owing every man a living. In time
                    the hero becomes so digusted with Socialistic conditions that he finally makes
                    his escape to the upper world. Critics writing for The Literary
                        Digest and The Outlook, while admitting that the
                    story was entertaining and the plot skilfully constructed, agreed that the book
                    as a whole had little literary merit.
As the foregoing account has indicated, Mr. Parry was 


5 William J. Burns told the story of the reign of
                            terror about the Parry family in his book, The Masked
                            War (New York, 1913).
 very progressive in his ideas. With the
                    introduction of the automobile as a major factor in transportation he did not
                    abandon the construction of carriages and buggies, but expanded his business to
                    include motor-vehicles. He was the founder and President of The Parry Auto
                    Company, of which his sons-in-law, W. C. Teasdale6 and
                    Warran D. Oakes, were Vice-Presidents, and his son, Maxwell O. Parry, was
                    Secretary-Treasurer. The Parry Manufacturing Company had meanwhile passed to the
                    control of his brother, St. Clair Parry, who became President of that concern.
                    In 1909 Mr. Parry became President of the Automobile Insurance Company of
                    America and Vice-President of the Indianapolis Southern Railroad. Many other executive honors were showered upon
                    him at various times. In 1911, after twenty-five years of incessant activity as
                    a manufacturer of vehicles, he retired from active business with the best wishes
                    of his associates.
But his interest in many current problems did not cease with his withdrawal from
                    the firm. Early in 1913, Mr. Parry and John Kirby, Jr., both of whom were former
                    Presidents of The National Manufacturers' Association, planned to sail
                    for Australia to study economic conditions. Their program was rudely shattered,
                    however, that very summer, when accusations were hurled at the Association by
                    the American Federation of Labor that back in 1907 they had attempted to bribe
                    Samuel Gompers, President of the American Federation of Labor.
Their trip was delayed by a Congressional investigation but Messrs. Parry and
                    Kirby resumed their plans the following year, and, accompanied by Dr. Albert A.
                    Snowden, of the Educational Staff of the National Association of Manufacturers,
                    made an exhaustive study of the situation in New Zealand, Tasmania, and Australia, and included in their itinerary parts of China, Japan,
                    and Korea.
On the return journey Mr. Parry was suddenly stricken ill aboard the steamer Korea when only two days out of 


6 Mr. Teasdale had an interesting career. Besides
                            being Vice-President of The Parry Auto Company, Vice-President of The
                            Shoe Mart Company, of St. Louis, and President of The Pathfinder Company, he was a
                            globe-trotter having traveled more than a million and a half miles about
                            in the world. His home was a veritable museum of objects picked up in
                                    India, China, Japan, Korea, Egypt, etc. In ancestry he was not inferior to
                            his wife, for he was a descendant of a long line of eminent Baptist
                            clergymen, and counted among his other forefathers the Honorable John
                            Ogden (1609–1682), Deputy-Governor of East Jersey, and the
                            noted Tuttle family of New Enland and East Jersey, from which descended
                            the illustrious divine, Jonathan Edwards, Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt, Sr.,
                            and others of distinction.
 Honolulu. He arrived in San Francisco on August 21, 1914, in a very serious condition. He was met by his
                    sons, Addison J., then a lumber executive in Oregon, and David M. Parry Jr., and rushed to a hospital where the doctors
                    offered little hope for his recovery. Mrs. Parry was at that moment rushing to
                    his side from Indianapolis.
Mr. Parry recovered sufficiently to be taken to his home in Indianapolis, but he was never the same man again. His health perceptibly
                    declined; at times he suffered losses of memory. Uremic poisoning set in, due,
                    it is believed, to the poor food received on his Asiatic tour. During the last
                    weeks of his life, he was confined most of the time to his bed.
His death, which occurred during the early morning hours of Wednesday, May 12,
                    1915, was not unexpected, but it occasioned considerable shock among his many
                    friends. His wife and all his children,7 except Ruth, who
                    was then in New York City, were at his bdeside when he passed away.
Telegrams from Mr. Parry's business associates and from many others in
                    all parts of the world poured into his home, all testifying to the high esteem
                    in which he was universally held. The local Chamber of Commerce passed a
                    resolution honoring their distinguished fellow-citizen, who had played so
                    conspicuous a part in building up the state in general and the city in
                    particular.
The funeral services were held at three o'clock in the afternoon of
                    Friday, May 14, 1915, at his beautiful residence in Golden Hill. The sermon was
                    preached by the Rev. Allan B. Philputt, pastor of the Central Christian Church.
                    The actual interment was private, and took place in Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis.
Many tributes were paid to Mr. Parry's genius by the press. The IndianapolisNews said, in part: "He was of the 


7 His eldest son, Maxwell O. Parry, was a realtor
                            by occupation, but he showed much promise as a playwright. During the
                            World War he served as a Second Lieutenant in the 147th Aero Squadron,
                            and as such gallantly met his death, July 8, 1918. His companions turned
                            back, but he remained to fight the enemy single-handed, and was downed.
                            He was posthumously awarded the Croix de Guerre by France and the Distinguished Service Cross by the United States. His sister, Mrs. Teasdale, had charge of the food work in Indianapolis during the war, and was active in securing the suffrage for
                            women in that city. Subsequently, she held positions in the city
                            government at Ocean City, N. J., and the federal government at Washington, where her husband died Dec. 25, 1935. They had two
                            children: Priscilla (b. Dec. 14, 1909), who studied obseterics at
                            Indiana University, and is now the wife of the author of this article
                            (b. March 26, 1909, representative of an old and learned family of
                            Hessian clergymen, and descended through other lines from Willem
                            Rittinghuysen (1644–1708), the first American Mennonite
                            Bishop and paper-manufacturer, and the Hon. John Wills
                            (1660–1746). Vice-President of the West Jersey Council of
                            Proprietors and a member of His Majesty's Provincial Council,
                            etc.); and John Moffett Teasdale (b. Jan. 12, 1912), a graduate of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, now connected with the Metallizing
                            Engineering Company of New York, with his headquarters at present located at Baltimore.
 cheerful and optimistic turn and a
                    delightful companion among his friends. He could also be an open, frank and
                    vigorous foe. In conduct he was always fearless. … His death today
                    will be noted and he will be missed by his many friends and the several business
                    interests to which he had become attached."8
The IndianapolisStar published the following editorial: 
The People who knew David M. Parry gained such an impression of his
                            energy and activity that the announcement of his death will bring much
                            surprise to those who have not been aware of his illness, and the event
                            will be difficult to realize.
He was a man of force and varied ability, who made a distinct impression
                            on the community in the years when he was in active business. His
                            executive skill, his power to handle large undertakings, his grasp of
                            commercial affairs, set a pace in local business and manufacturing
                            circles that undoubtedly served as an inspiration to his associates in
                            other lines of activity.
His prominence in the National Manufacturers' Association, of
                            which he was president for several years, and in other national, civic
                            and commercial organizations made him known throughout the country. He
                            made his way to distinction and wealth by his own efforts, having begun
                            as a poor boy, and was one of the notable self-made men of Indiana and
                            an influence in the development of city and state.9

David M. Parry*

MILTON RUBINCAM
Thirty years ago one of the Titans of Indiana industry was David Maclean Parry of Indianapolis. Few men in the Hoosier State had risen to such an exalted position
                    in the business world, or had enjoyed more the confidence of the political and
                    financial leaders of the nation. His course in life was steadily upward. The
                    author of a biographical sketch aptly wrote: The record of Mr. Parry's life shows that from the time he was
                            fifteen years of age his career has been marked by a series of successes
                            —never of a failure. He disclosed from the first,
                            self-reliance—obstacles were overcome as they appeared. His
                            head and his heart and his hands were always in harmonious alliance.
                            Under his masterful mind order and system predominated. … 1
Inasmuch as we are all the products of our ancestors, his success may be ascribed
                    in part to his heredity. Towards the close of the eighteenth century, there
                    lived in Wales a civil engineer of "uncommon ability" named
                    Henry Parry. This man resolved to try his luck in America. He accordingly
                    settled in Pennsylvania where he followed his occupation. During the War of 1812 he is said
                    to have served as an artilleryman. Afterwards he became a wheelwright and
                    carpenter and built the first courthouse in Pennsylvania west of the Alleghany Mountains. According to family records, his
                    wife was Sarah, the youngest daughter of Brigadier-General John Cadwalader, Pennsylvania Militia, of Revolutionary fame. This union allied him to some of
                    the foremost families of the Keystone State, while his brother-in-law was a
                    British Peer, the second Baron Erskine.
Twelve children were born to Henry and Sarah Parry. The youngest, Thomas J.
                    Parry, who was born September 24, 1822, became a farmer. He married Lydia, the
                    daughter of David Maclean, who, from 1822 to 1829, was editor and proprietor of
                    The PittsburghGazette. After the birth of two of their children, Edward R.
                    and David M. (the subject of this sketch), the family of Thomas Parry moved to
                    Indiana

                            manuscript, "David M. Parry, of Indianapolis, and his Family," by Milton Eubincam, the original of which has been presented to Mr.
                            Parry's widow, who is still a resident of Indianapolis. As the writer plans to issue a complete biography of Mr.
                            Parry in the distant future, any additional information relative to him
                            will be highly welcome.

 and settled on a farm near Laurel, in Franklin County. He was first a Whig and then a Republican. Of the latter
                    party he was an ardent member. In religious faith he was a Presbyterian. His
                    death occurred on September 21, 1899. The children of Thomas and Lydia Maclean
                    Parry were: Edward R.; David M.; Jennie, who married C. F. Griffith; Thomas H.;
                    and St. Clair. Of these, Edward and David were born in Pennsylvania, the others in Indiana.
David Maclean Parry, second son of Thomas, was born at Ridgeville, near Pittsburgh,
                            Pennsylvania, on
                    March 26, 1852. It was the following year that the family settled in Indiana.
                    Until he was sixteen or seventeen years of age, David lived on his
                    father's farm, attending school in the winter, but also receiving
                    instructions from his mother, who apparently was a woman of fine education and
                    superior intelligence. As he grew older, the boy began to realize that if he
                    were to tie himself to a farm he would get nowhere in life. Therefore, he sought
                    and obtained from his father permission to break loose and strike out for
                    himself. The elder Parry had faith in his son.
In 1869 he secured his first real job as a clerk in Laurel at $10.00 a month. For two years he worked in a drygoods
                    store in Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Afterwards, in rapid succession, he was employed by his
                    brother Edward in Columbia City, Iowa, and as bookkeeper for the New York Paint and Enamel Company of New York City, which he left to take a position with the wholesale drygoods
                    firm of Oberholser and Keeper. While residing in New York in the early eighteen-seventies, he was the room-mate of Robert G.
                    Dun, afterwards the founder of the great mercantile house bearing his name. In
                    1873 Parry located in Connersville, Indiana, where he established a hardware business with his brother
                    Edward on capital furnished by their father.
He was not entirely devoted to business, however, for on October 13, 1875, in
                            Brooklyn, New York, he was married to
                    Cora Harbottle, daughter of Thomas and Cora (McIntosh) Harbottle. The ceremony
                    was performed by Mr Parry's friend, the famous clergyman, Henry Ward
                    Beecher. Of this union were born two daughters: Helen, who married Frank H.
                    Fitzgerald, of Indianapolis; and Cora, who became the wife of Warren D. Oakes, of the same city.
In 1876 Thomas J. Parry experienced financial reverses which left him bankrupt.
                    David and Edward promptly sold their business and gave the
                    proceeds—$13,000—to their father.
                    "Such acts of filial devotion are more eloquent than words, however
                    fitly spoken, and D. M. Parry when he surrendered all his savings to relieve his
                    father of debt, disclosed the nobility of his nature and designated himself as
                    one who in the lottery of life ought to draw a capital prize."2
From 1876 to 1878 David Parry was a traveling salesman for the Pappenheimer and
                    Ludlow Hardware Company, of Cincinnati, Ohio. The next four years he spent as a partner with Marion Jamison in a hardware firm at Rushville, Indiana. In 1882 he sold out his share of the business and planned
                    to sell agricultural implements in South America. But in July of that year he
                    suffered a great domestic affliction in the death of his wife at the early age
                    of twenty-four years —an event which completely altered his plans. He
                    now bought the C. Spring Cart Company at Rushville, and from this humble beginning sprang the great
                    vehicle-manufacturing firm which in the course of a few years was destined to
                    astonish the world with its immensity.
On October 3, 1885, Mr. Parry took as his second wife Hessie Daisy Maxwell,
                    daughter of John Milton and Isabella Maxwell, of Indianapolis. Mrs. Maxwell was the daughter of William and Isabella (Read)
                    Moffett. The new Mrs. Parry was a well-born as her husband. The Maxwells were of
                    an ancient Scottish house, one branch of which, in the person of Bezaleel
                    Maxwell, the First, emigrated to Philadelphia about the beginning of the eighteenth century, afterwards removing
                    to Albemarle County, Virginia. His grandson, Bezaleel III, a veteran of the Revolutionary War,
                    was the founder of the Indiana line. His wife, Margaret, was the granddaughter
                    of the Reverend James Anderson (1678–1740), a famous Presbyterian
                    clergyman, whose wife, Miss Sudt Garland, was descended from the noted Verplanck
                    family of New Amsterdam, now New York. Of the many children of Bezaleel and Margaret Maxwell, the most
                    noted was Dr. David Hervey Maxwell (1786–1854), who won fame not only
                    as a physician and surgeon, but likewise as a member of the Constitutional
                    Convention of Indiana, and a founder of Indiana University at Bloomington. John Milton Maxwell (1825–1912), a son of

 Edward Russell Maxwell and grandson of
                    Bezaleel III, was for many years engaged in the iron business in Indianapolis. His wife, Isabella Read Moffett, was descended from the Honorable
                    George Read, of Delaware, a Signer of the Declaration of Independence and of the
                    Constitution of the United States. Thus it will be seen that Mrs. Parry's family was not
                    only inextricably associated with the history of the State of Indiana but had
                    contributed towards starting the infant republic on its historic career. She was
                    born on April 22, 1856, and, at more than eighty-one years of age, still lives
                    in Indianapolis, beloved alike by her family and friends.
David M. and Hessie Daisy (Maxwell) Parry were the parents of seven children:
                    Lydia Maxwell, who married William Carey Teasdale, Jr., of Saint Louis; Maxwell
                    Oswald, an aviator killed in action in the World War; Addison Julius; Isabella
                    Maxwell; Ruth, the wife of Victor Gorton; Jeanette, who married Emmert Daniels;
                    and David M., Jr.
In 1886 Addison Byber and J. P. Pratt became interested in Parry's
                    venture. Upon their request he removed to Indianapolis, where, with his brother Thomas, he established The Parry
                    Manufacturing Company of which he became President. He started with only forty
                    men on the payroll, but in a few years his firm was the largest
                    vehicle-manufacturing company of its kind in the world, covering a territory of
                    twenty-two acres and employing 2800 men.
According to a newspaper article of about 1893, the plant consisted of offices, a
                    store and repository, piano-box buggy department, gear and wheels department,
                    shipping-rooms, spring department, surrey department, wood-working department,
                    spring and road-wagon department, boiler house, iron-working department,
                    trimming department, and road-cart department. The anonymous writer of the
                    article adds: 
This bare enumeration of departments and buildings … at least
                            conveys an idea of what is, in its entirety, the largest plant in the
                            world for the manufacture of pleasure vehicles.
An inspection of the premises on foot is a good day's work in
                            itself, and such is the multiplicity of departments that the mind
                            becomes somewhat confused, and fails to retain more than an impression
                            that it is something huge.
Unlike other establishments there is a plan followed here that consists
                            in duplicate departments, so that you are going into one paint shop, or
                            trim shop, which you regard large enough in all truth, only to stumble
                            across a duplicate of it in another building. This looks like  bad arrangement at first thought,
                            but it is the outcome of wise planning. If fire should consume a third
                            or more of the plant, the following day work could be shipped with the
                            customary regularity, and there would be enough of a completely appointed shop remaining, to continue to turn out
                            in all departments without interruption.
I never saw so many wheels and gears under one roof as is contained in
                            the gear and wheel department. Actually the wheels are stored so thick
                            and in such quantity, that it would seem as if they were moving about in
                            a continual stream, propelled by boys. To stand at a given point and
                            observe the movement is to get dizzy. In the gear room
                            the axle arms of thousands sticking up in close array gives one the idea
                            of regiments of soldiers standing at "shoulder arms"
                            with the barrels of the guns alone visible. It's a great sight!
I saw what was perhaps the largest trim-shop on earth, but it was not so
                            impressive as the other departments. In one building where stuff is
                            gotten out for bodies and gears you would suppose you were in a
                            wood-working factory, so numerous are the machines.
Now, as to work. Of course, when work is built for the million at popular
                            prices, it is hardly expected that the latest refinements in
                            construction will be glaringly conspicuous, but there can be no question
                            that the facilities at hand enable the company to put exceptional
                            wearing value into the work for the price asked. And that is probably
                            the secret of the phenomenal success of the company.
The system of work seems to be about perfection. In all the vast place
                            affairs progress without friction or confusion. Nothing short of
                            executive genius could organize such a plant into its present
                            perfection, and it is to President D. M. Parry that the palm of success
                            must be awarded for producing this highly organized plant.3

In 1890 the Parry Company commenced the manufacture of four-wheeled vehicles on a
                    larger scale than ever before. They Company now produced surries, phaetons,
                    piano-box buggies, spring wagons, etc. The foreign trade was
                    stupendous—Parry buggies and carts being shipped to many other
                    countries, as well as to every state in the Union.
Meanwhile, Mr. Parry was engaged in other activities. He founded and was the
                    President of the Overland Automobile Company, which he later sold to John Willys
                    for $250,000. Becoming interested in the ideas of Henry Ford, he is
                    said to have given that indefatigable manufacturer of
                    "flivvers" his first financial assistance. He also owned an
                    interest in the Claypool Hotel in Indianapolis.
In the political field, D. M. Parry was a very active and enthusiastic adherent
                    of the Republican party. It is believed that he was more fully responsible for
                    the nomination of his friend, General Benjamin Harrison for the presidency of
                    the

                            newspaper of 1893, but unfortunately the date and name of the newspaper

United States than anyone else. Also he was the one who put forward
                    Vice-President Charles W. Fairbanks, Senator Albert J. Beveridge, and others. He
                    had the opportunity to become Mayor of Indianapolis, Member of Congress from Indiana, to serve as ambassador to several
                    foreign governments, and nominee for Vice-President of the United States—but declined all these proferred honors.
In the struggle between capitalism and labor, Mr. Parry was quite naturally an
                    ardent champion of the former. It is not to be inferred that he was radically
                    antagonistic to the laboring classes. On the contrary, the ordinary workmen
                    found him quite sympathetic and sincerely desirous to better labor conditions.
                    But he was warmly opposed to organized labor unions, which he denounced in a
                    speech delivered on August 13, 1903, as decidedly lowering "the tone of
                    American citizenship," consigning `the Declaration of Independence to
                    the scrap pile," making "the people foot their enormous bills
                    for enhanced prices," crushing "liberty and aiming at
                    sovereignty." After 1902 he held the office of President of The
                    National Association of Manufacturers of the United States of America, and as such, was a vital factor in capitalistic
                    circles. Many industrial leaders combatted labor organizations for their own
                    gain, but such an accusation could not be truthfully hurled at Mr. Parry. As
                    stated by one who knew him: "His high personal character and well-known
                    principles as well as his labors in behalf of the improvements and conditions
                    among the working classes, absolved him from any charge of undue self interest
                    in the position he took, which was for justice to all concerned."
Neverthless, labor chieftains were so agitated by his outspoken comments at the
                    time that he believed a conspiracy had been formed to kidnap his children and
                    wreak vengance upon him through them. The situation was such that whenever he
                    ventured about the streets of the city he carried an automatic revolver in each
                    coat pocket, and was accompanied by a heavily-armed bodyguard. He was a
                    sharpshooter and feared no man, while his brother Thomas was the crack pistol
                    shot of the National Guard of Indiana. His beautiful mansion in Golden Hill was
                    guarded night and day. Finally, as the danger seemed to increase, he felt
                    compelled to send his family to the city of Stuttgart, Germany, for safety.



4New YorkTribune, Aug. 14, 1903.

Similar precautions were taken at the Parry plant. A correspondent of the New YorkTimes wrote: 
Barring Parry's general office is a wrought iron fence, the
                            entrance through which is a heavy gate which fastens with a spring lock.
                            Back of the gate is a big, burly "bouncer." A flight
                            of steps leads to Parry's office, and at the head of the steps
                            sits a negro with a Winchester rifle across his knees. One cannot interview Parry without
                            first stating his business to two persons, and being questioned, scanned
                            and quizzed.
And when one is face to face with D. M. Parry! He is short and of slight
                            build. His skin resembles parchment. His face is sphinxlike. He is
                            always faultlessly dressed. He never utters an unnecessary word, except
                            when he launches forth in a tirade against labor unions.5

In October, 1903, Mr. Parry was elected President of the Industrial Association
                    of America, consisting of a federation of employers' associations and
                    citizens' alliances throughout the United States—intended to resist the demands of organized labor.
                    "Meet organization with organization!" was the motto. In 1904
                    he founded the American Manufacturers' Mutual Life Insurance Company,
                    with headquarters in Indianapolis, of which he was elected president.
As a lineal descendant of distinguished colonial and Revolutionary families,
                    David M. Parry was naturally interested in the work done by patriotic
                    organizations to preserve the memory of the achievements of our heroic forebears
                    of a century and a half ago. He was a member of the Indiana Society of the Sons
                    of the Revolution, of which he was elected Vice-President in 1902, and, in
                    1909–1910, President.
Always an enthusiastic student of sociology, and devoting much thought to the
                    subject, he produced a book in 1905 entitled: The Scarlet
                    Empire—an attack on Socialism in the form of a novel. The theme
                    concerns a young Socialist who plunges into the sea, descends to a lost Atlantis
                        (The Scarlet Empire), a social democracy where people
                    dwell in slavery, the government grudgingly owing every man a living. In time
                    the hero becomes so digusted with Socialistic conditions that he finally makes
                    his escape to the upper world. Critics writing for The Literary
                        Digest and The Outlook, while admitting that the
                    story was entertaining and the plot skilfully constructed, agreed that the book
                    as a whole had little literary merit.
As the foregoing account has indicated, Mr. Parry was 


5 William J. Burns told the story of the reign of
                            terror about the Parry family in his book, The Masked
                            War (New York, 1913).
 very progressive in his ideas. With the
                    introduction of the automobile as a major factor in transportation he did not
                    abandon the construction of carriages and buggies, but expanded his business to
                    include motor-vehicles. He was the founder and President of The Parry Auto
                    Company, of which his sons-in-law, W. C. Teasdale6 and
                    Warran D. Oakes, were Vice-Presidents, and his son, Maxwell O. Parry, was
                    Secretary-Treasurer. The Parry Manufacturing Company had meanwhile passed to the
                    control of his brother, St. Clair Parry, who became President of that concern.
                    In 1909 Mr. Parry became President of the Automobile Insurance Company of
                    America and Vice-President of the Indianapolis Southern Railroad. Many other executive honors were showered upon
                    him at various times. In 1911, after twenty-five years of incessant activity as
                    a manufacturer of vehicles, he retired from active business with the best wishes
                    of his associates.
But his interest in many current problems did not cease with his withdrawal from
                    the firm. Early in 1913, Mr. Parry and John Kirby, Jr., both of whom were former
                    Presidents of The National Manufacturers' Association, planned to sail
                    for Australia to study economic conditions. Their program was rudely shattered,
                    however, that very summer, when accusations were hurled at the Association by
                    the American Federation of Labor that back in 1907 they had attempted to bribe
                    Samuel Gompers, President of the American Federation of Labor.
Their trip was delayed by a Congressional investigation but Messrs. Parry and
                    Kirby resumed their plans the following year, and, accompanied by Dr. Albert A.
                    Snowden, of the Educational Staff of the National Association of Manufacturers,
                    made an exhaustive study of the situation in New Zealand, Tasmania, and Australia, and included in their itinerary parts of China, Japan,
                    and Korea.
On the return journey Mr. Parry was suddenly stricken ill aboard the steamer Korea when only two days out of 


6 Mr. Teasdale had an interesting career. Besides
                            being Vice-President of The Parry Auto Company, Vice-President of The
                            Shoe Mart Company, of St. Louis, and President of The Pathfinder Company, he was a
                            globe-trotter having traveled more than a million and a half miles about
                            in the world. His home was a veritable museum of objects picked up in
                                    India, China, Japan, Korea, Egypt, etc. In ancestry he was not inferior to
                            his wife, for he was a descendant of a long line of eminent Baptist
                            clergymen, and counted among his other forefathers the Honorable John
                            Ogden (1609–1682), Deputy-Governor of East Jersey, and the
                            noted Tuttle family of New Enland and East Jersey, from which descended
                            the illustrious divine, Jonathan Edwards, Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt, Sr.,
                            and others of distinction.
 Honolulu. He arrived in San Francisco on August 21, 1914, in a very serious condition. He was met by his
                    sons, Addison J., then a lumber executive in Oregon, and David M. Parry Jr., and rushed to a hospital where the doctors
                    offered little hope for his recovery. Mrs. Parry was at that moment rushing to
                    his side from Indianapolis.
Mr. Parry recovered sufficiently to be taken to his home in Indianapolis, but he was never the same man again. His health perceptibly
                    declined; at times he suffered losses of memory. Uremic poisoning set in, due,
                    it is believed, to the poor food received on his Asiatic tour. During the last
                    weeks of his life, he was confined most of the time to his bed.
His death, which occurred during the early morning hours of Wednesday, May 12,
                    1915, was not unexpected, but it occasioned considerable shock among his many
                    friends. His wife and all his children,7 except Ruth, who
                    was then in New York City, were at his bdeside when he passed away.
Telegrams from Mr. Parry's business associates and from many others in
                    all parts of the world poured into his home, all testifying to the high esteem
                    in which he was universally held. The local Chamber of Commerce passed a
                    resolution honoring their distinguished fellow-citizen, who had played so
                    conspicuous a part in building up the state in general and the city in
                    particular.
The funeral services were held at three o'clock in the afternoon of
                    Friday, May 14, 1915, at his beautiful residence in Golden Hill. The sermon was
                    preached by the Rev. Allan B. Philputt, pastor of the Central Christian Church.
                    The actual interment was private, and took place in Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis.
Many tributes were paid to Mr. Parry's genius by the press. The IndianapolisNews said, in part: "He was of the 


7 His eldest son, Maxwell O. Parry, was a realtor
                            by occupation, but he showed much promise as a playwright. During the
                            World War he served as a Second Lieutenant in the 147th Aero Squadron,
                            and as such gallantly met his death, July 8, 1918. His companions turned
                            back, but he remained to fight the enemy single-handed, and was downed.
                            He was posthumously awarded the Croix de Guerre by France and the Distinguished Service Cross by the United States. His sister, Mrs. Teasdale, had charge of the food work in Indianapolis during the war, and was active in securing the suffrage for
                            women in that city. Subsequently, she held positions in the city
                            government at Ocean City, N. J., and the federal government at Washington, where her husband died Dec. 25, 1935. They had two
                            children: Priscilla (b. Dec. 14, 1909), who studied obseterics at
                            Indiana University, and is now the wife of the author of this article
                            (b. March 26, 1909, representative of an old and learned family of
                            Hessian clergymen, and descended through other lines from Willem
                            Rittinghuysen (1644–1708), the first American Mennonite
                            Bishop and paper-manufacturer, and the Hon. John Wills
                            (1660–1746). Vice-President of the West Jersey Council of
                            Proprietors and a member of His Majesty's Provincial Council,
                            etc.); and John Moffett Teasdale (b. Jan. 12, 1912), a graduate of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, now connected with the Metallizing
                            Engineering Company of New York, with his headquarters at present located at Baltimore.
 cheerful and optimistic turn and a
                    delightful companion among his friends. He could also be an open, frank and
                    vigorous foe. In conduct he was always fearless. … His death today
                    will be noted and he will be missed by his many friends and the several business
                    interests to which he had become attached."8
The IndianapolisStar published the following editorial: 
The People who knew David M. Parry gained such an impression of his
                            energy and activity that the announcement of his death will bring much
                            surprise to those who have not been aware of his illness, and the event
                            will be difficult to realize.
He was a man of force and varied ability, who made a distinct impression
                            on the community in the years when he was in active business. His
                            executive skill, his power to handle large undertakings, his grasp of
                            commercial affairs, set a pace in local business and manufacturing
                            circles that undoubtedly served as an inspiration to his associates in
                            other lines of activity.
His prominence in the National Manufacturers' Association, of
                            which he was president for several years, and in other national, civic
                            and commercial organizations made him known throughout the country. He
                            made his way to distinction and wealth by his own efforts, having begun
                            as a poor boy, and was one of the notable self-made men of Indiana and
                            an influence in the development of city and state.9

During this time we had many opportunities to work closely together. It was very clear to me that Dave had a dedicated aim and focus, to perform to the best of his ability, to put in additional time and effort to achieve this and to delight his "customer" in every way he could. This was accomplished from an excellent set of skills acquired over the years that gives him a broad and deep knowledge of procedures, systems and best practice. These are suitably and very efffectively supported by his technical strengths, project management capabilities, a firm but fair approach and a caring nature.See moreSee lessI worked with Dave Parry over several years while I was acting as a technical consultant for one of his clients.  The process which we were developing was challenging and there were many problems to be overcome.   I was most impressed by the way in which, when things went wrong, Dave was never defensive.  He acknowledged the problem, took ownership of it and then worked constructively with all parties to solve it.  He has a wealth of experience at all levels of plant operation and has the flexibility of mind to be able to bring that to bear on problems to come up with innovative and effective solutions.  He is a good man to work with and would be an asset to any pilot or production operation.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended DavidGroupsThe Project Manager Network - #1 Group for Project ManagersProcess Safety ManagementAdvanced Operational ExcellenceChimica Oggi - Chemistry Today | Fine chemicals, Applied Chemistry, BiotechnologyThe official IOSH groupHAZOPRoyal Society of ChemistrySee 7 moreProject Manager Community - Best Group for Project ManagementSpeciality Chemicals Magazine: ForumPharm TechContract Pharma  -The International Media for Outsourcing and Contract ServicesOrganic Process Research & Development Networking GroupCrystallization CommunityProject Management Practices — Best Project Manager Group for PMP CAPM PfMP PgMP PMI PMBOK PRINCE2See lessView David’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact David directlyView David’s Full ProfileNot the David you’re looking for?
