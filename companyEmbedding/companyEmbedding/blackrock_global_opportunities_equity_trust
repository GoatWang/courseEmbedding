Overview






Investment Approach
BlackRock Global Opportunities Equity Trust’s (BOE) (the “Trust”) primary investment objective is to provide current income and current gains, with a secondary investment objective of long-term capital appreciation. The Trust seeks to achieve its investment objectives by investing primarily in dividend-paying equity securities and utilizing an option writing (selling) strategy to seek total return performance and enhance distributions. The Trust invests, under normal market conditions, at least 80% of its net assets in dividend-paying equity securities and at least 40% of its assets outside of the U.S. (unless market conditions are not deemed favorable by Trust management, in which case the Trust may invest at least 30% of its assets outside of the U.S.). The Trust may invest in securities of companies of any market capitalization, but intends to invest primarily in securities of large capitalization companies. The Trust may invest directly in such securities or synthetically through the use of derivatives.

Investors who purchase shares of the fund through an investment adviser or other financial professional may separately pay a fee to that service provider. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Total Distribution Current year distributions are not classified as “Income,” “Short-Term Capital Gains,” “Long-Term Capital Gains,” or “Return of Capital” until calendar year-end.











Past distributions are not indicative of future distributions.

If a Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains in the current fiscal year; a portion of its distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of a shareholder's investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect a Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund's net asset value per share. Although the character of income will not be determined until the end of the fund’s fiscal year, please refer to the 'Closed-End Fund Resources' section of the BlackRock website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the fund's distributions, which should not be not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes. A Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year will be sent to shareholders to illustrate how the Fund’s distributions should be reported for federal income tax purposes.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the SEC Edgar database. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Common shares for most of the closed-end funds identified above are only available for purchase and sale at current market price on a stock exchange. A closed-end fund’s dividend yield, market price and NAV will fluctuate with market conditions. The information for these funds is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell Fund shares.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. The market value and net asset value (NAV) of a fund's shares will fluctuate with market conditions. Closed-end funds may trade at a premium to NAV but often trade at a discount.  The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary. Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions. International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to political risks, currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets. Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments. Principal of mortgage- or asset-backed securities normally may be prepaid at any time, reducing the yield and market value of those securities. Obligations of US govt. agencies are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the US govt. Non-investment-grade debt securities (high-yield/junk bonds) may be subject to greater market fluctuations, risk of default or loss of income and principal than higher rated securities. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative and are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns. In addition, many emerging securities markets have lower trading volumes and less liquidity. The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. The Fund is subject to numerous risks, including investment risks. Shares of closed-end funds often trade at a discount from their net asset value. The Fund is not a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.  The amounts and sources of distributions reported in any notices are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the end of the period.  Some investors may be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT).   Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.


The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).

      five potlines at its Warrick Operations aluminum smelter near 
      Evansville, Ind., an action that will further improve the 
      competitiveness of the on-site rolling mill.
The process to restart the three lines, with 161,400 metric tons of 
      annual capacity, will begin immediately and is expected to be complete 
      in the second quarter of 2018. The three potlines will directly supply 
      the Warrick rolling mill, which serves the North American market with 
      flat-rolled aluminum for the food and beverage can packaging industry. 
      The smelter's molten metal will supplement purchased scrap metal and 
      other raw materials that the Warrick site will continue to procure.
"By restarting a portion of the Warrick smelter, we will provide an 
      efficient source of metal for the co-located rolling mill and help it 
      meet an anticipated increase in production volumes," said Tim Reyes, 
      President of Alcoa's Aluminum business unit. "The action will enable us 
      to more fully utilize the assets at this integrated site for the benefit 
      of our investors, customers, employees and the community."
The smelter at Warrick closed in March of 2016. Two of the five smelting 
      potlines will be classified as curtailed capacity and will remain idle. 
      After this partial restart, Alcoa will have approximately 886,000 metric 
      tons idled of its total smelting capacity of 3.4 million metric tons.
Restart expenses expected to be incurred in the third and fourth 
      quarters of 2017 are estimated to be between $30 and $35 million 
      (after-tax), or $0.16 and $0.19 per share, on a combined basis.
Additionally, in third quarter 2017, Alcoa will record an after-tax 
      benefit of approximately $25 million, or $0.13 per share, for the 
      reversal of liabilities related to the original closure.
The Warrick location currently employs about 1,250. The restart will 
      increase the site's employment by approximately 275, including those who 
      will be hired or recalled from layoff status. Some existing employees 
      will transfer to the smelter.
The federal, state and local governments have all been supportive of the 
      restart plan. Alcoa appreciates the actions the Trump Administration has 
      taken to address the challenges faced by the U.S. aluminum industry, 
      including Chinese overcapacity. As Warrick Operations restarts aluminum 
      production, Alcoa is confident the Administration will continue to be 
      attentive to the industry's needs.
The state of Indiana, through the Indiana Economic Development Corp. 
      (IEDC), and Warrick County offered preliminary assistance to support the 
      restart plan. The IEDC offered Alcoa up to $2.4 million in conditional 
      tax credits and up to $100,000 in training grants based on plans to add 
      new full-time jobs for Indiana residents.
"With its decision to restart operations in Indiana, Alcoa is showcasing 
      the value that this facility and Indiana's manufacturing expertise 
      provide to its global operations," said Indiana Governor Eric J. 
      Holcomb. "In Indiana, we're witnessing incredible momentum as 
      manufacturers continue to choose Indiana for growth, and we're pleased 
      that Alcoa once again chose Indiana."
Alcoa Warrick Operations is comprised of the smelter and the rolling 
      operations, which includes state-of-the-art casting, hot and cold 
      rolling, slitting and coating capabilities. The operations also include 
      the power supply for the smelter and rolling operations, consisting of a 
      coal mine that fuels four generating units with a combined net capacity 
      of about 750 megawatts. Three of those units are wholly-owned by Alcoa 
      Power Generating Inc. A fourth unit, Warrick Unit 4, with 300 megawatts 
      of net capacity, is owned in a 50-50 partnership with Vectren, a utility 
      headquartered in Evansville.
As part of the smelter restart plan, Alcoa Power Generating Inc. and 
      Vectren have agreed to jointly own and operate Unit 4 through December 
      31, 2023. Vectren's support in the restart decision provides important 
      clarity for the power portfolio at Warrick.
Carl Chapman, Vectren Chairman, President and CEO said: "Restarting the 
      operations of the smelter is a significant economic development win, and 
      we were pleased to play an important role in helping make this a 
      reality."
Ed Hemmersbach, Vice President of Operations for Alcoa Aluminum said: 
      "We appreciate the assistance and collaboration with numerous 
      stakeholders in this process, including our employees, United 
      Steelworkers Local 104, Vectren, and the local and state officials who 
      have all provided support in our work to strengthen the integrated 
      operation here in Southwestern Indiana."
