DJO Global Announces Financial Results for First Quarter 2017




Strong growth and Business Transformation on track






May 10, 2017 04:05 PM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--DJO Global, Inc. (“DJO” or the “Company”), a leading global provider of 
      medical technologies designed to get and keep people moving, today 
      announced financial results for its public reporting subsidiary, DJO 
      Finance LLC (“DJOFL”), for the first quarter ended April 1, 2017.
    


First Quarter Highlights



        Net sales grew 3.4% as reported to $288.4 million and grew 4.7% on a 
        sales per day constant currency basis.
      

        Net loss was $40.0 million compared to $38.3 million in the prior year 
        period.
      

        Adjusted EBITDA increased 17.0% as reported to $57.2 million, an 
        improvement of 15.4% in constant currency, or greater than 3 times 
        revenue growth.
      

        Net cash provided by continuing operating activities grew $25.2 
        million to $38.6 million.
      


      “We are off to a solid start in 2017 with growth across our global 
      business, earnings growing faster than revenue and improvement in our 
      cash flow during the first quarter,” said Brady Shirley, DJO’s President 
      and Chief Executive Officer. “Our business transformation is underway 
      and we have begun initiatives to improve liquidity, organization 
      effectiveness, procurement optimization, manufacturing, sales and 
      operations planning, and customer and product profitability, and we are 
      beginning to see early positive results of our efforts. There is still a 
      lot of work ahead of us, but I am confident that this transformation 
      positions the company for sustainable long-term financial performance 
      and value creation for all of our stakeholders.”
    

Sales Results


DJOFL achieved net sales for the first 
      quarter of 2017 of $288.4 million, reflecting as reported growth of 
      3.4%, compared with net sales of $278.9 million for the first quarter of 
      2016. Additionally, the first quarter of 2017 included 64 shipping days, 
      while the comparable period in 2016 included 65 shipping days. Sales in 
      the first quarter of 2017 grew 4.7% on a sales per day constant currency 
      basis over sales in the first quarter of 2016.
    

Net sales for the Surgical Implant segment 
      were $49.6 million for the first quarter of 2017, reflecting as reported 
      growth of 15.2% compared to the first quarter of 2016. Surgical sales 
      grew 17.0% on a sales day per day basis. The continued growth in the 
      Surgical Implant segment was primarily driven by strong organic growth 
      across the Company’s shoulder, hip and knee products.
    

Net sales for DJO’s International segment 
      were $78.2 million in the first quarter of 2017, reflecting as reported 
      growth of 4.2% over net sales in the first quarter of 2016. 
      International sales grew 4.9% on a sales per day constant currency 
      basis, driven by stronger sales in the Company’s direct markets, 
      primarily Australia, France, and Spain.
    

Net sales for DJO’s Recovery Sciences segment 
      were $38.5 million in the first quarter of 2017, reflecting as reported 
      growth of 5.3% compared to the first quarter of 2016. Recovery Sciences 
      sales grew 6.9% on a sales per day basis, reflecting continued strong 
      growth in the segment’s consumer products and Chattanooga rehabilitation 
      equipment product line.
    

Net sales for DJO’s Bracing and Vascular segment 
      were $122.1 million in the first quarter of 2017, a reported decline of 
      1.7%, compared to the first quarter of 2016. Bracing and Vascular sales 
      declined 0.2% on a sales per day basis, reflecting softness in the 
      Company’s Aircast and Procare, deep vein thrombosis, and Dr. Comfort 
      products, offset by growth in the Company’s OfficeCare channel, direct 
      consumer and DonJoy products.
    

Earnings Results


      For the first quarter of 2017, DJOFL reported a net 
      loss attributable to DJOFL of $40.0 million, compared to a net 
      loss of $38.3 million for the first quarter of 2016. As detailed in the 
      attached financial tables, the results for the current and prior year 
      first quarter periods and the current and prior year twelve-month 
      periods were impacted by significant non-cash items, non-recurring items 
      and other adjustments.
    

Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 
      2017 was $57.2 million compared with Adjusted EBITDA of $48.9 million in 
      the first quarter of 2016, representing 17.0% growth over the prior year 
      and 15.4% growth on a constant currency basis. Strong productivity 
      during the period drove growth in Adjusted EBITDA at over three times 
      the rate of revenue growth. Including projected future savings from cost 
      savings programs currently underway of $6.2 million as permitted under 
      our credit agreement and the indentures governing our outstanding notes, 
      Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended April 1, 2017 was $249.9 
      million.
    

      The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income attributable to 
      DJOFL plus net interest expense, income tax provision (benefit), and 
      depreciation and amortization, further adjusted for certain non-cash 
      items, non-recurring items and other adjustment items as permitted in 
      calculating covenant compliance under the Company’s secured term loan 
      and revolving credit facilities (“Senior Secured Credit Facilities”) and 
      the indentures governing its 8.125% second lien notes and its 10.75% 
      third lien notes. A reconciliation between net loss attributable to 
      DJOFL and Adjusted EBITDA is included in the attached financial tables.
    

Net cash provided by continuing operating 
      activities for the first quarter of 2017 was $38.6 million 
      compared to $13.4 million for the first quarter of 2016. The improvement 
      in cash flow was primarily attributable to working capital initiatives 
      executed as part of the Company’s overall business transformation.

DJO Finance LLCAdjusted EBITDA


For the Three Months Ended April 1, 2017 and 2016(unaudited)
    

      Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, consisting of a $1,039.2 million 
      term loan facility and a $150.0 million asset-based revolving credit 
      facility, under which $76.0 million was outstanding as of April 1, 2017, 
      and the Indentures governing our $1,015.0 million of 8.125% second lien 
      notes and $298.5 million of 10.75% third lien notes (collectively, the 
      “notes”) represent significant components of our capital structure. 
      Under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we are required to maintain 
      a specified senior secured first lien leverage ratio, which is 
      determined based on our Adjusted EBITDA. If we fail to comply with the 
      senior secured first lien leverage ratio under our Senior Secured Credit 
      Facilities, we would be in default. Upon the occurrence of an event of 
      default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the lenders could 
      elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit 
      Facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all 
      commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those 
      amounts, the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities could 
      proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that 
      indebtedness. We have pledged substantially all of our assets as 
      collateral under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and under the 
      notes. Any acceleration under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities would 
      also result in a default under the Indentures governing the notes, which 
      could lead to the note holders electing to declare the principal, 
      premium, if any, and interest on the then outstanding notes immediately 
      due and payable. In addition, under the Indentures governing the notes, 
      our and our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in activities such as 
      incurring additional indebtedness, making investments, refinancing 
      subordinated indebtedness, paying dividends and entering into certain 
      merger transactions is governed, in part, by our ability to satisfy 
      tests based on Adjusted EBITDA. Our ability to meet the covenants 
      specified in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indentures 
      governing those notes will depend on future events, some of which are 
      beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet those 
      covenants.
    

      Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to DJOFL 
      plus interest expense, net, income tax provision (benefit), and 
      depreciation and amortization, further adjusted for certain non-cash 
      items, non-recurring items and other adjustment items as permitted in 
      calculating covenant compliance and other ratios under our Senior 
      Secured Credit Facilities and the Indentures governing the notes. We 
      believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to 
      provide additional information to investors about the calculation of, 
      and compliance with, certain financial covenants and other ratios in our 
      Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indentures governing the notes. 
      Adjusted EBITDA is a material component of these calculations.
    

      Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income 
      (loss) attributable to DJOFL or other performance measures presented in 
      accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
      States of America (“GAAP”), or as an alternative to cash flow from 
      operations as a measure of our liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA does not 
      represent net income (loss) attributable to DJOFL or cash flow from 
      operations as those terms are defined by GAAP and does not necessarily 
      indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. In 
      particular, the definition of Adjusted EBITDA under our Senior Secured 
      Credit Facilities and the Indentures governing the notes allows us to 
      add back certain non-cash, extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring 
      charges that are deducted in calculating net income (loss) attributable 
      to DJOFL. However, these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and 
      are difficult to predict. While Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are 
      frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt 
      service requirements, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to 
      other similarly titled captions of other companies due to the potential 
      inconsistencies in the method of calculation.
    

      The following table provides a reconciliation between net loss 
      attributable to DJO Finance LLC and Adjusted EBITDA:

          Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for the twelve months 
          ended April 1, 2017 consisted of a goodwill impairment charge of 
          $99.0 million and $61.0 million related to the CMF and Vascular 
          reporting units, respectively. The impairment charge for our CMF 
          reporting unit resulted from reductions in our projected operating 
          results and estimated future cash flows due to disruption caused by 
          our exit of the Empi business. The impairment charge for our 
          Vascular reporting unit resulted from reductions in our projected 
          operating results and estimated future cash flows due to a loss of 
          revenue caused by disruption as we transitioned our Dr. Comfort 
          therapeutic footwear manufacturing and distribution to a new ERP 
          system and market pressure in the therapeutic shoe market.
        





          (2)
        



          In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, current management implemented 
          a new strategy relating to our procurement, manufacturing and 
          liquidation philosophies in order to significantly reduce inventory 
          levels. Historically, our strategy was to purchase inventory in 
          large quantities to capture purchase discounts and rebates and 
          provide an expansive mix of products for our customers. Our new 
          strategy aims to integrate our supply chain services with customer 
          demand through focused forecasted consumption and sales efforts, 
          therefore limiting the range of SKUs we plan to offer. As a result 
          of these changes, the Company recorded a charge to cost of sales and 
          corresponding reduction in inventory of approximately $18.0 million. 
          The E&O reserve expense in fiscal 2016 included $5.7 million related 
          to the Company’s decision to discontinue certain SKUs mainly within 
          the Bracing and Vascular product lines, $8.3 million related to 
          holding inventory for shorter periods and the planned scrapping of 
          long-dated inventory, $2.0 million related to new Surgical Implant 
          products that changed the expected life cycle of its current product 
          portfolio, and $2.0 million of slow moving consigned inventory 
          within certain OfficeCare clinics for which management has decided 
          not to strategically relocate.
        





          (3)
        



          Purchase accounting adjustments consisted of amortization of fair 
          market value inventory adjustments for all periods presented.

          Non-recurring and integration charges are comprised of the following:

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

      see terrific performance in Orthopedic Implants and in Consumer products

      International businesses.”
    

Sales Results


      DJOFL achieved net sales for the fourth quarter of 2015 of $308.0 
      million, reflecting constant currency growth of 9.4%, compared with net 
      sales of $290.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. For the twelve 
      months ended December 31, 2015, DJOFL achieved net sales of $1,113.6 
      million, reflecting constant currency growth of 6.7% compared to net 
      sales of $1,087.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. 
      Net sales for the twelve months of 2015 were unfavorably impacted by 
      changes in foreign currency exchange rates aggregating $46.9 million 
      compared to the rates in effect in the twelve months of 2014.
    

      Net sales for DJO’s Bracing and Vascular segment were $143.0 million in 
      the fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting growth of 3.9%, compared to the 
      fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year of 2015, net sales for the 
      Bracing and Vascular segment were $526.3 million and increased 4.3% over 
      the full year of 2014, due to new account acquisition and growth in 
      sales of direct consumer products.
    

      Net sales for DJO’s Recovery Sciences segment were $43.7 million in the 
      fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting an increase of 0.5%, compared to the 
      fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year of 2015, net sales for the 
      Recovery Sciences segment were $156.2 million, a decrease of 0.8% from 
      net sales for the full year of 2014, primarily driven by continued slow 
      market conditions affecting the sale of Chattanooga rehabilitation 
      equipment.
    

      Net sales for DJO’s International segment were $79.1 million in the 
      fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign 
      currency exchange rates from rates in effect in the prior year period, 
      net sales for the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 8.4% from the fourth 
      quarter of 2014. For the full year of 2015, net sales for the 
      International segment were $296.3 million and increased 5.5% on a 
      constant currency basis over sales for the full year of 2014, primarily 
      driven by stronger sales in direct markets, especially in Germany, 
      France and Spain, and increased sales penetration in emerging markets.
    

      Net sales for the Surgical Implant segment were $42.2 million for the 
      fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting growth of 54.6% over net sales in the 
      fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year of 2015, net sales for the 
      Surgical Implant segment were $134.8 million and increased 34.7% over 
      2014, driven by strong sales of each of the Company’s shoulder, knee and 
      hip product lines, as well as contribution from the acquired Biomet 
      assets.
    

Earnings Results


      Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $68.9 million, or 
      22.4% of net sales, reflecting 3.8% as reported and 11.1% constant 
      currency growth when compared with Adjusted EBITDA of $66.4 million, or 
      22.9% of net sales, for the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA for 
      the twelve months of 2015 was $239.9 million, or 21.5% of net sales, 
      compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $231.3 million, or 21.3% of net sales, 
      for the twelve months of 2014, reflecting 3.7% as reported growth and 
      constant currency growth of 9.3%. Including cost savings programs 
      currently underway of $9.1 million, Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve 
      months ended December 31, 2015 was $249.0 million, or22.4 percent of LTM 
      net sales.
    

      The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income attributable to 
      DJOFL plus interest expense, net, income tax provision (benefit), and 
      depreciation and amortization, further adjusted for certain non-cash 
      items, non-recurring items and other adjustment items as permitted in 
      calculating covenant compliance under the Company’s new senior secured 
      credit facilities (“New Senior Credit Facilities”) and the indentures 
      governing its 8.125% second lien notes, its 10.75% third lien notes and 
      its 9.75% senior subordinated notes. Reconciliation between net loss and 
      Adjusted EBITDA is included in the attached financial tables.
    

      For the fourth quarter of 2015, DJOFL reported a net loss attributable 
      to DJOFL of $49.6 million, compared to a net loss of $7.4 million for 
      the fourth quarter of 2014. As detailed in the attached financial 
      tables, the results for the current and prior year fourth quarter 
      periods were impacted by significant non-cash items, non-recurring items 
      and other adjustments. For the twelve months of 2015, DJOFL reported a 
      net loss attributable to DJOFL of $340.9 million, compared to a net loss 
      attributable to DJOFL of $90.5 million for the twelve months of 2014. As 
      detailed in the attached financial tables, the results for the current 
      and prior year twelve month periods were impacted by significant 
      non-cash items, non-recurring items and other adjustments.
    

      As of December 31, 2015, the Company had cash balances of $48.9 million 
      and available liquidity of $119.5 million under its $150 million 
      revolving credit facility.
    

2016 Outlook


      We have a very exciting slate of new products for 2016 that we will 
      begin to launch late in the first quarter. We expect these new products 
      and other ongoing commercial initiatives to drive continued top line 
      growth and we are targeting total company full year constant currency 
      revenue growth rates of 6%-8% for the full 2016 year and adjusted EBITDA 
      growth rates of 8%-10%, including future cost reductions for the full 
      2016 year. Based on year end foreign currency rates, we do not expect 
      sales or EBITDA for the full year of 2016 to be materially impacted.

DJO Finance LLCAdjusted EBITDAFor the Three 
      and Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014(unaudited)
    

      Our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, consisting of a $1,055.0 
      million term loan facility (including a $20.0 million delayed draw term 
      loan facility) and a $150.0 million revolving credit facility, under 
      which $30.0 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2015, and the 
      Indentures governing our $1,015.0 million of 8.125% second lien notes, 
      $298.5 million of 10.75% third lien notes, and $1.6 million of 9.75% 
      senior subordinated notes (collectively, the “notes”) represent 
      significant components of our capital structure. Under our New Senior 
      Secured Credit Facilities, we are required to maintain a specified 
      senior secured first lien leverage ratio, which is determined based on 
      our Adjusted EBITDA. If we fail to comply with the senior secured first 
      lien leverage ratio under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we 
      would be in default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under 
      the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the lenders could elect to 
      declare all amounts outstanding under the New Senior Secured Credit 
      Facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all 
      commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those 
      amounts, the lenders under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities 
      could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that 
      indebtedness. We have pledged substantially all of our assets as 
      collateral under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Any 
      acceleration under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities would also 
      result in a default under the Indentures governing the notes, which 
      could lead to the note holders electing to declare the principal, 
      premium, if any, and interest on the then outstanding notes immediately 
      due and payable. In addition, under the Indentures governing the notes, 
      our and our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in activities such as 
      incurring additional indebtedness, making investments, refinancing 
      subordinated indebtedness, paying dividends and entering into certain 
      merger transactions is governed, in part, by our ability to satisfy 
      tests based on Adjusted EBITDA. Our ability to meet the covenants 
      specified in the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indebtures 
      governing those notes will depend on future events, some of which are 
      beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet those 
      covenants.
    

      Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to DJOFL 
      plus interest expense, net, income tax provision (benefit), and 
      depreciation and amortization, further adjusted for certain non-cash 
      items, non-recurring items and other adjustment items as permitted in 
      calculating covenant compliance and other ratios under our New Senior 
      Secured Credit Facilities and the Indentures governing the notes. We 
      believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to 
      provide additional information to investors about the calculation of, 
      and compliance with, certain financial covenants and other ratios in our 
      New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indentures governing the 
      notes. Adjusted EBITDA is a material component of these calculations.
    

      Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income 
      (loss) or other performance measures presented in accordance with 
      accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America 
      (“GAAP”), or as an alternative to cash flow from operations as a measure 
      of our liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent net income (loss) 
      or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by GAAP and does 
      not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund 
      cash needs. In particular, the definition of Adjusted EBITDA under our 
      New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Indentures governing the 
      notes allows us to add back certain non-cash, extraordinary, unusual or 
      non-recurring charges that are deducted in calculating net income 
      (loss). However, these are expenses that may recur, vary greatly and are 
      difficult to predict. While Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are 
      frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt 
      service requirements, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to 
      other similarly titled captions of other companies due to the potential 
      inconsistencies in the method of calculation.
