Henry Hyde leaves the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York to start his own firm, then known as Equitable Life Assurance Society of America. In its tenth year, Equitable writes more new business than any other company in the world.



The company's new headquarters is the first office building with steam elevators, paving the way for future skyscrapers. By 1879, it will expand to be the tallest office building in the world at that time.



Equitable markets the first joint and survivor annuity and pioneers the practice of paying death claims immediately. Miss Ray Wilner appointed Equitable's first woman agency manager.



Equitable supported the American College in launching the CLU professional designation program. Equitable started new agent training classes in 1902.



Equitable introduces its first line of individual variable annuity products and in 1976 pioneers variable life insurance, an investment-oriented policy that commands significant market share.



With a $1 billion investment from the AXA Group, Equitable completes the largest-ever conversion from a mutual to a stock company at that time and soon becomes a member of the Global AXA Group.



AXA celebrates its eighth consecutive year as the #1 insurance brand in the world as measured by the Interbrand annual report.

How to Invest for a (Mostly) Tax-Free Retirement

Paul O'Donnell

"Tax-free retirement" has a nice ring to it. If, like two-thirds of Americans, you are unsure you've saved enough for your out years, it's especially nice to know that Uncle Sam won't be pinching a slice of your meager pie. Or maybe you're an ample saver convinced by the tax talk in Washington that the feds will undo your careful planning by raising taxes by the time you call it quits. 
  No wonder financial advisors say that current clients and prospects have taxes on their minds, or that titles containing "tax free" are popping up on the personal finance shelves at the bookstore.  
  As enticing as a completely tax-free income stream may sound, however, it's difficult to create. The most common retirement savings vehicles, tax-deferred IRAs and 401(k)s, are unwieldy investments when it comes to taxation. And while most retirees have less income to tax, they also have fewer deductions, reducing the opportunities to shelter their reduced revenue.  

  Some financial advisors question whether avoiding taxes should be a priority at all in retirement planning.  
"The goal is not to pay the least tax possible but to maximize the after-tax return," said Rande Spiegelman, vice president of financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. 
  But there's good reason to pursue as much tax-free income as possible. 
"If you ignore their impact, taxes can change the old mantra that you can live on 80 percent of what you make pre-retirement," said Greg Stevens, senior financial counselor at Cabot Money Management, in Salem, Mass. 
At a time of life when returns are low and health-care expenses are high, it makes sense to preserve every retirement dollar you can.

  Roth IRA 
  The retirees' primary source for tax-free income is the Roth IRA. After-tax dollars go in and grow tax-free, and you pay no tax on withdrawals. Roths have an advantage over municipal bonds, the time-honored tax-free instrument because, unlike with munis, Roth disbursements aren't counted as income for early recipients of Social Security, whose payments are docked if they make as little as $15,000.

            How to Plan Retirement With Commodity ETF   
			                        Wednesday, 12 Jun 2013 |  4:35  PM ET 




  Roth income is so advantageous that it makes sense to moving funds from other instruments such as 401(k)s and traditional IRAs and pay any taxes owed with the conversion. 
  Many retirees wait to convert until their first year of retirement, when they have no more employment income, leaving them in a lower bracket, but the conversion can be made anytime it's reasonable. The key is to avoid incurring higher taxes now in the name of avoiding them later, according to Stevens.  
  "The question is, do you have any room in your current tax bracket to make the Roth conversion?" he said.  
  By converting, the tax-averse also rid themselves of the mandatory—and taxable—withdrawals from IRAs and 401(k)s that come at age 70-and-a-half.  
  "A client who has $1.5 million in [taxable] funds is looking at required minimum distributions of more than $50,000," said Curt Knotick, a financial planner in Butler, Pa. "Add pension and Social Security, and they should begin premature distributions to convert to a Roth."  
 Insurance for income 
  It's not likely, however, that you'll have enough assets in a Roth IRA to provide all you'll need for retirement. The next stop in the search for tax-free income is the insurance agent. 
  With the collapse of traditional pensions, insurers have seen increased interest in annuities, which produce guaranteed monthly payouts in exchange for a chunk of your savings.  
  When funded by a Roth IRA, one type of annuity—an immediate fixed annuity—gives its owner an income stream that's not only tax-free but guaranteed for life. Even those funded by taxable savings can yield low-tax income because each monthly payment contains a small slice of your premium, which has already been taxed.   
  The life insurance retirement plan is another, more specialized, income-bearing product. Essentially a massively overfunded universal life policy, a LIRP allows the owner to withdraw the policy's excess cash tax-free and take loans that will be repaid from the its benefit when the owner dies.  
  Not everyone agrees that insurance is the best source of income, tax-free or not. Because the company has to take its cut and pay a death benefit, fees attending these investments tend to be high.  
  (Read More: Seniors Falling Short in Retirement) 
  In addition, annuities require relinquishing control of your cash for long periods, if not permanently. A standard tool in many retirement planning schemes, annuities are more often used to guarantee that basic expenses are covered rather than to avoid taxes. And all but their most ardent advocates agree that the costs and complexity of LIRPs make them a solution more for high earners who have maxed out conventional retirement savings vehicles and are still seeking shelter. 
 Portfolio management 
  Most retirees will have taxable income; the amount of tax will depend on how money is made and where it is placed.   
  "You want to manage your portfolio," said Spiegelman at Schwab. "You want your most tax-efficient investments in your taxable account and [least-efficient investments] in deferred." 
  Specifically, that means keeping high-earning stocks quarantined in IRAs or 401(k)s, where all the income will be put to best use. Low-turnover investments and securities aimed at growth rather than income can live happily in a regular brokerage account, along with exchange-traded funds.  
  "Then in retirement you have assets that have appreciated nicely over the years, but when you sell them, you pay capital gains, not ordinary income rates," Spiegelman said.
  "Even if taxes are what worry you, the first priority is asset allocation," he said. "Making the right investment decision comes next. Then be choosy about where you implement the portfolio." 
  Above all, financial advisors say, stay nimble, and don't put your assets into any single strategy with the purpose of minimizing taxes or, especially, getting free of the whims of Congress. Staying tax-free, as Stevens pointed out, is a necessary losing game. 
"If everyone goes into no-tax investments," he said, "leave it to Congress to take away the deductions."

1 Morningstar, as of 12/31/2016. Post-tax comparison between the 1, 3 and 5 year returns at NAV of the iShares Core ETFs and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds within the same Morningstar categories as the iShares Core ETFs. Mutual funds are generally more tax inefficient than ETFs and, as a result, are typically more negatively impacted than ETFs when comparing performance based on post-tax returns rather than total returns. The number of ETFs and mutual funds used for each period varies based on the inception date of the iShares Core ETFs. iShares Core ETFs included in this comparison vary based on the time period analyzed: 1 year (19 Core ETFs existed for the full 1-year period ended 1/31/15); 3 year (15 Core ETFs existed for the full 3-year period ended 1/31/13); and 5 year (9 Core ETFs existed for the full 5-year period ended 1/31/11). iShares Core ETFs outperformed their active mutual fund peers by 77.5% (1955/2426), 84.6% (1804/2157) and 79.9% (1330/1515) over the 1, 3 and 5 year periods ended 12/31/16, respectively. Performance was averaged for Morningstar categories containing more than one iShares fund, and may be different for other time periods. Returns are calculated after taxes on distributions, including capital gains and dividends, assuming the highest federal tax rate for each type of distribution in effect at the time of the distribution. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Review the differences between iShares ETFs and mutual funds for more information.2 BlackRock, as of 3/31/17. Based on 815 ETFs and $1.42 trillion in assets under management globally.






 
Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.







Transactions in shares of ETFs will result in brokerage commissions and will generate tax consequences. All regulated investment companies are obliged to distribute portfolio gains to shareholders.






Investment comparisons are for illustrative purposes only. To better understand the similarities and differences between investments, including investment objectives, risks, fees and expenses, it is important to read the products' prospectuses.






The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).

Strategy and process

More than 10 asset classes: The fund holds a variety of investments in all market conditions to be positioned to benefit from a wide range of opportunities.
Individual securities: The managers select individual stocks and bonds, not other funds, to finely tune the portfolio and avoid overlap in holdings.
Active rebalancing: The managers proactively pursue opportunities and regularly rebalance the portfolio to maintain a consistent risk profile.







Manager commentary | Q2 2017
Security selection can drive diversification
Jason Vaillancourt, Co-Head of Global Asset Allocation, explains how security selection can be a method of diversification.













 Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, visit putnam.com. 
Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. Returns before sales charge do not reflect the current maximum sales charges as indicated below. Had the sales charge been reflected, returns would be lower. Returns at public offering price (after sales charge) for class A and class M shares reflect the current maximum initial sales charges of 5.75% and 3.50% for equity funds and Putnam Absolute Return 500 Fund and 700 Fund, and 4.00% and 3.25% for income funds (1.00% and 0.75% for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund), respectively. Class B share returns reflect the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which is 5% in the first year, declining to 1% in the sixth year, and is eliminated thereafter (except for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund, which is 1% in the first year, declining to 0.5% in the second year, and is eliminated thereafter). Class C shares reflect a 1% CDSC the first year that is eliminated thereafter. Performance for class B, C, M, R, T1, and Y shares prior to their inception is derived from the historical performance of class A shares, adjusted for the applicable sales charge (or CDSC) and, except for class Y shares, the higher operating expenses for such shares (with the exception of Putnam Tax-Free High Yield Fund and Putnam AMT-Free Municipal Fund, which are based on the historical performance of class B shares). Class R5/R6 shares, available to qualified employee-benefit plans only, are sold without an initial sales charge and have no CDSC. Class Y shares are generally only available for corporate and institutional clients and have no initial sales charge. Performance for Class R5/R6 shares before their inception are derived from the historical performance of class Y shares, which have not been adjusted for the lower expenses; had they, returns would have been higher. Class A, M, and T1 shares of Putnam money market funds have no initial sales charge. For a portion of the period, some funds had expenses limitations or had been sold on a limited basis with limited assets and expenses, without which returns would be lower.



Objective
The Growth Fund seeks capital appreciation.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

The up-market capture ratio is used to evaluate how well an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has risen. The ratio is
calculated by dividing the manager’s returns by the returns of the index during the up-market, and multiplying that factor by 100. The down-market capture ratio
is used to evaluate how well an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has dropped. The ratio is calculated by dividing the
manager’s returns by the returns of the index during the down-market and multiplying that factor by 100.

The Russell 3000 Index is an unmanaged index of the 3,000 largest U.S. companies. You cannot invest directly in an index.
 Consider these risks before investing: Allocation of assets among asset classes may hurt performance. Stock and bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons, including general financial market conditions, factors related to a specific issuer or industry and, with respect to bond prices, changing market perceptions of the risk of default and changes in government intervention. These factors may also lead to increased volatility and reduced liquidity in the bond markets. International investing involves currency, economic, and political risks. Emerging-market securities carry illiquidity and volatility risks. Investments in small and/or midsize companies increase the risk of greater price fluctuations. Growth stocks may be more susceptible to earnings disappointments, and value stocks may fail to rebound. Funds that invest in government securities are not guaranteed. Mortgage-backed investments, unlike traditional debt investments, are also subject to prepayment risk, which means that they may increase in value less than other bonds when interest rates decline and decline in value more than other bonds when interest rates rise. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate risk (the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise) and credit risk (the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments). Default risk is generally higher for non-qualified mortgages. Interest-rate risk is greater for longer-term bonds, and credit risk is greater for below-investment-grade bonds. Unlike bonds, funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses. The use of derivatives may increase these risks by increasing investment exposure (which may be considered leverage) or, in the case of over-the-counter instruments, because of the potential inability to terminate or sell derivatives positions and the potential failure of the other party to the instrument to meet its obligations. You can lose money by investing in the fund.
