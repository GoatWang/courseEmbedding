About the Firm

Firm Overview

		Our attorneys are experienced litigators with a wide-ranging client base, however, over the years, we have developed particular expertise and have become the go-to firm in several areas including agriculture law, insurance coverage and toxic torts. Our attorneys have handled matters for businesses of all sizes - from small to medium-sized manufacturers and agricultural enterprises to Fortune 500 companies - and we have served as defense counsel in some of the country's highest profile insurance coverage and damage cases.

While the scope of our clients' needs may differ, our practice philosophy does not. We are always available to our clients, and our focus is trained on meeting their legal needs without delay, wasted time, or distractions.

Reeg Lawyers also provides additional benefits and advantages, including:

SIZE. Our smaller size means we can react much quicker and be more responsive to a client's changing needs and circumstances than large corporate law firms.

EXPERIENCE. Collectively, our attorneys offer more than 75 years of successful litigation experience.

SUCCESS AND REPUTATION. Our law firm is peer-rated AV by Martindale-Hubbell and listed in the Bar Register of Pre-Eminent Lawyers, which means we have been rated by our peers in the legal profession as having the highest level of professional ethics and legal ability.

VALUE. By providing all of the above - strategic size, proven experience, and recognized ability - we offer our clients tremendous value. Clients receive the counsel and skill commensurate with bigger law firms  at a rate much lower than corporate firms and with an uncommon attention to detail.

Headquartered in the Midwest, Reeg Lawyers provides a range of litigation services to clients throughout the Heartland via its offices in St. Louis and Center, Missouri and its office in Wichita, Kansas. In addition to maintaining offices in these cities, our attorneys are also licensed to practice in Missouri, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, and Nebraska.

Firm Specialties



Personal Injury

Our attorneys defend businesses and individuals confronted with personal injury claims.
These cases are often complex and can be emotion-filled - we have the experience, expertise, and determination to fully investigate each case and defend our clients at trial. Defense of our clients includes addressing such matters as compensatory damages, medical bills, lost wages, pain and suffering damages, financial and economic losses, and punitive damages. Should an appeal be necessary, our attorneys are well-versed in the appeals process.

Our personal injury lawyers handle a wide array of matters that include, for example:

-Automobile Accidents
-Aviation Crashes
-Birth Injuries
-Brain Injuries
-Catastrophic Injury
-Lost Limbs
-Medical Negligence
-Paraplegia
-Surgical Injuries
-Trucking Accidents
-Workers Compensation
-Wrongful Death

We also represent businesses and individuals in claims against others who were negligent or committed careless or intentional acts, fraud, or breach-of-contract. Whether the claim is one of medical negligence or a workplace injury that has resulted in the need for workers compensation, Reeg Lawyers has the experience to defend your interests and to take your case to trial.

If you are accused of causing a catastrophic injury or wrongful death through carelessness or unintentional conduct towards others, contact Reeg Lawyers today.

Representative Personal Injury Cases

-One of our lawyers was on the team that represented the manufacturer of a dump truck bed that allegedly failed, causing the Plaintiff to be buried waist-deep in 325 degree asphalt for more than 20 minutes while his co-workers dug him out. After the Plaintiff settled for millions of dollars with all the other defendants, our client did not settle, chose to go to trial, and was exonerated with a defense verdict within two weeks. The case was widely reported and noted as one of the top ten defense verdicts in the U.S. in 1996 by the National Law Journal.

-One of the driver-employees of our trucking company client was killed in a major accident in which he was not at fault. This man had a wife and young teenager at home. With our advice, the President of the company and another senior officer personally delivered to the family's home the first of many workers' compensation payments rightfully due the family. In the meantime, our lawyers brought litigation against the company whose workers caused the accident when the tools they did not secure flew off the truck. Reimbursement was secured to the limits of the company's insurance policy.

-Pharmaceutical litigation has been an active part of our practice for more than three decades. One our lawyers defended a damaged baby case alleged to have been caused by a prescription drug taken by the mother. The condition of the child was one of the known potential side effects of the drug. After a series of depositions, a thorough review of the medical records of both the mother and the child, and a spirited motion practice, our attorney, the client, and opposing counsel worked together to create a life-care plan that would assist in the child's upbringing and ongoing care. The amount paid by the client to fund this program was substantially less than it might have been if the case had gone to trial in the jurisdiction where it was pending.

When a personal injury claim is filed it is important to have a dedicated and experienced attorney working for you. Contact Reeg Lawyers today to ensure that you are protected.
