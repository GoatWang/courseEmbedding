 Cigarettes
A cigarette is any roll of tobacco wrapped in paper or in any substance not containing tobacco. It is the most widely used tobacco product in the United States.
Tobacco smoke contains a deadly mix of more than 7,000 chemicals. Hundreds are toxic. About 70 are known to cause cancer. Learn more about the health effects of smoking cigarettes. The chemicals in cigarette smoke also effect those around you. Breathing secondhand smoke from cigarettes is harmful to both children and adults. Learn more about the health effects of secondhand smoke.

Back to top

 Light Cigarettes
You may have chosen low-tar, mild, light, or ultra light cigarettes in the past because they seemed less harmful. However—if you took long, deep, or frequent puffs—tar exposure from light cigarettes was just as high as that from regular cigarettes.
The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (PDF – 340 KB) bans tobacco manufacturers from using the terms “light,” “low,” or “mild” in product labeling and advertisements. This provision went into effect on June 22, 2010.
All cigarettes are harmful. Learn more about the health effects of light cigarettes.
 
Back to top

 Menthol Cigarettes
Menthol is a substance naturally found in mint plants such as peppermint and spearmint that gives a cooling sensation. It is an additive in cigarettes, cigars, little cigars, smokeless tobacco products, and tobacco rolling paper. Brands marketed as menthol cigarettes have enough menthol added to describe them as having a menthol flavor. However, brands not labeled as menthol may contain low levels of it as well.
The tobacco industry has marketed menthol cigarettes as being a "healthier" and "safer" cigarette, emphasizing its cool and refreshing taste. In reality, menthol reduces the harshness of cigarette smoke, which makes it easier to smoke—especially for children and teens.
Many people choose menthol cigarettes because they believe menthol cigarettes are safer than non-menthol cigarettes. However, no evidence exists indicating that menthol cigarettes are safer. All cigarette smoking is linked to many cancers and other diseases. No tobacco product is safe. Learn more about the health effects of menthol cigarettes.

Read the announcement that the Food and Drug Administration is seeking public input on menthol in cigarettes. 

Read a Q&A about menthol.
 
Back to top

 Cigars and Pipes
From 2000 to 2011, the use of non-cigarette smoked tobacco products increased dramatically. The largest increases were in use of pipe tobacco—used for roll-your-own cigarettes—and large cigars.
No tobacco product is safe. Cigars are large, rolled bundles of dried and cured tobacco. There are three major types of cigars sold in the United States—large cigars, cigarillos, and little cigars. While some people still use traditional pipes with a bow, pipe tobacco is often purchased for roll your own cigarettes.
Like cigarettes, cigars and pipe tobacco smoke contains toxic and cancer causing chemicals that are harmful to both smokers and nonsmokers. Unlike cigarettes, cigars sold in the United States are permitted to be manufactured with flavors, which can mask the harshness of tobacco and appeal particularly to youth and young adults. Learn more about the health effects of smoking cigars and pipes. 
Back to top

 Bidis and Kreteks (Clove Cigarettes)
Bidis are small, thin, hand-rolled cigarettes primarily imported to the United States from India and other Southeast Asian countries. They are tobacco wrapped in a tendu or temburni leaf—plants native to Asia—that may be tied with colorful string at one or both ends. Bidis can be flavored—such as chocolate, cherry, or mango—or unflavored. Flavored bidis, however, are not allowed in the United States because of the ban on flavored cigarettes.
Kreteks—sometimes referred to as clove cigarettes—are imported from Indonesia. They typically contain about 60% tobacco and 40% ground cloves. Kreteks are banned in the United States because of the ban on flavored cigarettes.
No tobacco product is safe. A limited amount of research on the long-term health effects of bidis and kreteks has been conducted in the United States. However, research studies from India show that bidi smoking is associated with cancer and other health conditions. Additionally, research studies from Indonesia show that kretek smoking is associated with lung problems.
Back to top

 Hookahs
Hookahs—sometimes called water pipes—are used to smoke specially made tobacco that is available in a variety of flavors. Hookahs originated in ancient Persia and India and have been used for centuries. A typical modern hookah has a head (with holes in the bottom), a metal body, a water bowl, and a flexible hose with a mouthpiece. Tobacco smoke is drawn through water or ice in the water bowl and cooled before it is inhaled.
While hookah smokers may consider this practice less harmful than smoking cigarettes, no tobacco product is safe. Water pipe smoking delivers the addictive drug nicotine and hookah smokers may absorb higher concentrations of the toxins found in cigarette smoke. A typical 1-hour-long hookah smoking session involves inhaling 100–200 times the volume of smoke inhaled from a single cigarette.

E-Cigarettes Under Fire
No-Smoke Electronic Cigarettes Draw Criticism From FDA, Medical Groups

By Daniel J. DeNoon





From the WebMD Archives





"They are electronic, alternative smoking devices that simulate the sensation of smoking. They do not expose the user, or others close by, to harmful levels of cancer-causing agents and other dangerous chemicals normally associated with traditional tobacco products."

-- Craig Youngblood, president of InLife, an e-cigarette company.

"They are nicotine delivery devices intended to be used like a cigarette. What happens to someone who stops inhaling the tars of cigarettes and inhales only nicotine? We don't know. There is at least the potential for harm."

-- Norman Edelman, MD, chief medical officer, American Lung Association

"We are concerned about the potential for addiction and abuse of these products. We don't want the public to perceive them as a safer alternative to cigarettes."

-- Rita Chapelle, FDA spokeswoman.


E-cigarettes don't make real smoke, yet they've ignited a firestorm of controversy.
You may have already seen e-cigarettes -- electronic cigarettes -- for sale on the Internet or at one of at least 62 kiosks at malls across the U.S.
E-cigarettes are safer than cigarettes, their makers say or imply. But until e-cigarettes are proven safe, the FDA is refusing to let them into the country and may soon ban their sale, as major U.S. medical associations have asked.
"We have an open investigation into this issue," FDA spokeswoman Rita Chappelle tells WebMD. "What is happening right now is FDA has reviewed several e-cigarettes, e-cigars, and e-pipes, and have refused entry of these products into the country. We acted because these products appear to require FDA approval for marketing, and have not been reviewed by the agency."
An informal FDA review of some of these products "indicated that these products are not currently approved," Chappelle says.
If the FDA bans e-cigarettes, an action many observers believe imminent, it won't be the first North American agency to do so. Last month, Canada's health agency banned the importation or sale of e-cigarette products.
What's all the fuss about? At the heart of the issue is a debate over what the e-cigarette really is.

What's an E-Cigarette?

Like gunpowder, the e-cigarette is a Chinese invention. The first ones came from the Ruyan company in 2004. According to media reports, Ruyan says it sold 300,000 e-cigarettes in 2008, and it's far from the only company making the devices.

The e-cigarette comes in many shapes and sizes. Many look more or less like long cigarettes; others look like cigars or pipes. They all work the same basic way:

The user inhales through a mouthpiece.
Air flow triggers a sensor that switches on a small, battery-powered heater.
The heater vaporizes liquid nicotine in a small cartridge (it also activates a light at the "lit" end of the e-cigarette). Users can opt for a cartridge without nicotine.
The heater also vaporizes propylene glycol (PEG) in the cartridge. PEG is the stuff of which theatrical smoke is made.
The user gets a puff of hot gas that feels a lot like tobacco smoke.
When the user exhales, there's a cloud of PEG vapor that looks like smoke. The vapor quickly dissipates.
E-cigarettes contain no tobacco products; even the nicotine is synthetic.

The devices retail for $100 to $200. Refill cartridge packs vary in price depending on nicotine content, and liquid for do-it-yourself refills are sold, too. Each cartridge is good for several uses.

E-Cigarettes: Good?

So what's an e-cigarette good for?
Different e-cigarette marketers stress different points:

For smokers who don't plan to quit tobacco, some firms point to e-cigarettes as a way to "smoke" in smoke-free environments such as airplane lounges, restaurants, and workplaces.
For smokers who don't want to give up their nicotine addiction, some firms suggest that switching to e-cigarettes will reduce the harm of their habit.
For smokers who want to quit, some firms suggest that e-cigarettes may help people transition from smokers to nonsmokers (the World Health Organization has asked marketers not to make this claim).

Craig Youngblood, president of the InLife e-cigarette company, says that since regular tobacco is very bad for you, something that assuages your nicotine habit without smoke must be less bad.
"In our product you have nicotine or no nicotine, PEG, and some flavoring. In cigarettes you have nicotine, PEG, and 4,000 chemicals and 43 carcinogens," Youngblood tells WebMD. "There are 45 to 50 million people already addicted to nicotine. Should they have the choice to satisfy their addiction by other means? ... I am a proponent of harm reduction. People have rights and choices and should be allowed to make them."


Continued


Youngblood says his company makes no health claims. He rejects the idea that his product is a smoking cessation device and says his company does not make that claim. He also says his product is not sold to minors.
Youngblood does make this claim: E-cigarettes are green.
"There is no pollution of the environment with this product," he says. "The vapor is not the same as smoke. And for every odor-free e-cigarette cartridge people throw in the trash, smokers throw 20 smelly cigarette butts out their car windows."
Some firms do suggest that e-cigarettes are safer than tobacco cigarettes. Most point to a Ruyan-funded study by tobacco researcher Murray Laugesen, MBChB, of Health New Zealand, a private research firm.
Laugesen analyzed Ruyan e-cigarettes and found nothing inherently bad in them -- that is, they contained what they said they contained and posed little threat of immediate harm.
But this was not a clinical study, notes Norman Edelman, MD, chief medical officer of the American Lung Association, one of the organizations that has called for an FDA ban on e-cigarettes.
"Laugesen is trying to project what the effects of e-cigarettes might be, but he doesn't really know," Edelman tells WebMD. "There are no clinical studies of long-term use of these products."
And some firms do claim that e-cigarettes help people quit smoking. After all, there's an FDA-approved nicotine inhaler already in drug stores -- Pfizer's Nicotrol. It doesn't look much like a cigarette, but it doesn't look much different than some e-cigarette products.
What's the difference?
"The Nicotrol inhaler is an approved smoking cessation device," says the FDA's Chapelle. "Because these e-cigarette products haven't been reviewed by the agency, their labeling has to be reviewed, their intended use has to be reviewed, and all of their ingredients and components have to be reviewed."

E-Cigarettes: Bad?

Edelman says nicotine addiction is bad and that people with the habit need help quitting, not help continuing their habit in more socially acceptable ways.
And there's no proof that e-cigarettes don't cause long-term harm. That's what bothers all the health experts who discussed e-cigarettes with WebMD.


Continued


"We cannot say they are good or bad because we don't have any scientific proof," says Eliana Mendes, MD, a pulmonology researcher at the University of Miami.
"What happens to someone who stops inhaling the tars of cigarettes and just inhales nicotine? We don't know," Edelman says. "We are talking about use that might be three years, five years, 10 years, we just don't know. Once you have the nicotine habit, you are not likely to quit."
Rather than quit, e-cigarettes might worsen users' nicotine habits, says Michael Eriksen, ScD, director of the institute of public health at Atlanta's Georgia State University and former director of CDC's office of smoking and health.
"I have seen no evidence that people switch from tobacco cigarettes to e-cigarettes or other smokeless tobacco products," Eriksen tells WebMD. "If you look at how smokeless products are marketed, they are sold as something to use at times you can't smoke. The implication is you will increase nicotine exposure, not reduce smoking. We'll just be encouraging people to use more nicotine."
Youngblood says his e-cigarette products are being marketed only to people who already smoke and already have a nicotine addiction. But Eriksen says the unregulated sale of these products might get new users hooked -- users who might then start smoking.
"Will e-cigarettes get fewer people smoking? Or will people start with e-cigarettes and graduate to tobacco cigarettes? It is unknown whether these things are good, bad, or indifferent," he says. "If for every person who used e-cigarettes there was one fewer person smoking tobacco cigarettes, that would be good. But there is no evidence that will occur."
And there's one more issue that troubles doctors. University of Miami pediatrician and lung specialist Michael Light, PhD, says underage users will get their hands on e-cigarettes -- even if marketers like Youngblood refuse to sell them to minors.
"It will be easy for kids to get the product," Light tells WebMD. "It could be a way to get kids into the nicotine habit to get them to smoke. It is a ploy."

FDA: E-Cigarettes Bad, but Not Banned
FDA Issues Warning as Tests Find Electronic Cigarettes 'Illegal'

By Daniel J. DeNoon





From the WebMD Archives




July 22, 2009 - The FDA today warned Americans not to use electronic cigarettes -- but did not ban the sale of the smoke-free devices.
E-cigarettes and similar products are sold online and in scores of mall kiosks across the U.S. They deliver nicotine in a puff of hot gas that feels like smoke; nicotine-free versions are also sold.
Now the FDA has tested two of the devices: the Smoking Everywhere and Njoy products.
"The products we reviewed so far we found to be illegal," attorney Michael Levy, director of the FDA's office of compliance in the division of drug evaluation and research, said today during an FDA news conference. But the FDA has not banned them because "There is pending litigation on the issue of FDA's jurisdiction over e-cigarettes," Levy said.
Why call a news conference?
"We felt it important that while there is litigation and we are considering options, there is no reason to be confused about FDA's position on this issue," Joshua Sharfstein, MD, FDA principal deputy commissioner, said.
At the news conference, FDA analyst Benjamin Westenberger described testing 19 cartridges from the two e-cigarettes at the FDA's St. Louis facility. Among the findings:

All but one cartridge marked as having no nicotine actually contained the addictive substance.
Cartridges marked as having low, medium, or high amounts of nicotine actually had varying amounts of nicotine.
One of the cartridges contained a toxic antifreeze ingredient, diethylene glycol.
The devices emitted "tobacco-specific nitrosamines which are human carcinogens."
The devices emitted "tobacco-specific impurities suspected of being harmful to humans."

The FDA news conference also featured experts who issued strong warnings against e-cigarettes.
Jonathan Winickoff, MD, chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics Tobacco Consortium, warned that the products seem "tailor-made to appeal to kids." He said the devices could addict kids to nicotine and turn them into smokers.
Matthew McKenna, MD, director, of the CDC's Office of Smoking and Health, noted that e-cigarettes can be used in smoke-free environments and thus weaken the health benefits of antismoking efforts.
Jonathan Samet, MD, director of the Institute for Global Health at the University of Southern California, warned that e-cigarettes are nothing like FDA-approved nicotine-delivery devices shown to help people quit smoking. He noted that e-cigarettes have no proven benefits but very clear risks.


Continued


Since 2008, the FDA has been trying to prevent e-cigarettes from entering the country. To date, 50 shipments have been refused, but this has not stopped distribution and sale of e-cigarettes. Canada fully banned the devices in March 2009.
E-cigarette makers and distributors have argued that their devices are safer than real cigarettes, thereby mitigating the harm of smoking. Some have implied that their products help people quit smoking tobacco products.
The FDA rejects both claims. Because the devices can deliver a dose of synthetic nicotine, the agency sees them as unapproved drug-delivery devices with unknown safety. And whether they can safely help people quit smoking is also unknown, while they have a clear potential to entice new smokers with their fruit and candy flavors. 

How E-Cigarettes Work

The e-cigarette comes in many shapes and sizes. Many look more or less like long cigarettes; others look like cigars or pipes. They all work the same basic way:

The user inhales through a mouthpiece.
Air flow triggers a sensor that switches on a small, battery-powered heater.
The heater vaporizes liquid nicotine in a small cartridge (it also activates a light at the "lit" end of the e-cigarette). Users can opt for a cartridge without nicotine.
The heater also vaporizes propylene glycol (PEG) in the cartridge. PEG is the stuff of which theatrical smoke is made.
The user gets a puff of hot gas that feels a lot like tobacco smoke.
When the user exhales, there's a cloud of PEG vapor that looks like smoke. The vapor quickly dissipates.
E-cigarettes contain no tobacco products; even the nicotine is synthetic.

The devices retail for $100 to $200. Refill cartridge packs vary in price depending on nicotine content, and liquid for do-it-yourself refills are sold, too. Each cartridge is good for several uses.
Device makers say they make no health claims for their products. Craig Youngblood, president of the InLife e-cigarette company, says that since regular tobacco is very bad for you, something that assuages your nicotine habit without smoke must be less bad.
"In our product you have nicotine or no nicotine, PEG, and some flavoring. In cigarettes you have nicotine, PEG, and 4,000 chemicals and 43 carcinogens," Youngblood last April told WebMD. "I am a proponent of harm reduction. People have rights and choices and should be allowed to make them."

Others see the devices as a sneaky way to get people hooked on nicotine. One is Michael Eriksen, ScD, director of the institute of public health at Atlanta's Georgia State University and former director of CDC's office of smoking and health.
"I have seen no evidence that people switch from tobacco cigarettes to e-cigarettes or other smokeless tobacco products," Eriksen recently told WebMD. "If you look at how smokeless products are marketed, they are sold as something to use at times you can't smoke. The implication is you will increase nicotine exposure, not reduce smoking."
