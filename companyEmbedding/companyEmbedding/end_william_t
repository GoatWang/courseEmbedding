Lands' End, Ceo Have Parting Of Ways - tribunedigital-chicagotribune




 



Lands' End, Ceo Have Parting Of WaysDecember 06, 1994|By Genevieve Buck, Tribune Staff Writer.Catalog retailer Lands' End Inc. said Monday its president and chief executive officer, William T. End, 47, resigned due to disagreements with the company's board of directors over managment style.The board immediately named Michael J. Smith, 34, president and CEO. Smith, who came to Lands' End directly from the University of Wisconsin in 1983, was most recently vice president and head of the company's Coming Home division, which sells bed and bath products.Lands' End spokeswoman Charlotte LaComb would not elaborate on "differences in management style," though analysts attributed it to a "personality issue" or a parting of the ways "that could have been based on different expectations." The company and analysts said they could foresee no major changes in strategic direction under Smith.End's resignation Friday came as a surprise to the company, and the Monday announcement took the catalog industry and Wall Street by surprise, especially because of the proximity to Christmas, said analyst Dean Ramos of Dain Bosworth in Minneapolis. "Anytime you have a management change, there's risk involved, but when you have a pressurized environment," just three weeks before Christmas, following a disappointing third quarter, there's more risk.In that quarter, ended Oct. 28, Lands' End reported profits fell 52 percent, to $3.83 million from $7.98 million a year earlier. Revenues rose 14 percent, to $246.2 million from $215.1 million.Debra G. O'Shea, senior research analyst with Barrington Research Associates, said she believed there was no conflict "with what Bill wanted to do, perhaps only with the way he was going about it."Lands' End, an international direct merchant of traditionally styled, casual clothing, accessories and domestics, recently launched its first Japanese language catalog and began testing three other foreign language catalogs in Europe, which boosted costs.O'Shea said the international expansion, higher paper costs and other expenses have hurt the company's earnings but believes the expansion will pay off in the long term.
