YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksMedical Alert SystemsNeed a Medical Alert System?See The #1 Rated Company Near Youbestcompany.com/medical-alertAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection1. Nash Timothy600 Taylor Station RdColumbus, OH 43230(614) 759-8811Physicians & Surgeons,...Add to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection2. Nash, Timothy J, MD600 N Pickaway StCircleville, OH 43113(740) 474-9551Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection3. Nash, Patricia L, MD700 Childrens DrColumbus, OH 43205(614) 722-3275Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection4. Nash Steven M MD1313 Olentangy River RdColumbus, OH 43212(614) 890-6555Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection5. Nash, Steven, MD1654 Upham DrColumbus, OH 43210(614) 890-6555Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection6. Nash, Ryan R453 W 10th AveColumbus, OH 43210(614) 293-2957Physicians & SurgeonsClinicsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection7. Nash, Laura R5969 E Broad St Ste 200Columbus, OH 43213(614) 864-6010Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection8. Nash, Ryan R, MD4019 W Dublin Granville RdDublin, OH 43017(614) 293-2957Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection9. Nash, David M, MD540 N Cleveland AveWesterville, OH 43082(614) 895-3333Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection10. Ryan, Timothy E, MD108 N Murray Hill RdColumbus, OH 43228(614) 878-7407Physicians & Surgeons,...WebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection11. Cripe, Timothy P, MD700 Childrens DrColumbus, OH 43205(614) 722-2000Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection12. Timothy N Udoji, MD - Udoji Timothy N MD473 W 12th AveColumbus, OH 43210(614) 293-4967Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection13. Timothy James Robert Rust, MD931 Chatham Ln Ste 200Columbus, OH 43221(614) 533-5500Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection14. DR Timothy L Timko MD Facc3525 Olentangy River RdColumbus, OH 43214(614) 459-7676Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection15. Timothy Roland MD8627 Sancus BlvdColumbus, OH 43240(614) 457-4806Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection16. Treece, Timothy A, MD(2)4971 Arlington Centre BlvdColumbus, OH 43220(614) 246-6900Physicians & Surgeons, Plastic...WebsiteServicesI recently had Vaser liposuction to my inner thighs with Dr. Treece, and I couldn't be happier with the results!

He is one of the best endo I have seen and very knowledgeable.The nurses there are worst and seems like they do not really care about any patients health.Recently I ran out of Insulin (I am type-1 diabetic and cannot get by with out insulin) and when I called pharmacy they said my prescriptions were expired.I tried to get prescription refill through calls and after no use I stopped by at the office and talked to the receptionist.The receptionist at front desk was really helpful and said the prescription should be ready be end of the day.After 1 day the pharmacy still not received the prescription and when I call the Nurse number, it just goes to VM or the call is kept holding all the time.I had to skip work again drive to office and receptionist listened to me patiently and asked what I need and worked with the Nurse.She was also able to get me samples to get by for time being and said since Dr was out of office the Nurse could not refill my prescription on time.Wow !!!! that was nice but I wish the nurse has the courtesy to just give me a call back and explain the situation.I am happy with the Dr and receptionist but I think the nurses need to improve and be more helpful to patients in emergency situations at least.My rating:Dr Ravi Dhwale 5 starsReceptionist 5 starsNurse 1 starI am rating it 2 starts because of multiple office trips for my prescription refills.Korby, Gordon Jaysweetanniedetroit ratedTHE PROPER OFFICE NUMBER IS (614)762-7312 .  I am very happy with the level of care I get at this clinic.  I have spastic diplegia Cerebral Palsy, spinal stenosis, a bulging disc and arthritis,and have worked with other clinics in the past.  At the other clinics, I would go in, sit for an hour or two (very painful with my aforementioned issues)and then be handed my prescriptions,AFTER  I paid an office copay of fifty dollars regardless of the fact that I never even went back to an examined room, much less be seen by a doctor or nurse.  Here, I am asked comprehensive questions about the effectiveness of my current treatment, my ability to attend to self care, and basic quality of life.  The staff here seems to really understand that my goal isn't to procure medication, but to live as full and satisfying a life despite my diagnosis.  In addition to medication, I am given prescriptions for PT, and other treatments,such as using heat and/or cold,are discussed. I am given a drug test every visit (all patients are) which comforts me in knowing we are all being monitored for proper med use.  I am very comfortable here, and after fifteen years, I am walking better since become a patient in January 2015.Smith Jr, Stephen P, MDLisa G. ratedI had my eyelids and jawline done with Dr. Smith about a month ago.  My brother had referred me to his office.  He is a physician and his daughter was a patient of Dr. Smith’s.  Dr. Smith was the only doctor I had a consult with because he was extremely professional, warm, and accommodating.  His office is well-run and everything is perfect.  So far, I am thrilled with my results.  The process was exactly as he had predicted.  Everyone was available to me if I had questions or concerns.  I had very minimal pain and an uneventful recovery.  I recovered quickly and even a little earlier than anticipated.  I will recommend Dr. Smith to absolutely everybody.  It is a marvelous office and if you’re interested in having any type of facial surgery, he does a fabulous job.  Smith Jr, Stephen P, MDMandy B. ratedI saw Dr. Smith for a rhinoplasty on December 23rd.  Another doctor recommended Dr. Smith to my father.  I decided to have the rhinoplasty because my nose was not completely straight.  I was also having a lot of problems breathing; one of my nasal passages was 99% blocked.  Dr. Smith is very educated and nice.  You can tell he loves what he’s doing.  I love my results so far.  I can breath now.  It’s also nice to have a beautiful, perfect nose.  During the recovery, I was expecting more pain, but everything went smooth.  I recommend Dr. Smith’s rhinoplasty to anyone with breathing problems.Schwartz, Norman A, MDJennifer D. ratedDr. Norman Schwartz is, by far, the BEST doctor I have ever come in contact with!!! My husband and I both see him. We both feel comfortable with him, he cares about his patients, but is also down-to, earth and easy to talk to!!! He is NOT one of those doctors that breezes in and out of the room in ten seconds, leaving you with unanswered questions/concerns. Over the past month, my husband has had a few issues with his diabetes and the levels of several vitamins. Dr. Schwartz took the time to text and call to check on him on 3 separate occasions!!! He is an excellent physician!!!Samuel, Milroy J, MDTom L. ratedMy wife was pregnant with our 3rd child and I lost my job. My doctor that I had been going to before Dr Milroy Samuel, told me that I had to pay $4000 cash or he wouldn't see us. We had only 3 weeks left in the pregnancy and we were desperate!  I was unemployed and we were expected to pay $4000?!!  We called 30 different obgyn's and only one would see us and that was Dr Samuel!  His office has a patient assistance program that no other office has.  Dr Milroy delivered our baby a week after we joined his practice!  We would and do recommend him to our church family and friends. Smith Jr, Stephen P, MDEddie A. ratedDr. Smith performed my rhinoplasty a few weeks ago.  I found him by doing some online research and through Google.  I needed to do this procedure quickly, since I only had like three weeks before I was coming back to Japan, as I’m in the navy..  Dr. Smith will show you a picture of how he wants to do your nose, so you know exactly what will be done in the surgery.  I am really in love with what he did.  I look the same, but the changes Dr. Smith did are just awesome.  Nobody can tell the difference.  I’m really happy wish the outcome of my rhinoplasty with Dr. Smith.OhioHealth Neurological Physicians: Dr. Gregory Balturshot, MDAnn S. ratedI am 84 years old and had many concerns about surgery, however I could not continue with my pain level that was so severe. Dr. Balturshot settled my concerns and worries on my 1st meeting with him. It has been 3 weeks since my back surgery and my pain level is 0-1. I cannot thank Dr. Balturshot enough for helping me. He has treated me with such kindness and compassion. The long wait was at the Portsmouth office where he just started seeing patients - thankful for office visit close to home.Cole-Sedivy, Deborah L, MDsusanoh ratedIf anyone is looking for a great place for a microderm and chemical peel, Monarch Health is the place to go.  I purchased a groupon and found Dr. Cole-Sedivy.  Her staff is very friendly and very well informed on the lastes and up to date cosmetic procedures.  they got me started on the Obagi product line and love the results.  They offer many seminars and patient gatherings throughout the year.  Those are great to network and hear about other patient information.  A great experience.Smith Jr, Stephen P, MDEvelyn W. ratedAbout three or four months ago, I had a rhinoplasty with Dr. Smith.  This was in February.  Another doctor referred us to Dr. Smith’s office.  He is nice, calm, and knows what he is doing.  I am very pleased with my results so far.  The best part has to be that my nose is more symmetrical and even feels better  after I had the little bump taken off the top.  I have already recommended other people to Dr. Smith; my aunt has actually come in and had some things done.  Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.

Tim Nash | Development Coach, Consultant, Change Agent  — The Path To Peak Performance



























 



















 













 
ABOUT






Welcome to Timothy P. Nash Development Coaching & Consulting!
You’ve come to the hub of my company and newsletter The Path To Peak Performance.
What do you need for your Peak Performance?

Increase your personal impact?
Improve the trust and collaboration in your team?
Embed a Change in your organization?

Whatever your specific goal or challenge, I believe that raising awareness is the key to unfreezing old or negative patterns in a system for a new, healthier one (self/group/org).
Using a powerful mix of tools and methods, I work alongside you to create a clear picture of A). where you are right now and B). how you wish to move forward.  Together we identify and develop strategies to achieve your desired results.
It is my mission to help you, your team or your organization TAKE ACTION FOR LASTING CHANGE.
In the words of British Olympian Reg Revans, “there can be no learning without action, no action without learning”.
To get a feeling for how I think, watch this short clip below:

With 23 years’ working experience in Financial Services, Tourism, Education, Sales, the Media and People & Org’l Development, I’ve experienced what it takes to lead and collaborate across cultures (national & org’l).  This provides me valuable insight into the complexities of the modern workplace.  More importantly, it helps me connect to your unique situation.
I’m a Gestalt Practitioner in Organizations and serve on the Board of Directors of ODN Europe.  I was born in Los Angeles, California in 1971.  In 1994 I graduated cum laude with a BA in History & Business Administration.
For more professional details, see my LinkedIn Profile.  If you’re curious about why I do what I do or how I got here, see My Story & Lessons Learned.
Based in Munich, Germany since 2001, I speak native English, proficient German and basic Japanese.
Drop me a note and let’s start a dialogue about what you need!
