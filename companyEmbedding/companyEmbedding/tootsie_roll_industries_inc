History[edit]
In 1896 Leo Hirshfield, an Austrian immigrant to the United States, began work at a small candy shop located in New York City owned by the Stern & Staalberg firm.[3] In 1907, Hirshfield decided he wanted a chocolate-tasting candy that would not melt in the heat, and that would be an economical artificial alternative to traditional chocolates.[citation needed] He named the candy after the nickname of his daughter, Clara "Tootsie" Hirshfield.[4][3] By this point, the company had expanded to a five-story factory. In 1917 the name of the company was changed to The Sweets Company of America. The business, which had forced Hirshfield out by this point (leading to his eventual suicide), became a listed company in 1922. In 1931 the Tootsie Pop — a hard-candy lollipop with Tootsie Roll filling — was invented, and quickly became popular with Dust Bowl refugees during the Depression era because of its low price. During World War II, Tootsie Rolls became a standard part of American soldiers' field rations, due to the hardiness of the candy under a variety of environmental conditions.[3]
In 1935, the company was in serious difficulty. Its principal supplier of paper boxes, Joseph Rubin & Sons of Brooklyn — concerned about the possible loss of an important customer — became interested in the possibility of acquiring control. The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but Bernard D. Rubin acquired a list of shareholders and approached them in person in order to purchase their shares. The Rubins eventually achieved control and agreed that Bernard would run the company as president. Mr. Rubin was able to steadily increase sales and restore profits, changing the formula of the Tootsie Roll and increasing its size, moving from Manhattan to a much larger plant in Hoboken, New Jersey, and guiding the company successfully through the difficult war years when vital raw materials were in short supply. When he died in 1948 he had increased the sales volume twelvefold. After his death, his brother William B. Rubin became president and remained president until 1962.
In 1962, William's daughter, Ellen Rubin Gordon, took control, and as of January 2015, is Chairman and CEO of the company.[2] For many years prior to his death, her husband, Melvin Gordon, was Chairman and CEO from 1962 to 2015.[1]
In 1966, the company adopted its current name of "Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc."[5][6][7]
The company has acquired several famous brands of confections such as The Candy Corporation of America's Mason Division (1972), Cella's Confections (1985), The Charms Company (1988), Warner-Lambert's candy division (1993; excluding gum and mints), Andes Candies (2000), and Concord Confections (2004).
Facilities[edit]
The company's headquarters are located on the South side of Chicago, in a portion of the former Dodge Chicago Plant. The company has a factory in Mexico City where they produce Tootsie Pops and other candy products for the Mexican market as well as for exports to the U.S. and Canada.[citation needed] There is also a candy factory in the Area 4 neighborhood of Cambridge, Massachusetts (belonging to the subsidiary "Cambridge Brands").[8]

History[edit]
In 1896 Leo Hirshfield, an Austrian immigrant to the United States, began work at a small candy shop located in New York City owned by the Stern & Staalberg firm.[3] In 1907, Hirshfield decided he wanted a chocolate-tasting candy that would not melt in the heat, and that would be an economical artificial alternative to traditional chocolates.[citation needed] He named the candy after the nickname of his daughter, Clara "Tootsie" Hirshfield.[4][3] By this point, the company had expanded to a five-story factory. In 1917 the name of the company was changed to The Sweets Company of America. The business, which had forced Hirshfield out by this point (leading to his eventual suicide), became a listed company in 1922. In 1931 the Tootsie Pop — a hard-candy lollipop with Tootsie Roll filling — was invented, and quickly became popular with Dust Bowl refugees during the Depression era because of its low price. During World War II, Tootsie Rolls became a standard part of American soldiers' field rations, due to the hardiness of the candy under a variety of environmental conditions.[3]
In 1935, the company was in serious difficulty. Its principal supplier of paper boxes, Joseph Rubin & Sons of Brooklyn — concerned about the possible loss of an important customer — became interested in the possibility of acquiring control. The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but Bernard D. Rubin acquired a list of shareholders and approached them in person in order to purchase their shares. The Rubins eventually achieved control and agreed that Bernard would run the company as president. Mr. Rubin was able to steadily increase sales and restore profits, changing the formula of the Tootsie Roll and increasing its size, moving from Manhattan to a much larger plant in Hoboken, New Jersey, and guiding the company successfully through the difficult war years when vital raw materials were in short supply. When he died in 1948 he had increased the sales volume twelvefold. After his death, his brother William B. Rubin became president and remained president until 1962.
In 1962, William's daughter, Ellen Rubin Gordon, took control, and as of January 2015, is Chairman and CEO of the company.[2] For many years prior to his death, her husband, Melvin Gordon, was Chairman and CEO from 1962 to 2015.[1]
In 1966, the company adopted its current name of "Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc."[5][6][7]
The company has acquired several famous brands of confections such as The Candy Corporation of America's Mason Division (1972), Cella's Confections (1985), The Charms Company (1988), Warner-Lambert's candy division (1993; excluding gum and mints), Andes Candies (2000), and Concord Confections (2004).
Facilities[edit]
The company's headquarters are located on the South side of Chicago, in a portion of the former Dodge Chicago Plant. The company has a factory in Mexico City where they produce Tootsie Pops and other candy products for the Mexican market as well as for exports to the U.S. and Canada.[citation needed] There is also a candy factory in the Area 4 neighborhood of Cambridge, Massachusetts (belonging to the subsidiary "Cambridge Brands").[8]

Tootsie Roll Industries (TR): A Dividend King With a Safe Payout and Iconic Brands



Simply Safe Dividends

July 26th, 2017|Dividend Aristocrats|  Print Article

Dividend kings, stocks with 50+ consecutive years of dividend growth, are a rare and prized collection of generally low risk income growth investments.
 
Many of these companies have established leadership positions in the markets they serve through some combination of economies of scale, intellectual property, and customer relationships.
 
In the case of Tootsie Roll (TR), the company has increased its dividend for 51 consecutive years thanks largely to its portfolio of popular candy brands.
 
Given Warren Buffett’s affection for popular food brands in his dividend portfolio here, let’s take a closer look at Tootsie Roll to see if this dividend king could be an appealing long-term investment.
 
Business Overview
Founded in 1896 by Leo Hirschfield in Chicago, Illinois, Tootsie Roll is the maker of famous candy brands as Tootsie Roll, Tootsie Pops, Child’s Play, Caramel Apple Pops, Charms, Blow-Pop, Junior Mints, Charleston Chew, Sugar Daddy, Sugar Babies, Andes, Razzles, and Dubble Bubble.

It sells its products primarily through 30 candy and grocery brokers to over 4,000 supermarkets, variety stores, dollar stores, chain grocers, and drug chains in the US, as well as numerous outlets in Canada and Mexico, which are its largest foreign markets.
 
The company also sells in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, but the US is its largest market, accounting for roughly 92% of total product revenue.
 
Business Analysis
Tootsie Roll’s large portfolio of well-known brands generally means that its sales are steady in all types of economic environments, which is important for a company that has become famous for clockwork-like annual dividend increases.
 
That being said, like most food companies, Tootsie Roll isn’t a fast-growing company. In fact, sales peaked in 2012 and have been gradually declining ever since.
 
Source: Simply Safe Dividends
 
Fortunately, management has proven effective at maximizing the company’s economies of scale and cutting costs in recent years.
 
In fact, thanks to its specialized, high-speed equipment, and highly automated manufacturing facilities, the company has been able to generate steady improvements in margins and returns on shareholder capital.
 
This is courtesy of the company launching its “enterprise resource planning” system, or ERP, in 2011. This corporate turnaround plan was based on using advanced analytics to help managers streamline and maximize the flexibility of the company’s manufacturing systems and supply chain.
 

 
In fact, today Tootsie Roll enjoys some of the industry’s highest profitability.
 
Sources: Morningstar, and Gurufocus
 
Going forward the company has four opportunities to stabilize and return to moderate sales growth.  The first is launching new product lines such as Cella Dips (chocolate covered whole dried cherries) and caramel marshmallow Sugar Babies.
 
The second is increased distributions of existing products, especially in emerging markets such as India and China, where a fast-growing middle class could fuel a large increase in per capita candy consumption.
 
Third, the company is revamping its advertising budget away from more traditional routes, such as TV and print, and towards a greater focus on social media, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.
 
This shift is intended to increase its brand awareness and popularity with Millennials and America’s youth market.
 
And finally, the company can continue to grow through acquisitions as it has over the past 120 years, when it purchased such well-known brands as Andes, Dubble Bubble, Junior Mints, and Dots.
 
Key Risks
While Tootsie Roll’s status as a dividend king is worthy of respect, there are nonetheless several major risks to owning this stock.
 
The most obvious is that, while the company’s ability to boost its margins over time with increasing use of automation and cost cutting is impressive, there are limits to how how high margins can go, especially given that its key ingredients (such as sugar and coco) are highly cyclical commodities.
 
Which means that at some point Tootsie Roll’s dividend growth prospects will slow unless it can turnaround its declining sales.
 
Unfortunately, the US, its largest and most important market, is largely saturated, meaning that organic sales growth potential is pretty much limited to matching 1% to 2% population growth.
 
However, that may not prove the case if shifting consumer sentiment, specifically away from high sugar snacks, results in weaker future candy sales.
 
And while foreign markets can serve as a good potential source of growth, remember that the global candy industry is massively competitive, dominated by giants such as Hershey’s (HSY), Mondelez International (MDLZ), and Nestle (NSRGY).
 
These well-capitalized rivals are potentially able to better compete in faster-growing emerging markets with advertising budgets orders of magnitude larger than Tootsie Roll’s, as well as potentially better knowledge of local tastes.
 
That means that the company’s best bet to achieve stronger top line sales growth is through acquisitions, which always come at the risk of overpaying and underperforming on execution (i.e. failing to achieve expected synergies).
 
Finally, anyone interested in Tootsie Roll should know that the company, although public since 1922, is effectively a private company, under the total control of the Gordon family, including the current chairwoman and CEO, 85-year-old Ellen Gordon.
 
Source: Tootsie Roll Annual Report
 
Ms. Gordon took over control of the company from Melvin Gordon in 2015, upon the death of the 95-year-old CEO who had run the company for over 50 years.
 
Normally strong insider ownership is a good thing, as is very long management tenure, because it aligns the incentives of management with those of shareholders and means that executives have plenty of experience in achieving steady growth.
 
However, in this case, Tootsie Roll, due to its dual class share system, is entirely under the control of the Gordon family. This is because Ms. Gordon’s father, William Rubin, took over a large controlling interest in Sweets Company of America (Tootsie Roll’s precursor) in the 1930’s after the death of its founder.
 
Source: Motley Fool
 
Which means that today, Ellen Gordon controls 79% of the voting rights in Tootsie Roll, giving her absolute say in all corporate policies, thanks to her almost exclusive ownership of the company’s class B shares which have 10 times the voting rights of common stock. These shares were created in the 1980’s to ensure the couple’s lock on power.
 
Critics of the Gordons, including shareholders who have periodically sued management over the years, claim that the Gordon’s have abused this absolute power by paying themselves lavishly in both salary and benefits.
 
For example, in 2012 Mr. and Mrs. Gordon were paid $7.6 million in salary, made use of the company jet for private reasons (flying between their primary home in Massachusetts and Chicago) to the tune of $1.2 million, and had the company pay for their $10,500 per month Chicago apartment, where they stayed part time when working from the corporate headquarters.
 
All told, that meant that the couple’s compensation  was $8.9 million, 1.6% of the company’s total revenue that year.
 
In addition, Ms. Gordon isn’t a big fan of transparency, and as a result the company doesn’t do conference calls, issue guidance of any kind, or even have an investor relations page.
 
In other words, anyone owning shares of Tootsie Roll has to accept the fact that they are completely at the mercy of non-transparent management, who can do almost anything it wants, as well as pay itself whatever it likes (top five executives were paid $12.1 million in 2015, or 2.3% of revenue).
 
Tootsie Roll Dividend Safety
We analyze 25+ years of dividend data and 10+ years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend.
 
Our Dividend Safety Score answers the question, “Is the current dividend payment safe?” We look at some of the most important financial factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios, debt levels, free cash flow generation, industry cyclicality, ROIC trends, and more.
 
Dividend Safety Scores range from 0 to 100, and conservative dividend investors should stick with firms that score at least 60. Since tracking the data, companies cutting their dividends had an average Dividend Safety Score below 20 at the time of their dividend reduction announcements.
 

 
We wrote a detailed analysis reviewing how Dividend Safety Scores are calculated, what their real-time track record has been, and how to use them for your portfolio here.
 
Tootsie Roll has a Dividend Safety Score of 99, which suggests that the company offers one of the safest and most dependable dividends on Wall Street.
 
That’s not surprising given its 51-year payout growth history.
 
In fact, Tootsie Roll has paid an uninterrupted quarterly dividend for 77 years and has also paid an annual 3% annual stock dividend for the past half century.
 
This kind of steady performance and high dividend security is due to three main factors.
 
The first being that food companies in general have very stable (if slow growing) sales, earnings, and cash flows. After all, even during recessions people need to eat, and candy is a low cost indulgence that generally isn’t highly cyclical.
 
Next, management has been very conservative with the company’s dividend growth, maintaining very low EPS and free cash flow payout ratios below 40% most years.
 


 
With the annual cash dividend consuming only about 30% of any year’s EPS and about 25% of free cash flow, the payout is extremely well insulated against any unexpected negative events, such as a sharp spike in commodity prices or currency swings which would ding earnings.
 
Finally, we can’t forget the importance of a strong balance sheet, which offers the company plenty of flexibility to both invest in future growth, as well as continue rewarding investors with the steady payout growth for which Tootsie Roll is famous.
 
As you can see, Tootsie Roll’s enjoys a pristine, fortress-like balance sheet with no debt, a substantial cash position (enough to cover nearly seven years of dividends), and one of the strongest current ratios (short-term assets/short-term liabilities) not just in the industry, but of any company on Wall Street.
 

 
In fact, when we compare Tootsie Roll’s metrics against its industry peers, things look even better.
 
Sources: Morningstar, Fast Graphs, Simply Safe Dividends
 
That’s because this is a highly capital intensive industry, generally marked by a very high leverage ratio (Debt/EBITDA) and low current ratios.
 
In contrast, Tootsie Roll’s lack of debt and high current ratio mean that, if it were ever to issue bonds (such as to make a large acquisition), it would likely receive a high investment-grade rating that would allow it plentiful access to very cheap growth capital.
 
Tootsie Roll’s Dividend Growth
Our Dividend Growth Score answers the question, “How fast is the dividend likely to grow?” It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth-centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios. Scores of 50 are average, 75 or higher is very good, and 25 or lower is considered weak.
 
Tootsie Roll’s Dividend Growth Score of 75 indicates that it has above average dividend growth potential. However, that’s largely due to its low payout ratios and not necessarily because of a history of fast dividend growth.
 

 
Going forward Tootsie Roll should be capable of 1% to 2% organic sales growth, which it can boost to 2% to 3% through acquisitions.
 
Combined with ongoing margin expansion from cost cutting and larger of economies of scale, as well as steady 1% to 2% net share buybacks (2.4% annually over the past 5 years), Tootsie Roll might be able to generate long-term EPS growth of 5% to 7%.
 
And because its payout ratios are so low, Tootsie Roll could provide dividend investors with somewhat faster payout growth, should management want to, along the lines of 6% to 8% over the coming years.
 
Of course, this is merely the company’s potential earnings and dividend outlook. Whether or not Tootsie Roll manages to achieve it depends on stabilizing its declining sales, returning to top line growth, and rational decision-making from the management team. If sales continue declining, than shareholders should only expect 4% to 6% payout growth going forward.
 
Valuation
Over the past year Tootsie Roll has underperformed the S&P 500 by about 15%. However, that doesn’t mean its valuation is attractive. In fact, the stock’s valuation appears quite rich.
 
For example, TR’s forward P/E ratio is 36.5, more than double the S&P 500’s 17.8. It’s also much higher than its industry peers, who have a median forward P/E ratio of 20.2.
 
And while Tootsie Roll has never been especially cheap (over the past 13 years its median forward P/E ratio was 30.5), today’s valuation looks especially stretched.
 
In other words, while Tootsie Roll’s industry leading profitability and impressive dividend growth record mean it probably deserves a market premium, today’s share price represents an 81% premium to its rivals, which is probably not warranted given its slow growth potential.
 
Meanwhile, the current cash yield of 1%, while in line with its historic 1% yield over the past 22 years, is only about half that of the broader S&P 500, which yields 1.9%.
 
In addition, it’s far below the industry median yield of 1.9%. In other words, Tootsie Roll’s low payout doesn’t offer investors much, especially considering that the company isn’t exactly experiencing fast earnings growth.
 
Now in fairness, the company’s annual 3% stock dividend does mean that investors can probably achieve long-term total returns of 9% to 11% (4% total yield + 5% to 7% potential earnings growth) with 9% to 10% being the more likely conservative estimate.
 
While that may be decent total return potential, especially for a dividend king, the fact remains that TR’s forward P/E ratio carries significant risk, especially when combined with some of the company’s questionable management practices.
 
Conclusion
While there is a lot to like about Tootsie Roll, at the same time the company has major issues it needs to deal with, most notably its weakening top line and potential succession issues when Ms. Gordon becomes unable to fulfill her duties.
 
When combined with a very low cash yield (unlike some of the best high dividend stocks here), modest payout growth prospects that make it a weaker income growth stock, and a potentially frightening valuation, I simply can’t recommend Tootsie Roll for any diversified dividend portfolio.
 
That’s especially true when there are far better dividend aristocrat alternatives, which offer more yield, stronger long-term dividend growth potential, and more appealing valuations.

Very good article and I couldn’t agree more. I would personally find it very difficult to invest in a company where Senior Management takes the kind of perks they do here. Keep up the good work Brian.

Thanks for reading, Doug. TR certainly has some unique corporate governance concerns.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  This financial review discusses the Company's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources and other matters. Dollars are presented in thousands, except per share amounts. This review should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this Form 10-Q and with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 (the "2016 Form 10-K").  Net product sales were $103,425 in first quarter 2017 compared to $103,362 in first quarter 2016, an increase of $63 or 0.1%. The timing of sales to certain customers as well as currency translation of foreign sales had some adverse impact on first quarter 2017 sales compared to the prior year first quarter period.  Product cost of goods sold were $65,416 in first quarter 2017 compared to $65,824 in first quarter 2016. Product cost of goods sold includes $787 and $13 of certain deferred compensation expenses in first quarter 2017 and 2016, respectively. These deferred compensation expenses principally result from the changes in the market value of investments and investment income from trading securities relating to compensation deferred in previous years and are not reflective of current operating results. Adjusting for the aforementioned, product cost of goods sold decreased from $65,811 in first quarter 2016 to $64,629 in first quarter 2017, a decrease of $1,182 or 1.8%. As a percentage of net product sales, adjusted product cost of goods sold was 62.5% and 63.7% in first quarter 2017 and 2016, respectively, a favorable decrease of 1.2%. Adjusted cost of goods sold as a percent of sales benefited from continuing improvements in manufacturing operations driven by capital improvements and ongoing cost containment programs. However, adjusted costs of goods sold in prior year first quarter 2016 were adversely affected by higher manufacturing costs to comply with changes to new product labeling requirements, including the adverse effects of lower production volumes and inventory reductions which resulted in reduced efficiencies during first quarter 2016. The inventory reductions were in response to uncertainties surrounding certain changes in state and national labeling regulations as well as other new labeling requirements which had specific compliance dates.  Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were $26,598 in first quarter 2017 compared to $24,053 in first quarter 2016. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses includes $2,095 and $40 of certain deferred compensation expenses in first quarter 2017 and 2016, respectively. As discussed above, these expenses principally result from changes in the market value of investments and investment income from trading securities relating to compensation deferred in previous years, and are not reflective of current operating results. Adjusting for the aforementioned, selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased from $24,013 in first quarter 2016 to $24,503 in first quarter 2017, an increase of $490 or 2.0%. As a percentage of net product sales, adjusted selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased from 23.2% in first quarter 2016 to 23.7% in 2017, an unfavorable increase of 0.5% as a percent of net sales. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses include $9,668 and $9,186 for freight, delivery and warehousing expenses in first quarter 2017 and 2016, respectively. These expenses were 9.3% and 8.9% of net product sales in first quarter 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Earnings from operations were $12,175 in first quarter 2017 compared to $14,216 in first quarter 2016. Earnings from operations include $2,882 and $53 of certain deferred compensation expenses in first quarter 2017 and 2016, respectively, which are discussed above. Adjusting for these deferred compensation costs and expenses, operating earnings were $15,057 and $14,269 in first quarter 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $788 or 5.5%. As a percentage of net product sales, these adjusted operating earnings were 14.6% and 13.8% in first quarter 2017 and 2016, respectively, a favorable increase of 0.8% as a percentage of net product sales. This increase as a percentage of net product sales principally reflects the benefits of improved plant operating efficiencies in first quarter 2017 when compared to the adverse effects of additional costs and operational inefficiencies incurred in first quarter 2016 to the uncertainties of product labeling laws in that period. Management believes the presentation in this and the preceding paragraphs relating to amounts adjusted for deferred compensation expense are more reflective of the underlying operations of the Company.  Table of Contents  Other income (loss), net was $1,979 in first quarter 2017 compared to $(35) in first quarter 2016, a favorable increase of $2,014. Other income (loss), net for first quarter 2017 and 2016 includes net gains and investment income of $2,882 and $53, respectively, on trading securities which provide an economic hedge of the Company's deferred compensation liabilities. These changes in trading securities were substantially offset by a like amount of deferred compensation expense or credit included in product cost of goods sold and selling, marketing, and administrative expenses in the respective periods as discussed above. Other income (loss), net includes losses on foreign exchange of $1,545 and $634 in first quarter 2017 and 2016, respectively.  The consolidated effective tax rates were 29.3% and 30.5% in first quarter 2017 and 2016, respectively. The lower effective tax rate in first quarter 2017 compared to first quarter 2016 principally reflects a lower effective state income tax rate, including a benefit relating to a state income tax carry-forward.  Net earnings attributable to Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc. were $10,051 (after $40 net loss attributed to non-controlling interests) in first quarter 2017 compared to $9,896 (after $40 net loss attributed to non-controlling interests) in first quarter 2016, and earnings per share were $0.16 and $0.15 in first quarter 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $0.01 per share, or 7%. Higher net earnings for first quarter 2017 were principally the result of higher earnings from operations after adjusting for the effects of certain deferred compensation and a lower effective state income tax rate as discussed above. Earnings per share attributable to Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc. for first quarter 2017 did benefit from the reduction in average shares outstanding resulting from purchases in the open market by the Company of its common stock. Average shares outstanding decreased from 64,347 in first quarter 2016 to 63,605 in first quarter 2017.  Goodwill and intangibles are assessed annually as of December 31 or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable from future cash flows. The Company has not identified any triggering events, as defined, or other adverse information that would indicate a material impairment of its goodwill or intangibles in first quarter 2017. There were also no impairments in the comparative first quarter 2016 period or calendar 2016.  Beginning in 2012, the Company received periodic notices from the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union Pension Plan (Plan), a multi-employer defined benefit pension plan for certain Company union employees, that the Plan's actuary certified the Plan to be in "critical status", the "Red Zone", as defined by the Pension Protection Act (PPA) and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), and that a plan of rehabilitation was adopted by the trustees of the Plan in 2012 (and was further amended in 2016). During 2015, the Company received notices that the Plan's status was changed to "critical and declining status", as defined by the PPA and PBGC, for the plan year beginning January 1, 2015, and that the Plan was projected to have an accumulated funding deficiency for the 2017 through 2024 plan years. A designation of "critical and declining status" implies that the Plan is expected to become insolvent in the next 20 years. In April 2017, the Company received new notices that the Plan remains in "critical and declining status" and is projected to become insolvent in 13 years. These notices also advise that the Plan trustees are considering the reduction or elimination of certain retirement benefits and may seek assistance from the PBGC.  Based on these updated notices, the Plan's funded percentages (plan investment assets as a percentage of plan liabilities), as defined, were 57.0%, 62.8% and 65.1% as of January 1, 2016 (most recent valuation date available), 2015, and 2014, respectively (these valuation dates are as of the beginning of each Plan year). These funded percentages are based on actuarial values, as defined, and do not reflect the actual market value of Plan investments as of these dates. If the market value of investments had been used as of January 1, 2016, the funded percentage would be 53.0% (not 57.0%). As of the January 1, 2016 valuation date (most recent valuation available), 20% of Plan participants were current active employees, 51% were retired or separated from service and receiving benefits, and 29% were retired or separated from service and entitled to future benefits. The number of current active employee Plan participants as of January 1, 2016 fell 2% from the previous year and 4% over the past two years. When compared to the Plan valuation date of January 1, 2011 (five years earlier), current active employees participants have declined 31%, whereas participants who were retired or separated from service and receiving benefits increased 6% and participants who were retired or separated from service and entitled to future benefits increased 8%. The bankruptcy of a major participating employer in the Plan contributed to the above discussed Plan results.  The Company has been advised that its withdrawal liability would have been $72,700, $61,000 and $56,400 if it had withdrawn from the Plan during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase from 2015 to 2016 principally reflects poor investment returns of the plan in 2015, a decrease in the PBGC interest rates, and a higher share of the  Table of Contents  Plan's unfunded vested benefits allocated to the Company. Based on the above, including the Plan's projected insolvency in 13 years, management believes that the Company's withdrawal liability will likely increase further in future years. Based on the Company's actuarial study and certain provisions in ERISA and the law relating to withdrawal liability payments, management believes that the Company's liability would likely be limited to twenty annual payments of $2,914 which have a present value in the range of $34,200 to $44,700. The aforementioned is based on a range of valuation interest rates which management understands is provided under the statute. Should the Company actually withdraw from the Plan at a future date, a withdrawal liability, which could be higher than the above discussed amounts, could be payable to the Plan.  The Company's existing labor contract with the local union commits the Company's participation in this Plan through third quarter 2017. The amended rehabilitation plan, which continues, requires that employer contributions include 5% compounded annual surcharge increases each year for an unspecified period of time beginning in 2012 as well as certain plan benefit reductions. The Company's pension expense for this Plan for calendar years 2016 and 2015 was $2,541 and $2,574, respectively. The aforementioned expense includes surcharges of $542 and $447 in calendar years 2016 and 2015, respectively, as required under the plan of rehabilitation as amended. The Company's pension expense for this Plan for first quarter 2017 and 2016 was $495 and $499 respectively, which includes surcharges of $124 and $106 respectively.  The Company is currently unable to determine the ultimate outcome of the above discussed matter and therefore, is unable to determine the effects on its consolidated financial statements, but the ultimate outcome or the effects of any modifications to the current rehabilitation plan could be material to its consolidated results of operations or cash flows in one or more future periods. See also the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's 2016 Form 10-K.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Net cash flows provided by operating activities were $11,862 and $14,980 in first quarter 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $3,118. The decrease in first quarter 2017 cash flows from operating activities principally reflects the timing of sales and collections of account receivables as well as the effects of higher inventories reflecting changes in the annual production plans in the comparative periods.  Net cash used in investing activities was $32,458 in first quarter 2017 compared to $28,724 in first quarter 2016. Cash flows from investing activities reflect $27,227 and $23,348 of purchases of available for sale securities during first quarter 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $1,759 and $4,871 of sales and maturities of available for sale securities during first quarter 2017 and 2016, respectively. First quarter 2017 and 2016 investing activities include capital expenditures of $4,845 and $8,376, respectively. All capital expenditures in 2017 are expected to be funded from the Company's cash flow from operations and internal sources. In addition, Company management has committed approximately $15,000 to a manufacturing plant rehabilitation upgrade and expansion of one of its manufacturing facilities in the U.S.A. Management anticipates capital outlays for this project to be $5,000 in 2017, $9,000 in 2018 and $1,000 in 2019.  The Company's consolidated financial statements include bank borrowings of $330 and $853 at March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, all of which relates to its two majority-owned and controlled Spanish companies. The Company had no other outstanding bank borrowings at March 31, 2017.  Financing activities include Company common stock purchases and retirements of $9,985 and $6,576 in first quarter 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cash dividends of $11,128 and $10,943 were paid in first quarter 2017 and 2016, respectively.  The Company's current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) was 4.5 to 1 at March 31, 2017 compared to 4.7 to 1 at December 31, 2016 and 4.3 to 1 at March 31, 2016. Net working capital was $202,749 at March 31, 2017 compared to $235,739 and $195,504 at December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively.  The aforementioned net working capital amounts are principally reflected in aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $145,557 at March 31, 2017 compared to $186,658 and $133,807 at December 31, 2016  Table of Contents  and March 31, 2016, respectively. In addition, long term investments, principally debt securities comprising corporate and municipal bonds were $195,312 at March 31, 2017, as compared to $164,665 and $176,483 at December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively. Aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments were $340,869, $351,323, and $310,290, at March 31, 2017, December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively. The aforementioned includes $73,025, $67,995, and $62,509 at March 31, 2017, December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively, relating to trading securities which are used as an economic hedge for the Company's deferred compensation liabilities. Investments in corporate and municipal bonds, variable rate demand notes, and other debt securities that matured during first quarter 2017 and 2016 were generally used to purchase the Company's common stock or were replaced with debt securities of similar maturities.  The Company periodically contributes to a VEBA trust, managed and controlled by the Company, to fund the estimated future costs of certain employee health, welfare and other benefits. The Company is currently using these VEBA funds to pay the actual cost of such benefits through a portion of 2017. The VEBA trust held $1,855, $3,027 and $5,216 of aggregate cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2017, December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016, respectively. This asset value is included in prepaid expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. These assets are categorized as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. The Company is planning to make a contribution to this VEBA in the range of $10,000 to $15,000 in fourth quarter 2017. This contribution would result in the prepayment of these employee benefits.  ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  See Note 1 of the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.

Tootsie Roll Industries (TR): A Dividend King With a Safe Payout and Iconic Brands



Simply Safe Dividends

July 26th, 2017|Dividend Aristocrats|  Print Article

Dividend kings, stocks with 50+ consecutive years of dividend growth, are a rare and prized collection of generally low risk income growth investments.
 
Many of these companies have established leadership positions in the markets they serve through some combination of economies of scale, intellectual property, and customer relationships.
 
In the case of Tootsie Roll (TR), the company has increased its dividend for 51 consecutive years thanks largely to its portfolio of popular candy brands.
 
Given Warren Buffett’s affection for popular food brands in his dividend portfolio here, let’s take a closer look at Tootsie Roll to see if this dividend king could be an appealing long-term investment.
 
Business Overview
Founded in 1896 by Leo Hirschfield in Chicago, Illinois, Tootsie Roll is the maker of famous candy brands as Tootsie Roll, Tootsie Pops, Child’s Play, Caramel Apple Pops, Charms, Blow-Pop, Junior Mints, Charleston Chew, Sugar Daddy, Sugar Babies, Andes, Razzles, and Dubble Bubble.
 
Source: Tootsie Roll Annual Report
 
It sells its products primarily through 30 candy and grocery brokers to over 4,000 supermarkets, variety stores, dollar stores, chain grocers, and drug chains in the US, as well as numerous outlets in Canada and Mexico, which are its largest foreign markets.
 
The company also sells in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, but the US is its largest market, accounting for roughly 92% of total product revenue.
 
Business Analysis
Tootsie Roll’s large portfolio of well-known brands generally means that its sales are steady in all types of economic environments, which is important for a company that has become famous for clockwork-like annual dividend increases.
 
That being said, like most food companies, Tootsie Roll isn’t a fast-growing company. In fact, sales peaked in 2012 and have been gradually declining ever since.
 
Source: Simply Safe Dividends
 
Fortunately, management has proven effective at maximizing the company’s economies of scale and cutting costs in recent years.
 
In fact, thanks to its specialized, high-speed equipment, and highly automated manufacturing facilities, the company has been able to generate steady improvements in margins and returns on shareholder capital.
 
This is courtesy of the company launching its “enterprise resource planning” system, or ERP, in 2011. This corporate turnaround plan was based on using advanced analytics to help managers streamline and maximize the flexibility of the company’s manufacturing systems and supply chain.
 

 
In fact, today Tootsie Roll enjoys some of the industry’s highest profitability.
 
Sources: Morningstar, and Gurufocus
 
Going forward the company has four opportunities to stabilize and return to moderate sales growth.  The first is launching new product lines such as Cella Dips (chocolate covered whole dried cherries) and caramel marshmallow Sugar Babies.
 
The second is increased distributions of existing products, especially in emerging markets such as India and China, where a fast-growing middle class could fuel a large increase in per capita candy consumption.
 
Third, the company is revamping its advertising budget away from more traditional routes, such as TV and print, and towards a greater focus on social media, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.
 
This shift is intended to increase its brand awareness and popularity with Millennials and America’s youth market.
 
And finally, the company can continue to grow through acquisitions as it has over the past 120 years, when it purchased such well-known brands as Andes, Dubble Bubble, Junior Mints, and Dots.
 
Key Risks
While Tootsie Roll’s status as a dividend king is worthy of respect, there are nonetheless several major risks to owning this stock.
 
The most obvious is that, while the company’s ability to boost its margins over time with increasing use of automation and cost cutting is impressive, there are limits to how how high margins can go, especially given that its key ingredients (such as sugar and coco) are highly cyclical commodities.
 
Which means that at some point Tootsie Roll’s dividend growth prospects will slow unless it can turnaround its declining sales.
 
Unfortunately, the US, its largest and most important market, is largely saturated, meaning that organic sales growth potential is pretty much limited to matching 1% to 2% population growth.
 
However, that may not prove the case if shifting consumer sentiment, specifically away from high sugar snacks, results in weaker future candy sales.
 
And while foreign markets can serve as a good potential source of growth, remember that the global candy industry is massively competitive, dominated by giants such as Hershey’s (HSY), Mondelez International (MDLZ), and Nestle (NSRGY).
 
These well-capitalized rivals are potentially able to better compete in faster-growing emerging markets with advertising budgets orders of magnitude larger than Tootsie Roll’s, as well as potentially better knowledge of local tastes.
 
That means that the company’s best bet to achieve stronger top line sales growth is through acquisitions, which always come at the risk of overpaying and underperforming on execution (i.e. failing to achieve expected synergies).
 
Finally, anyone interested in Tootsie Roll should know that the company, although public since 1922, is effectively a private company, under the total control of the Gordon family, including the current chairwoman and CEO, 85-year-old Ellen Gordon.
 
Source: Tootsie Roll Annual Report
 
Ms. Gordon took over control of the company from Melvin Gordon in 2015, upon the death of the 95-year-old CEO who had run the company for over 50 years.
 
Normally strong insider ownership is a good thing, as is very long management tenure, because it aligns the incentives of management with those of shareholders and means that executives have plenty of experience in achieving steady growth.
 
However, in this case, Tootsie Roll, due to its dual class share system, is entirely under the control of the Gordon family. This is because Ms. Gordon’s father, William Rubin, took over a large controlling interest in Sweets Company of America (Tootsie Roll’s precursor) in the 1930’s after the death of its founder.
 
Source: Motley Fool
 
Which means that today, Ellen Gordon controls 79% of the voting rights in Tootsie Roll, giving her absolute say in all corporate policies, thanks to her almost exclusive ownership of the company’s class B shares which have 10 times the voting rights of common stock. These shares were created in the 1980’s to ensure the couple’s lock on power.
 
Critics of the Gordons, including shareholders who have periodically sued management over the years, claim that the Gordon’s have abused this absolute power by paying themselves lavishly in both salary and benefits.
 
For example, in 2012 Mr. and Mrs. Gordon were paid $7.6 million in salary, made use of the company jet for private reasons (flying between their primary home in Massachusetts and Chicago) to the tune of $1.2 million, and had the company pay for their $10,500 per month Chicago apartment, where they stayed part time when working from the corporate headquarters.
 
All told, that meant that the couple’s compensation  was $8.9 million, 1.6% of the company’s total revenue that year.
 
In addition, Ms. Gordon isn’t a big fan of transparency, and as a result the company doesn’t do conference calls, issue guidance of any kind, or even have an investor relations page.
 
In other words, anyone owning shares of Tootsie Roll has to accept the fact that they are completely at the mercy of non-transparent management, who can do almost anything it wants, as well as pay itself whatever it likes (top five executives were paid $12.1 million in 2015, or 2.3% of revenue).
 
Tootsie Roll Dividend Safety
We analyze 25+ years of dividend data and 10+ years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend.
 
Our Dividend Safety Score answers the question, “Is the current dividend payment safe?” We look at some of the most important financial factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios, debt levels, free cash flow generation, industry cyclicality, ROIC trends, and more.
 
Dividend Safety Scores range from 0 to 100, and conservative dividend investors should stick with firms that score at least 60. Since tracking the data, companies cutting their dividends had an average Dividend Safety Score below 20 at the time of their dividend reduction announcements.
 

 
We wrote a detailed analysis reviewing how Dividend Safety Scores are calculated, what their real-time track record has been, and how to use them for your portfolio here.
 
Tootsie Roll has a Dividend Safety Score of 99, which suggests that the company offers one of the safest and most dependable dividends on Wall Street.
 
That’s not surprising given its 51-year payout growth history.
 
In fact, Tootsie Roll has paid an uninterrupted quarterly dividend for 77 years and has also paid an annual 3% annual stock dividend for the past half century.
 
This kind of steady performance and high dividend security is due to three main factors.
 
The first being that food companies in general have very stable (if slow growing) sales, earnings, and cash flows. After all, even during recessions people need to eat, and candy is a low cost indulgence that generally isn’t highly cyclical.
 
Next, management has been very conservative with the company’s dividend growth, maintaining very low EPS and free cash flow payout ratios below 40% most years.
 


 
With the annual cash dividend consuming only about 30% of any year’s EPS and about 25% of free cash flow, the payout is extremely well insulated against any unexpected negative events, such as a sharp spike in commodity prices or currency swings which would ding earnings.
 
Finally, we can’t forget the importance of a strong balance sheet, which offers the company plenty of flexibility to both invest in future growth, as well as continue rewarding investors with the steady payout growth for which Tootsie Roll is famous.
 
As you can see, Tootsie Roll’s enjoys a pristine, fortress-like balance sheet with no debt, a substantial cash position (enough to cover nearly seven years of dividends), and one of the strongest current ratios (short-term assets/short-term liabilities) not just in the industry, but of any company on Wall Street.
 

 
In fact, when we compare Tootsie Roll’s metrics against its industry peers, things look even better.
 
Sources: Morningstar, Fast Graphs, Simply Safe Dividends
 
That’s because this is a highly capital intensive industry, generally marked by a very high leverage ratio (Debt/EBITDA) and low current ratios.
 
In contrast, Tootsie Roll’s lack of debt and high current ratio mean that, if it were ever to issue bonds (such as to make a large acquisition), it would likely receive a high investment-grade rating that would allow it plentiful access to very cheap growth capital.
 
Tootsie Roll’s Dividend Growth
Our Dividend Growth Score answers the question, “How fast is the dividend likely to grow?” It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth-centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios. Scores of 50 are average, 75 or higher is very good, and 25 or lower is considered weak.
 
Tootsie Roll’s Dividend Growth Score of 75 indicates that it has above average dividend growth potential. However, that’s largely due to its low payout ratios and not necessarily because of a history of fast dividend growth.
 

 
Going forward Tootsie Roll should be capable of 1% to 2% organic sales growth, which it can boost to 2% to 3% through acquisitions.
 
Combined with ongoing margin expansion from cost cutting and larger of economies of scale, as well as steady 1% to 2% net share buybacks (2.4% annually over the past 5 years), Tootsie Roll might be able to generate long-term EPS growth of 5% to 7%.
 
And because its payout ratios are so low, Tootsie Roll could provide dividend investors with somewhat faster payout growth, should management want to, along the lines of 6% to 8% over the coming years.
 
Of course, this is merely the company’s potential earnings and dividend outlook. Whether or not Tootsie Roll manages to achieve it depends on stabilizing its declining sales, returning to top line growth, and rational decision-making from the management team. If sales continue declining, than shareholders should only expect 4% to 6% payout growth going forward.
 
Valuation
Over the past year Tootsie Roll has underperformed the S&P 500 by about 15%. However, that doesn’t mean its valuation is attractive. In fact, the stock’s valuation appears quite rich.
 
For example, TR’s forward P/E ratio is 36.5, more than double the S&P 500’s 17.8. It’s also much higher than its industry peers, who have a median forward P/E ratio of 20.2.
 
And while Tootsie Roll has never been especially cheap (over the past 13 years its median forward P/E ratio was 30.5), today’s valuation looks especially stretched.
 
In other words, while Tootsie Roll’s industry leading profitability and impressive dividend growth record mean it probably deserves a market premium, today’s share price represents an 81% premium to its rivals, which is probably not warranted given its slow growth potential.
 
Meanwhile, the current cash yield of 1%, while in line with its historic 1% yield over the past 22 years, is only about half that of the broader S&P 500, which yields 1.9%.
 
In addition, it’s far below the industry median yield of 1.9%. In other words, Tootsie Roll’s low payout doesn’t offer investors much, especially considering that the company isn’t exactly experiencing fast earnings growth.
 
Now in fairness, the company’s annual 3% stock dividend does mean that investors can probably achieve long-term total returns of 9% to 11% (4% total yield + 5% to 7% potential earnings growth) with 9% to 10% being the more likely conservative estimate.
 
While that may be decent total return potential, especially for a dividend king, the fact remains that TR’s forward P/E ratio carries significant risk, especially when combined with some of the company’s questionable management practices.
 
Conclusion
While there is a lot to like about Tootsie Roll, at the same time the company has major issues it needs to deal with, most notably its weakening top line and potential succession issues when Ms. Gordon becomes unable to fulfill her duties.
 
When combined with a very low cash yield (unlike some of the best high dividend stocks here), modest payout growth prospects that make it a weaker income growth stock, and a potentially frightening valuation, I simply can’t recommend Tootsie Roll for any diversified dividend portfolio.
 
That’s especially true when there are far better dividend aristocrat alternatives, which offer more yield, stronger long-term dividend growth potential, and more appealing valuations.

Very good article and I couldn’t agree more. I would personally find it very difficult to invest in a company where Senior Management takes the kind of perks they do here. Keep up the good work Brian.

TR - Stock Valuation Report
 Trade 

Tootsie Roll Industries Inc. (TR) traded on unusually high volume on Jul. 27, as the stock 
lost 0.27% to close at $36.90. On the day, Tootsie Roll Industries Inc. saw 142,485 shares trade hands on 1,361 trades. 
Considering that the stock averages only a daily volume of 91,523 shares a day over the last month, this represents a pretty significant bump in volume over the norm.

Generally speaking, when a stock experiences a sudden spike in trading volume, it may be seen as a bullish signal for investors. An increase in volume means more market awareness for the 
company, potentially setting up a more meaningful move in stock price. The added volume also provides a level of support and stability for price advances.

The stock has traded between $40.44 and $33.19 over the last 52-weeks, its 50-day SMA is now $35.59, and its 200-day SMA $36.54. Tootsie Roll Industries Inc. 
has a P/B ratio of 3.32. It also has a P/E ratio of 35.1.
