            What are the pro's and cons of the 1 1/8 stroke versus the 3/4 stroke saws.
        


Asked by: tswa54

            Pros:
You are going to be cutting much faster with a 1 1/8&quot; stroke since each tooth travels 3/8&quot; further.

Cons:
Plunge cuts can be a bit trickier when your tip is moving around that much more.

Asked by: Johnny71

        I like the product quality and color
I received my saw for a Christmas Present and I have not had a chance to use it as yet but my grandson has one just like the one I received and we used it to fix the basement stair case...so I am looking forward to using mine..I like to overhaul all my own farm equipment plus repair all my own buildings so I am sure it will get put to very good use..thank you for making such a good product
