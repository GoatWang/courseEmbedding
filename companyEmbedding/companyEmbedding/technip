              Subsea products            








Technip has pioneered the development of critical products that have permitted the emergence of new concepts in offshore field development.
Flexible pipe
Manufacturing plants







With almost 75% of the market, Technip is the world leader in the
design and manufacturing of flexible pipe. With its manufacturing units
located in France and in Brazil, the Group is the leader in providing
flexible pipe for oil and gas field developments. Thermoplastic sheaths
ensure leakproofness and significantly reduce heat loss, providing the
best solution for corrosion resistance and for high temperature
hydrocarbons. Helically wound, the still wires give the structure an
excellent bending performance.
These layers can be easily adapted to any subsea developments.
Moreover, flexible pipe can be easily retrieved in order to be re-used
on another field development (particularly in Brazil), or in case of
decommissioning (in the British sector of the North Sea). 

France: Le Trait Manufacturing plant
Brazil: Vitória Manufacturing plant





IPB technology







Technip has developed the Integrated Production Bundle (IPB), an
innovative and proprietary technology. The IPB allows for high-level
flow assurance of hydrocarbon fluids in difficult conditions (viscous
oil, deepwater, pressure constraints etc.) from well heads to surface
treatment units. The IPB is a flexible production riser including
thermal insulation layers, additional hoses for gas lift or other
services, active heating
through electric cables and fluid temperature monitoring with optical
fibres. The IPB technology was first and successfully deployed on the
Dalia field, offshore Angola, for Total, at a water depth between 1,200
and 1,500m. First oil of the Dalia FPSO occurred in December 2006.





Technologies and Products - Flexible Pipe (1,6 MB)
 
Rigid pipe
SCR/HCR







Technip has developed reeled steel catenary risers and hybrid catenary
risers, which combine flexible and rigid pipe. These technologies
provide cost-effective solutions for offshore field developments in
certain layouts of deepwater environments.These lines can be laid using
the Group’s vessels Apache or Deep Blue.Technip has successfully installed SCR lines with the reel lay method. Our
onshore welding of SCR's for reel lay purposes allows to reach very
high quality and therefore optimal fatigue performance. The J-Lay
method is used for large diameter pipes or very high top tensions.





Pipe-in-pipe technology
This technology integrates perfectly into these rigid pipe solutions, providing the level of insulation necessary for economical installation and the level of flow assurance needed for effective production in deep and ultra-deep water.
Umbilicals







Through the Technip Umbilical Systems (TUS) group of companies, Technip is the leading manufacturer of umbilicals (steel and thermoplastic), providing connections between subsea equipment and platforms or floating production  systems enabling control from the surface. The Group operates 4 manufacturing sites in Newcastle (UK), Houston (US), Lobito (Angola) and Tangjung Langsat (Malaysia).

Overview[edit]
TECHNIP is primarily in the energy business and is active in three business segments, namely Subsea, Offshore & Onshore. It has around 38,000 employees and operates in 48 countries. It owns a fleet of 21 vessels in operation with 6 more under construction. As of the end of 2014, while the operating income of Technip Group from recurring activities stood at ~ Euros 825 million, the total revenues stood at more than Euros 10.7 billion.[1]
History[edit]




Technip head office, 89 avenue de la Grande-Armée, Paris 16th arr.


Technip was established in 1958 by IFP, Institut français du pétrole, as Compagnie française d'études et de construction Technip.
In the 1960s, the company completed its first international projects in Africa and Asia. In the 1970s Technip became an international group with the acquisition of an office in Rome and the creation of Technip Geoproduction, a subsidiary specialized in hydrocarbon field equipment. During this period, Coflexip – a firm specialized in the design, manufacture and supply of flexible subsea flowlines – was created by the IFP (French Petroleum Institute) and opened a flexible flowline manufacturing plant in Le Trait, France, as well as offices in Houston, Aberdeen and Rio de Janeiro.
In the 1980s Technip opened operating centers in Kuala Lumpur and Abu Dhabi. Coflexip opened a second flowline manufacturing plant in Brazil and branched out into the manufacture of umbilicals with the establishment of the Duco plant in Newcastle, UK.
Coflexip acquired Stena Offshore while Technip acquired several companies with strong technological expertise: Speichim, Krebs and KTI. Already established in the United States, KTI enabled Technip to set up in North America. Coflexip established a presence in Australia and acquired the Norwegian company Stena Offshore.
In the 2000s, Technip merged with Coflexip, which had just acquired Aker Maritime's Deepwater Division. The unified group is now one of the top five companies worldwide in engineering, technology and services for the energy industry. Many major contracts are signed, notably in the Middle East in the liquefied natural gas (LNG), ethylene and refining sectors.
In 2010 three major assets came into operation: the Technip fleet expanded to 17 vessels with the addition of the Apache II, one of the most advanced pipelay vessels in the industry, and the Skandi Vitoria, a Brazilian-flagged vessel dedicated to the pre-salt market. Asiaflex Products, the Group’s third flexible pipe production plant, located in Tanjung Langsat, Malaysia was inaugurated.
In 2011, Technip acquired Global Industries, substantially expanding its addressable market in subsea.
In 2012 Technip acquired Stone & Webster Process Technologies and associated oil and gas engineering capabilities from The Shaw Group.
FMC-Technip Merger to Create $13 Billion Oil-Services Firm[3][4][edit]
In 2017, FMC Technologies Inc. and French oil-services Technip SA agreed to merge, forming a significant new player in an energy industry racked by a nearly two-year slump in crude prices.[5]
The all-share deal would result in a new company named TechnipFMC with a market value of about $13 billion.
TechnipFMC has three headquarters in Houston, Paris and London under new Houston-based CEO Doug Pferdehirt, who worked as FMC’s chief operating officer. Former Technip chairman and CEO Thierry Pilenko is the new executive chairman.[5]
Listings[edit]
In the 1990s Technip was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange and Coflexip on the New York Stock Exchange. Technip was included in the CAC40 French benchmark index in September 2009.
Controversies[edit]
In June 2010 Technip S.A. agreed to pay a $338 million criminal penalty to resolve charges related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for its participation in a decade-long scheme to bribe Nigerian government officials to obtain engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts.[6]
In 2011, the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit in the federal Southern District of New York alleging insider trading.[7]
Organization[edit]
Technip was certified as one of the first five companies in the world as a Global Top Employer 2015 which recognizes first-class employee offerings globally and equally. This independent certification delivered by the Top Employers Institute demonstrates the quality and consistency of the company’s human resources policies and practices all around the globe.
Technip has also been certified as a top employer in 24 countries (Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Qatar, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Venezuela and Vietnam) as well as in three regions (Asia-Pacific, Europe and Latin America).[8]
In July 2015, it was announced that the company would lay off 6,000 employees due to the industry downturn.[9]

Overview[edit]
TECHNIP is primarily in the energy business and is active in three business segments, namely Subsea, Offshore & Onshore. It has around 38,000 employees and operates in 48 countries. It owns a fleet of 21 vessels in operation with 6 more under construction. As of the end of 2014, while the operating income of Technip Group from recurring activities stood at ~ Euros 825 million, the total revenues stood at more than Euros 10.7 billion.[1]
History[edit]




Technip head office, 89 avenue de la Grande-Armée, Paris 16th arr.


Technip was established in 1958 by IFP, Institut français du pétrole, as Compagnie française d'études et de construction Technip.
In the 1960s, the company completed its first international projects in Africa and Asia. In the 1970s Technip became an international group with the acquisition of an office in Rome and the creation of Technip Geoproduction, a subsidiary specialized in hydrocarbon field equipment. During this period, Coflexip – a firm specialized in the design, manufacture and supply of flexible subsea flowlines – was created by the IFP (French Petroleum Institute) and opened a flexible flowline manufacturing plant in Le Trait, France, as well as offices in Houston, Aberdeen and Rio de Janeiro.
In the 1980s Technip opened operating centers in Kuala Lumpur and Abu Dhabi. Coflexip opened a second flowline manufacturing plant in Brazil and branched out into the manufacture of umbilicals with the establishment of the Duco plant in Newcastle, UK.
Coflexip acquired Stena Offshore while Technip acquired several companies with strong technological expertise: Speichim, Krebs and KTI. Already established in the United States, KTI enabled Technip to set up in North America. Coflexip established a presence in Australia and acquired the Norwegian company Stena Offshore.
In the 2000s, Technip merged with Coflexip, which had just acquired Aker Maritime's Deepwater Division. The unified group is now one of the top five companies worldwide in engineering, technology and services for the energy industry. Many major contracts are signed, notably in the Middle East in the liquefied natural gas (LNG), ethylene and refining sectors.
In 2010 three major assets came into operation: the Technip fleet expanded to 17 vessels with the addition of the Apache II, one of the most advanced pipelay vessels in the industry, and the Skandi Vitoria, a Brazilian-flagged vessel dedicated to the pre-salt market. Asiaflex Products, the Group’s third flexible pipe production plant, located in Tanjung Langsat, Malaysia was inaugurated.
In 2011, Technip acquired Global Industries, substantially expanding its addressable market in subsea.
In 2012 Technip acquired Stone & Webster Process Technologies and associated oil and gas engineering capabilities from The Shaw Group.
FMC-Technip Merger to Create $13 Billion Oil-Services Firm[3][4][edit]
In 2017, FMC Technologies Inc. and French oil-services Technip SA agreed to merge, forming a significant new player in an energy industry racked by a nearly two-year slump in crude prices.[5]
The all-share deal would result in a new company named TechnipFMC with a market value of about $13 billion.
TechnipFMC has three headquarters in Houston, Paris and London under new Houston-based CEO Doug Pferdehirt, who worked as FMC’s chief operating officer. Former Technip chairman and CEO Thierry Pilenko is the new executive chairman.[5]
Listings[edit]
In the 1990s Technip was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange and Coflexip on the New York Stock Exchange. Technip was included in the CAC40 French benchmark index in September 2009.
Controversies[edit]
In June 2010 Technip S.A. agreed to pay a $338 million criminal penalty to resolve charges related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for its participation in a decade-long scheme to bribe Nigerian government officials to obtain engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts.[6]
In 2011, the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit in the federal Southern District of New York alleging insider trading.[7]
Organization[edit]
Technip was certified as one of the first five companies in the world as a Global Top Employer 2015 which recognizes first-class employee offerings globally and equally. This independent certification delivered by the Top Employers Institute demonstrates the quality and consistency of the company’s human resources policies and practices all around the globe.
Technip has also been certified as a top employer in 24 countries (Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Qatar, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Venezuela and Vietnam) as well as in three regions (Asia-Pacific, Europe and Latin America).[8]
In July 2015, it was announced that the company would lay off 6,000 employees due to the industry downturn.[9]

Overview[edit]
TECHNIP is primarily in the energy business and is active in three business segments, namely Subsea, Offshore & Onshore. It has around 38,000 employees and operates in 48 countries. It owns a fleet of 21 vessels in operation with 6 more under construction. As of the end of 2014, while the operating income of Technip Group from recurring activities stood at ~ Euros 825 million, the total revenues stood at more than Euros 10.7 billion.[1]
History[edit]




Technip head office, 89 avenue de la Grande-Armée, Paris 16th arr.


Technip was established in 1958 by IFP, Institut français du pétrole, as Compagnie française d'études et de construction Technip.
In the 1960s, the company completed its first international projects in Africa and Asia. In the 1970s Technip became an international group with the acquisition of an office in Rome and the creation of Technip Geoproduction, a subsidiary specialized in hydrocarbon field equipment. During this period, Coflexip – a firm specialized in the design, manufacture and supply of flexible subsea flowlines – was created by the IFP (French Petroleum Institute) and opened a flexible flowline manufacturing plant in Le Trait, France, as well as offices in Houston, Aberdeen and Rio de Janeiro.
In the 1980s Technip opened operating centers in Kuala Lumpur and Abu Dhabi. Coflexip opened a second flowline manufacturing plant in Brazil and branched out into the manufacture of umbilicals with the establishment of the Duco plant in Newcastle, UK.
Coflexip acquired Stena Offshore while Technip acquired several companies with strong technological expertise: Speichim, Krebs and KTI. Already established in the United States, KTI enabled Technip to set up in North America. Coflexip established a presence in Australia and acquired the Norwegian company Stena Offshore.
In the 2000s, Technip merged with Coflexip, which had just acquired Aker Maritime's Deepwater Division. The unified group is now one of the top five companies worldwide in engineering, technology and services for the energy industry. Many major contracts are signed, notably in the Middle East in the liquefied natural gas (LNG), ethylene and refining sectors.
In 2010 three major assets came into operation: the Technip fleet expanded to 17 vessels with the addition of the Apache II, one of the most advanced pipelay vessels in the industry, and the Skandi Vitoria, a Brazilian-flagged vessel dedicated to the pre-salt market. Asiaflex Products, the Group’s third flexible pipe production plant, located in Tanjung Langsat, Malaysia was inaugurated.
In 2011, Technip acquired Global Industries, substantially expanding its addressable market in subsea.
In 2012 Technip acquired Stone & Webster Process Technologies and associated oil and gas engineering capabilities from The Shaw Group.
FMC-Technip Merger to Create $13 Billion Oil-Services Firm[3][4][edit]
In 2017, FMC Technologies Inc. and French oil-services Technip SA agreed to merge, forming a significant new player in an energy industry racked by a nearly two-year slump in crude prices.[5]
The all-share deal would result in a new company named TechnipFMC with a market value of about $13 billion.
TechnipFMC has three headquarters in Houston, Paris and London under new Houston-based CEO Doug Pferdehirt, who worked as FMC’s chief operating officer. Former Technip chairman and CEO Thierry Pilenko is the new executive chairman.[5]
Listings[edit]
In the 1990s Technip was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange and Coflexip on the New York Stock Exchange. Technip was included in the CAC40 French benchmark index in September 2009.
Controversies[edit]
In June 2010 Technip S.A. agreed to pay a $338 million criminal penalty to resolve charges related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for its participation in a decade-long scheme to bribe Nigerian government officials to obtain engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts.[6]
In 2011, the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit in the federal Southern District of New York alleging insider trading.[7]
Organization[edit]
Technip was certified as one of the first five companies in the world as a Global Top Employer 2015 which recognizes first-class employee offerings globally and equally. This independent certification delivered by the Top Employers Institute demonstrates the quality and consistency of the company’s human resources policies and practices all around the globe.
Technip has also been certified as a top employer in 24 countries (Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Qatar, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Venezuela and Vietnam) as well as in three regions (Asia-Pacific, Europe and Latin America).[8]
In July 2015, it was announced that the company would lay off 6,000 employees due to the industry downturn.[9]

                Planning and Scheduling at Technip - FlexiFrance
            






December 2010

About the Technip Group :


		World leader in the fields of engineering and technical projects for the oil and gas for over 50 years. 

		23,000 people in 48 countries

		110 nationalities and industrial activities on 5 continents

		6.5 billion euros of sales in 2009



THE MARKETS OF TECHNIP :
• SUBSEA


		The Subsea market represents 44% of the turnover of Technip. In this activity are grouped underwater products and supplies pipes underwater flexible and rigid umbilicals and risers (products for connecting subsea equipment to fixed platforms or floating production systems).

		Five manufacturing plants representing approximately 2200 people in the production of hoses and umbilicals.

		Five assembly bases of rigid underwater pipes.

		A fconstantly evolving fleet of support vessels.


	• OFFSHORE


		The Offshore market accounts for 9% of sales turnover for the group

		It develops methods for the manufacture and installation of fixed platforms for shallow waters and also floating platforms.


	 

	• ONSHORE


		This is the most important activity in the group which accounts for 47% of income. It concerns the refining units, hydrogen processing and settlement of gas and unconventional resources.

MANUFACTURE :
TECHNIP has six manufacturing plants. The factories in Le Trait (France), Vitoria (Brazil) and Tanjung Langsat (Malaysia) are specialized in the manufacture of the flexible devices. Those in Newcastle (UK), Channelview (U.S.) and Lobito (Angola) are focused on the production of umbilicals. The resources are mainly based in Europe but there is also a strong presence in South America and increasingly in Asia.

Product quality is fundamental to TECHNIP. There are huge financial consequences at stake if equipment is unreliable. Their customer’s oil delivery are dependent on TECHNIP’s equipment both umbilicals and flexibles. Project value can be more than 50m€ in the North Sea, up to more than 1 Billion € in South Africa. The Group has a fleet of 19 ships to deliver and install their equipment. The Asiaflex factory is currently under construction where both flexible and umbilical products will be made.

THE MANUFACTURE OF FLEXIBLES AT FLEXI FRANCE :
This plant is located in Le Trait, Normandy and has been involved in the design and manufacture of flexible devices for more than 35 years. It is the ‘Centre of Excellence’ for manufacturing. The group has established a cross-functional organization to respond to any request from customer prospecting to product realization. FLEXI FRANCE figures:


		950 people (650 production staff, 110 in R & D, 85 offshore),

		More than 7000 km of flexible pipe and 15,000 connectors produced since 1974.

		approximately 52 projects per year,

		150 different structures, 450 endings. 

FLEXIBLE DEVICES
All fabrications are made-to-order, there is no standard product. A flexible device carries oil and gas and consists of several layers each with a specific function :
1st Layer : A stapled foliage that prevents the hose from closing on itself.
2nd Layer : Thin plastic sealing.
3rd Layer : Layer of steel to withstand the internal pressure.
4th Layer : Cross-ply armor to provide stability over time.
5ht Layer : Layer of protection and insulation to maintain temperature

PLANNING AT FLEXI FRANCE
As each project is almost unique, the design of the equipment is systematically adapted to customer requirements depending on:


		The depth at which the flexible device will be installed,

		The fluid that will be carried

		The variation in the temperature of the water, 

		The installation conditions

		The pressure

		The corrosive conditions,  and

		The diameter which will be necessary to carry the fluid.
		 


PRODUCTION AT THE HEART OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN
In 2007, to meet its ambitions, the TECHNIP group decided to focus on delivery reliability. They wanted to be able to simulate the expected lead times of projects (which could take between 3 months and 3 years) and then monitor progress to meet customers deadlines.

“Production is at the heart of the global supply chain group. We must be able to announce accurate and reliable deadlines to customers and make simulations for future customers on a period stretching to three years. The equipment must absolutely leave on the promise date as ships that are used to convey them to the platforms are reserved well in advance. The cost of laying-up a ship is very expensive and any delay in production would involve heavy additional costs which we have to avoid” says Bruno BELLET, Director of the factory at Le Trait.

THE CONSTRAINTS
• Manage raw material suppliers.


		The 30 principle suppliers to TECHNIP  are specifically qualified for each product

		Purchases of raw materials are made as and when required by demand

		Any supply risks are indentified in advance

		Estimates of future demand are regularly sent to the suppliers

		Estimates of future volumes to suppliers allow negotions to optimize.


• Managing the entire chain of subcontracting (forging, machining, welding, protection). A plan is sent to subcontractors about once per year. Revisions are done every 2 or 3 months. The subcontractor is part of a project and therefore forward visibility is equally important to them to provide an efficient service.

• Machine Utilization


		The wide range of products and projects means that machine bottlenecks will often move over time depending on product mix.


• Operator Utilization


		It is necessary to change the number of operators (2-18 staff) and the tasks assigned to them especially for example when specific equipment is needed such as reels to wind and store flexible devices

		It is necessary to be able to adjust the number of temporary staff easily.

		The choice of equipment to use during manufacture will also change the operator requirements.



• Reel/Bobbin Utilisation


		It is necessary to manage the problem of the availability of reels/bobbins as well as the space available for storage.

		A reel/bobbin can weigh 300 tons, therefore it is necessary to plan and take into account the handling equipment and movement of each reel.

• Existing constraints


		Detailed Constraints
		

				Inter-machine conflicts

				Reels are between 8 and 11 meters high. Some areas are not able to accept the reels so processes requiring certain sizes of reel have to be done in specific workshops

				Machines can be single or multi-process

				There are single and multi-processes that can be parallel or linear - certain operations are connected, others not.

				All customer inspectors are present on site. They impose inspection requirements at certain stages of manufacture.

				Requirements are dependent on whether the project is focussed on maintenance or new work

				Management of production progress and history is important


		 

		Estimated time for prototypes
		

				10 to 12% of resource activity is dedicated to the realization of prototypes.


		 

		Manage other resources or other criteria
		

				Management of non conformities on operations (around 50 per week)

				Managing indexing complexity by operation.

				Management of diversity. The makespans are long, re-planning and regrouping of work is necessary.

				Optimizing launches

				Tools (important make-ready time, requirements up to 16 hours).

				Consumable requirements (adhesives, oil etc..).



		Manage financial forecasts
		

				TECHNIP wishes at a time T the progress of its projects in order to reliably simultaneously announce a projected budget. The simulation will then be combined financial recovery for the Group to make a forecast of consolidated sales. Planning is therefore a determining factor.



WHY A NEW SOLUTION FOR PLANNING & SCHEDULING? :


		Pioneer in the use of the optimization of the logistic chain, Technip had tried another solution a year before. This solution had important limitations and did not take into account the whole of the manufacturing process. It became imperative to improve this solution or change it. “Our tool for long term planning was a house dating from 1985”, declared Jerome DELAHAYE, responsable for planning at FLEXI FRANCE. “It was limited to the manufacture of the flexible devices. It did not manage the activities of the assembly of the ends, test and packing. We in addition had another solution which managed short term planning supplied with other technical data”.

		The technical data were thus present in several tools. "We did not have commonality of data between these tools," comments Bruno Bellet.

		The solution did not take into account inventory control. This needed to take into account the information from the ERP to align the work orders with the available stock.

		The high cost of maintaining existing tools was also a big factor in Technip deciding to look for a new solution.
		 

CONCLUSION:
An integrated solution was essential. This solution would have to manage the total Supply Chain, short term and long term. It would have to take into account all detailed constraints of the workshops and the complexity of the processes. It must be flexible and reactive. It must be multi-user, allow each user to make simulations, allow filtering of information, compare actual information with planned activities, and be able to adapt to the increasing complexity of the products. The decision to order Preactor was taken in 2007 and it is now operational at Le Trait, in the UK, in Brazil and Malaysia.

This is just part of a complete overhaul of the information systems in Technip including:



		ERP (during installation)

		Preactor - Planning and Scheduling

		CHAMELEON - Quotation configurator for the generation of estimates

		ENNOV - Quality Management

		Other applications developed by TECHNIP.


The specifications for the Planning & Scheduling was pushed up voluntarily to measure the solution's ability to meet the requirements of Technip. 62 criteria have been identified since the solution's ability to meet business requirements, taking into account all the constraints, simulate, etc. ... The Preactor project started in December 2007. Preactor has considered 60 of the 62 criteria knowing that the remaining two criteria have been abandoned by TECHNIP meantime. Preactor covers 100% of the needs of TECHNIP, this project has been successful.
 
KEY FACTORS OF SUCCESS BY TECHNIP :


		The functional specification generated was very thorough and detailed including the integration with other Technip applications. The capital requirement and return on investment was based on Technip being able to carry out simulations that enabled reliable delivery dates to be given to potential customers,

		The project was carried out by all affected teams in the Group, from management to planning as well as production line teams. The Planning is the lifeblood of the Group.

		One project leader who was also responsible for functional requirements.

		Good control of the integration of all information systems at FLEXI FRANCE

		Excellent interaction between the Pre-sales teams of both Segula and Preactor who were part of the implementation team

		The availability of a proof of concept solution before the final decision was made.

		The International presence of Preactor

		Regular meetings with Preactor International HQ.


RESULTS :
Between 2004 and 2009, the sales turnover of TECHNIP was multiplied by 2.5. Machine utilisation increased by 170% on a quarterly basis. Purchasing time has been halved. Enrollment increased by almost a third but its provision is now controlled. In 5 years Technip has increased its turnover threefold and has been able to meet its customer deadlines.
FLEXI FRANCE is now positioned on Fast tracks (orders with short times). The resources are managed in detail (equipment, reels, etc…). The planning department is now able to anticipate problems before they occur. A very strong “planning” culture is now at the centre of the organization. Plans are generated in ten seconds where it took several hours previously at a preliminary meeting every morning which allows the teams to concentrate on other tasks. This time advantage allows the planners to now concentrate on the activity “Win It”.

“This project was a true in-house success. The personnel now realize the power of Preactor. We chose to initially implement planning before the ERP which shows our strong planning culture” - Bruno BELLET.

Air Products and Technip Global Hydrogen Alliance Marks 20 Years of Success
















News ReleaseAir Products and Technip Global Hydrogen Alliance Marks 20 Years of Success



	Worldwide Teamwork Produces Two Billion SCF Per Day of Hydrogen for Clean Fuels Production
April 10, 2013 Lehigh Valley, Pa.Two decades of operational excellence and success were celebrated by Air Products (NYSE: APD) and Technip (NYSE: FR0000131708) to mark the 20 year milestone of the longest and most productive global hydrogen alliance supporting the oil and gas industry around the world. 

The global alliance was formed to meet refining industry demands for outsourced hydrogen to make cleaner burning transportations fuels. During two decades Air Products and Technip have constructed 35 steam methane reformer (SMR) hydrogen production plants. Located in 11 countries, the combined facilities provide the refining and petrochemical industry with more than two billion standard cubic feet per day of hydrogen. 

The global alliance began in 1992 when a paradigm shift in the refining industry began to gain momentum and the industry moved toward outsourcing and buying hydrogen instead of refiners making it on their own. The success in meeting customer hydrogen demands for supply reliability and plant efficiency across the alliance’s first 10 years led to renewal of the agreement between Air Products and Technip in 2009, extending the relationship beyond the year 2020. 

“This alliance helped lead the global refining industry’s major shift in decision-making to purchase hydrogen from a third-party instead of making its own. Outsourced hydrogen is supplied to our customers on a 24/7 basis in tonnage quantities, and is a critical requirement for refineries to meet clean fuels standards. We are very proud to have been working side-by-side with Technip on several continents to help our customers meet the world’s growing energy needs in the most reliable, efficient and sustainable manner,” said John E. McGlade, chairman, president and CEO of Air Products. 
Thierry Pilenko, Technip’s Chairman and CEO stated: “Technip is really proud to be a member of this alliance. The valuable feedback we have received from the plants designed for Air Products, coupled with Technip’s high standards in design and engineering, have improved long term operations, where reliability over the years is the main focus. In the end the refining industry benefits by receiving a reliable and cost-effective source of hydrogen. In addition, our global footprint ensures that Technip can accompany its clients around the world, on their projects of tomorrow.” 

Throughout the global alliance relationship, the two companies have continued to strive for productivity improvements, supporting sustainability goals of reducing energy consumption and emissions. One of the notable recent plant onstream sustainability successes of the alliance is located in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. The new hydrogen facility, brought onstream in 2011, improved energy efficiency over the previous hydrogen supply by over 15 percent. It also lowered carbon dioxide emissions by over 200,000 tons per year, comparable to taking 90,000 cars off the road annually. 

The refining industry has sought larger SMRs to meet increased hydrogen demands. The alliance is scheduled to bring onstream its largest world-scale capacity SMR in fiscal year 2014. Located in St. Charles, Louisiana, United States, the facility will be the newest alliance project and will feature the latest technology advancements to maximize energy efficiency and emissions reduction. The enhanced SMR design targets optimal heat integration and minimal loss of heat to the environment, which in turn lowers natural gas feedstock consumption. 

The extended agreement has also led the alliance to look at extending the geographic reach of new hydrogen production projects in emerging markets including China, India and the Middle East. In 2013, the alliance’s first SMR in China is due onstream. Producing over 90 million standard cubic feet per day, it will be the first time a state-owned refinery has outsourced its hydrogen refinery requirement. 

To commemorate the 20-year milestone of the alliance, Air Products and Technip awarded a total of $200,000 in scholarships to four colleges and universities. These institutions are located in geographies where the two companies have collaborated to bring onstream world-class projects, and also in new geographies where the industry growth is expected to take the alliance next in support of the global refining industry. Scholarship winners each receiving $50,000 included: Indian Institute of Technology (Madras, India); King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (Saudi Arabia); Lehigh University (Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States); and Rice University (Houston, Texas, United States). 

The Air Products and Technip global alliance provides the worldwide refining industry with competitive technology and world-class safety. Technip provides the design and construction expertise for steam reformers while Air Products provides the gas separation technology. Air Products, through its extensive operating network, and Technip, from its large reference base, also bring effective operational and engineering knowledge to “design-in” high reliability and efficiency. The plants are operated and maintained by Air Products under long-term agreements with customers. 

Hydrogen is widely used in petroleum refining processes to remove impurities found in crude oil such as sulfur, olefins and aromatics to meet the product fuels specifications. Removing these components allows gasoline and diesel to burn cleaner and thus makes hydrogen a critical component in the production of cleaner fuels needed by modern, efficient internal combustion engines.

Two decades of operational excellence and success were celebrated by Air Products (NYSE: APD) and Technip (NYSE: FR0000131708) to mark the 20 year milestone of the longest and most productive global hydrogen alliance supporting the oil and gas industry around the world. 

The global alliance was formed to meet refining industry demands for outsourced hydrogen to make cleaner burning transportations fuels. During two decades Air Products and Technip have constructed 35 steam methane reformer (SMR) hydrogen production plants. Located in 11 countries, the combined facilities provide the refining and petrochemical industry with more than two billion standard cubic feet per day of hydrogen. 

The global alliance began in 1992 when a paradigm shift in the refining industry began to gain momentum and the industry moved toward outsourcing and buying hydrogen instead of refiners making it on their own. The success in meeting customer hydrogen demands for supply reliability and plant efficiency across the alliance’s first 10 years led to renewal of the agreement between Air Products and Technip in 2009, extending the relationship beyond the year 2020. 

“This alliance helped lead the global refining industry’s major shift in decision-making to purchase hydrogen from a third-party instead of making its own. Outsourced hydrogen is supplied to our customers on a 24/7 basis in tonnage quantities, and is a critical requirement for refineries to meet clean fuels standards. We are very proud to have been working side-by-side with Technip on several continents to help our customers meet the world’s growing energy needs in the most reliable, efficient and sustainable manner,” said John E. McGlade, chairman, president and CEO of Air Products. 
Thierry Pilenko, Technip’s Chairman and CEO stated: “Technip is really proud to be a member of this alliance. The valuable feedback we have received from the plants designed for Air Products, coupled with Technip’s high standards in design and engineering, have improved long term operations, where reliability over the years is the main focus. In the end the refining industry benefits by receiving a reliable and cost-effective source of hydrogen. In addition, our global footprint ensures that Technip can accompany its clients around the world, on their projects of tomorrow.” 

Throughout the global alliance relationship, the two companies have continued to strive for productivity improvements, supporting sustainability goals of reducing energy consumption and emissions. One of the notable recent plant onstream sustainability successes of the alliance is located in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. The new hydrogen facility, brought onstream in 2011, improved energy efficiency over the previous hydrogen supply by over 15 percent. It also lowered carbon dioxide emissions by over 200,000 tons per year, comparable to taking 90,000 cars off the road annually. 

The refining industry has sought larger SMRs to meet increased hydrogen demands. The alliance is scheduled to bring onstream its largest world-scale capacity SMR in fiscal year 2014. Located in St. Charles, Louisiana, United States, the facility will be the newest alliance project and will feature the latest technology advancements to maximize energy efficiency and emissions reduction. The enhanced SMR design targets optimal heat integration and minimal loss of heat to the environment, which in turn lowers natural gas feedstock consumption. 

The extended agreement has also led the alliance to look at extending the geographic reach of new hydrogen production projects in emerging markets including China, India and the Middle East. In 2013, the alliance’s first SMR in China is due onstream. Producing over 90 million standard cubic feet per day, it will be the first time a state-owned refinery has outsourced its hydrogen refinery requirement. 

To commemorate the 20-year milestone of the alliance, Air Products and Technip awarded a total of $200,000 in scholarships to four colleges and universities. These institutions are located in geographies where the two companies have collaborated to bring onstream world-class projects, and also in new geographies where the industry growth is expected to take the alliance next in support of the global refining industry. Scholarship winners each receiving $50,000 included: Indian Institute of Technology (Madras, India); King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (Saudi Arabia); Lehigh University (Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States); and Rice University (Houston, Texas, United States). 

The Air Products and Technip global alliance provides the worldwide refining industry with competitive technology and world-class safety. Technip provides the design and construction expertise for steam reformers while Air Products provides the gas separation technology. Air Products, through its extensive operating network, and Technip, from its large reference base, also bring effective operational and engineering knowledge to “design-in” high reliability and efficiency. The plants are operated and maintained by Air Products under long-term agreements with customers. 

Hydrogen is widely used in petroleum refining processes to remove impurities found in crude oil such as sulfur, olefins and aromatics to meet the product fuels specifications. Removing these components allows gasoline and diesel to burn cleaner and thus makes hydrogen a critical component in the production of cleaner fuels needed by modern, efficient internal combustion engines.

Overview[edit]
TECHNIP is primarily in the energy business and is active in three business segments, namely Subsea, Offshore & Onshore. It has around 38,000 employees and operates in 48 countries. It owns a fleet of 21 vessels in operation with 6 more under construction. As of the end of 2014, while the operating income of Technip Group from recurring activities stood at ~ Euros 825 million, the total revenues stood at more than Euros 10.7 billion.[1]
History[edit]




Technip head office, 89 avenue de la Grande-Armée, Paris 16th arr.


Technip was established in 1958 by IFP, Institut français du pétrole, as Compagnie française d'études et de construction Technip.
In the 1960s, the company completed its first international projects in Africa and Asia. In the 1970s Technip became an international group with the acquisition of an office in Rome and the creation of Technip Geoproduction, a subsidiary specialized in hydrocarbon field equipment. During this period, Coflexip – a firm specialized in the design, manufacture and supply of flexible subsea flowlines – was created by the IFP (French Petroleum Institute) and opened a flexible flowline manufacturing plant in Le Trait, France, as well as offices in Houston, Aberdeen and Rio de Janeiro.
In the 1980s Technip opened operating centers in Kuala Lumpur and Abu Dhabi. Coflexip opened a second flowline manufacturing plant in Brazil and branched out into the manufacture of umbilicals with the establishment of the Duco plant in Newcastle, UK.
Coflexip acquired Stena Offshore while Technip acquired several companies with strong technological expertise: Speichim, Krebs and KTI. Already established in the United States, KTI enabled Technip to set up in North America. Coflexip established a presence in Australia and acquired the Norwegian company Stena Offshore.
In the 2000s, Technip merged with Coflexip, which had just acquired Aker Maritime's Deepwater Division. The unified group is now one of the top five companies worldwide in engineering, technology and services for the energy industry. Many major contracts are signed, notably in the Middle East in the liquefied natural gas (LNG), ethylene and refining sectors.
In 2010 three major assets came into operation: the Technip fleet expanded to 17 vessels with the addition of the Apache II, one of the most advanced pipelay vessels in the industry, and the Skandi Vitoria, a Brazilian-flagged vessel dedicated to the pre-salt market. Asiaflex Products, the Group’s third flexible pipe production plant, located in Tanjung Langsat, Malaysia was inaugurated.
In 2011, Technip acquired Global Industries, substantially expanding its addressable market in subsea.
In 2012 Technip acquired Stone & Webster Process Technologies and associated oil and gas engineering capabilities from The Shaw Group.
FMC-Technip Merger to Create $13 Billion Oil-Services Firm[3][4][edit]
In 2017, FMC Technologies Inc. and French oil-services Technip SA agreed to merge, forming a significant new player in an energy industry racked by a nearly two-year slump in crude prices.[5]
The all-share deal would result in a new company named TechnipFMC with a market value of about $13 billion.
TechnipFMC has three headquarters in Houston, Paris and London under new Houston-based CEO Doug Pferdehirt, who worked as FMC’s chief operating officer. Former Technip chairman and CEO Thierry Pilenko is the new executive chairman.[5]
Listings[edit]
In the 1990s Technip was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange and Coflexip on the New York Stock Exchange. Technip was included in the CAC40 French benchmark index in September 2009.
Controversies[edit]
In June 2010 Technip S.A. agreed to pay a $338 million criminal penalty to resolve charges related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for its participation in a decade-long scheme to bribe Nigerian government officials to obtain engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts.[6]
In 2011, the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit in the federal Southern District of New York alleging insider trading.[7]
Organization[edit]
Technip was certified as one of the first five companies in the world as a Global Top Employer 2015 which recognizes first-class employee offerings globally and equally. This independent certification delivered by the Top Employers Institute demonstrates the quality and consistency of the company’s human resources policies and practices all around the globe.
Technip has also been certified as a top employer in 24 countries (Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Qatar, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Venezuela and Vietnam) as well as in three regions (Asia-Pacific, Europe and Latin America).[8]
In July 2015, it was announced that the company would lay off 6,000 employees due to the industry downturn.[9]

Overview[edit]
TECHNIP is primarily in the energy business and is active in three business segments, namely Subsea, Offshore & Onshore. It has around 38,000 employees and operates in 48 countries. It owns a fleet of 21 vessels in operation with 6 more under construction. As of the end of 2014, while the operating income of Technip Group from recurring activities stood at ~ Euros 825 million, the total revenues stood at more than Euros 10.7 billion.[1]
History[edit]




Technip head office, 89 avenue de la Grande-Armée, Paris 16th arr.


Technip was established in 1958 by IFP, Institut français du pétrole, as Compagnie française d'études et de construction Technip.
In the 1960s, the company completed its first international projects in Africa and Asia. In the 1970s Technip became an international group with the acquisition of an office in Rome and the creation of Technip Geoproduction, a subsidiary specialized in hydrocarbon field equipment. During this period, Coflexip – a firm specialized in the design, manufacture and supply of flexible subsea flowlines – was created by the IFP (French Petroleum Institute) and opened a flexible flowline manufacturing plant in Le Trait, France, as well as offices in Houston, Aberdeen and Rio de Janeiro.
In the 1980s Technip opened operating centers in Kuala Lumpur and Abu Dhabi. Coflexip opened a second flowline manufacturing plant in Brazil and branched out into the manufacture of umbilicals with the establishment of the Duco plant in Newcastle, UK.
Coflexip acquired Stena Offshore while Technip acquired several companies with strong technological expertise: Speichim, Krebs and KTI. Already established in the United States, KTI enabled Technip to set up in North America. Coflexip established a presence in Australia and acquired the Norwegian company Stena Offshore.
In the 2000s, Technip merged with Coflexip, which had just acquired Aker Maritime's Deepwater Division. The unified group is now one of the top five companies worldwide in engineering, technology and services for the energy industry. Many major contracts are signed, notably in the Middle East in the liquefied natural gas (LNG), ethylene and refining sectors.
In 2010 three major assets came into operation: the Technip fleet expanded to 17 vessels with the addition of the Apache II, one of the most advanced pipelay vessels in the industry, and the Skandi Vitoria, a Brazilian-flagged vessel dedicated to the pre-salt market. Asiaflex Products, the Group’s third flexible pipe production plant, located in Tanjung Langsat, Malaysia was inaugurated.
In 2011, Technip acquired Global Industries, substantially expanding its addressable market in subsea.
In 2012 Technip acquired Stone & Webster Process Technologies and associated oil and gas engineering capabilities from The Shaw Group.
FMC-Technip Merger to Create $13 Billion Oil-Services Firm[3][4][edit]
In 2017, FMC Technologies Inc. and French oil-services Technip SA agreed to merge, forming a significant new player in an energy industry racked by a nearly two-year slump in crude prices.[5]
The all-share deal would result in a new company named TechnipFMC with a market value of about $13 billion.
TechnipFMC has three headquarters in Houston, Paris and London under new Houston-based CEO Doug Pferdehirt, who worked as FMC’s chief operating officer. Former Technip chairman and CEO Thierry Pilenko is the new executive chairman.[5]
Listings[edit]
In the 1990s Technip was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange and Coflexip on the New York Stock Exchange. Technip was included in the CAC40 French benchmark index in September 2009.
Controversies[edit]
In June 2010 Technip S.A. agreed to pay a $338 million criminal penalty to resolve charges related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for its participation in a decade-long scheme to bribe Nigerian government officials to obtain engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts.[6]
In 2011, the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit in the federal Southern District of New York alleging insider trading.[7]
Organization[edit]
Technip was certified as one of the first five companies in the world as a Global Top Employer 2015 which recognizes first-class employee offerings globally and equally. This independent certification delivered by the Top Employers Institute demonstrates the quality and consistency of the company’s human resources policies and practices all around the globe.
Technip has also been certified as a top employer in 24 countries (Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Qatar, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Venezuela and Vietnam) as well as in three regions (Asia-Pacific, Europe and Latin America).[8]
In July 2015, it was announced that the company would lay off 6,000 employees due to the industry downturn.[9]

Overview[edit]
TECHNIP is primarily in the energy business and is active in three business segments, namely Subsea, Offshore & Onshore. It has around 38,000 employees and operates in 48 countries. It owns a fleet of 21 vessels in operation with 6 more under construction. As of the end of 2014, while the operating income of Technip Group from recurring activities stood at ~ Euros 825 million, the total revenues stood at more than Euros 10.7 billion.[1]
History[edit]




Technip head office, 89 avenue de la Grande-Armée, Paris 16th arr.


Technip was established in 1958 by IFP, Institut français du pétrole, as Compagnie française d'études et de construction Technip.
In the 1960s, the company completed its first international projects in Africa and Asia. In the 1970s Technip became an international group with the acquisition of an office in Rome and the creation of Technip Geoproduction, a subsidiary specialized in hydrocarbon field equipment. During this period, Coflexip – a firm specialized in the design, manufacture and supply of flexible subsea flowlines – was created by the IFP (French Petroleum Institute) and opened a flexible flowline manufacturing plant in Le Trait, France, as well as offices in Houston, Aberdeen and Rio de Janeiro.
In the 1980s Technip opened operating centers in Kuala Lumpur and Abu Dhabi. Coflexip opened a second flowline manufacturing plant in Brazil and branched out into the manufacture of umbilicals with the establishment of the Duco plant in Newcastle, UK.
Coflexip acquired Stena Offshore while Technip acquired several companies with strong technological expertise: Speichim, Krebs and KTI. Already established in the United States, KTI enabled Technip to set up in North America. Coflexip established a presence in Australia and acquired the Norwegian company Stena Offshore.
In the 2000s, Technip merged with Coflexip, which had just acquired Aker Maritime's Deepwater Division. The unified group is now one of the top five companies worldwide in engineering, technology and services for the energy industry. Many major contracts are signed, notably in the Middle East in the liquefied natural gas (LNG), ethylene and refining sectors.
In 2010 three major assets came into operation: the Technip fleet expanded to 17 vessels with the addition of the Apache II, one of the most advanced pipelay vessels in the industry, and the Skandi Vitoria, a Brazilian-flagged vessel dedicated to the pre-salt market. Asiaflex Products, the Group’s third flexible pipe production plant, located in Tanjung Langsat, Malaysia was inaugurated.
In 2011, Technip acquired Global Industries, substantially expanding its addressable market in subsea.
In 2012 Technip acquired Stone & Webster Process Technologies and associated oil and gas engineering capabilities from The Shaw Group.
FMC-Technip Merger to Create $13 Billion Oil-Services Firm[3][4][edit]
In 2017, FMC Technologies Inc. and French oil-services Technip SA agreed to merge, forming a significant new player in an energy industry racked by a nearly two-year slump in crude prices.[5]
The all-share deal would result in a new company named TechnipFMC with a market value of about $13 billion.
TechnipFMC has three headquarters in Houston, Paris and London under new Houston-based CEO Doug Pferdehirt, who worked as FMC’s chief operating officer. Former Technip chairman and CEO Thierry Pilenko is the new executive chairman.[5]
Listings[edit]
In the 1990s Technip was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange and Coflexip on the New York Stock Exchange. Technip was included in the CAC40 French benchmark index in September 2009.
Controversies[edit]
In June 2010 Technip S.A. agreed to pay a $338 million criminal penalty to resolve charges related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for its participation in a decade-long scheme to bribe Nigerian government officials to obtain engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts.[6]
In 2011, the US Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit in the federal Southern District of New York alleging insider trading.[7]
Organization[edit]
Technip was certified as one of the first five companies in the world as a Global Top Employer 2015 which recognizes first-class employee offerings globally and equally. This independent certification delivered by the Top Employers Institute demonstrates the quality and consistency of the company’s human resources policies and practices all around the globe.
Technip has also been certified as a top employer in 24 countries (Australia, Brazil, China, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Qatar, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Venezuela and Vietnam) as well as in three regions (Asia-Pacific, Europe and Latin America).[8]
In July 2015, it was announced that the company would lay off 6,000 employees due to the industry downturn.[9]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
