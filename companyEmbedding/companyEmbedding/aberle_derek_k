Leadership3 / 11Leadership3 / 11Derek K. AberlePresident, Qualcomm IncorporatedDownload photoDownload bioDerek Aberle serves as president of Qualcomm Incorporated and is responsible for the oversight for all business divisions across the organization, as well as the company’s global market development and marketing groups. Aberle is also responsible for formulating and driving key strategies for diversifying and growing the company in both Qualcomm’s core businesses, as well as new business opportunities such as data center and mobile healthcare solutions. He has served as a member of Qualcomm’s executive committee since 2008, helping to drive Qualcomm’s overall global strategy. In recent years Aberle also has been instrumental to evolving and expanding Qualcomm's business in China, including leading negotiations with the Chinese Government and establishing important new business ventures in China.
Prior to his current role, Aberle served as executive vice president of Qualcomm Incorporated, and group president, as well as president of Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL).  He was responsible for overseeing Qualcomm’s technology and IP licensing business as well as Qualcomm’s earlier stage businesses such as its mobile health, platform, display and wireless charging businesses.
Starting in 2008, Aberle led the QTL division and held several roles within this division, including executive vice president and president, and senior vice president and general manager. He has been instrumental to the success and growth of this division, and, under his leadership, QTL has significantly grown both revenues and profits and established its 4G licensing program. For well over a decade, he has played a leading role in structuring and negotiating key license agreements with Qualcomm’s licensees. He has also contributed heavily to the creation and implementation of the legal and business strategies that led to the resolution of several of the company’s licensing-related disputes.
Aberle joined Qualcomm in 2000 after representing the company as outside counsel for several years at the law firms of Pillsbury Madison & Sutro and Heller Ehrman.
Aberle holds a bachelor's degree in business economics from the University of California, Santa Barbara. He also holds a Juris Doctor from the University of San Diego School of Law, where he graduated magna cum laude.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/25/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
