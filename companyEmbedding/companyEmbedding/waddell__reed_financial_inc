Investors in Waddell & Reed Financial, IncWDR need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 21st 2017 $15.00Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Waddell & Reed Financial shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Waddell & Reed Financial is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Financial - Investment Management industry that ranks in the Top 18% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, the stock has seen two upward versus one downward estimate revision. Despite, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has remained unchanged at 39 cents per share over the period.Given the way analysts feel about Waddell & Reed Financial right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there's a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

Traditional, Roth and rollover IRAs offer attractive tax advantages and can serve as primary or supplemental retirement savings vehicles.  




Traditional IRA



Invest in a traditional IRA and defer paying taxes until you make withdrawals in retirement. Why does deferral matter? Simply put, if you think you will be in a lower tax bracket when you retire, your tax savings could be significant when you withdraw the money. Learn more about the traditional IRA:


 Traditional IRA Flyer



Deferred taxes and tax deductions. In addition to deferring taxes on current investment income or appreciation, you may be able to deduct all or a portion of your annual contribution, depending on your adjusted gross income.
Contributions. If you are younger than 70½ in 2017 and have taxable compensation, you may contribute up to the current maximum of $5,500. If you are 50 or older, you can make an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution. You also may contribute for a non-working or minimally working spouse. 
Reinvested earnings. All earnings from your traditional IRA are automatically reinvested into your account to maximize your total return.
Required withdrawals.  At age 70½, the IRS mandates that you begin taking an annual withdrawal called a required minimum distribution (RMD). Your Waddell & Reed financial advisor can assist you in calculating and understanding the RMD process.  



IRA vs. Taxable Account Comparison
Your IRA’s potential growth is tax deferred until withdrawn and can accumulate substantially faster than identical savings in a taxable account

This chart is for illustration purposes only and does not represent the past or future performance of any specific investment. This chart assumes the reinvestment of all earnings
and does not take into account any applicable fees, expenses, or possible withdrawals. The chart does not reflect all possible variables that may affect results. This illustration does not reflect the impact of state income taxes. Your situation may be different.

The assumed rate of return is not a guarantee, and investments that pay higher rates of return are generally subject to higher risk and volatility. Please note that lower minimum
tax rates on capital gains and dividends would make the investment return for the taxable investment more favorable and thus would reduce the difference in performance
between the accounts shown.

Investors should consider their personal investment horizon and income tax bracket, both current and anticipated, when making an investment decision, as these may further
impact the comparison.



Roth IRA



What are your tax expectations when you retire? If you think you will be taxed at a higher rate than today, think about saving for retirement with a Roth IRA. You'll make Roth contributions with money that has already been taxed at today's potentially lower rate. When you withdraw in retirement, your contributions and any potential growth may be tax free. That's one big reason to contribute. Other reasons the Roth IRA may be right for you include:


 Roth IRA Flyer



Contributions. You can contribute to a Roth IRA as long as you or your spouse have taxable income and your modified adjusted gross income is within the Roth limits. For 2017 you may contribute up to the current maximum of $5,500. If you are 50 or older, you can make an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution.




Roth IRA Adjusted Gross Income Limits for 2017


Single, head of household
 $118,000-$133,000


Married filing jointly 
$186,000-$196,000


Married filing separately
 $10,000





Withdrawals. You can withdraw contributions for any reason at any time without taxes or penalties. However, request a withdrawal before your account is at least five years old or if you are not yet 59½ and the earnings portion may be subject to a 10% penalty (exceptions apply). With a Roth, unlike the traditional IRA, the IRS does not mandate a required minimum distribution at age 70½.

Earn too much to contribute to a Roth IRA? Consider contributing to and converting a traditional IRA to a Roth. A Waddell & Reed financial advisor can explain the details and guide you in this decision. 



Rollover IRA



When you’re ready to retire or switch employers, don’t leave without thinking about the assets in your employer’s retirement plan. One option is to transfer them directly to a rollover IRA, where you may benefit from:


 Rollover IRA Flyer



Tax-deferred retirement savings. Defer taxes on earnings until withdrawn in retirement.
    
No current income taxes. Avoid current income taxes, including a mandatory 20% income tax withholding and possible 10% excise tax, when you rollover.
    
Withdrawal flexibility. Withdraw without tax penalties between ages 59 ½ and 70 ½. After 70 ½, the IRS mandates require minimum distributions based on your average life expectancy

Other options for your assets in a former employer's retirement plan include: 

Leave the assets in the plan
Keep/spend the assets
Receive the assets in a check and deposit them yourself in an IRA rollover
Transfer your assets directly into your new employer’s retirement plan

What you choose depends on your previous employer’s plan document, your specific needs and your tax advisor's guidance. 






Add an IRA to your retirement savings plan.

Important Information:
Early withdrawals are subject to ordinary income tax and a 10% penalty if you take a distribution before reaching age 59½.

*Eligible Rollover Distribution (ERD) refers to those distributions from Qualified Plans that are eligible to move between various fiduciary plan types (for example - 403(b), 401(k)) without tax consequences. These Qualified Plan types are referred to in Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 401(a) and include Profit Sharing, 401(k), Money Purchase Pension, Defined-Benefit, and ESOP. An ERD may also be from an IRC 403(b) (7) plan, which is for employees of non-profit institutions and public schools.
If an election is made to take an ERD from these plans in cash or "in kind" there is a mandatory 20% federal withholding. When this occurs, various states require withholding as indicated.

SEC-Required Report on Routing of Customer Orders
Waddell & Reed, Inc. ("W&R") introduces transactions on a fully disclosed basis to our clearing firm, Pershing LLC ("Pershing") . In November 2000, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") adopted new rules aimed at improving the quality and availability of disclosure related to order execution and routing practices. Pershing has prepared reports pursuant to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 606 that requires all brokerage firms to make publicly available quarterly reports on their order routing practices. The report provides information on the routing of "non-directed orders" - any order that the customer has not specifically instructed to be routed to a particular venue for execution. For these non-directed orders, our clearing firm has selected the execution venue on behalf of its customers.

The report is divided into four sections: one for securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange, one for securities listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market, one for securities listed on the American Stock Exchange or regional exchanges, and one for exchange-listed options. For each section, this report identifies the venues most often selected by the clearing firm, sets forth the percentage of various types of orders routed to the venues, and discusses the material aspects of the respective clearing firm's relationship with the venues. W&R directs its equity order flow to its clearing firm, Pershing, for routing and execution based upon where the customer's account is held. W&R does not receive compensation for directing order flow to Pershing.

Proxy Voting

Prior to the general meeting of a company or fund, shareholders will receive a package
in the mail containing a variety of documents that report financial data and operations
results and announce important issues - such as proposals for changes to the company's
share structure or mergers and acquisitions. These are all matters that shareholders
or unit holders, the true owners of the company or fund, will vote on at the general
meeting. If, however, a shareholder is not able to attend an annual (or special)
meeting, he or she can vote on proposals by means of a proxy, one of the documents
that is included in the pre-meeting mailing package. Shareholders are encouraged
to take advantage of their opportunity to influence the company and fund’s operations
by casting their vote.

I decided to write this long overdue review for Chris after yet another prove of his professional excellence. I am not an easy rater, so me giving 5 stars means that I am thoroughly impressed, and I am.

I came to California from Spain 18 months ago. Although we had lived here before, I felt a stranger to most of the details of financial planning. I had trouble understanding how to plan for retirement, my kids' university, saving for buying a house, stocks... After doing some research, I read about Chris on Yelp, and I decided to give it a shot. That was definitely one of the best decisions I made since coming to California.

Chris did a thorough analysis of our financial situation, assets, incomes, needs, priorities... He helped us come up with a plan. But, not only that, he was patient to guide us through all the steps and gave us what I would consider a "financial planning course". Since then, he has been flexible to adapt the plan to changes. Also, he is always available to answer an email or a visit for any question. Most importantly, I have come to really trust his advice (I am not an easy one since I question even the medical advice I get most of the time). I would trust Chris' advice on anything ranging from job opportunities to buying a house. I really think that what we paid for his advice was a real bargain. The best invested money I can think of.

Btw, if you are, like me, working on tech, you will find yet another positive in Chris. He is a former engineer, and he knows all the ins and outs of the Valley.

If you have doubts on how to plan what to do with your money, I would truly recommend you visiting Chris. I give this same advice to my best friends.







I have not used Waddell & Reed.  However, I am inclined to give them a terrible review because they have cold emailed me, twice, about becoming a Financial Advisor at their firm.

I am not in a financial field.  I have never been in a financial field.  As a matter of fact, I am terrible at my own finances.  I have a graduate degree in Anthropology, and have worked for over 20 years in the tech sector.  Nothing on my resume points to anyone who would be the "great fit" they claim I would am for a Financial Advisor with them.  The only "great fit" that exists is that their office is 20 minutes from my house.

It seems to me they don't care about having qualified people advising their clients, they want bodies in seats who can generate revenue.  That doesn't sound like a firm I want advising me on my financial future.







5 stars to Financial Adviser.
0 stars to Office Principle.
I met with a very friendly, articulate, 20+ year experienced corner-office adviser within the office of Rob Williams suite address for a free consultation. It was my first experience with a financial adviser and I wanted to understand the services offered, the fee structure, and end-game if I were to sign over my IRA accounts under their control. I left feeling 51% leaning toward giving it a try since I'm a poor investor on my own. 
However in the weeks since I've received random spam emails from two different Waddell & Reed offices including this office of Rob Williams asking me to apply for a position as a financial adviser as "We do not require any experience, as we offer an extensive training program, benefits and transition pay to assist you in getting started. I believe you may have some of the needed skills to be successful with our firm."
Nothing in my online resume is financially related. I have no financial skills, background, or desire. This forced me to research a bit online regarding the public opinions of Waddell & Reed's corporate hiring practices and business model during a large cup of coffee.
I'm sure the senior financial adviser I met with is very qualified however I'm no longer comfortable moving my investments based on the bigger picture.







I have never written a review on Yelp before. However, I am forced to write this as the financial adviser who we interacted from Waddell & Reed was not totally worth our time..

So.. Here it goes!!

We were planning on hiring a financial adviser for a long time and zeroed on Delbar as one of our realtors advised us. We went there and the very first day, she walked us through the entire plan and told us that she can help us and it is the right time for us to start with our financial planning.. At the first meeting itself, she asked us to pay her fee.. I was a little bit surprised as this was our first meeting and she was doing the sales pitch without even letting us think.. Ok, we thought may be she is aggressive and as we were anyway planning on hiring someone for a long time, we agreed to hire her..

The next, she goes through the entire documentation and says, I am not going to go crazy like other financial advisers and make money for you. Instead, I will do the things which are normal and will help you long term.. We were like, OK.. let us give her a chance.. Now, after looking at all the options, she proposes us the insurance plan by threatening us that one of us can die or fall sick for more than 30 minutes. Neither of us are in our 30's yet and she tells us all of this..Towards the end, she starts saying that I can only help you with your taxes which is again a basic change..Every meeting we had with her, she would ask us to sign an acknowledgement letter that she has done her job right..If she is sitting in front of us, we can't even right the correct comments as we wanted to give her chance to improve and help us out the next time..

To conclude, It was so hard for us to find out that inspite of knowing our current financial situation and everything, she misguided us that she can help us get our long term gains and .. She never mentioned anything worthwhile during our 2 to 3 meetings and we were surprised that she represents Waddell & Reed which is one of the most respected firms. We were so disappointed that we decided that this will be our last appointment with any financial adviser.







I approached Chris based on a reference and I am glad I did it.  He has excellent at summarizing my financial situation, came up with various scenario analysis if my compensation changed or my kids college expenses changed, etc.  He was not pushy and did not try to sell services he offered.  So, when I told him that I would go with an alternative provider for some of my investing needs, he was comfortable and even gave me advice along the way.  Thanks a lot.







I can't say enough good things about this place! We are having a baby in a few weeks, and decided to contact Waddell & Reed a few months ago for general advice. We got a large tax refund and were not sure what to do with it; should it go towards debt? Should we invest it? We were clueless. 

Before we went in, I figured we would get a-talkin to about my enthusiastic trips to Target and our penchant for spending $60 on pizza from Amicci's. I figured there would be finger wagging and lots of language using the words SHOULD. You should not go to Target. You really should MAKE pizza at home. Basically I figured it was going to be a giant guilt trip. 

My previous experience with a financial planner was when I was living back east and had a sky-high credit card debt -- so it helped that I wasn't (ahem, we weren't) in that particular situation. After our first meeting, we bought Quicken and did an analysis of our spending and turned it over to them. I was seriously stunned at how much we were spending on groceries and eating out, but she said that was pretty normal for a couple in the Bay area. Phew. We walked through all of our accounts, debt, pensions and the lack of IRAs. We looked at our net worth, which was um, humbling. They created a well-thought-out plan for us to invest here, save here, spend here. Most of all, there was no finger wagging or scolding. We spent the $800 on the baby stroller without guilt, cause we had budgeted for it and put it into our plan (and I will say, cut back heavily on other baby stuff). 

Result: each time I leave their offices, I feel lighter, more responsible and really, really in charge of where my (our) lives are going, financially. We have life insurance. We're going to write a will. We're starting Roth IRAs. We're out of credit card debt and have a plan to get rid of those pesky student loans. 

It's been worth their nominal fee, 10x over. I can't recommend Waddell & Reed more. Go see them. It's incredibly empowering to start making changes in your life to create a smart financial future.







Candor and honesty sum up my experience with Chris. Sure, he has given me solid and astute counsel on financial topics such as investing, long term planning, the market, financial life goals, etc.  But doesn't that simply meet the minimum expectation for a financial advisor?

What I found more important and rewarding was that he had the courage to be honest with me, and forced me to be honest with myself with regards to setting and staying on course for realistic and achievable goals.







Chris is an excellent financial advisor--I'm so glad that I sought out his services!

When it comes to finances, I'm about as ignorant as they come. For so long I had resigned myself to flying by the seat of my pants: no planning, expense tracking, nothing. Long story short: after a few short meetings with Chris I now feel like my entire financial house is in order, and I'm finally confident that I'm well-positioned to accomplish my short- and long-term financial goals.

Chris is very approachable and has no problem explaining arcane financial lingo to a layperson like me. He was always happy to take my calls and answer my incessant emails, and I'm really looking forward to our continued partnership.







Went to see Chris for some general advice about 401k and stocks and, basically, what to do with my money. I showed him everything I had as far as finances and he explained clearly what I was doing right and wrong for myself and why. He was great to work with and I'd recommend him to anyone.

I decided to write this long overdue review for Chris after yet another prove of his professional excellence. I am not an easy rater, so me giving 5 stars means that I am thoroughly impressed, and I am.I came to California from Spain 18 months ago. Although we had lived here before, I felt a stranger to most of the details of financial planning. I had trouble understanding how to plan for retirement, my kids' university, saving for buying a house, stocks... After doing some research, I read about Chris on Yelp, and I decided to give it a shot. That was definitely one of the best decisions I made since coming to California.Chris did a thorough analysis of our financial situation, assets, incomes, needs, priorities... He helped us come up with a plan. But, not only that, he was patient to guide us through all the steps and gave us what I would consider a "financial planning course". Since then, he has been flexible to adapt the plan to changes. Also, he is always available to answer an email or a visit for any question. Most importantly, I have come to really trust his advice (I am not an easy one since I question even the medical advice I get most of the time). I would trust Chris' advice on anything ranging from job opportunities to buying a house. I really think that what we paid for his advice was a real bargain. The best invested money I can think of.Btw, if you are, like me, working on tech, you will find yet another positive in Chris. He is a former engineer, and he knows all the ins and outs of the Valley.If you have doubts on how to plan what to do with your money, I would truly recommend you visiting Chris. I give this same advice to my best friends.

I have not used Waddell & Reed.  However, I am inclined to give them a terrible review because they have cold emailed me, twice, about becoming a Financial Advisor at their firm.I am not in a financial field.  I have never been in a financial field.  As a matter of fact, I am terrible at my own finances.  I have a graduate degree in Anthropology, and have worked for over 20 years in the tech sector.  Nothing on my resume points to anyone who would be the "great fit" they claim I would am for a Financial Advisor with them.  The only "great fit" that exists is that their office is 20 minutes from my house.It seems to me they don't care about having qualified people advising their clients, they want bodies in seats who can generate revenue.  That doesn't sound like a firm I want advising me on my financial future.

5 stars to Financial Adviser.0 stars to Office Principle.I met with a very friendly, articulate, 20+ year experienced corner-office adviser within the office of Rob Williams suite address for a free consultation. It was my first experience with a financial adviser and I wanted to understand the services offered, the fee structure, and end-game if I were to sign over my IRA accounts under their control. I left feeling 51% leaning toward giving it a try since I'm a poor investor on my own. However in the weeks since I've received random spam emails from two different Waddell & Reed offices including this office of Rob Williams asking me to apply for a position as a financial adviser as "We do not require any experience, as we offer an extensive training program, benefits and transition pay to assist you in getting started. I believe you may have some of the needed skills to be successful with our firm."Nothing in my online resume is financially related. I have no financial skills, background, or desire. This forced me to research a bit online regarding the public opinions of Waddell & Reed's corporate hiring practices and business model during a large cup of coffee.I'm sure the senior financial adviser I met with is very qualified however I'm no longer comfortable moving my investments based on the bigger picture.

I have never written a review on Yelp before. However, I am forced to write this as the financial adviser who we interacted from Waddell & Reed was not totally worth our time..So.. Here it goes!!We were planning on hiring a financial adviser for a long time and zeroed on Delbar as one of our realtors advised us. We went there and the very first day, she walked us through the entire plan and told us that she can help us and it is the right time for us to start with our financial planning.. At the first meeting itself, she asked us to pay her fee.. I was a little bit surprised as this was our first meeting and she was doing the sales pitch without even letting us think.. Ok, we thought may be she is aggressive and as we were anyway planning on hiring someone for a long time, we agreed to hire her..The next, she goes through the entire documentation and says, I am not going to go crazy like other financial advisers and make money for you. Instead, I will do the things which are normal and will help you long term.. We were like, OK.. let us give her a chance.. Now, after looking at all the options, she proposes us the insurance plan by threatening us that one of us can die or fall sick for more than 30 minutes. Neither of us are in our 30's yet and she tells us all of this..Towards the end, she starts saying that I can only help you with your taxes which is again a basic change..Every meeting we had with her, she would ask us to sign an acknowledgement letter that she has done her job right..If she is sitting in front of us, we can't even right the correct comments as we wanted to give her chance to improve and help us out the next time..To conclude, It was so hard for us to find out that inspite of knowing our current financial situation and everything, she misguided us that she can help us get our long term gains and .. She never mentioned anything worthwhile during our 2 to 3 meetings and we were surprised that she represents Waddell & Reed which is one of the most respected firms. We were so disappointed that we decided that this will be our last appointment with any financial adviser.

We were with Waddell & Reed for several years and have recently switched. It was VERY difficult to see where our money was and to access our accounts. I like to have an advisor I can trust, and I didn't feel there was enough transparency here at all. The final straw was when out of the blue they told us our advisor was changing his focus and they switched us to a new advisor without our consent. Months later, our accounts are still in the old advisor's name and the new advisor was telling us he couldn't access them for that reason. We've also found it near impossible to see our accounts online in a format that gives us the appropriate information. It all feels inexcusably sloppy for a group of advisors that want to handle large sums of money. If you are considering using them, also be sure to look them up online and see what their standings are with the appropriate licensing bureaus, etc.







All you need to know about this firm is how they handle new & potential clients:

I moved to the Hillsborough area, recently, from San Francisco, having purchased our dream home. I was looking for a good financial advisory firm & had heard about Waddell. Additionally, my parents & brother's wife & her family were interested in finding someone as well. We are lucky enough to be well off, I have a great job, my wife owns 5 franchises in the Sacramento Area, I could go on and on about how strong we are, economically. Thus, we wanted to start zeroing in our financial planning or retirement options. 

I called looking to speak to an adviser named Amy, whom I had heard of through a company happy hour. I called 4 times, here is my story:

Call #1:
I called and was greeted by a gentleman named Miles. I explained my situation. He told me that I need to come into the office and he needed to see my portfolio before he could screen me to a financial professional. What does that even mean? He wanted to know my net worth. He wanted to ask my long term plan. Huh? I pushed back. He was very rude, very short, once I started asking if he was an adviser. 

Who is Miles? Is he a registered financial advisor? Is he a secretary? I left my number and asked for a call back by an investment professional; we had money in other accounts we anted to move. 3 days went by...nothing

Call #2:
I called and was "greeted" by Miles, I reminded him of the conversation. I complained that my message must not have reached anyone and asked if he had forwarded it. He made excuses and put me on hold, only to drop me. 

I called back, he did not apologize and told me that I needed to be patient. He took my information down and said he would forward it. I asked for the direct info of a few advisers, he told me that he would not provide that info and told me to go on Linkedin or if I was serious, come into the office. Click. He hung up. Wow. 

Call #3:
Few days later, its Miles. I refreshed his memory. I asked to speak with his Supervisor and requested his name. He said that his Supervisor was unavailable. I asked for voice mail. I was denied. I asked for a name. I was denied. It seems this guy does not want his boss to know what was up. I lost it. I explained that I would find out who his boss was and report him, especially for pretending to be an adviser which is a big regulatory no-no. His response to me was simply to laugh. Very arrogant. He then asked for my number, again! I provided it. 

Call #4:
I called and no one picked up. It was 9a and it went straight to voicemail. I called again at 9:30a. Not a good sign. I wanted a live person. Nothing. I gave up. 

Who wants to work with a firm like this? I was 1 potential customer who was ready to bring a slew of wealthy clients over; my family and friends, even work associates. We went elsewhere.

Please be cautious of this place. If they can't get a message through....they cannot manage your money.

We were with Waddell & Reed for several years and have recently switched. It was VERY difficult to see where our money was and to access our accounts. I like to have an advisor I can trust, and I didn't feel there was enough transparency here at all. The final straw was when out of the blue they told us our advisor was changing his focus and they switched us to a new advisor without our consent. Months later, our accounts are still in the old advisor's name and the new advisor was telling us he couldn't access them for that reason. We've also found it near impossible to see our accounts online in a format that gives us the appropriate information. It all feels inexcusably sloppy for a group of advisors that want to handle large sums of money. If you are considering using them, also be sure to look them up online and see what their standings are with the appropriate licensing bureaus, etc.

All you need to know about this firm is how they handle new & potential clients:I moved to the Hillsborough area, recently, from San Francisco, having purchased our dream home. I was looking for a good financial advisory firm & had heard about Waddell. Additionally, my parents & brother's wife & her family were interested in finding someone as well. We are lucky enough to be well off, I have a great job, my wife owns 5 franchises in the Sacramento Area, I could go on and on about how strong we are, economically. Thus, we wanted to start zeroing in our financial planning or retirement options. I called looking to speak to an adviser named Amy, whom I had heard of through a company happy hour. I called 4 times, here is my story:Call #1:I called and was greeted by a gentleman named Miles. I explained my situation. He told me that I need to come into the office and he needed to see my portfolio before he could screen me to a financial professional. What does that even mean? He wanted to know my net worth. He wanted to ask my long term plan. Huh? I pushed back. He was very rude, very short, once I started asking if he was an adviser. Who is Miles? Is he a registered financial advisor? Is he a secretary? I left my number and asked for a call back by an investment professional; we had money in other accounts we anted to move. 3 days went by...nothingCall #2:I called and was "greeted" by Miles, I reminded him of the conversation. I complained that my message must not have reached anyone and asked if he had forwarded it. He made excuses and put me on hold, only to drop me. I called back, he did not apologize and told me that I needed to be patient. He took my information down and said he would forward it. I asked for the direct info of a few advisers, he told me that he would not provide that info and told me to go on Linkedin or if I was serious, come into the office. Click. He hung up. Wow. Call #3:Few days later, its Miles. I refreshed his memory. I asked to speak with his Supervisor and requested his name. He said that his Supervisor was unavailable. I asked for voice mail. I was denied. I asked for a name. I was denied. It seems this guy does not want his boss to know what was up. I lost it. I explained that I would find out who his boss was and report him, especially for pretending to be an adviser which is a big regulatory no-no. His response to me was simply to laugh. Very arrogant. He then asked for my number, again! I provided it. Call #4:I called and no one picked up. It was 9a and it went straight to voicemail. I called again at 9:30a. Not a good sign. I wanted a live person. Nothing. I gave up. Who wants to work with a firm like this? I was 1 potential customer who was ready to bring a slew of wealthy clients over; my family and friends, even work associates. We went elsewhere.Please be cautious of this place. If they can't get a message through....they cannot manage your money.
