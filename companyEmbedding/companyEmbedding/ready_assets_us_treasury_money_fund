	Fair Value Measurements - Various inputs are used in determining the fair value of investments. These inputs to valuation techniques are categorized into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of three broad levels for financial reporting purposes as follows:





	 


	 




	 



	•




	Level 1 — unadjusted price quotations in active markets/exchanges for identical assets and liabilities that the Fund has the ability to access





	 


	 




	 



	•




	Level 2 — other observable inputs (including, but not limited to, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in markets that are active, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities (such as interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates) or other market-corroborated inputs)





	 


	 




	 



	•




	Level 3 — unobservable inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances, to the extent observable inputs are not available (including the Fund’s own assumptions used in determining the fair value of investments)





	 


	 





	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.





	 





	Changes in valuation techniques may result in transfers into or out of an assigned level within the disclosure hierarchy. In accordance with the Fund’s policy, transfers between different levels of the fair value disclosure hierarchy are deemed to have occurred as of the beginning of the reporting period. The categorization of a value determined for investments is based on the pricing transparency of the investment and is not necessarily an indication of the risks associated with investing in those securities. For information about the Fund’s policy regarding valuation of investments and other significant accounting policies, please refer to the Fund’s most recent financial statements as contained in its semi-annual report.





	 


	 





	The following table summarizes the Fund’s investments categorized in the disclosure hierarchy as of January 31, 2013:

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time. 
 The Fund's yield may be affected by changes in interest rates and changes in credit ratings. Please see the Fund's prospectus for additional fund specific risks.

 Performance 






Performance








IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: The performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results, and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown.  Average annual total returns and calendar year returns assumes reinvestment of all distributions at net asset value and the deduction of all fund expenses. Performance would have been lower if fees had not been reimbursed or waived in various periods. Performance for other share classes will vary due to differences in sales charge structure and class expenses. All classes of shares are not available through all distribution channels.
The Current SEC 7-day yield represents net interest income generated by the investments for the past 7 days and assumes that the same income is generated each week over a 365-day period. The 7-day yield more closely reflects current fund earnings than does total returns. Yields for other share classes may vary due to differences in sales charge structure and class expenses. The Fund's yields reflect expense reimbursements or fee waivers, if any; absent these expense reimbursements and/or fee waivers, performance would have been lower.

**Gross expenses are the Fund's total annual operating expenses for the share class(es) shown.  Net expenses for Class(es) N & Service reflect contractual fee waivers and/or reimbursements, where these reductions reduce the Fund's gross expenses, which cannot be terminated prior to Dec 31, 2018 without Board consent.

 Holdings 






Holdings









IMPORTANT HOLDINGS INFORMATION: The information shown above relates to U.S. Treasury Reserves Portfolio ("the Portfolio"), the registered investment company in which the Fund invests all of its investable assets. The Funds utilize a master/feeder structure by investing all of their assets in a master portfolio. Assets are reported at the master portfolio level. As of the period ended April 30, 2016, the data in the “Value” column represents the market value of the Portfolio’s investments.  For those periods prior to April 30, 2016, the data in the “Value” column represents the amortized cost value. 

The Portfolio's investments are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value, in accordance with Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The amortized cost method of valuation involves valuing portfolio securities at their cost and thereafter assuming a constant amortization to maturity of any discount or premium.
The Portfolio's use of amortized cost is subject to its compliance with certain conditions as specified by Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act. The Portfolio continues to meet the requirements of Rule 2a-7 that permit it to utilize amortized cost to value its securities.
Portfolio holdings are subject to change at any time. Percentages are based on total investments. This information is provided for information purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell any security.
Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.

Weighted Average Maturity (WAM) is a weighted average of all the maturities of the securities held in a fund. WAM for money market funds can be used as a measure of sensitivity to interest rate changes. Generally, the longer the maturity, the greater the sensitivity. Weighted Average Life (WAL) is the weighted average of the life of the securities held in a fund or portfolio and can be used as a measure of sensitivity to changes in liquidity and/or credit risk. Generally, the higher the value, the greater the sensitivity. However, unlike WAM, WAL does not include interest rate resets in its calculation. Effective Maturity is a measure of a bond's maturity which takes into consideration the possibility that the issuer may call the bond before its maturity date.
