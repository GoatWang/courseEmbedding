Mortgage-Backed Securities

                            July 23, 2010
                       


Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are debt obligations that represent claims to the cash flows from pools of mortgage loans, most commonly on residential property. Mortgage loans are purchased from banks, mortgage companies, and other originators and then assembled into pools by a governmental, quasi-governmental, or private entity. The entity then issues securities that represent claims on the principal and interest payments made by borrowers on the loans in the pool, a process known as securitization.
Most MBSs are issued by the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), a U.S. government agency, or the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. Ginnie Mae, backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, guarantees that investors receive timely payments. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also provide certain guarantees and, while not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, have special authority to borrow from the U.S. Treasury. Some private institutions, such as brokerage firms, banks, and homebuilders, also securitize mortgages, known as "private-label" mortgage securities.
Mortgage-backed securities exhibit a variety of structures. The most basic types are pass-through participation certificates, which entitle the holder to a pro-rata share of all principal and interest payments made on the pool of loan assets. More complicated MBSs, known as collaterized mortgage obligations or mortgage derivatives, may be designed to protect investors from or expose investors to various types of risk. An important risk with regard to residential mortgages involves prepayments, typically because homeowners refinance when interest rates fall. Absent protection, such prepayments would return principal to investors precisely when their options for reinvesting those funds may be relatively unattractive.

Overview of Products
Single-Family Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) »
Fannie Mae creates MBS that represent beneficial ownership interests in a pool of mortgage loans secured by single-family (1-4 units) residential properties. An individual Single-Family MBS pool may hold mortgage loans that are either fixed-rate or adjustable-rate loans but will not hold both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans.
Multifamily Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) »
Fannie Mae creates MBS that represent beneficial ownership interests in a pool of mortgage loans secured by multifamily (5 or more units) residential properties. An individual Multifamily MBS pool may hold one or more mortgage loans that are either fixed-rate or adjustable-rate loans but will not hold both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans.
Structured Transactions and Megas »
Fannie Mae creates multiclass mortgage-backed securities including real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs) and stripped mortgage-backed securities (SMBS). REMICs permit an issuer to restructure cash flows on underlying mortgage assets into separately tradable securities. SMBS separate the principal and interest cash flows from underlying mortgage assets to create classes that pay only principal or only interest (known as principal only or interest only classes). Fannie Mae also creates and guarantees a single-class MBS known as a Fannie Mega® security or Mega. Megas are pass-through certificates backed by previously pooled Fannie Mae MBS with similar characteristics and/or other previously pooled Megas with similar characteristics.

                    Global Credit Research - 19 Apr 2016
                









New York, April 19, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service was informed that the Borrower, EpiCentre 
SPE Charlotte LLC, is seeking to further condominiumize and release 
the Air Rights Parking Lease Premises contained in Level P4 of the parking 
garage as provided in the original loan documents. This second 
tier condominium and release of the Air Rights Parking Lease Premises 
will become effective upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent set 
forth in the Loan Agreement.




Moody's has reviewed the Proposed Release of the EpiCentre Air Rights 
Parking Lease Premises. Moody's has determined that this proposed 
release of the Epicentre Air Rights Parking Lease will not, in and 
of itself, and at this time, result in a downgrade or withdrawal 
of the current ratings to any class of certificates rated by Moody's for 
GS Mortgage Securities Corporation II, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through 
Certificates, Series 2014-GC22. Moody's opinion only 
addresses the credit impact associated with the proposed EpiCentre Air 
Rights Parking Lease. Moody's is not expressing any opinion as 
to whether this change has, or could have, other noncredit 
related effects that may have a detrimental impact on the interests of 
note holders and/or counterparties.




Moody's will continue to monitor these ratings. Any change in the 
ratings will be publicly disseminated by Moody's through appropriate media.






This publication does not announce a credit rating action. For 
any credit ratings referenced in this publication, please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com 
for the most updated credit rating action information and rating history.

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

Approximately $830.465 million of Structured Securities Affected


New York, June 09, 2014 -- Moody's Investors Service has assigned ratings to twelve classes of CMBS

*Reflects Interest-Only Class


**Reflects Exchangeable Class




RATINGS RATIONALE




The Certificates are collateralized by 59 fixed-rate loans secured 
by 113 properties. The ratings are based on the collateral and 
the structure of the transaction.




Moody's CMBS ratings methodology combines both commercial real estate 
and structured finance analysis. Based on commercial real estate 
analysis, Moody's determines the credit quality of each mortgage 
loan and calculates an expected loss on a loan specific basis. 
Under structured finance, the credit enhancement for each certificate 
typically depends on the expected frequency, severity, and 
timing of future losses. Moody's also considers a range of qualitative 
issues as well as the transaction's structural and legal aspects.




The credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors: 
1) Moody's assessment of the probability of default, which 
is largely driven by each loan's DSCR, and 2) Moody's 
assessment of the severity of loss upon a default, which is largely 
driven by each loan's LTV ratio.




The Moody's Actual DSCR of 1.55X is higher than the 2007 
conduit/fusion transaction average of 1.31X. The Moody's 
Stressed DSCR of 0.95X is also slightly higher than the 2007 conduit/fusion 
transaction average of 0.92X.




Moody's Trust LTV ratio of 108.1% is lower than the 
2007 conduit/fusion transaction average of 110.6% but higher 
than many pools securitized during 2013. 




Moody's also considers both loan level diversity and property level 
diversity when selecting a ratings approach. With respect to loan 
level diversity, the pool's loan level (includes cross collateralized 
and cross defaulted loans) Herfindahl Index is 20.6. The 
transaction's loan level diversity is lower than Herfindahl scores 
found in most multi-borrower transactions issued since 2009. 
With respect to property level diversity, the pool's property 
level Herfindahl Index is 26.7. The transaction's 
property diversity profile is lower than the indices calculated in most 
multi-borrower transactions issued since 2009. 




Moody's also grades properties on a scale of 1 to 5 (best to worst) and 
considers those grades when assessing the likelihood of debt payment. 
The factors considered include property age, quality of construction, 
location, market, and tenancy. The pool's weighted 
average property quality grade is 2.28, which is slightly 
better than the indices calculated in most multi-borrower transactions 
since 2009. 




This deal has a super-senior Aaa class with 30% credit enhancement. 
Although the additional enhancement offered to the senior most certificate 
holders provides additional protection against pool loss, the super-senior 
structure is credit negative for the certificate that supports the super-senior 
class. If the support certificate were to take a loss, the 
loss would have the potential to be quite large on a percentage basis. 
Thin tranches need more subordination to reduce the probability of default 
in recognition that their loss-given default is higher. 
This adjustment helps keep expected loss in balance and consistent across 
deals. The transaction was structured with additional subordination 
at class A-S to mitigate the potential increased severity to class 
A-S.




The principal methodology used in this rating was "Moody's Approach to 
Rating U.S. CMBS Conduit Transactions" published in September 
2000. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology. 




Moody's analysis employs the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model v2.64 
which derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation of adjusted 
loan level proceeds derived from Moody's loan level DSCR and LTV ratios. 
Major adjustments to determining proceeds include loan structure, 
property type, sponsorship and diversity. Moody's analysis 
also uses the CMBS IO calculator version 1.0 which references the 
following inputs to calculate the proposed IO rating based on the published 
methodology: original and current bond ratings and credit estimates; 
original and current bond balances grossed up for losses for all bonds 
the IO(s) reference(s) within the transaction; and IO type corresponding 
to an IO type as defined in the published methodology.




Moody's Parameter Sensitivities: If Moody's value of the collateral 
used in determining the initial rating were decreased by 5%, 
15%, and 23%, the model-indicated rating 
for the currently rated junior Aaa class would be Aa1, Aa2, 
A1, respectively. Parameter Sensitivities are not intended 
to measure how the rating of the security might migrate over time; 
rather they are designed to provide a quantitative calculation of how 
the initial rating might change if key input parameters used in the initial 
rating process differed. The analysis assumes that the deal has 
not aged. Parameter Sensitivities only reflect the ratings impact 
of each scenario from a quantitative/model-indicated standpoint. 
Qualitative factors are also taken into consideration in the ratings process, 
so the actual ratings that would be assigned in each case could vary from 
the information presented in the Parameter Sensitivity analysis.




These ratings: (a) are based solely on information in the public 
domain and/or information communicated to Moody's by the issuer 
at the date it was prepared and such information has not been independently 
verified by Moody's; (b) must be construed solely as a statement 
of opinion and not a statement of fact or an offer, invitation, 
inducement or recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any securities 
or otherwise act in relation to the issuer or any other entity or in connection 
with any other matter. Moody's does not guarantee or make any representation 
or warranty as to the correctness of any information, rating or 
communication relating to the issuer. Moody's shall not be liable 
in contract, tort, statutory duty or otherwise to the issuer 
or any other third party for any loss, injury or cost caused to 
the issuer or any other third party, in whole or in part, 
including by any negligence (but excluding fraud, dishonesty and/or 
willful misconduct or any other type of liability that by law cannot be 
excluded) on the part of, or any contingency beyond the control 
of Moody's, or any of its employees or agents, including any 
losses arising from or in connection with the procurement, compilation, 
analysis, interpretation, communication, dissemination, 
or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer.




Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously anticipated. 
Factors that may cause an upgrade of the ratings include significant loan 
paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's share of defeasance 
or overall improved pool performance. Factors that may cause a 
downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance 
of the pool, loan concentration, increased expected losses 
from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and 
sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and 
Sensitivity to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




Moody's received and took into account one or more third-party 
assessments on the due diligence performed regarding the underlying assets 
or financial instruments in this transaction and the assessments had a 
neutral impact on the credit rating. 




Further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement 
mechanisms available to investors are available on http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF369833.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




As the section on loss and cash flow analysis describes, Moody's 
quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that stress factors 
contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account the likelihood 
of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. Moody's 
weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its assumptions of 
the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.


Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com

Approximately $820 Million of Structured Securities Affected


New York, April 29, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the ratings on twelve classes in 
GS Mortgage Securities Trust, Commercial Pass-Through Certificates, 
Series 2014-GC22 as follows:




Cl. A-1, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Apr

29, 2015 Affirmed Aa3 (sf)


Cl. PEZ, Affirmed A1 (sf); previously on Apr 29, 
2015 Affirmed A1 (sf)




RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The ratings on the IO classes, X-A and X-B, 
were affirmed based on the credit performance (or the weighted average 
rating factor) of the referenced classes.




The ratings on the exchangeable PEZ class was affirmed based the weighted 
average rating factor of its exchangeable classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 3.7% 
of the current balance, compared to 4.3% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 3.7% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 4.3% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in this rating was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 20, 
the same as at Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the April 12, 2016 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 1.1% to $950.6 
million from $961.5 million at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 59 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 12% of the pool, with the top ten 
loans constituting 59% of the pool.




Two loans, constituting 1.7% of the pool, are 
on the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes 
loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part 
of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As 
part of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




Moody's received full year 2014 operating results for 68% of the 
pool, and full or partial year 2015 operating results for 95% 
of the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 107%, 
unchanged since Moody's last review. Moody's conduit 
component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased 
and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 12% to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). 
Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 
9.4%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.55X and 0.96X, 
respectively, compared to 1.56X and 0.95X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The top three conduit loans represent 31% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the Maine Mall Loan ($110 million -- 11.6% 
of the pool), which represents a 47% pari-passu interest 
in a $235 million A note. The loan is secured by 730,444 
SF of net rentable area (NRA) contained within a 1,030,483 
square feet (SF) super-regional mall located in Portland, 
Maine. The mall has five anchors, which include Macy's, 
J.C. Penney, Sears, Bon Ton and Best Buy. 
Macy's and Sears own their respective units and are not contributed as 
collateral for the loan. Maine Mall was built in 1971, and 
renovated in 1983/1989 and 1994. As of December 31, 2015 
the property was 98% leased, unchanged from the prior year. 
In-line occupancy was approximately 97%. Moody's 
LTV and stressed DSCR are 99% and 0.9X, respectively, 
unchanged from the prior review.




The second largest loan is the Selig Portfolio 2014 Loan ($100 
million -- 10.5% of the pool), which represents 
a 51% pari-passu interest in a $197.0 million 
A note. The loan is collateralized by seven office properties containing 
1,082,617 SF of aggregate NRA located in Seattle, Washington. 
Two of the buildings are located in Seattle's Central Business District 
(CBD) and five are located in the Lower Queen Anne District. The 
buildings were constructed between 1970 and 2009 and have been selectively 
upgraded over the years. As of June 2015, the average occupancy 
rate across the collateral was approximately 93%, compared 
to 91% in December 2014. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 
109% and 0.95X, respectively, unchanged from 
the prior review




The third largest loan is the EpiCentre Loan ($85 million -- 
8.9% of the pool), which is secured by a retail/office 
mixed-use property containing a four-level sub-grade 
parking garage, developed in 2008 and located in the CBD of Charlotte, 
North Carolina. The improvements total 304,772 SF of rentable 
area primarily comprised of retail, which represents 264,323 
SF (87% NRA) of the development. The remaining 40,449 
SF (13% NRA) is represented by office space. As of September 
2015, the retail and office portions of the collateral were 91% 
leased. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 105% and 0.99X, 
respectively, unchanged from the prior review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis. 





For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.

                    Global Credit Research - 30 Jul 2015
                









New York, July 30, 2015 -- On May 28, 2015, Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") upgraded 
both Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas ("DBTCA") and Deutsche 
Bank National Trust Company ("DBNTC") and their operating 
trust company subsidiaries' long-term bank deposit ratings to A1 
from A3 and upgraded their short-term bank deposit ratings to P-1 
from P-2. The long-term issuer ratings for both DBTCA 
and DBNTC were downgraded to Baa1 from A3 and the Counter Party Risk Assessment 
("CRA") is A2(cr) / P-1(cr). DBTCA and DBNTC 
(collectively, "DB") have submitted a request for Rating Agency 
Confirmation ("RAC") with respect to 30 transactions for which DB serves 
as trustee and / or certificate administrator for Moody's consideration.




In the event that DB's ratings fail to meet Moody's criteria, 
DB's proposal includes the following features: 




(1) For those transactions in which DB serves as nominal trustee with 
the obligation to back-up the Master Servicer with respect to debt 
service and property protection advances: a) DB may serve in this 
capacity as long as it maintains a minimum long-term issuer rating 
of Baa2 and the Master Servicer for the transaction maintains a minimum 
long-term issuer rating of A2; b) If the Master Servicer is 
not rated, or its long-term issuer rating is lower than A2 
and DB's long-term issuer rating is lower than Baa2, 
then DB will resign as trustee within 30 days of the master servicer or 
DB both failing to meet the A2 long-term issuer rating threshold 
and be replaced by a successor trustee with a minimum long-term 
issuer rating of A2.




(2) For those transactions in which DB serves as Certificate Administrator, 
DB may serve in this capacity as long as it maintains a minimum long-term 
issuer rating of Baa2. However, if: a) DB holds distribution 
or collection account funds intraday and only intraday, those funds 
must be held in a depository institution with a minimum long-term 
bank deposit rating of Baa2 or short-term bank deposit rating of 
P-2; or b) DB holds distribution or collection account funds 
overnight or longer, those funds must be held in a depository institution 
that has a minimum long-term deposit rating of A2 or short-term 
deposit rating of P-1.




In assessing the proposal, Moody's has considered the rating implementation 
guidance entitled "The Temporary Use of Cash in Structured Finance Transactions: 
Eligible Investment and Bank Guidelines" published in March 16, 
2015. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this rating implementation guidance.




Moody's opinion only addresses the credit impact associated with the proposal. 
Moody's is not expressing any opinion as to whether this change has, 
or could have, other noncredit related effects that may have a detrimental 
impact on the interests of note holders and/or counterparties.




Moody's will continue to monitor these ratings. Any change in the 
ratings will be publicly disseminated by Moody's through appropriate media








This publication does not announce a credit rating action. For

However, MOODY’S is not an auditor and cannot in every instance independently verify or validate information received in the rating process or in preparing the Moody’s publications. To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability to any person or entity for any indirect, special, consequential, or incidental losses or damages whatsoever arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information, even if MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers is advised in advance of the possibility of such losses or damages, including but not limited to: (a) any loss of present or prospective profits or (b) any loss or damage arising where the relevant financial instrument is not the subject of a particular credit rating assigned by MOODY’S. To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability for any direct or compensatory losses or damages caused to any person or entity, including but not limited to by any negligence (but excluding fraud, willful misconduct or any other type of liability that, for the avoidance of doubt, by law cannot be excluded) on the part of, or any contingency within or beyond the control of, MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers, arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Approximately $812 Million of Structured Securities Affected


New York, April 28, 2017 -- Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the ratings on twelve classes in 
GS Mortgage Securities Trust, Commercial Pass-Through Certificates, 
Series 2014-GC22 as follows:




Cl. A-1 Certificate, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously 
on Apr 29, 2016 Affirmed Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-2 Certificate, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously

Cl. PEZ Certificate, Affirmed A1 (sf); previously on 
Apr 29, 2016 Affirmed A1 (sf)




RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on nine P&I Classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable ranges.




The ratings on two IO Classes (Class X-A and X-B) were affirmed 
based on the credit performance (or the weighted average rating factor 
or WARF) of their referenced classes.




The transaction contains a exchangeable certificates. Classes A-S, 
B and C may be exchanged for Class PEZ certificates. The PEZ certificates 
will be entitled to receive the sum of interest and principal distributable 
on the Classes A-S, B and C certificates that are exchanged 
for such PEZ certificates. The rating on Class PEZ was affirmed 
based on the WARF of its exchangeable classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 4.4% 
of the current balance, compared to 3.7% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 4.3% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 3.7% at Moody's last review. Moody's 
provides a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion 
CMBS transactions on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology. 




The methodology used in rating the exchangeable class, Cl. 
PEZ was "Moody's Approach to Rating Repackaged Securities" 
published in June 2015. Please see the Rating Methodologies page 
on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.




Additionally, the methodology used in rating Classes X-A 
and X-B was "Moody's Approach to Rating Structured Finance 
Interest-Only Securities" published in October 2015. Please 
see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for 
a copy of this methodology.




Please note that on February 27, 2017, Moody's released a 
"Request for Comment" in which it has requested market feedback on proposed 
changes to its methodology for rating structured finance interest-only 
(IO) securities called "Moody's Approach to Rating Structured Finance 
Interest-Only Securities," dated October 20, 2015. 
If Moody's adopts the new methodology as proposed, the changes could 
affect the ratings of in GS Mortgage Securities Trust, Commercial 
Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2014-GC22. 
Please see "Moody's Proposes Revised Approach to Rating Structured Finance 
Interest-Only (IO) Securities", which is available at www.moodys.com, 
for more information about the implications of the proposed changes to 
the methodology on Moody's ratings.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 20, 
the same as at Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the April 12, 2017 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 1.9% to $943 
million from $961 million at securitization. The certificates 
are collateralized by 59 mortgage loans ranging in size from less than 
1% to 11.7% of the pool, with the top ten loans 
constituting 59% of the pool.




Eight loans, constituting 7.9% of the pool, 
are on the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes 
loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part 
of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As 
part of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




Moody's received full year 2015 operating results for 91% of the 
pool, and full or partial year 2016 operating results for 79% 
of the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 108%, 
compared to 107% at Moody's last review. Moody's 
conduit component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, 
defeased and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 17% to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). 
Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 
9.4%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.52X and 0.95X, 
respectively, compared to 1.55X and 0.96X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The top three conduit loans represent 31% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the Maine Mall Loan ($110 million -- 11.7% 
of the pool), which represents a pari-passu interest in a 
$235 million mortgage loan. The loan is secured by 730,444 
SF of net rentable area contained within a 1,030,483 square 
feet (SF) super-regional mall located in Portland, Maine. 
The mall contains five anchors, which include Macy's, J.C. 
Penney, Sears, Bon Ton and Best Buy. Macy's and Sears 
own their respective units and are not contributed as collateral for the 
loan. Other major tenants include Apple, H&M, Forever 
XXI and Pottery Barn. Maine Mall was built in 1971, and renovated 
in 1983, 1989 and 1994. As of September 2016 the property 
was 93% leased, down from 98% in December 2015. 
In-line occupancy was approximately 97%. Moody's 
LTV and stressed DSCR are 99% and 0.90X, respectively, 
unchanged from the prior review.




The second largest loan is the Selig Portfolio Loan ($100 million 
-- 10.6% of the pool), which currently represents 
a pari-passu interest in a $197.0 million mortgage 
loan. The loan is collateralized by seven office properties containing 
1,082,617 SF of aggregate NRA located in Seattle, Washington. 
Two of the buildings are located in Seattle's Central Business District 
(CBD) and five are located in the Lower Queen Anne District. The 
buildings were constructed between 1970 and 2009 and have been selectively 
upgraded over the years. As of December 2016, the portfolio 
was 96% leased, up from 93% a year earlier in December 
2015. Additional pari passu debt, that is co-terminus 
with the current Selig Portfolio Loan, is permitted provided that, 
among other provisions provided in the loan documents, certain aggregate 
appraised loan-to-value, DSCR and debt yield parameters 
are met. Moody's accounted for the potential of future pari passu 
debt in its analysis. 




The third largest loan is the EpiCentre Loan ($85 million -- 
9.0% of the pool), which is secured by a retail/office 
mixed-use property containing a four-level sub-grade 
parking garage, developed in 2008 and located in the central business 
district (CBD) of Charlotte, North Carolina. The improvements 
total 304,772 SF of rentable area primarily comprised of retail. 
The retail component represents 264,323 SF (88.3% 
NRA) of the development and the remaining 40,449 SF (11.7% 
NRA) is represented by office space. As of September 2016, 
the retail and office portions of the collateral were a combined 94% 
leased, compared to 91% a year earlier in September 2015. 
Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 105% and 0.99X, 
respectively, unchanged from the prior review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.




Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.

MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable).

Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
