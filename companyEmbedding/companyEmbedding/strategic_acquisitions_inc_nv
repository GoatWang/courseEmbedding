STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS INC.






NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


MARCH 31, 2017

(UNAUDITED)



NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION



The consolidated interim financial statements included herein, presented
in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles and
stated in US dollars, have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant
to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been
condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the
Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information
presented not misleading.


These statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring
adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for fair
presentation of the information contained therein. It is suggested that these
consolidated interim financial statements be read in conjunction with the
financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2016 and
notes thereto included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K. The Company
follows the same accounting policies in the preparation of interim reports.


Results of operations for interim periods are not indicative of annual
results.



NOTE 2 - STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY



The Company is authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of its $0.001 par
value common stock.


On March 22, 2017, the Company issued 25,000 shares of its $0.001 par
value common stock for cash in the amount of $10,000 in a private placement
transaction.


There were no other issuances of common stock for the period ended
March 31, 2017.



NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN



The Company has  incurred  net losses of  approximately  $232,000 for the period
from  January 27, 1989 (Inception) through March 31, 2017  and has commenced
limited  operations,  raising  substantial  doubt about the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern. The Company will seek additional sources of capital
through the issuance of debt or equity financing,  but there can be no assurance
the Company will be successful in accomplishing its objectives.


The  ability of the  Company to  continue  as a going  concern is  dependent  on
additional  sources  of  capital  and the  success of the  Company's  plan.  The
financial  statements do not include any adjustments  that might be necessary if
the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying
financial  statements for the three-month period  ended  March 31, 2017 and the
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.


The Company has limited capital resources and stockholder's equity. At
March 31, 2017, the Company had current assets in the form of cash and
cash equivalents of $6,139 and liabilities of $0.


The Company has not realized any revenues from operations in the past two
years, and its plan of  operation  for the next twelve  months  shall  be  to
continue to locate a suitable acquisition/merger candidate.  The  Company  can
provide no assurance that it will continue to satisfy its cash requirements for
at least the next twelve  months if a suitable acquisition/merger is completed.


It is unlikely the Company will have any revenue unless it is able to
effect an acquisition of or merger with an operating company, of which there
can be no assurance.


For the quarters ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company showed net
losses of $5,136 and $5,265, respectively.  The decrease in net loss was due
to minor decreases in fees, including audit, transfer agent, and bank fees.






ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES



As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company conducted
an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal
Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
Company's disclosure controls  and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act").
Based on this evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. Additionally, the
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that
the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.  There was no change in the
Company's internal control over financial reporting during the Company's most
recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over
financial reporting.

ITEM 2.  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS



On March 22, 2017, an investor in a private placement transaction purchased,
with personal funds, 25,000 restricted shares of common stock of the Company
for $10,000.  The securities were sold pursuant to an exemption from
registration as set forth in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), and Rule 506 promulgated thereunder.  The
purchaser is an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501 of the Securities
Act, and there was no general solicitation or advertising regarding the
offering. The offering has terminated. The use of proceeds is working capital.
There were no underwriters in the transaction, no commissions or other

over financial reporting that occurred during the Registrant's most recent
fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Registrant's internal control over financial
reporting; and


5. I have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of internal control over
financial reporting, to the Registrant's auditors and the audit committee of
the Registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent
functions):


a) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Registrant's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information; and


b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Registrant's internal
control over financial reporting.

PART I






Item 1.  Business.



Strategic Acquisitions, Inc. (the "Company" or "Strategic") was incorporated
under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 27, 1989. Since inception the
Company had no revenues other than nominal interest income. As of the date
hereof, the Company has no commercial operations, has no full- or part-time
employees, and owns no real estate.


The Company's current business plan is to seek, investigate, and, if warranted,
acquire a business, and to pursue other related activities intended to enhance
shareholder value. The acquisition of a business opportunity may be made by
purchase, merger, exchange of stock, or otherwise, and may encompass assets or a
business entity, such as a corporation, joint venture, or partnership. The
Company has limited capital, and it is unlikely that the Company will be able to
take advantage of more than one such business opportunity. The Company intends
to seek opportunities demonstrating the potential of long-term growth as opposed
to short-term earnings.


At the present time the Company has not identified any business opportunity
that it plans to pursue, nor has the Company reached any agreement or
definitive understanding with any person concerning an acquisition.


No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in finding or
acquiring a desirable business opportunity, given that limited funds are
available for acquisitions, or that any acquisition that occurs will be on
terms that are favorable to the Company or its stockholders.


The Company's search will be directed toward small and medium-sized enterprises
which have a desire to become public corporations and which are able to satisfy,
or anticipate in the reasonably near future being able to satisfy, the minimum
asset requirements in order to qualify shares for trading on NASDAQ or
another stock exchange.


The  Company  anticipates  that  the  business  opportunities presented to it
will (i) be recently organized with no operating  history,  or a history of
losses attributable to under-capitalization or other factors; (ii) be
experiencing financial or operating  difficulties;  (iii) be in need of funds to
develop a new product or service or to expand into a new market; (iv) be relying
upon an untested product or marketing concept;  or (v) have a combination of the
characteristics  mentioned  in (i) through  (iv) above.  The Company  intends to
concentrate its acquisition efforts on properties or businesses that it believes
to be  undervalued.  Given the above factors,  investors  should expect that any
acquisition candidate may have a history of losses or low profitability.


1





The  Company  does not  propose  to  restrict  its  search  for  investment
opportunities  to  any  particular  geographical  area  or  industry,  and  may,
therefore,  engage in  essentially  any  business,  to the extent of its limited
resources.  The Company's discretion in the selection of business  opportunities
is  unrestricted,  subject to the availability of such  opportunities,  economic
conditions, and other factors.


In connection with such a merger or  acquisition,  it is highly likely that
an amount of stock  constituting  control of the Company  would be issued by the
Company or purchased from the current  principal  shareholders of the Company by
the acquiring  entity or its affiliates.  If stock is purchased from the current
shareholders,  the transaction is very likely to result in substantial  gains to
them relative to their purchase price for such stock. In the Company's judgment,
none of its officers and directors would thereby become an "underwriter"  within
the meaning of the Section 2(11) of the  Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Act").


It is anticipated  that business  opportunities  will come to the Company's
attention from various sources,  including its officers and directors, its other
stockholders,   professional   advisors  such  as  attorneys  and   accountants,
securities  broker-dealers,   venture  capitalists,  members  of  the  financial
community,  and others who may present unsolicited proposals. The Company has no
plans,  understandings,  agreements, or commitments with any individual for such
person to act as a finder of opportunities for the Company, although its
officers, directors and significant shareholders seek out such opportunities and
respond to unsolicited proposals in their ordinary course of business.


The  Company  does  not  foresee  that it  would  enter  into a  merger  or
acquisition  transaction  with any business with which its officers or directors
are currently affiliated.  Should the Company determine in the future,  contrary
to foregoing expectations,  that a transaction with an affiliate would be in the
best  interests of the Company and its  stockholders,  the Company is in general
permitted by Nevada law to enter into such a transaction if:


1. The material facts as to the  relationship  or interest of the affiliate
and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of
Directors, and the Board in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by
the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested  directors,  even though
the disinterested directors constitute less than a quorum; or


2. The material facts as to the  relationship  or interest of the affiliate
and as to the  contract  or  transaction  are  disclosed  or  are  known  to the
stockholders  entitled  to vote  thereon,  and the  contract or  transaction  is
specifically approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or


3. The contract or  transaction is fair as to the Company as of the time it
is  authorized,  approved  or  ratified,  by  the  Board  of  Directors  or  the
stockholders.

Investigation and Selection of Business Opportunities



To a large  extent,  a  decision  to  participate  in a  specific  business
opportunity may be made upon  management's  analysis of the quality of the other
company's  management  and  personnel,  the  anticipated  acceptability  of  new
products or marketing concepts, the merit of technological changes, and numerous
other factors which are difficult,  if not  impossible,  to analyze  through the
application of any objective criteria. In many instances, it is anticipated that
the historical operations of a specific business opportunity may not necessarily
be indicative  of the  potential for the future  because of the possible need to
shift marketing approaches substantially,  expand significantly,  change product
emphasis, change or substantially augment management, or make other changes. The
Company will be dependent upon the owners of a business  opportunity to identify
any such problems which may exist and to implement,  or be primarily responsible
for the implementation of, required changes. Because the Company may participate
in a business  opportunity  with a newly  organized firm or with a firm which is
entering a new phase of growth,  it should be  emphasized  that the Company will
incur further risks,  because  management in many instances will not have proven
its abilities or effectiveness,  the eventual market for such company's products
or  services  will  likely  not be  established,  and  such  company  may not be
profitable when acquired.


It is anticipated that the Company will not be able to diversify,  but will
essentially  be limited to only one  venture  because of the  Company's  limited
financing.  This lack of  diversification  will not permit the Company to offset
potential losses from one business opportunity against profits from another, and
should be  considered an adverse  factor  affecting any decision to purchase the
Company's securities.


It is emphasized  that  management  of the Company may effect  transactions
having a potentially adverse impact upon the Company's  shareholders pursuant to
the   authority  and   discretion  of  the  Company's   management  to  complete
acquisitions  without  submitting  any  proposal to the  stockholders  for their
consideration.  Holders of the Company's  securities  should not anticipate that
the  Company  necessarily  will  furnish  such  holders,  prior to any merger or
acquisition, with financial statements, or any other documentation, concerning a
target  company  or its  business.  In some  instances,  however,  the  proposed
participation in a business opportunity may be submitted to the stockholders for
their  consideration,   either  voluntarily  by  such  directors,  to  seek  the
stockholders' advice and consent, or because state law so requires.


The analysis of business  opportunities  will be undertaken by or under the
supervision of the Company's officers and directors. Although there are no
current plans to do so, Company management might also hire an outside consultant
to assist in the investigation and selection of business opportunities,and might
pay a finder's fee.  Since  Company  management  has  no  current  plans  to use
any outside consultants or advisors to assist in the investigation and selection
of business opportunities, no policies have been adopted  regarding use of such
consultants  or advisors,  the criteria to be used in selecting such consultants
or advisors, the services to be provided,  the term of service, or regarding the
total amount of fees that may be paid. However, because of the limited resources
of the Company, it is likely that any such fee would be paid in stock and not
in cash.


3





In  assessing  a potential  transaction, the Company anticipates that it
will consider, among other things, the following factors:


1.  Potential for growth and  profitability,  indicated by new  technology,
anticipated market expansion, or new products;


2. The Company's perception of how any particular business opportunity will
be received by the investment community and by the Company's stockholders;


3. Whether, following the business combination,  the financial condition of
the business  opportunity would be, or would have a significant  prospect in the
foreseeable  future of  becoming  sufficient  to enable  the  securities  of the
Company to qualify for trading in the over-the-counter markets or listing on a
securities  exchange;


4. Capital requirements and anticipated  availability of required funds, to
be provided by the Company or from  operations,  through the sale of  additional
securities,  through  joint  ventures  or  similar  arrangements,  or from other
sources;


5. The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced;


6. Competitive  position as compared to other companies of similar size and
experience within the industry;


7. Strength and diversity of existing  management,  or management prospects
that are scheduled for recruitment; and


8. The  accessibility  of required  management  expertise,  personnel,  raw
materials, services, professional assistance, and other required items.


No one of the factors  described above will be controlling in the selection
of a business  opportunity,  and management  will attempt to analyze all factors
appropriate to each  opportunity and make a determination  based upon reasonable
investigative  measures  and  available  data.  Potentially  available  business
opportunities  may occur in many  different  industries and at various stages of
development,  all of which will make the task of comparative  investigation  and
analysis  of  such  business  opportunities  extremely  difficult  and  complex.
Potential  investors  must  recognize  that,  because of the  Company's  limited
capital  available for  investigation  and  management's  limited  experience in
business analysis,  the Company may not discover or adequately  evaluate adverse
facts about the opportunity to be acquired.  It should be noted that the Company
has not completed a transaction in the twenty years of its existence.


The  Company is unable to  predict  when it may  participate  in a business
opportunity.  It expects,  however, that the analysis of specific proposals,  if
and when any are received,  and the selection of a business opportunity may take
several months or more.


The Company has no business proposals under consideration as of the date of
this annual report.


4





Prior to making a decision to  participate in a business  opportunity,  the
Company  will  generally  request  that it be provided  with  written  materials
regarding the business  opportunity  containing  such items as a description  of
products,   services  and  company  history;   management   resumes;   financial
information; available projections, with related assumptions upon which they are
based; an explanation of proprietary products and services; evidence of existing
patents,  trademarks, or services marks, or rights thereto; present and proposed
forms of compensation to management;  a description of transactions between such
company and its affiliates during relevant periods; a description of present and
required  facilities;  an  analysis  of  risks  and  competitive  conditions;  a
financial  plan  of  operation  and  estimated  capital  requirements;   audited
financial  statements,  or  if  they  are  not  available,  unaudited  financial
statements,   together  with  reasonable   assurances  that  audited   financial
statements  would be able to be produced prior to completion  of a merger
transaction;  and other information deemed relevant.


As part of the Company's  investigation,  the Company's  executive officers
and directors may meet personally  with management and key personnel,  may visit
and inspect material facilities,  obtain independent analysis or verification of
certain information provided,  check references of management and key personnel,
and take other reasonable investigative measures, to the extent of the Company's
limited financial resources and management expertise.


Company  management  believes  that various  types of  potential  merger or
acquisition  candidates might find a business combination with the Company to be
attractive.  These include  acquisition  candidates  desiring to create a public
market for their shares in order to enhance liquidity for current  shareholders,
acquisition  candidates  which have long-term  plans for raising capital through
the public sale of securities and believe that the possible prior existence of a
public  market  for  their  securities  would  be  beneficial,  and  acquisition
candidates  which  plan  to  acquire   additional  assets  through  issuance  of
securities rather than for cash, and believe that the possibility of development
of a public market for their  securities  will be of assistance in that process.
Acquisition  candidates which have a need for an immediate cash infusion are not
likely  to find a  potential  business  combination  with the  Company  to be an
attractive alternative.



Form of Acquisition



It is impossible to predict the manner in which the Company may participate
in a business opportunity.  Specific business  opportunities will be reviewed as
well as the respective needs and desires of the Company and the promoters of the
opportunity  and,  upon the basis of that  review and the  relative  negotiating
strength of the Company and such promoters, the legal structure or method deemed
by management to be suitable will be selected.  Such structure may include,  but
is not limited to leases, purchase and sale agreements, licenses, joint ventures
and other contractual  arrangements.  The Company may act directly or indirectly
through an interest in a partnership, corporation or other form of organization.
Implementing   such   structure  may  require  the  merger,   consolidation   or
reorganization  of the  Company  with other  corporations  or forms of  business
organization,  and  although it is likely,  there can be no  assurance  that the
Company would be the surviving entity. In addition,  the present  management and
stockholders  of the Company  most likely will not have control of a majority of
the voting shares of the Company following a reorganization transaction. As part
of such a  transaction,  the  Company's  existing  directors  may resign and new
directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders.


5





It is likely that the Company will acquire its  participation in a business
opportunity  through the  issuance of common  stock or other  securities  of the
Company.  Although the terms of any such  transaction  cannot be  predicted,  it
should be noted that in  certain  circumstances  the  criteria  for  determining
whether or not an acquisition is a so-called "tax free" reorganization under the
Internal  Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Internal  Revenue Code"),  depends upon the
issuance to the stockholders of the acquired  company of a controlling  interest
(i.e.,  80% or more) of the common  stock of the combined  entities  immediately
following the reorganization. If a transaction were structured to take advantage
of these provisions  rather than other "tax free" provisions  provided under the
Internal Revenue Code, the Company's  current  stockholders  would retain in the
aggregate  20% or less of the total issued and  outstanding  shares.  This could
result  in  substantial  additional  dilution  in the  equity  of those who were
stockholders of the Company prior to such  reorganization.  Any such issuance of
additional shares might also be done  simultaneously  with a sale or transfer of
shares  representing  a  controlling  interest  in the  Company  by the  current
officers, directors and principal shareholders.


It is  anticipated  that any new  securities  issued in any  reorganization
would  be  issued  in  reliance  upon  exemptions,  if any are  available,  from
registration  under  applicable  federal  and  state  securities  laws.  In some
circumstances,  however, as a negotiated element of the transaction, the Company
may agree to register  such  securities  either at the time the  transaction  is
consummated,  or under certain conditions or at specified times thereafter.  The
issuance of substantial  additional securities and their potential sale into any
trading  market  that  might  develop  in the  Company's  securities  may have a
depressive effect upon such market.


The  Company  will  participate  in a business  opportunity  only after the
negotiation  and  execution of a written  agreement.  Although the terms of such
agreement  cannot  be  predicted,  generally  such an  agreement  would  require
specific  representations and warranties by all of the parties thereto,  specify
certain events of default,  detail the terms of closing and the conditions which
must be satisfied by each of the parties thereto prior to such closing,  outline
the manner of bearing costs if the transaction is not closed, set forth remedies
upon default, and include miscellaneous other terms.


As a general matter,  the Company  anticipates that it, and/or its officers
and  principal  shareholders  will  enter  into a  letter  of  intent  with  the
management,  principals or owners of a prospective business opportunity prior to
signing a binding agreement. Such a letter of intent will set forth the terms of
the proposed  acquisition but will not bind any of the parties to consummate the
transaction.  Execution  of a letter of intent  will by no means  indicate  that
consummation  of an acquisition is probable.  Neither the Company nor any of the
other  parties  to the  letter  of  intent  will  be  bound  to  consummate  the
acquisition unless and until a definitive  agreement  concerning the acquisition
as described  in the  preceding  paragraph is executed.  Even after a definitive
agreement  is  executed,  it is  possible  that  the  acquisition  would  not be
consummated  should  any  party  elect to  exercise  any right  provided  in the
agreement to terminate it on specified grounds.


6





It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities
and the negotiation,  drafting and execution of relevant agreements,  disclosure
documents and other  instruments  will require  substantial  management time and
attention and  substantial  costs for  accountants,  attorneys and others.  If a
decision were made not to participate in a specific  business  opportunity,  the
costs  theretofore   incurred  in  the  related   investigation   would  not  be
recoverable.  Moreover,  because many  providers  of goods and services  require
compensation at the time or soon after the goods and services are provided,  the
inability of the Company to pay until an  indeterminate  future time may make it
impossible to procure goods and services.


An acquisition made by the Company may be in an industry which is regulated
or  licensed  by  federal,  state or local  authorities.  Compliance  with  such
regulations can be expected to be a time-consuming and expensive process.



Competition



The Company expects to encounter substantial  competition in its efforts to
locate attractive opportunities,  primarily from business development companies,
venture capital  partnerships and  corporations,  venture capital  affiliates of
large  industrial  and financial  companies,  small  investment  companies,  and
wealthy  individuals.  Many of these  entities will have  significantly  greater
experience,  resources  and  managerial  capabilities  than the Company and will
therefore  be in a  better  position  than  the  Company  to  obtain  access  to
attractive  business  opportunities.  The Company also will possibly  experience
competition  from other public "Blank Check"  companies,  some of which may have
more funds available than does the Company.



No Rights of Dissenting Shareholders



The Company  does not intend to provide its  shareholders  with  disclosure
documentation concerning a possible target company prior to acquisition, because
the Nevada Business Corporation Act vests authority in the board of directors to
decide and approve matters involving  acquisitions within certain  restrictions.
If any  transaction  is structured  as an  acquisition,  not a merger,  with the
Company  being the parent  company and the  acquiree  being merged into a wholly
owned subsidiary, a shareholder will have no right of dissent under Nevada law.



Employees



The  Company has no  employees.  Management  of the Company  expects to use
consultants,  attorneys and accountants as necessary,  and does not anticipate a
need to engage any full-time  employees so long as it is seeking and  evaluating
business  opportunities.  The need for employees and their  availability will be
addressed  in  connection  with  the  decision  whether  or  not to  acquire  or
participate  in specific  business  opportunities.  The Company has previously
paid its Secretary/Treasurer in 2004 and 2009 for her services in bookkeeping,
recordkeeping, filing tax forms and filing of reports with the SEC.  Although
there is no current plan with  respect to its nature or  amount,  additional
remuneration  may be paid to or accrued for the benefit of, the Company's
officers prior to, or in conjunction with, the completion of a business
acquisition for services actually  rendered.

At March 10, 2017, there were approximately 55 holders of record and
75 beneficial owners of the Company's common stock.


The Board of Directors has never declared a dividend and the Company does not
anticipate paying dividends at any time in the foreseeable future. Also, in the
event of the acquisition of a business by the Company, control of the Company
and its Board of Directors may pass to others and the payment of dividends would
be wholly dependent upon the decisions of such persons.


The Company does not have an equity compensation plan.


The Company did not repurchase any equity securities during the last fiscal
year.

ITEM 6.   Selected Financial Data.



Not applicable.  As a smaller reporting company we are not required to provide
the information otherwise required by this item.






ITEM 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.



The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying
audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016.





Liquidity and Capital Resources



The Company has limited capital resources and stockholder's equity. At
December 31, 2016, the Company had liquid assets in the form of cash and
cash equivalents of $1,275 and liabilities of $0.


The Company had no material commitments for capital expenditures at December 31,
2016.






Results of Operations



The Company has not realized any revenues from operations in the past two
years, and its plan of operation for the next twelve months shall be to
continue its efforts to locate a suitable acquisition/merger candidate. The
Company can provide no assurance that it will continue to satisfy its cash
requirements for the next twelve months if a suitable acquisition/merger is
completed.


It is unlikely the Company will have any revenue, other than interest income,
unless it is able to effect an acquisition of or merger with an operating
company, of which there can be no assurance.


For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company showed net
losses of $11,615 and $8,102, respectively. The increase in net loss was due
primarily to a change in the Company's auditor.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Strategic Acquisitions, Inc.


We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Strategic Acquisitions, Inc.
as of December 31, 2015, and the related statements of income, stockholders'
equity (deficit), and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Strategic Acquisitions, Inc.'s managements is responsible for these financial
statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.


We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of The Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  The company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting.  Our audit included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control
over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit
also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion.


In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Strategic Acquisitions, Inc.
as of December 31, 2015, and the related statements of income, stockholders'
equity (deficit), and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.


The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 6 to the
financial statements, the Company has no revenues, has incurred recurring
losses and recurring negative cash flow from operating activities, and has
an accumulated deficit which raises substantial doubt about its ability to
continue as a going concern. Management's plans concerning these matters are
also described in Note 6. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS INC.






NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015




NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES




ORGANIZATION


The Company was organized January 27, 1989 (Date of Inception) under the laws
of the State of Nevada, as Strategic Acquisitions, Inc.


Since inception, the Company has not engaged in any business other than
organizational  efforts, the sale of stock, and the evaluation of potential
acquisition targets.  It has no full-time employees and owns no real property.
The Company intends to seek to acquire one or more existing  businesses that
have existing  management, through  merger or  acquisition.  Management of
the Company will have  virtually unlimited discretion in determining the
business activities in which the Company might engage.



ESTIMATES


The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.



CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS


The Company maintains a cash balance in an interest-bearing account that
currently does not exceed federally insured limits.  For the purpose of
the statements of cash flows, all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.



CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK


At December 31, 2016, and 2015, the Company maintained all of its cash in one
commercial bank.  The Company has not experienced any losses on such accounts.



REVENUE RECOGNITION


The Company recognizes revenue on an accrual basis as it invoices for services.



REPORTING ON THE COSTS OF START-UP ACTIVITIES


ASC 720-15, "Start-Up Costs," which provides guidance on the financial
reporting of start-up costs and organizational costs, requires most costs of
start-up activities and organizational costs to be expensed as incurred.



LOSS PER SHARE


Net loss per share is provided in accordance with ASC 260, "Earnings Per Share".
Basic loss per share is computed by dividing losses available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period.  The Company had no dilutive common stock equivalents, such as
stock options or warrants, as of December 31, 2016.


F6






ADVERTISING COSTS


The Company expenses all costs of advertising as incurred.  There were no
advertising costs included in selling, general and administrative expenses
for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.



FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS


Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions
and pertinent information available to management as of December 31, 2016.
The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments
approximated their fair values. These financial instruments include cash and
accounts payable. Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for
cash and payables because they are short term in nature and their carrying
amounts approximate fair values or they are payable on demand.



SEGMENT REPORTING


The Company follows ASC 280, "Segment Reporting". The Company operates as a
single segment and will evaluate additional segment disclosure requirements
as it expands its operations.



DIVIDENDS


The Company has not yet adopted any policy regarding payment of dividends.
No dividends have been paid or declared since inception.



INCOME TAXES


The Company follows ASC 740, "Income Taxes" for recording the provision for
income taxes.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the
difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and
liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related
asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled.  Deferred income tax
expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability each
period.  If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that
some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a
valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the
amount that is more likely than not to be realized.  Future changes in such
valuation allowance are included in the provision for deferred income taxes
in the period of change.


Deferred income taxes may arise from temporary differences resulting from
income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in
different periods.  Deferred taxes are classified as current or non-current,
depending on the classification of assets and liabilities to which they relate.
Deferred taxes arising from temporary differences that are not related to an
asset or liability are classified as current or non-current depending
on the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.



RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS


We have reviewed the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") accounting
pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during
the periods reported and in future periods. The Company has carefully
considered the new pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted
accounting principles and does not believe that any new or modified principles
will have a material impact on the Company's reported financial position or
operations in the near term.  The applicability of any standard is subject to
the formal review of our financial management and certain standards are under
consideration.  Reference is made to these recent accounting pronouncements as
if they are set forth herein in their entirety.

NOTE 2 - INCOME TAXES



The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740, "Income Taxes", which
requires use of the liability method.  ASC 740 provides that deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial
reporting purposes, referred to as temporary differences.  Deferred tax
assets and liabilities at the end of each period are determined using the
currently enacted tax rates applied to taxable income in the periods in which
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be settled or realized.


The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the
statutory federal income tax rate to income before provision for income taxes.
The sources and tax effects of the differences are as follows:








U.S federal statutory rate       (34.0%)
Valuation reserve                 34.0%
Total                               - %








As of December 31, 2016, the Company has a net operating loss carryforward of
approximately $184,000 for tax purposes, which will be available to offset
future taxable income.  If not used, this carryforward will expire between
2019 and 2036. The deferred tax asset relating to the operating loss
carryforward has been fully reserved at December 31, 2016. The availability of
this operating loss to offset future earnings may be limited under the change
of control provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 381.  For the years
ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the valuation allowance increased by
approximately $4,000 and $2,700, respectively.


Management has concluded that the Company has no uncertain tax positions
requiring disclosure pursuant to ASC 740.  The tax years open for audit are
2013 to 2016.



NOTE 3 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS



The Company currently utilizes the home of its President as a mailing
address "rent free".  The officers and directors of the Company are involved
in other business activities and may, in the future, become involved in other
business opportunities.  If a specific business opportunity becomes available,
such persons may face a conflict in selecting between the Company and their
other business interests.  The Company has not formulated a policy for the
resolution of such conflicts.

NOTE 4 - STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

Common Stock to its directors for cash in the amount of $6,000.


During the fourth quarter 1989, the Company's public offering was declared
effective.  In connection therewith, the Company sold 40,000 units of Common
Stock at $6.00 per unit.  Each unit consisted of six shares of $0.001 par value
common stock, thirty Class A Warrants, thirty Class B Warrants, and thirty
Class C Warrants.  The Class A Warrants, Class B Warrants, and Class C Warrants
expired on July 15, 2004.


The Company granted the underwriters of its initial public offering Warrants to
purchase an aggregate of 4,000 units that were identical in all respects to the
units sold to the public, pursuant to the terms of the underwriting agreement,
at an exercise price of $6.42 per unit.  The underwriter's warrants expired on
July 15, 2004.


On June 30, 2004, the Company issued 10,000 shares of its $0.001 par value
Common Stock to an officer and director of the Company for services valued at
$3,100.

NOTE 6 - GOING CONCERN



The Company has  incurred  net losses of  approximately  $227,128 for the period
from  January 27, 1989 (Inception) through December 31, 2016  and has commenced
limited  operations,  raising  substantial  doubt about the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern. The Company will seek additional sources of capital
through the issuance of debt or equity financing,  but there can be no assurance
the Company will be successful in accomplishing its objectives.


The  ability of the  Company to  continue  as a going  concern is  dependent  on
additional  sources  of  capital  and the  success of the  Company's  plan.  The
financial  statements do not include any adjustments  that might be necessary if
the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

ITEM 9A.  Controls and Procedures.



As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company conducted
an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal
Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
Company's disclosure  controls  and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act").
Based on this evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. Additionally, the
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that
the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.



Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting



Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by the Company's principal executive and principal financial
officers, and effected by the Company's board of directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Our
internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that

(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets, (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and

(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisitions, use, or dispositions of our assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.


12





Management, including the President/Principal Financial Officer and
Secretary/Treasurer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.
Management's evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control
over financial reporting is based on the framework described in "Internal
Control - Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO").


Based on its assessment, management concluded that the Company's internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2016.


This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company's
independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the
Company's independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary
rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management's report
in this Annual Report.


This report shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or otherwise subject to the liabilities
of that section, and is not incorporated by reference into any filing of the
Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of any general
incorporation language in such filing.



Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during
the quarter ended December 31, 2016 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

Exhibit 31.1



Certification Pursuant to Section 302

of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002


I, John P. O'Shea, certify that:


1. I have reviewed this annual report on Form 10-K of Strategic Acquisitions,
Inc. (the "Registrant");


2. Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the

were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;


3. Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects

internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules

a) designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under my supervision,
to ensure that material information relating to the Registrant is made
known to me by others within the Registrant, particularly during the
period in which this report is being prepared. The Registrant has no

d) disclosed in this report any change in the Registrant's internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent

materially affect, the Registrant's internal control over financial
reporting; and


5. I have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of internal control over
financial reporting, to the Registrant's auditors and the audit committee of
the Registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent
functions):


a) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Registrant's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information; and


b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Registrant's internal
control over financial reporting.
