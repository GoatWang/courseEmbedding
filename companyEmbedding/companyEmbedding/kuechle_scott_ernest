He also serves as a director of Esterline Corporation, a specialty manufacturer serving the global aerospace and defense markets, and Wesco Aircraft Holdings, Inc., a provider of comprehensive supply chain management services to the global aerospace industry. Mr. Kuechle's extensive background and experience within the aerospace and defense industry, coupled with his financial expertise and past experience as a Chief Financial Officer, provide the Board with a powerful skill-set upon which to draw as the Company continues to execute on its strategic plan. This type of expertise and experience was particularly important to the Board as a means of providing additional depth of capability to the Audit Committee, to which he was appointed upon his election to the Board. Mr. Kuechle's background also provides the Board with additional perspective on international operations, financial management, acquisitions, and other finance-related matters.
