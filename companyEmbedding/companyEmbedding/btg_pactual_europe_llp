MiFID

The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive ("MiFID" - 2004/39/EC) is a European 
                Directive, which applies to the European Economic Area ("EEA") including all Member 
                States of the European Union as well as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. MiFID's 
                primary objectives are to ensure a single market for financial services, protect investors, 
                foster further competition in the financial services industry and increase market transparency. 
                MiFID concerns almost all financial instruments and investment services, comprising the new 
                architecture for the securities industry across the EEA.
The information displayed on this website concerns investment services provided by BTG Pactual 
                Europe LLP. Here, you will find information on BTG Pactual UK's General Terms and Conditions 
                for Investment Services and its Order Execution Policy.

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].
Since December 3, 2015, BTG Pactual is controlled by the Top Seven Partners, composed of members Marcelo Kalim, Roberto Sallouti, Persio Arida, Antonio Carlos Canto Porto Filho, James Marcos de Oliveira, Renato Monteiro dos Santos and Guilherme da Costa Paes. The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Controversies[edit]
Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

Zeljko Ivic alleged that Banco BTG Pactual SA, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Esteves and Huw Jenkins, a managing partner, made fraudulent misrepresentations to get him to sign agreements with the investment bank, according to a lawsuit filed with the Hong Kong High Court. BTG Pactual raised as much as 3.66 billion reais ($1.66 billion) in its 2012 initial public offering. The sale followed a 2010 agreement to sell a stake to a group including China Investment Corp., GIC Pte. and the Rothschild and Agnelli families. Esteves, 45, is worth $4.2 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, mostly due to his 22 percent stake in BTG Pactual. Jenkins and Hong Kong-based BTG Pactual Asia Ltd., which has also been sued, will vigorously defend the claims, “which they believe to be baseless and without merit,” according to their lawyer Randall Arthur.

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].
Since December 3, 2015, BTG Pactual is controlled by the Top Seven Partners, composed of members Marcelo Kalim, Roberto Sallouti, Persio Arida, Antonio Carlos Canto Porto Filho, James Marcos de Oliveira, Renato Monteiro dos Santos and Guilherme da Costa Paes. The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Controversies[edit]
Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].
Since December 3, 2015, BTG Pactual is controlled by the Top Seven Partners, composed of members Marcelo Kalim, Roberto Sallouti, Persio Arida, Antonio Carlos Canto Porto Filho, James Marcos de Oliveira, Renato Monteiro dos Santos and Guilherme da Costa Paes. The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Controversies[edit]
Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].
Since December 3, 2015, BTG Pactual is controlled by the Top Seven Partners, composed of members Marcelo Kalim, Roberto Sallouti, Persio Arida, Antonio Carlos Canto Porto Filho, James Marcos de Oliveira, Renato Monteiro dos Santos and Guilherme da Costa Paes. The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Controversies[edit]
Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].
Since December 3, 2015, BTG Pactual is controlled by the Top Seven Partners, composed of members Marcelo Kalim, Roberto Sallouti, Persio Arida, Antonio Carlos Canto Porto Filho, James Marcos de Oliveira, Renato Monteiro dos Santos and Guilherme da Costa Paes. The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].
Since December 3, 2015, BTG Pactual is controlled by the Top Seven Partners, composed of members Marcelo Kalim, Roberto Sallouti, Persio Arida, Antonio Carlos Canto Porto Filho, James Marcos de Oliveira, Renato Monteiro dos Santos and Guilherme da Costa Paes. The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Controversies[edit]
Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

Zeljko Ivic alegou que o Banco BTG Pactual SA, o presidente e CEO Esteves e Huw Jenkins, um sócio-gerente, fizeram deturpações fraudulentas para que ele assinasse acordos com o banco de investimentos, conforme uma ação judicial apresentada perante o Supremo Tribunal de Hong Kong.

Andre Esteves, the billionaire founder of Brazil’s BTG Pactual, was sued by a former employee in Hong Kong who claims he was promised a partnership and stock for securing investors before the bank’s initial share sale. Zeljko Ivic alleged that Banco BTG Pactual SA, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Esteves and Huw Jenkins, a managing partner, made fraudulent misrepresentations to get him to sign agreements with the investment bank, according to a lawsuit filed with the Hong Kong High Court. BTG Pactual raised as much as 3.66 billion reais ($1.66 billion) in its 2012 initial public offering. The sale followed a 2010 agreement to sell a stake to a group including China Investment Corp., GIC Pte. and the Rothschild and Agnelli families. Esteves, 45, is worth $4.2 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, mostly due to his 22 percent stake in BTG Pactual. Jenkins and Hong Kong-based BTG Pactual Asia Ltd., which has also been sued, will vigorously defend the claims, “which they believe to be baseless and without merit,” according to their lawyer Randall Arthur. BTG Pactual doesn’t comment on matters under litigation, the Sao Paulo-based bank said in an e-mail response to queries. Shares of the company fell 0.7 percent to 32.22 reais at 10:41 a.m. in Sao Paulo.

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].
Since December 3, 2015, BTG Pactual is controlled by the Top Seven Partners, composed of members Marcelo Kalim, Roberto Sallouti, Persio Arida, Antonio Carlos Canto Porto Filho, James Marcos de Oliveira, Renato Monteiro dos Santos and Guilherme da Costa Paes. The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Founded in 1873 in the city of Lugano, BSI is a financial institution specialized in wealth management for private and corporate clients.

2014: BTG Pactual acquires 100% of the shares of BSI (Banca della Svizzera Italiana).

Controversies[edit]
Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

Mr. ESTEVES filed an administrative appeal, which he subsequently withdrew despite his continuing affirmation that the accusations were unfounded, in order to avoid the expense involved in such an appeal, as well as the time lost.

It is also important to note that, due to its nature, this proceeding does not reflect any criminal consequences.

The AMF claims that Charles Rosier, a banker, tipped Raad off about an impending transaction that involved French state railway SNCF bidding for Geodis, and that Raad bought Geodis shares and options worth €8m in the fortnight leading up to the announcement of the bid.

Der grösste Insiderfall – allerdings kein strafbarer, sondern ein cleverer – ist, wie Esteves zu seiner Bank kam, an der er 27 Prozent be sitzt und die er beherrscht. Er verkaufte die Bank 2006 der UBS für 3,1 Milliarden Franken. Zwei Jahre später kaufte er sie für 2,5 Milliarden zurück und brachte sie 2012 für 14 Milliar den Dollar an die Börse. Verantwortlich für den Kauf der Pactual war 2006 der damaligen UBS-Investmentbanking chef Hew Jenkins. Jenkins wur de da mals kurzzeitig zum Chef von Esteves. Es war unter seiner Ägide, als die UBS einen grossen Teil der Schrott-Hypotheken kaufte, die bei der UBS zu den 60 Milliarden Franken Abschreibungen und letztlich zum Eingreifen des Staates führten.

Presque un an plus tard, le rachat doit toujours être validé par la Finma. Si le délai peut sembler long, c’est que le feu vert de l’autorité de surveillance des marchés financiers est lié, en partie, au dossier fiscal américain.

The sale followed a 2010 agreement to sell a stake to a group including China Investment Corp., GIC Pte. and the Rothschild and Agnelli families. Esteves, 45, is worth $4.2 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, mostly due to his 22 percent stake in BTG Pactual. Jenkins and Hong Kong-based BTG Pactual Asia Ltd., which has also been sued, will vigorously defend the claims, “which they believe to be baseless and without merit,” according to their lawyer Randall Arthur. BTG Pactual doesn’t comment on matters under litigation, the Sao Paulo-based bank said in an e-mail response to queries. Shares of the company fell 0.7 percent to 32.22 reais at 10:41 a.m. in Sao Paulo. Ivic is seeking more than $20 million as damages for the value of the shares and partnership promised, as well as unpaid bonuses, his lawyer Robert Tibbo said.

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].
Since December 3, 2015, BTG Pactual is controlled by the Top Seven Partners, composed of members Marcelo Kalim, Roberto Sallouti, Persio Arida, Antonio Carlos Canto Porto Filho, James Marcos de Oliveira, Renato Monteiro dos Santos and Guilherme da Costa Paes. The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Controversies[edit]
Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

Andre Esteves, the billionaire founder of Brazil’s BTG Pactual, was sued by a former employee in Hong Kong who claims he was promised a partnership and stock for securing investors before the bank’s initial share sale. Zeljko Ivic alleged that Banco BTG Pactual SA, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Esteves and Huw Jenkins, a managing partner, made fraudulent misrepresentations to get him to sign agreements with the investment bank, according to a lawsuit filed with the Hong Kong High Court. BTG Pactual raised as much as 3.66 billion reais ($1.66 billion) in its 2012 initial public offering. The sale followed a 2010 agreement to sell a stake to a group including China Investment Corp., GIC Pte. and the Rothschild and Agnelli families. Esteves, 45, is worth $4.2 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, mostly due to his 22 percent stake in BTG Pactual. Jenkins and Hong Kong-based BTG Pactual Asia Ltd., which has also been sued, will vigorously defend the claims, “which they believe to be baseless and without merit,” according to their lawyer Randall Arthur. BTG Pactual doesn’t comment on matters under litigation, the Sao Paulo-based bank said in an e-mail response to queries. Shares of the company fell 0.7 percent to 32.22 reais at 10:41 a.m. in Sao Paulo.

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].
Since December 3, 2015, BTG Pactual is controlled by the Top Seven Partners, composed of members Marcelo Kalim, Roberto Sallouti, Persio Arida, Antonio Carlos Canto Porto Filho, James Marcos de Oliveira, Renato Monteiro dos Santos and Guilherme da Costa Paes. The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Controversies[edit]
Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

Jenkins and Hong Kong-based BTG Pactual Asia Ltd., which has also been sued, will vigorously defend the claims, “which they believe to be baseless and without merit,” according to their lawyer Randall Arthur. BTG Pactual doesn’t comment on matters under litigation, the Sao Paulo-based bank said in an e-mail response to queries. Shares of the company fell 0.7 percent to 32.22 reais at 10:41 a.m. in Sao Paulo. Ivic is seeking more than $20 million as damages for the value of the shares and partnership promised, as well as unpaid bonuses, his lawyer Robert Tibbo said.
