Finding it hard to decide whether to major in engineering, architecture or computer science, his father urged him to major in business and explore his other interests throughout life.  Russ started his first software company in the early 80’s while working as an employee of OSU. During the ensuing 30 years, Russ became a serial entrepreneur and software product inventor.  In the software industry, his forte is the development of solutions that integrate existing and emerging large-scale information technology.  Even though his customers have always been outside Oklahoma, his family chose to stay in Stillwater and become part of the community.  Russ’ love of Stillwater, and fascination with solving complex integration problems, underlies his 20 year commitment to restore a collection of historical buildings in downtown Stillwater.  The challenge of infusing century-old buildings with art, architecture and design elements from around the world became his hobby – as well as a concrete example of what he enjoys in the software world.  Russ is the CEO of HostBridge Technology, a company he co-founded in 2000.  He also serves as Chairman of Southwest Bancorp (NASDAQ:OKSB), the parent company of Bank SNB.ExperienceFounder & CEOHostBridge Technology (www.hostbridge.com)January 2000  –  Present (17 years 7 months)HostBridge products enable organizations to rapidly integrate mainframe data and applications with web applications, other enterprise or distributed applications.Running on the IBM z Systems mainframe, HostBridge integrates CICS transactions, programs, and z Systems data with any distributed resource – Web and mobile applications, enterprise applications, service-oriented architectures (SOA), and cloud architectures. Standards-based HostBridge makes mainframe integration fast, flexible, and powerful.Owner and Lead DesignerBackstage Stillwater (www.backstagestillwater.com)2014  –  Present (3 years)Backstage is an event space that invites you to wonder about the past, draw inspiration for the present, and think creatively about the future.Through the integration of art, architecture and craftsmanship, Backstage represents 120 years of shared history and creates a context to consider what’s next.While steeped in history, Backstage is a space that encourages new thoughts, new perspectives and new plans. I hope it will help people re-imagine our city, state and region. I also hope it provokes questions, perhaps springing from a sense of disorientation: “Where am I?” “What is this place?” “How did this happen?” Many different types of gatherings will occur in this space -- business meetings, philanthropic and musical events, art openings, receptions and private dining -- both serious and fun. But whatever their nature, I hope the venue causes those in attendance to wonder about our past, draw inspiration for the present, and think creatively about our future.Chairman of the BoardSouthwest Bancorp (www.oksb.com)January 2013  –  Present (4 years 7 months)Bank SNB is a subsidiary of Southwest Bancorp., Inc. Founded in 1894, Bank SNB is headquarted in Stillwater, OK with offices in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and Colorado. Bank SNB offers commercial and consumer lending, deposit, investment services, specialized cash management, consulting and other financial services.DirectorCowboy Technologies2011  –  Present (6 years)Cowboy Technologies was organized in 2011 as a for-profit, limited-liability company owned by the OSU Research Foundation to be a catalyst for commercializing Oklahoma State University technology through successful startup companies. The Cowboy Technologies' mission runs parallel with that of Oklahoma State University’s land grant mission of taking university research from "CAMPUS TO COMMUNITY".DirectorOSU Research FoundationJanuary 2000  –  Present (17 years 7 months)Advisory Council MemberOSU Museum of ArtMay 2013  –  Present (4 years 3 months)DirectorSouthwest Bancorp1999  –  Present (18 years)Bank SNB is a subsidiary of Southwest Bancorp., Inc. Founded in 1894, Bank SNB is headquarted in Stillwater, OK with offices in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and Colorado. Bank SNB offers commercial and consumer lending, deposit, investment services, specialized cash management, consulting and other financial services.ProprietorTeubner Properties1988  –  Present (29 years)It all started innocently enough... I needed a place to house the outstanding employees of Teubner & Associates in the late 80's.  They deserved a great space to work within -- something that connected them to WHAT they did, and WHO they did it for.  Somehow, it took on a life of it's own.  Does investing in the downtown district of a pre-statehood northern Oklahoma community possibly make sense?  It does if it's become your home.ProjectsIBM Impact 2014 SpeakerStarting May 2014Tales from the Trenches: CICS Integration and OptimizationTeam members: Russell TeubnerCertificationsPrivate PilotFAA2000  –  PresentIBM Champion 2017 - AnalyticsIBMJanuary 2017  –  January 2018Volunteer Experience & CausesSupporterOklahoma WONDERtorium2010  –  Present (7 years)ChildrenI have never observed a more passionate and dedicated group of social entrepreneurs seeking to create a fantastic resource for the children and families of in this area.Honors & AwardsSpears School of Business: 100 for 100Oklahoma State UniversityMay 2014http://spears.okstate.edu/tributes/week-6/Russell-W-Teubner/Honorary MemberNational Academy of InventorsFebruary 2014From Oklahoma State University, a Member InstitutionDistinguished Entrepreneur of the YearOklahoma State University Riata Center for Entrepreneurship2010Inc 5000Inc Magazine2008Hall of Fame InducteeOklahoma State University College of Business1999Family Friendly Employment CommendationThe White House1998The Teubner's, and their daughter Jennie, were honored by President and Mrs. Clinton during a White House Rose Garden Ceremony which recognized a select group of companies and business owners who promote family-friendly employment policies within their organizations.Distinguished Alumni AwardOklahoma State University1997Inc 500Inc Magazine1994Outstanding Young OklahomanOklahoma Jaycees1993Inc 500Inc Magazine1993Citizen of the YearStillwater Chamber of Commerce1992Inc 500Inc Magazine1992PublicationsIntegrating the Mainframe using XMLPrentice Hall PTRXML Handbook (Chapter 14)Edited by Charles Goldfarb and Paul PrescodAuthors: Russell TeubnerLiving with Legacy NetworksPrentice Hall PTRSNA and TCP/IP Enterprise Networking (Chapter 16)Edited by Daniel Lynch, James Gray and Edward RabinovitchAuthors: Russell TeubnerIntegrating Web Technology and Enterprise SytemsPrentice Hall PTRSNA and TCP/IP Enterprise Networking (Chapter 18)Edited by Daniel Lynch, James Gray and Edward RabinovitchAuthors: Russell Teubner, Donald CzubekUS Patent 6,981,257 B2  System, Method, Apparatus to allow communication between CICS and non-CICS software applicationsUnited States Patent OfficeDecember 2005Authors: Russell TeubnerPatentsSystem, method and apparatus to allow communication between CICS and non-CICS software applicationsUnited States 6981257 B2Issued January 2002Inventors: Russell Teubner, Scott GlennSkillsEnterprise SoftwareXMLSoftware DevelopmentEnterprise ArchitectureSolution SellingStart-upsStrategic PartnershipsIntegrationProduct ManagementCloud ComputingSaaSSQLMergers & AcquisitionsSOASoftware Project ManagementSee 35+Go-to-market StrategyIT StrategyLead GenerationProgram ManagementManagementSalesforce.comWeb ServicesSoftware IndustryProfessional ServicesBusiness IntelligenceProduct MarketingCorporate GovernanceIBM MainframeMainframe ArchitectureCICSBoard of DirectorsMainframeExecutive ManagementEntrepreneurshipBig DataStrategyStartup DevelopmentMobile DevicesMobile ApplicationsE-commercePre-salesAgile MethodologiesArchitecturesDatabasesSoftware DesignSolution ArchitectureDisaster RecoveryArchitectureLeadershipService-Oriented Architecture (SOA)See lessHow's this translation?Great•Has errorsThanks for your help!EducationOklahoma State UniversityBS, Management Science and Computer SystemsBS, Management Science and Computer Systems1974  –  1978University of Pennsylvania - The Wharton SchoolExecutive Education ProgramExecutive Education Program2011Corporate Governance Program – Best Practice for DirectorsHarvard Business SchoolExecutive Education ProgramExecutive Education Program2008Compensation Committee: New Challenges, New SolutionsAudit Committees in a New Era of GovernanceStanford University Law SchoolDirectors CollegeDirectors College2002MIT Birthing of Giants Program1994  –  1996A Professional Development Program for EntrepreneursNathan Hale High School (Tulsa, OK)1972  –  1974LanguagesEnglishGroupsMainframe (COBOL,JCL,DB2,IMS,CICS,VSAM,z/OS,Adabas/Natural) ExpertsEnterprise SystemsOklahoma State University Alumni AssociationMainframe Experts NetworkMainframeSupport tip userMainframe Products and Services: Announcements, Conferences, Training, Webinars, etcMainframe Assembler ProfessionalsSee 2 moreCICS TSSoftware CEOSee lessView Russell’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Russell directlyView Russell’s Full ProfileView this profile in another languageEnglishChinese (Simplified)GermanPeople Also ViewedDebi WillisCEO at PatientLink Enterprises, Inc.Nancy NardiCo Founder at BE MYDOHolt BeckyClassroom Teacher at Stillwater Junior High SchoolMelissa VincentCo Founder at Locked In Sports & CEO of 9Tribe, LLCNathan PriestOwner, Nate's Tree Service LLC, Yucca Pointe Landscape Co.

Russ Teubner
 Russ Teubner, CEO
 Mr. Teubner is a seasoned entrepreneur within the software industry. Much of his 22-year career has focused on the development and delivery of software products that integrate existing and emerging technologies within large organizations. Since many large organizations rely heavily on IBM mainframes and applications, Russ has focused much of his creative energy on solving the difficult problems associated with the integration of these legacy systems with technologies that have emerged or evolved more recently. He is recognized as a pioneer in the integration of IBM mainframes and applications with UNIX systems, TCP/IP networks, facsimile transmission networks and, most recently, the World Wide Web. 
Having brought the first solution to allow 3270 terminals to access UNIX systems and the web-to-host (W2H) product to market in 1995, Russ knows firsthand the difficulties in developing host access solutions that meet the needs of large enterprises. As the infrastructure around e-commerce and eBusiness matured, he quickly recognized the importance of the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) as a data delivery tool that could enable CICS applications to communicate with other XML-enabled applications. This led to the the development of HostBridge, an easy-to-use solution that runs on OS/390 and enables CICS applications to emit XML for use in e-commerce and eBusiness.
Corporate highlights: 
Teubner and Associates. Russ’ founded his first company in 1983. Over 15 years, Teubner and Associates developed four product lines (A-Net, Corridor, Faxgate, and ESP: The Expert Support Program) and spread its reach to include customers in 35 countries on six continents. Teubner was named to Inc. Magazine’s list of the 500 fastest growing privately held companies in America three consecutive years
 Esker. In 1997, Teubner and Associates merged with French-based Esker S.A. to form Esker, Inc. Russ currently serves on the Esker Supervisory Board. 
Russ also serves on the Board of Directors of Southwest Bancorp, Inc.(NASDAQ: OKSB) and iTradeFair
 Personal highlights:
1992, Stillwater Chamber of Commerce recognized Russ as Citizen of the Year
 1993, Russ received the Outstanding Young Oklahoman award from the Oklahoma Jaycees
 1996, Graduate of the MIT Birthing of Giants program

 1998, Russ and his wife Julie were honored by President and Mrs. Clinton during a White House Rose Garden Ceremony which recognized a select group of companies and business owners who promote family-friendly employment policies within their organizations and communities
