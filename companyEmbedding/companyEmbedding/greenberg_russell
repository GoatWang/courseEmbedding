Through chance I discovered Russell after asking around in my network for someone who would know how to help me create the world's first 365 day timepiece with artistry and aplomb. Turns out the project was a custom fit for his expertise in design, creative direction, sourcing and the utilization of his crackshot team of talent at Rux. 

I've had the pleasure of continuing a working relationship with Russell as The Present has expanded over time. The elegance of the timepiece we created together has everything to do with his deep understanding of architectural simplicity & truth. 

Russell helped me turn my idea into a work of art and I'm certain he can do the same for you.    See moreSee lessI cannot use enough superlatives to describe Russell's talents.  Not only is he a Brilliant designer, but he has the unique gift of being able to communicate his designs  with verbal and visual precision (he is a notably adept communicator).  We look to him not only for his design services but for his consistently rigorous and always valuable input on strategic matters.  His business and design acumen AND wonderful sense of humor make him a constant delight to work with.  We are fortunate to have him as part of our team.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended RussellGroupsYale University School of ArchitectureView Russell’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Russell directlyView Russell’s Full ProfileNot the Russell you’re looking for?

Profile


Russell “Chip” Gaudreau has a broad range of experience defending companies in complex product liability and mass tort litigations. His engagements have focused primarily on the pharmaceutical, medical device & health care industries; however, he has also worked on national litigations involving automobiles, safety equipment, financial services/sales practices and toxic torts.
Chip’s main focus is achieving the right outcome for clients in litigation. To that end, he provides all-inclusive strategic litigation management and resolution strategies that are narrowly tailored to the client’s financial needs and ultimate goals. He works with a large team of litigators, both inside and outside of GT, and helps to manage and coordinate their efforts on a nationwide basis.


He routinely designs and implements creative alternative fee arrangements, and manages those arrangements during the life of an engagement to avoid surprises and provide predictability in “outside counsel” legal spend. In fact, Chip often works hand-in-hand with his client’s and their legal finance departments, to provide complete transparency in the level of work being performed and to ensure that any expected financial targets will be met.

Russell Greenberg: Pioneering Ornithologist
November 4, 2013 by Steve Monfort

Photo by Jeffrey MacMillanAll of us at the National Zoo are deeply saddened by the passing of Russell Greenberg, a pioneering ornithologist and founder of the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center.  Russ was a treasured friend, mentor and colleague to so many of us.  He was a visionary who was among the first to recognize a precipitous decline in Neotropical migratory bird populations, and an innovator who invented the concept of “shade-grown” coffee as a bird-friendly product, and for developing the rigorous science-based criteria now used in Smithsonian Bird Friendly coffee.Russ displayed a precocious affinity to birds.  He started his “life list” of bird sightings at age eight and maintained a passion for ornithology throughout his youth, hitchhiking around the Golden State in search of birds and earning a Bachelor’s degree and PhD in zoology from the University of California at Berkeley.  All of us knew Russ as an intellectual powerhouse, but also recognized his exceedingly dry humor and flawless deadpan.  Colleagues still talk about the color slide he liked to use in his talks—supposedly an aerial view of lowland tropical forest, but actually a photo of the broccoli display he took at the Berkeley Bowl supermarket.Eschewing the charismatic species that attract so many birders, Russ dedicated most of his career to studies of nature’s more subtly colored fliers in lowland tropical forests and wetlands including wintering warblers, vireos, antwrens, swamp sparrows and rusty blackbirds.  From observations of these under-appreciated species he derived a number of groundbreaking insights into avian behavior, evolution, and ecology. His most recent work brought ecological and evolutionary evidence to bear on an emerging and surprising recognition that, beyond their obvious utility for nabbing insects and hulling seeds, bird beaks serve an important role in the regulation of avian body temperature. Russ was a strong advocate for science education and for inspiring the public about the wonders the great phenomenon of bird migration. He founded Migratory Bird Day, a festival to celebrate the arrival of migratory songbirds back to their northern breeding areas, now celebrated at 700 venues throughout the Western hemisphere.  And Russ had a vision for making the Zoo’s Bird House the public “store front” highlighting the science and marvels of bird migrations.  As we move forward with Bird House renovations in the years to come, “Marvelous Migrations” will help to ensure Russ’s legacy by bringing the ornithological sciences to millions of guests each year.Russ was passionate about graduate and post graduate training, and he served as a mentor or advisor to more than 70 postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and research interns.  To honor him and to ensure his important work continues, we are establishing the "Russ Greenberg Fellowship Fund" at the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center to support graduate and post graduate training.  If you wish to contribute, please contact Lesli Creedon at 202-633-3022 / creedonl@si.edu.Our hearts go out to Russ's family and friends at this difficult time, especially to his wife and early scientific collaborator, Judy Gradwohl, and to their children, Natalie and Jeremy.RemembrancesWashington PostOrnithology ExchangeMigratory Connectivity ProjectSmithsonian TorchVirginia Society of Ornithology - page 3Capital Area Audubon - page 5Bird Watching Magazine

Product Description


This is a state-of-the-science book about organizational justice, which is the study of peoples perception of fairness in organizations. The volumes contributors, all acknowledged leaders in this burgeoning field, present new theoretical positions, clarify existing paradigms, and identify future areas of application.The first chapter provides a comprehensive framework that integrates and synthesizes key concepts in the field: distributive justice, procedural justice, and retributive justice. The second chapter is a full theoretical analysis of how people use fairness judgments as means of guiding their reactions to organizations and their authorities.The subsequent two chapters examine the conceptual interrelationships between various forms of organizational justice. First, we are given a definitive review and analysis of interactional justice that critically assesses the evidence bearing on its validity. The next chapter argues that previous research has underemphasized important similarities between distributive and procedural justice, and suggests new research directions for establishing these similarities.The three following chapters focus on the social and interpersonal antecedents of justice judgments: the influence that expectations of justice and injustice can have on work-related attitudes and behavior; the construction of a model of the determinants and consequences of normative beliefs about justice in organizations that emphasizes the role of cross-cultural norms; and the potential impact of diversity and multiculturalism on the viability of organizations.The books final chapter identifies seven canons of organizational justice and warns that in the absence of additional conceptual refinement these canons may operate as loose cannons that threaten the existence of justice as a viable construct in the organizational sciences.

The authors argue that we need only understand how our minds function in order to unlock shortcuts to switches in behaviour.
