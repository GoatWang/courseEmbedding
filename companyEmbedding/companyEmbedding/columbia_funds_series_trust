Disclosures

1 In U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2016. Source Ameriprise Q2 Earnings Release. Includes all assets managed by entities in the Columbia and Threadneedle group of companies. Contact us for more current data.
2Source: ICI as of December 31, 2016 for Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC.
3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.

1 In U.S. dollars as of December 31, 2016. Source Ameriprise Q2 Earnings Release. Includes all assets managed by entities in the Columbia and Threadneedle group of companies. Contact us for more current data.
2Source: ICI as of December 31, 2016 for Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC.
3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.

Responsibilities of Board with respect to fund management  The Board oversees management of the Trust and the Funds. The Board is chaired by an Independent Trustee who has significant additional responsibilities compared to the other Board members, including,
among other things: setting the agenda for Board meetings, communicating and meeting regularly with Board members between Board and committee meetings on fund-related matters with the Funds Chief Compliance Officer (CCO), counsel to the
Independent Trustees, and representatives of the Funds service providers and overseeing Board Services Corporation (Board Services), which serves as an agent of the Funds for purposes of administering the payment of Trustee compensation, to
provide office space for use by the Funds and the Board, and to provide any other services to the Board or the Trustees as may be reasonably requested.  The Board initially approves an Investment Management Services Agreement and other contracts with the Adviser and its affiliates, and other service providers. Once the contracts are approved, the Board
monitors the level and quality of services including commitments of service providers to achieve expected levels of investment performance and shareholder services. The Board evaluates the services received under the contracts by receiving reports
covering investment performance, shareholder services, marketing, and the Advisers profitability in order to determine whether to continue existing contracts or negotiate new contracts. The Adviser is responsible for day-to-day management and
administration of the Funds and management of the risks that arise from the Funds investments and operations. The Boards oversight of the Adviser and other service providers in the operation of the Trust includes oversight with respect
to various risk management functions. The Funds are subject to a number of risks, including investment, compliance, operational, and valuation risks, among others. Day-to-day risk management functions are subsumed within the responsibilities of the
Adviser, the sub-advisers and other service providers (depending on the nature of the risk), who carry out the Funds investment management and business affairs. Each of the Adviser, the sub-advisers and other service providers has its own,
independent interest in risk management, and its policies and methods of carrying out risk management functions will depend, in part, on its analysis of the risks, functions and business models. 
Risk oversight forms part of the Boards general oversight of the Funds and is addressed as part of various Board and Committee
activities. The Board recognizes that it is not possible to identify all of the risks that may affect a Fund or to develop processes and controls to eliminate or even mitigate their occurrence or effects. As part of its regular oversight of the
Trust, the Board, directly or through a Committee, interacts with and reviews reports from, among others, the Adviser, sub-advisers, the independent registered public accounting firm for the Funds, and internal auditors for the Adviser or its
affiliates, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by the Funds and relevant risk functions. The Board also meets periodically with the Funds CCO, to receive reports regarding the compliance of the Funds and their principal service providers
with the federal securities laws and their internal compliance policies and procedures. The Board, with the assistance of the Investment Review Committee, reviews investment policies in connection with its review of the Funds performance, and
meets periodically with the portfolio managers of the Funds to receive reports regarding the management of the Funds, including various investment risks. As part of the Boards periodic review of the Funds advisory, subadvisory and other
service provider agreements, the Board may consider risk management aspects of their operations and the functions for which they are responsible. In addition, the Board oversees processes that are in place to assure compliance with applicable rules,
regulations and investment policies and addresses possible conflicts of interest.  Committees of the Board 
The Board has organized the following standing committees to facilitate its work: Board Governance Committee, Compliance Committee,
Contracts Committee, Executive Committee, Investment Review Committee and Audit Committee. These committees are comprised solely of Independent Trustees (for these purposes, persons who are not affiliated persons of the Adviser or Ameriprise
Financial). The table above describing each Trustee also includes their respective committee memberships. The duties of these committees are described below. 
  7 


Mr. Lewis, as Chair of the Board, acts as a point of contact between the Independent
Trustees and the Adviser between Board meetings in respect of general matters.  Board Governance Committee 
Recommends to the Board the size, structure and composition of the Board and its committees; the compensation to be paid to members of the Board; and a process for evaluating the Boards performance. The committee also reviews candidates for
Board membership including candidates recommended by shareholders. The committee also makes recommendations to the Board regarding responsibilities and duties of the Board, oversees proxy voting and supports the work of the Board Chair in relation
to furthering the interests of the Funds and their shareholders on external matters.  To be considered as a candidate for
trustee, recommendations must include a curriculum vitae and be mailed to the Chair of the Board, Columbia Family of Funds, 901 Marquette Avenue South, Suite 2810, Minneapolis, MN 55402-3268. To be timely for consideration by the committee, the
submission, including all required information, must be submitted in writing not less than 120 days before the date of the proxy statement for the previous years annual meeting of shareholders, if such a meeting is held. The committee will
consider only one candidate submitted by such a shareholder or group for nomination for election at a meeting of shareholders. The committee will not consider self-nominated candidates or candidates nominated by members of a candidates family,
including such candidates spouse, children, parents, uncles, aunts, grandparents, nieces and nephews.  The committee
will consider and evaluate candidates submitted by the nominating shareholder or group on the basis of the same criteria as those used to consider and evaluate candidates submitted from other sources. The committee may take into account a wide
variety of factors in considering trustee candidates, including (but not limited to): (i) the candidates knowledge in matters relating to the investment company industry; (ii) any experience possessed by the candidate as a trustee or
senior officer of other public or private companies; (iii) the candidates educational background; (iv) the candidates reputation for high ethical standards and personal and professional integrity; (v) any specific
financial, technical or other expertise possessed by the candidate, and the extent to which such expertise would complement the Boards existing mix of skills and qualifications; (vi) the candidates perceived ability to contribute to
the ongoing functions of the Board, including the candidates ability and commitment to attend meetings regularly, work collaboratively with other members of the Board and carry out his or her duties in the best interests of the fund;
(vii) the candidates ability to qualify as an independent trustee; and (viii) such other criteria as the committee determines to be relevant in light of the existing composition of the Board and any anticipated vacancies or other
factors.  Members of the committee (and/or the Board) also meet personally with each nominee to evaluate the candidates
ability to work effectively with other members of the Board, while also exercising independent judgment. Although the Board does not have a formal diversity policy, the Board endeavors to comprise itself of members with a broad mix of professional
and personal backgrounds. Thus, the committee and the Board accorded particular weight to the individual professional background of each Independent Trustee, as encapsulated in their bios included in the table above. 
The Board believes that the Funds are well-served by a Board, the membership of which consists of persons that represent a broad mix of
professional and personal backgrounds. In considering nominations, the committee takes the following matrix into account in assessing how a candidates professional background would fit into the mix of experiences represented by the
then-current Board.

 With respect to the trusteeship of Mr. Truscott, who is not an Independent Trustee, the
committee and the Board have concluded that having a senior member of the Adviser serve on the Board can facilitate the Independent Trustees increased access to information regarding the Funds Adviser, which is the Funds most
significant service provider. With respect to the trusteeship of Dr. Santomero, the committee and the Board have concluded that, despite his lack of technical independence of the Funds under the 1940 Act (arising from his board service to
Citigroup, Inc. and Citigroup, N.A.), he could serve with substantive independence primarily since he has no financial interest or relationship with the Adviser or Ameriprise Financial. The committee and the Board also took into account
Dr. Santomeros broad array of experiences from management consulting to academia to public service, which can complement well the mix of experiences represented by the other Board members. 
Compliance Committee  Supports the Funds maintenance of a strong compliance program by providing a forum for
Independent Trustees to consider compliance matters impacting the Funds or their key service providers; developing and implementing, in coordination with the Funds CCO, a process for the review and consideration of compliance reports that are
provided to the Board; and providing a designated forum for the Funds CCO to meet with Independent Trustees on a regular basis to discuss compliance matters.

similar function as the current Boards Investment Review Committee).

The section of the SAI entitled FUND GOVERNANCE  The Board  Compensation is modified by adding the following at the end of
the section:  The Independent Trustees determine the amount of compensation that they receive, including the
amount paid to the Chair of the Board. In determining compensation for the Independent Trustees, the Independent Trustees take into account a variety of factors including, among other things, their collective significant work experience (e.g., in
business and finance, government or academia). The Independent Trustees also recognize that these individuals advice and counsel are in demand by other organizations, that these individuals may reject other opportunities because the time
demands of their duties as Independent Trustees, and that they undertake significant legal responsibilities. The Independent Trustees also consider the compensation paid to independent board members of other mutual fund complexes of comparable size.
In determining the compensation paid to the Board Chair, the Independent Trustees take into account, among other things, the Board Chairs significant additional responsibilities (e.g., setting the agenda for Board meetings, communicating or
meeting regularly with the Funds CCO, counsel to the Independent Trustees, and the Funds service providers) which result in a significantly greater time commitment required of the Board Chair. The Board Chairs compensation,
therefore, has generally been set at a level between 2.5 and 3 times the level of compensation paid to other independent Board members. In 2011, the Boards Chair will receive total annual cash compensation of $430,000. 
Effective June 1, 2011, Independent Trustees and Dr. Santomero will be paid an annual retainer of $165,000. Committee Chairs
each receive an additional annual retainer of $20,000 and subcommittee Chairs each receive an additional retainer of $5,000. In addition, Independent Trustees and Dr. Santomero are paid the following fees for attending Board and committee
meetings: $5,000 per day of in-person Board meetings and $2,500 per day of in-person committee or sub-committee meetings (if such meetings are not held on the same day as a Board meeting). Independent Trustees are and Dr. Santomero not paid for
special meetings conducted by telephone.  Independent Trustee Compensation for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2011

Supplement 
dated March 10, 2017
to 
each of the following Statements of Additional Information (each an SAI and 
collectively the SAIs):




SAI 
SAI Dated 

Columbia Funds Series Trust I 
3/10/2017 

Columbia Funds Series Trust and Columbia Funds Series 
      Trust II 
3/1/2017 
Effective 
on or about March 27, 2017, shares held by Class I shareholders will be 
exchanged for Class Y shares of the same Fund in a tax-free transaction with no 
impact on the fees and expenses paid by shareholders and Class I shares of the 
Funds will no longer be offered for sale. Therefore, effective on or about March 
27, 2017, all information regarding Class I shares is hereby deleted from each 
SAI. In addition, effective April 10, 2017, Appendix S to each SAI is hereby 
superseded and replaced with the information in this Supplement.
APPENDIX 
S — MORE INFORMATION ABOUT CHOOSING A SHARE CLASS
The 
Fund’s prospectus contains information relative to choosing a share class. The 
information in this Appendix S should be read in conjunction with the 
information contained in the prospectus. With regard to any sales charge waivers 
and discounts described in this Appendix S and the prospectus, it is your 
obligation to advise your financial intermediary or (in the case of 
Direct-at-Fund Accounts, as defined in the prospectus) the Transfer Agent that 
you qualify for any waiver or reduced sales change and be prepared to provide 
proof thereof.
Class 
Y — Historical Changes to Share Class Eligibility
Current 
Class Y eligibility is disclosed in the Fund’s prospectus, as supplemented (as 
the case may be). The following is certain historical information with respect 
to Class Y shares:
Prior 
to November 8, 2012, Class Y shares were offered only to certain former 
shareholders of series of the former Columbia Funds Institutional Trust 
(together, Former CFIT Shareholders). Former CFIT Shareholders who opened and 
funded a Class Y account with a Fund as of the close of business on November 7, 
2012 may continue to make additional purchases of Class Y shares even if they do 
not satisfy the current eligibility requirements but may not establish new Class 
Y shares accounts and will not be eligible to exchange Class Y shares of a Fund 
into Class Y shares of other Funds. Former CFIT Shareholders may exchange Class 
Y shares of a Fund for Class Z shares of the same Fund or Class Z shares of 
another Fund, subject to applicable minimum investments.
Certain 
Historical Changes to Share Class Names
Effective 
October 25, 2012, Class R4 shares were renamed Class K shares. Effective October 
31, 2012, Class R3 shares were renamed Class R4 shares. Prior to September 3, 
2010, any Class R shares of a series of CFST II were known as Class R2 shares. 
Class T shares existing on January 23, 2017 were renamed as Class V shares on 
January 24, 2017. Effective March 27, 2017, Class W shares were renamed as Class 
T shares.

The 
minimum initial investment in Class Z shares for the following categories of

      an asset management company, trust, fiduciary, retirement plan 
      administration or similar arrangement with Bank of America or the 
      subsidiary. 

■ 
    
Any 
      employee (or family member of an employee) of Bank of America or one of 
      its subsidiaries. 

■ 
    
Any 
      investor buying shares through a Columbia Management state tuition plan 
      organized under Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code.

As 
described in the prospectuses, any shareholder (as well as any family member of 
a shareholder or person listed on an account registration for any account of the 
shareholder) of another fund distributed by the Distributor who holds Class Z 
shares is eligible to purchase Class Z shares subject to a minimum initial 
investment of $2,000. If the account in which the shareholder holds Class Z 
shares is not eligible to purchase additional Class Z shares, the shareholder 
may purchase Class Z shares in an account maintained directly with the Transfer 
Agent, subject to the $2,000 minimum for such direct account.
Class 
B Shares — Conversion to Class A Shares
Class 
B shares purchased in a series of CFST, CFST I or CFST II (other than Class B 
shares purchased in a former Seligman Fund on or prior to June 12, 2009) 
automatically convert to Class A shares after you’ve owned the shares for eight 
years, except for Class B shares of Columbia Short Term Municipal Bond Fund, 
which do not convert to Class A shares. Class B shares originally purchased in a 
former Seligman Fund on or prior to June 12, 2009 will convert to Class A shares 
in the month prior to the ninth year of ownership. The conversion feature allows 
you to benefit from the lower operating costs of Class A shares, which can help 
increase your total returns from an investment in the fund.
The 
following rules apply to the conversion of Class B shares to Class A 
shares:




■ 
    
Class 
      B shares are converted on or about the 15th day of the month that they 
      become eligible for conversion. For purposes of determining the month when 
      your Class B shares are eligible for conversion, the start of the holding 
      period is the first day of the month in which your purchase was made. 
  

■ 
    
Any 
      shares you received from reinvested distributions on these shares 
      generally will convert to Class A shares at the same time. 

■ 
    
You’ll 
      receive the same dollar value of Class A shares as the Class B shares that 
      were converted. Class B shares that you received from an exchange of Class 
      B shares of another fund will convert based on the day you bought the 
      original shares. 

■ 
    
No 
      sales charge or other charges apply, and conversions are free from U.S. 
      federal income tax. 
Class 
F Shares — Conversion to Class E Shares*
The 
following rules apply to the conversion of Class F shares to Class E 
shares:




■ 
    
Class 
      F shares are converted on or about the 15th day of the month that they 
      become eligible for conversion. For purposes of determining the month when 
      your Class F shares are eligible for conversion, the start of the holding 
      period is the first day of the month in which your purchase was made. 
  

■ 
    
Any 
      shares you received from reinvested distributions on these shares 
      generally will convert to Class E shares at the same time. 

■ 
    
You’ll 
      receive the same dollar value of Class E shares as the Class F shares that 
      were converted. Class F shares that you received from an exchange of Class 
      F shares of another Fund will convert based on the day you bought the 
      original shares.

No 
      sales charge or other charges apply, and conversions are free from U.S. 
      federal income tax. 





* 
    
The 
      Funds no longer accept investments from new or existing investors in Class 
      E or Class F shares, except by existing Class E and/ or Class F 
      shareholders who opened and funded their account prior to September 22, 
      2006 that may continue to invest in Class E and/or Class F shares. See the 
      prospectus offering Class E and Class F shares of Large Cap Growth Fund 
      for details. 
Shares 
of Multi-Manager Strategies Funds
The 
Multi-Manager Strategies Funds offer 
Class A shares and Class Z shares that are available only through certain wrap 
fee programs sponsored and/or managed by Ameriprise Financial or its affiliates. 
The minimum initial investment for Class A shares and Class Z shares of the 
Multi-Manager Strategies Funds is $100, 
and each share class has no minimum additional investment. Shares of the 
Multi-Manager Strategies Funds are not 
subject to any front-end sales charge or CDSC. See the Fund’s prospectus for 
additional information.
Fund 
Reorganizations
Class 
A shares may be issued without any initial sales charge in connection with the 
acquisition of cash and securities owned by other investment companies. Any CDSC 
will be waived in connection with the redemption of shares of the fund if the 
fund is combined with another fund or in connection with a similar 
reorganization transaction.
Rejection 
of Purchases
Each 
fund and the distributor of the funds reserve the right to reject any offer to 
purchase shares, in their sole discretion.
Restrictions 
and Changes in Terms and Conditions
Restrictions 
may apply to certain accounts and certain transactions. The Funds and/or the 
Distributor may change or cancel these terms and conditions at any time. Unless 
you provide your financial intermediary with information in writing about all of 
the factors that may count toward available reductions or waivers of an 
applicable sales charge, there can be no assurance that you will receive all of 
the reductions and waivers for which you may be eligible. To the extent your 
Fund account is held directly with the Fund, you should provide this information 
to the Fund when placing your purchase or redemption order. Please see the 
Fund’s prospectus for more information about sales charge reductions and 
waivers.
Shareholders 
should retain this Supplement for future reference.

2Source: ICI as of December 31, 2016 for Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC.
3The Overall Morningstar Rating is as of December 31, 2016 and for Class Z shares. Out of 101 Z-share Columbia funds rated by Morningstar, 18 funds received a 5-star Overall Rating and 33 funds received a 4-star Overall Rating. Class Z shares are sold at net asset value and have limited eligibility. Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. offers multiple share classes, not all necessarily available through all firms, and the share class ratings may vary. Contact us for details. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a retail mutual fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For share classes that do not have a 3-, 5- or 10-year actual performance history, the fund’s independent Morningstar Rating metric is then compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ used to rank the fund against other funds in the same category. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, without any adjustments for loads (front-end, deferred, or redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star (each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages).
The Morningstar RatingTM is for Class Z shares only; other classes may have different performance characteristics and may have different ratings.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
