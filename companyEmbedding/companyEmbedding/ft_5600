       Product Description Specifications Media Resources Replacement Parts    Product Description Locate metal or plastic lines quickly using the 5600FT Pipe and Cable Locator. The 5600FT determines location, direction, and depth of buried pipes and cables. The hand held receiver is used to pick up a radio frequency signal that is put "onto" or "into" the line to be traced. This signal can be put onto conductive (metal) pipes or cables either by clamping the energizer to the exposed portions of the line or by placing the energizer over the line which is buried in the ground.  This package includes a "Bullet" transmitter (Goldak  #3350) which can be flushed or pulled through the pipes as small as 3/4" to locate non-conductive plumbing around swimming pools. The Pistol Grip style receiver requires 8-AA batteries. The energizer also requires 8-AA batteries. Includes lightweight carrying case.
