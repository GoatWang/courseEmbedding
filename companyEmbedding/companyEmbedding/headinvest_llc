Zacks Investment Research lowered shares of CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) from a buy rating to a hold rating in a research report released on Monday morning. 
According to Zacks, “CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period.”

Please click on a question to view the answer. How are you compensated?  We charge a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the assets we manage. To align ourselves with our clients, we receive no compensation from anyone other than our clients, including commissions or other forms of payment from investment product providers or financial institutions. Our fee is billed quarterly and normally deducted from the client’s account. Do you charge extra fees to consult with my tax advisor or estate planning attorney?  No, all consultations are
offered as part of our normal management fee. In fact, we welcome the opportunity
to discuss tax or estate planning opportunities with other professionals that
you have engaged. We realize that they may charge you for their time to speak
with us, so we will not undertake these discussions without your permission,
unless as a result of a direct inquiry from them. If you have a need to find a
tax professional, attorney or insurance specialist, we are happy to provide
referrals to professionals who can best be of assistance to you. We accept no
referral fees from anyone in return for referring a client. How do I proceed with considering becoming a client and is there a fee for our initial meeting?  We offer each prospective client a no-obligation analysis of their current situation, as well as our ideas about what changes we might suggest. This way both your investment position and our initial suggestions are clear. What’s the next step if I want to open an account at HeadInvest?  It’s easy. Here is a checklist of documents we initially need to get you started:Financial statements for the accounts you would like to transferSocial security number or tax identification numberDriver’s license (for both parties if it’s a joint account)Trust or partnership documents (if applicable)Will (if applicable) What if I want to transfer my account from another investment firm? Our goal is to make this as simple as possible as we assist you to have a seamless transition of your account(s) from your current investment firm.
We do not charge any additional fees to transfer your assets. Will I have to sell all, or part, of my current investments to work with you?  In most cases, there are
investment changes we will recommend. Often the changes are implemented
over time. For example, some clients may have significant unrealized investment
gains in their current holdings that could trigger large taxes if they
were sold. In other cases, clients have specific holdings they have a
particular desire to keep. In all cases, we will use our best judgment to
recommend the most appropriate portfolio for you, then adjust and adapt it to
accommodate your specific goals. H7 Custom House Street 4th Floor Portland, Maine 04101 (207) 773-5333 info@headinvest.comNewsletter Signup Thanks for subscribing!

Our philosophy is founded in historical perspective and market knowledge. We believe that discipline is the most effective path to investment success; rigorous processes of historical analysis drive our strategic and tactical decisions. This consistent application of financial analysis enables us to maintain discipline and eliminate emotional decision-making.In the stock market, there is a close correlation between the value of a company and its ability to make its business grow. Market history clearly shows that overpricing and underpricing of security classes, sectors and individual issues are occurring continuously. By building diversified portfolios of attractively priced, financially strong companies, we provide a greater likelihood of investment success through market cycles. In bond market activities, we seek yield advantage over benchmark U.S. Treasury rates, considering many different risk factors in reaching our investment conclusions. Our efforts are applied equally to all managed accounts so that all clients receive equal treatment. Within target allocation guidelines, we actively manage our client portfolios to improve risk/return characteristics. How are clients’ investment strategies implemented? At the outset of our relationship with you, your investment goals, investing experience, tolerance for risk and your specific preferences are all important in determining the investment strategy we recommend.

We review the asset allocation strategy regularly and make adjustments as needed.We work with you on a discretionary basis meaning we may take investment action on your behalf without explicit approval in advance, provided the action is consistent with your overall investment goals. You receive notification by mail or email from your custodian of the investment change. You are always welcome to call and discuss any questions you may have, including all of our investment decisions. How will you communicate with me about my account(s)? At the beginning of a new account relationship, often we find that it is helpful to meet more frequently, usually quarterly or semi-annually. Our goal is to ensure you understand and feel comfortable with our process.In addition, you will receive monthly statements from the custodian and a quarterly portfolio appraisal and investment newsletter from us. We will also have occasional special mailings and emails on topics of interest. Most clients speak with us by telephone several times throughout the year.
