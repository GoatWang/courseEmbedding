What Our Customers Are Saying About Martin E. Adams


 My sincerest thanks and praise to the crew that was here yesterday, a really commendable tree removal and clean-up job. I am grateful for your guidance and support in helping me to maintain the property. 
                      
Georgia E., Ellicott City, MD



 Marty is great to work with, always responds very quickly, yard was in perfect shape when finished. We are very pleased with all of our interactions with Bartlett. 
                      
Matt O., Ellicott City, MD



 Carol and I thank the Bartlett crew and you for the excellent trimming job you did on our property a few weeks back. It really opened up the front of the house and eliminated the low-hanging obstacles for people and vehicles. We were particularly pleased with the River Birch and Japanese Maple! We'll certainly recommend you to any of our neighbors! 
                      
Dan and Carol G., Ellicott City, MD



 I have trusted Bartlett to take care of my trees for many years. Marty Adams is exceptional, his guidance and suggestions are very sound, and his technical expertise is exceptional. I trust him to make recommendations that are necessary rather than just optional. He is a quintessential professional and a joy to work with. 
                      
Olivia L., Catonsville, MD



 Always act politely and professionally on every job. Courteous staff that get the job done efficiently. Works with scheduling to accommodate customer's schedule. Overall, a first-class company! Jack F., Dayton, MD
