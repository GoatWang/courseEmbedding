Financial Planning Services - Investment Management











We are Robert and Denise Holland, financial planners at Holland Capital Management with offices in Grants Pass and Medford Oregon.While some of our advisors focus on helping individuals pursue their retirement goals or help people through financial transitions, others are helping companies manage their 401k, IRA’s, and 403b by lowering costs and providing local service. We do this by making every effort to maximize their return while lowering their risk. In the long run this too will help people retire, follow their passions and goals, give back to their community and make a difference.We are more than advisors; we are your friends, your neighbors, and your adopted family. While your goals and passions are uniquely yours we manage your assets as though your goals and passions are our own. We are independent and always a fiduciary; which allows us to go out and find the best solution for your unique financial situation. You, the client, will always come first. The community comes second. We find our happiness and satisfaction because we truly love helping people accomplish their goals, seek out their passions, and make a difference in our community. We get to do it every day we come to work at Holland Capital Management.
