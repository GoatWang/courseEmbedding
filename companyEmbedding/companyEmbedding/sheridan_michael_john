Biography[edit]
Michael Sheridan was born in St. Louis, Missouri, to John and Bernice (née Moore) Sheridan, and studied at St. Louis University High.
He was ordained to the priesthood by John Cardinal Carberry on May 29, 1971, and then did pastoral work in the Archdiocese of St. Louis. He also taught on the theological faculty of Kenrick-Glennon Seminary.
In 1980 he earned a doctorate in theology from the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum in Rome with a dissertation entitled The Theology of the Local Church in Vatican II. Bishop of Colorado Springs.[1]
On July 8, 1997, Sheridan was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of St. Louis and Titular Bishop of Thibiuca by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following September 3 from then-Archbishop Justin Francis Rigali, with Bishops Edward Joseph O'Donnell and Edward Kenneth Braxton serving as co-consecrators. He chose as his episcopal motto: "Virtus in infirmitate perficitur" (2 Cor 12:9, meaning, "Strength is made perfect in weakness").
Sheridan was named Coadjutor Bishop of Colorado Springs, Colorado, on December 4, 2001, later succeeding Richard Hanifen as the second Bishop of Colorado Springs upon the latter's resignation on January 30, 2003.
Within the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Bishop Sheridan sits on the Committee on Education. He is also a member of the Board of Governors of the Pontifical North American College in Rome, of the Board of Directors of Catholic Relief Services, of the International Dominican Foundation, and of the Kenrick Seminary Board of Trustees.
Controversy[edit]
Sheridan excited controversy in 2004 when he said any Catholic who does not reflect church teaching in the voting booth "makes a mockery of that faith and belies his identity as a Catholic," a remark widely held to refer to supporters of John Kerry, though the bishop stated "the church never directs citizens to vote for any specific candidate." The directive was reported to be the first in the nation "that would apply to voters the same controversial sanctions proposed by some bishops against abortion-rights Catholic politicians...also one of the most drastic—equating a particular vote with sinful activity."[2] Sheridan's stance drew national attention and harsh criticism, which he then softened in a column in the diocesan newspaper. Sheridan's spokesman has said that there is no Communion ban and that decisions on taking Communion rest with individuals and their consciences.[3]
There was further controversy in 2005 when Sheridan's executive assistant, Peter Howard, wrote a column in the diocesan newspaper stating that participating in Protestant services is contrary to church teaching. Sheridan then issued a public apology stating that Howard's view "does not represent my thinking on the subject". Other prominent clerics in the diocese agreed with Sheridan, saying that Catholics should be encouraged to participate in Protestant services.[4]

Biography[edit]
Michael Sheridan was born in St. Louis, Missouri, to John and Bernice (née Moore) Sheridan, and studied at St. Louis University High.
He was ordained to the priesthood by John Cardinal Carberry on May 29, 1971, and then did pastoral work in the Archdiocese of St. Louis. He also taught on the theological faculty of Kenrick-Glennon Seminary.
In 1980 he earned a doctorate in theology from the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum in Rome with a dissertation entitled The Theology of the Local Church in Vatican II. Bishop of Colorado Springs.[1]
On July 8, 1997, Sheridan was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of St. Louis and Titular Bishop of Thibiuca by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following September 3 from then-Archbishop Justin Francis Rigali, with Bishops Edward Joseph O'Donnell and Edward Kenneth Braxton serving as co-consecrators. He chose as his episcopal motto: "Virtus in infirmitate perficitur" (2 Cor 12:9, meaning, "Strength is made perfect in weakness").
Sheridan was named Coadjutor Bishop of Colorado Springs, Colorado, on December 4, 2001, later succeeding Richard Hanifen as the second Bishop of Colorado Springs upon the latter's resignation on January 30, 2003.
Within the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Bishop Sheridan sits on the Committee on Education. He is also a member of the Board of Governors of the Pontifical North American College in Rome, of the Board of Directors of Catholic Relief Services, of the International Dominican Foundation, and of the Kenrick Seminary Board of Trustees.
Controversy[edit]
Sheridan excited controversy in 2004 when he said any Catholic who does not reflect church teaching in the voting booth "makes a mockery of that faith and belies his identity as a Catholic," a remark widely held to refer to supporters of John Kerry, though the bishop stated "the church never directs citizens to vote for any specific candidate." The directive was reported to be the first in the nation "that would apply to voters the same controversial sanctions proposed by some bishops against abortion-rights Catholic politicians...also one of the most drastic—equating a particular vote with sinful activity."[2] Sheridan's stance drew national attention and harsh criticism, which he then softened in a column in the diocesan newspaper. Sheridan's spokesman has said that there is no Communion ban and that decisions on taking Communion rest with individuals and their consciences.[3]
There was further controversy in 2005 when Sheridan's executive assistant, Peter Howard, wrote a column in the diocesan newspaper stating that participating in Protestant services is contrary to church teaching. Sheridan then issued a public apology stating that Howard's view "does not represent my thinking on the subject". Other prominent clerics in the diocese agreed with Sheridan, saying that Catholics should be encouraged to participate in Protestant services.[4]

Michael John Sheridan's Experience
Title: Physician
               Company: Citrus Memorial Hospital
Job Details
               Citrus Memorial is a 198-bed, not-for-profit, community hospital that provides health care services to residents of Citrus County and surrounding communities. More than 150 physicians and 1,200 employees provide a wide range of services at our Inverness campus and at medical offices and clinics in eight locations in Citrus and Sumter Counties. Citrus Memorial is fully accredited by the Joint Commission and is fully licensed by the State of Florida.
Title: 
               Company: Ocala Heart Institute
Job Details
               The good news, by comparison, is that Ocala Heart Institute (OHI) will typically provide care to over 3,000 cardiac, vascular and thoracic surgical cases as well as 8,000 cardiac catherization cases in one year alone. While we have become so accustomed to the protective presence of OHI in our community, the rest of the world is clamoring for their attention, driving home the point that nationally recognized cardiac care is not a right, but rather a privilege. So why, then, given such staggering success does OHI take it upon themselves to execute not-for-profit education and training trips? From the beginning the goal of the Ocala Heart Institute was to draw upon the expertise of three specialties - cardiovascular surgery, cardiovascular anesthesia, and interventional/invasive cardiology - to deliver the best quality of cardiothoracic and vascular care to the heart, lung and vascular patient. They worked in complete cooperation with the hospital administration to build a program which would provide the highest quality of care in a cost-effective manner. That said, the physicians of OHI knew that the greater mission of Ocala Heart Institute lay beyond the Ocala city limits, past the state line, into international waters. Though it begs the question "Why? the answer goes back to Dr. Peter Chung's announcement: Ninety-three percent of the world's population has no access to cardiovascular and open heart facilities. Dr. Carmichael knew there was a need greater than Ocala's and took it upon himself, with the addition of Dr. Peter Chung and henceforth others, to answer it. The Ocala Heart Institute, through their Heart for the World Foundation, exists to minister to a sick and hurting world. Education, training and providing indigent medical care in several foreign countries and domestically are the key elements of the organization. Performed in love as a ministry in service to God, these endeavors are meant to change lives both physically and spiritually. For 12 years surgical teams have been traveling to Nanjing, Peoples Republic of China, to train doctors and perform open heart procedures. Because of the success at Nanjing, they've since expanded into Yangi, Fuzhou and Pyungyang China. In addition, OHI teams are also active in Mongolia, Albania, India and North Korea. To aid in the training process, international medical teams often come to Ocala to observe the latest techniques. While the success of the program lies in education and training, there is a third element to which the doctors of OHI adhere. "Prayer is a huge part of our work," Dr. Chung explains. "When we travel to other countries, other cultures, we ask to pray with them. When their teams come here for more advanced training, they learn surgery and cardiac, but they also learn about God. For believers and non-believers alike, you cannot dispute the fact that OHI has had unprecedented success in cardiac surgery and recovery. Read the latest Mission Notes:
