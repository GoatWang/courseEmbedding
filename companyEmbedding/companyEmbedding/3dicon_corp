During his career at Dow Corning Avery served in a broad range of global sales and marketing position. Avery is one of four Dow Corning Sellers recognized in the Sales Gallery 2005 to 2013, the first to obtain four Sales Excellence Awards for top 1% sellers, and received seven Sales Achievement Awards for top 10% sellers in New Business Development.  Most recently Avery served as the New Business Development Manager for Lithium Ion Battery Solutions within Dow Corning's Business and Technology Incubator. Within that role, Avery was responsible for developing a portfolio of collaboration opportunities for Dow Corning's silicon material solutions, as well as managing relationships with key prospect customers of silicon materials. Avery holds a Bachelor of Science, Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University and a Masters of Science, Manufacturing Management from Kettering University.                                   Research and development team at NDSU            The team is led by Dr. Philip Boudjouk :  He is assisted by Mr. Kenneth J. Anderson,Dr. Kostia Pokhodnya and others. The team's current emphasis is on chemistry of polysilanes, especially CHS, and its ability to form novel derivatives and complexes. They have also been studying the chemistry of silicones using new pathways developed for manipulating the branches on a silicone backbone, allowing great flexibility in incorporating new properties in silicone derivatives.   As reported previously, it is anticipated that the research activities surrounding the silicone intellectual property (involving as it does a lighter weight material than the glass material currently being employed) could result in the improvement of 3DIcon's CSpace image space material, which would mark the final step in the completion of its volumetric, three-dimensional display.  A recipient of many honors and awards for research and instruction, Dr. Boudjouk is tenured professor in department of chemistry at NDSU with over 167 publications and 30+ patents and patent applications. He is recognized worldwide as an expert in silicon chemistry (most notably cyclohexasilane (“Si6”)-based technologies) and is a prolific inventor of a variety of silicon-based compositions and related IP.                            			                     Real, Static Volumetric Displays: No glasses needed. Coretec CSpace™ replicates as closely as possible natural viewing conditions without limiting the viewing zone available to the viewer. CSpace is a patented glasses-free 3D static volumetric display technology that is being designed to produce high-resolution full- color, true 3D images from 3D datasets generated by imaging systems or transformed from raw datasets (e.g., cyber data) that can benefit from visualization in 3D. View CSpace® Sell Sheet   From July 7, 2017 shareholder new release        "We have been pleased to name Michael Kraft as CEO of The Coretec Group," said Keen. "He brings significant C-Suite experience from a number of technical and scientific companies, from start-up to multi-million dollar revenue operations. Michael is a great addition to the Company's strong leadership team."  The Coretec Group has a near-term objective to begin marketing for testing and evaluation of its patent-protected, silicon-based technology, Coretec HexaSilane™ (CHS). CHS has the potential for a number of commercial applications, including extension of battery life in electric cars, computers and cell phones; increasing efficiency of solar cells; and reducing the manufacturing costs of semiconductors and printed electronics. The Company has entered into an agreement with Gelest, Inc., for Gelest to manufacture CHS, and partner in marketing the material to customers and collaborators in target markets.                                                                                                     Conference call from July 14 , 2017   http://ir.thecoretecgroup.com/ir-calendar/detail/1340/shareholder-call

Silicon-Based Technology for Tomorrow's Markets
The Coretec Group™ is committed to enabling next-generation technology for advanced technology markets. Our product portfolio is based on the production of innovative silicon products, starting with cyclohexasilane, Si6H12 (CHS), a liquid that converts to polysilane when exposed to heat or UR irradiation followed by amorphous silicon and ultimately crystalline silicon. This novel liquid state provides new opportunities to introduce silicon-containing electronic materials, leading to improved performance, reduced cost, simplified manufacturing, and safer handling when compared to the more traditionally used monosilane. An extremely pure material, CHS is a key element for advanced applications including solar energy, energy storage, sensors, imaging and semiconductors, among others. Through our partnership with Gelest, Inc., The Coretec Group can provide materials for evaluation during new product development and once commercial, in larger scale production quantities. These materials can be varied in purity to meet specific market application needs and lower cost.
