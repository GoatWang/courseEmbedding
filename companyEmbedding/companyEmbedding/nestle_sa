Nestlé SA, multinational manufacturer of food products. It is headquartered in Vevey, Switzerland, and operates factories in more than 80 countries. Nestlé’s chief products are condensed and powdered milk, baby foods, chocolate products, candies, instant coffees and teas, soups, seasonings and condiments, frozen foods, ice cream, and bottled water. The company also produces pharmaceuticals.The company dates to 1866, when two separate Swiss enterprises were founded that would later form the core of Nestlé. In August of that year, Charles A. Page and George Page, brothers from the United States, established the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company in Cham, Switzerland. In September, in nearby Vevey, Henri Nestlé developed a milk-based baby food and soon began marketing it. In the succeeding decades both enterprises aggressively expanded their businesses throughout Europe and the United States. (Henri Nestlé retired in 1875, but the company, under new ownership, retained his name as Farine Lactée Henri Nestlé.) In 1877 Anglo-Swiss added milk-based baby foods to its products, and in the following year the Nestlé company added condensed milk, so that the firms became direct and fierce rivals.In 1905, however, the companies merged to become the Nestlé and Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company, retaining that name until 1947, when the name Nestlé Alimentana SA was taken as a result of the acquisition of Fabrique de Produits Maggi SA (founded 1884) and its holding company, Alimentana SA of Kempttal, Switzerland. Maggi was a major manufacturer of soup mixes and related foodstuffs. The company’s current name was adopted in 1977.From the beginning of the 20th century the Nestlé company began diversifying. In 1904 it bought chocolate rights that would eventually result in products under the Peter, Kohler, Nestlé, and Cailler brands. In 1927 it acquired rights from the cheese makers Gerber & Company AG. In 1937 the company invented instant coffee, which it began producing under the name Nescafé the following year. In 1960 it acquired control of Crosse & Blackwell (founded 1830) and affiliated companies in Great Britain, Australia, South Africa, the United States, and elsewhere. Nestlé’s bottled-water division was created through the purchase of European brands such as Vittel (1987), Perrier (1992), and Sanpellegrino (1998). The many acquisitions of U.S. food companies have included Libby, McNeill & Libby (1970), the Stouffer Corporation (1973), and one of America’s largest food companies, the Carnation Company (1985). In 2002 Nestlé’s purchase of Ralston Purina created a new division, Nestlé Purina PetCare, while Nestlé’s American ice cream businesses were consolidated under the Dreyer’s brand. Chef America, Inc., a frozen-food company, was also purchased in 2002. In 2007 the company added the milk-flavouring product known as Ovaltine to its product line. The company also entered the frozen-pizza market in 2010 by purchasing Kraft Foods’ frozen-pizza business in the U.S. and Canada for $3.7 billion.

Over the years, Nestlé came under scrutiny for some of its business practices. In July 1977 a boycott was started in the United States against the company’s products, because of Nestlé’s advertising of its infant-formula baby food to mothers as an alternative to breast-feeding, particularly in less-developed countries. The boycotters criticized the advertising as aggressive and claimed that the use of infant formula resulted in health problems and deaths among infants; led by such groups as World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action (WABA) and Save the Children, the boycott later spread to Europe and beyond. Nestlé was also targeted by lawsuits from the International Labor Rights Forum and anti-child-labour activists for alleged child-labour practices on its cocoa farms in Ivory Coast. In 2013 Nestlé Canada, two of its former executives, a competitor, and a distributor were charged with allegedly fixing the price of chocolate; the charges followed a multiyear investigation by the Canadian Competition Bureau that also resulted in a $23 million settlement paid by Nestlé Canada and other chocolate producers.

	Nestle boycott products list | Baby Milk Action



























 
































Nestle boycott products list










Scroll down for the online product list.
The campaign led by the International Nestlé Boycott Committee primarily targets Nescafé, the corporation’s flagship product. But we would encourage you to boycott all Nestlé products until the company stops marketing its babymilk in ways that undermine breastfeeding and break marketing rules. Here is a guide to Nestlé’s principal brands in the UK. You will also find brand information on the Nestlé website at http://www.nestle.com/ and on national Nestlé websites.
Note: Nestlé breastmilk substitutes are not included on boycott product lists for the simple reason that there may be situations where these are the only products available for baby who is not breastfed and does not have access to breastmilk. If other bona fide breastmilk substitutes are available, there is no reason to choose a Nestlé brand over any other.
For more on the reasons for the boycott, see the Nestlé-Free Zone.
Nestlé UK Product List cards 
Credit-card size cards with the main UK brands on one side and a short explanation of the boycott on the other are available in our online Virtual Shop – click here.
We also stock Nescafé – No thanks! and Nespresso – No thanks! cards.
Click on the card to order – also see the Nestlé-Free Kit.
Scroll down for the list on this page.
IMPORTANT NOTE: We list products from which Nestlé profits. So Nestlé ice cream is listed because, although Nestlé sold the company, it continues to receive payments for use of the brand name (confirmed June 2015). We welcome new information regarding changes in ownership, but please remember that headline stories about brands being sold do not usually give all the details of the deal. We only remove a product from the list when we are reasonably confident that all links to Nestlé have been cut
Items marked with an * are either part-owned by Nestlé, such a L’Oreal, Body Shop, Lactalis Nestlé Chilled Dairy (a 60:40 joint venture between Lactalis and Nestlé, which owns Rachel’s Dairy) and Cereal Partners (a 50:50 joint venture with General Mills) or have been sold but there is an arrangement by which Nestlé continues to profit from them.
No longer Nestlé: PowerBar, Branston Pickle, Crosse and Blackwell, Fox’s Glacier Mints, Gales Honey, Libby’s Juices, Sun Pat, Sarsons and Tartex may appear on old lists, but no longer have any link to Nestlé.
Differences between countries: Findus and Haagen Daz have no link to Nestlé in the UK, but may have in some other countries.
Some brand names below link to reports in our Boycott News newsletter giving more explanation. Some of these are hosted on our archive site.
There is a report on own brand cereals manufactured by Nestlé’s Cereal Partners business in Boycott News 32.
Nestlé UK Product List
Last changes: 8 June 2015: PowerBar removed (this does not affect the current boycott list cards).
7 August 2012: Rachel’s Dairy has been added to the boycott list following its move into the Lactalis Nestlé Chilled Dairy (LNCD joint venture). Lactalis purchased Rachel’s Dairy in August 2010 and recently announced its move into the joint venture. Lactailis owns 60% of the joint venture and Nestlé 40%.

Nestlé leads the way in Europe in the development of cosmeceuticals/ nutricosmetics. The joint venture between Nestlé and L'Oréal aims to produce a range of foods that will aim to improve the appearance of skin, hair and nails (and we thought fresh fruit did that...). The first product, which launched in France in March 2004, is Inneov Fermete, a nutritional complement developed for women over 40 who are concerned about skin firmness following menopause. It contains Lacto-Lycopene, which has been formulated with a combination of vitamin C and soya isoflavones to allow lycopene, a powerful antioxidant, to be easily absorbed into the body.[A] See section 'Corporate Crimes' section for more information on Nestle and L'Oreal 'Promoting untested nano-technology'.Associated Company: L'Oréal. Nestlé is the biggest shareholder in this company. For more information see 'Who, Where, How Much?' section.
For background information on L'Oréal see http://www.corporatewatch.org.uk/news/animal_test_ban.htm
