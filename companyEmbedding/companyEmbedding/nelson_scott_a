Product Description▼▲
The mission of God has a church. So the church needs to be in sync with the mission of God. This is the guiding philosophy of the Forge Missions Training Network, which has helped church leaders and laypeople alike all over the world to reach their neighbors, their neighborhoods and their communities with the gospel. In these guides you and your friends will be equipped to be missionaries where you are-which is why God has a church in the first place.In Community: Living as the People of God you'll explore the dynamic image of church not as a building but a people, not a place but a movement, not a weekly event but a lifestyle. You'll consider how you and your friends might begin to employ your skills and gifts not as a service to the church but as a fulfillment of God's mission to spread the good news of God's kingdom to the ends of the earth. And you'll gain a fresh understanding of how you might relate to one another not as members of an institution but as a family on an exhilarating adventure.

Author Bio▼▲
Scott Nelson serves as the director of theology for Forge America where he is responsible for curriculum development for all Forge America training resources.  Scott is also a coach with the Forge Chicago hub, has been a small group pastor at a local church and is currently finishing his Ph.D program in missional theology at Luther Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota.
Alan Hirsch is the founding Director of Forge Mission Training Network. He is the co-founder of shapevine.com, an international forum for engaging with world transforming ideas. He leads Future Travelers, a learning journey applying missional-incarnational approaches to established churches and is an active participant in The Tribe of LA, a Jesus community among artists and creatives in Los Angeles.  Known for his innovative approach to mission, Hirsch is a teacher and key mission strategist for churches across the western world. His popular book  (with Michael Frost) is widely considered to be a seminal text on mission. Alan's recent book , has quickly become a key reference for missional thinking, particularly as it relates to movements. His book  is a radical restatement about the role that Jesus plays in defining missional movements.  , his latest book (with his wife Debra) is about missional discipleship for a missional church.  His experience in leadership includes leading a local church movement among the marginalized as well as heading up the Mission and Revitalization work of his denomination. Hirsch is an adjunct professor at Fuller Seminary and lectures frequently throughout Australia, Europe, and the U.S.


Endorsements▼▲
The Forge Guides are full of simple but provocative questions that are designed to help groups become a transformative presence in any context.
-Shawn Young, national director of chapter planting, InterVarsity Christian Fellowship

Scott Nelson has given us a gem. If you want to live on mission with others in a way that is faithful to God, mindful of your context, with theological depth, then the Forge guides are for you. Get a group of people, start engaging these guides, and you will find the life you were meant to live!
-JR Woodward, cofounder, The Ecclesia Network, and author, Creating a Missional Culture

Most churches no longer need to be convinced to move outside the confines of the church building and engage in God's mission. What churches are now asking for are practical resources to activate congregations toward missional action. Scott Nelson's Forge Guides for Missional Conversation do just that. He has created a series of helpful tools that provides serious theological reflections along with practical steps in getting there. I cannot recommend these guides more highly to any group serious about engaging God's mission.
-Brad Brisco, coauthor of The Missional Quest

If we truly understood that we are missionaries wherever we live, it would absolutely change everything. That is not an understatement, and the Forge Guides for Missional Conversation guide us into exactly how to go about doing that.
-Dan Kimball, author of They Like Jesus but Not the Church

The possibilities we can imagine for our life are largely determined by the assumptions we have adopted about what life is all about. For most people, these assumptions lead us away from being on mission everyday with God. Through the practice of tried-and-true spiritual disciplines done together in community, these guides will help people uncover those assumptions and renew their minds in light of what God's Word says life is all about, so they can begin to really live, think and act like missionaries in the places God has called them.
-Mike Breen, global team leader, 3DM

Product Description▼▲
The mission of God has a church. So the church needs to be in sync with the mission of God. This is the guiding philosophy of the Forge Missions Training Network, which has helped church leaders and laypeople alike all over the world to reach their neighbors, their neighborhoods and their communities with the gospel. In these guides you and your friends will be equipped to be missionaries where you are-which is why God has a church in the first place.In Mission: Living for the Purposes of God you and your friends will consider how your life and faith experience would change if you conceived of yourselves not as church members but as ambassadors for Christ. You'll explore what a mission-shaped life looks like in your context, and how you can more fully calibrate your life around God's life-giving mission in the world.

Author Bio▼▲
Scott Nelson serves as the director of theology for Forge America where he is responsible for curriculum development for all Forge America training resources.  Scott is also a coach with the Forge Chicago hub, has been a small group pastor at a local church and is currently finishing his Ph.D program in missional theology at Luther Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota.
Alan Hirsch is the founding Director of Forge Mission Training Network. He is the co-founder of shapevine.com, an international forum for engaging with world transforming ideas. He leads Future Travelers, a learning journey applying missional-incarnational approaches to established churches and is an active participant in The Tribe of LA, a Jesus community among artists and creatives in Los Angeles.  Known for his innovative approach to mission, Hirsch is a teacher and key mission strategist for churches across the western world. His popular book  (with Michael Frost) is widely considered to be a seminal text on mission. Alan's recent book , has quickly become a key reference for missional thinking, particularly as it relates to movements. His book  is a radical restatement about the role that Jesus plays in defining missional movements.  , his latest book (with his wife Debra) is about missional discipleship for a missional church.  His experience in leadership includes leading a local church movement among the marginalized as well as heading up the Mission and Revitalization work of his denomination. Hirsch is an adjunct professor at Fuller Seminary and lectures frequently throughout Australia, Europe, and the U.S.


Endorsements▼▲
The Forge Guides are full of simple but provocative questions that are designed to help groups become a transformative presence in any context.
-Shawn Young, national director of chapter planting, InterVarsity Christian Fellowship

Scott Nelson has given us a gem. If you want to live on mission with others in a way that is faithful to God, mindful of your context, with theological depth, then the Forge guides are for you. Get a group of people, start engaging these guides, and you will find the life you were meant to live!
-JR Woodward, cofounder, The Ecclesia Network, and author, Creating a Missional Culture

Most churches no longer need to be convinced to move outside the confines of the church building and engage in God's mission. What churches are now asking for are practical resources to activate congregations toward missional action. Scott Nelson's Forge Guides for Missional Conversation do just that. He has created a series of helpful tools that provides serious theological reflections along with practical steps in getting there. I cannot recommend these guides more highly to any group serious about engaging God's mission.
-Brad Brisco, coauthor of The Missional Quest

If we truly understood that we are missionaries wherever we live, it would absolutely change everything. That is not an understatement, and the Forge Guides for Missional Conversation guide us into exactly how to go about doing that.
-Dan Kimball, author of They Like Jesus but Not the Church

The possibilities we can imagine for our life are largely determined by the assumptions we have adopted about what life is all about. For most people, these assumptions lead us away from being on mission everyday with God. Through the practice of tried-and-true spiritual disciplines done together in community, these guides will help people uncover those assumptions and renew their minds in light of what God's Word says life is all about, so they can begin to really live, think and act like missionaries in the places God has called them.
-Mike Breen, global team leader, 3DM
