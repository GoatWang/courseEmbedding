Ovation Partners







Alternative Income Fund














Ovation Partners has the experience to navigate niche markets that don’t fit larger firms’ strategies.





Management Team



The Ovation Alternative Income Fund, LP (“AIF”) is a diversified, multi-strategy fund that primarily invests in income-producing private credit and specialty finance assets with meaningful collateral and contractual cash flows. The Fund’s objectives are to preserve our investor’s capital, generate returns with low correlation to public markets, and provide quarterly cash distributions. There can be no assurance, however, that the Fund’s objectives will be achieved.

AIF is diversified across strategies including (but not limited to) tax lien loans, municipal tax liens, first lien loans backed by real estate, insurance-backed assets, non-performing debt, equipment leases, small business loans, and receivables finance. Each of these assets requires specialized due diligence, origination, and servicing expertise that Ovation believes is uncommon in the asset management industry.

Ovation believes the resulting AIF portfolio provide these benefits to investors:
						
Portfolio Diversification. Income–producing private investments have historically been less correlated with public markets.
Current cash flow. A substantial portion of the total return of these investments is current cash flow distributable to investors.
Shorter duration. Most of the Fund’s underlying assets amortize over 6-60 months with average duration less than three years.
Meaningful Collateral. Ovation primarily targets asset-backed investments with low loan-to-values (“LTVs”) or deep purchase discounts.

Introduction







Our Investment Strategy














Ovation invests in niche markets where the supply of capital is scarce relative to the demand for capital.



Management Team



Ovation’s goals are to preserve our investor’s capital, generate returns with low correlation to public markets, and provide quarterly distributions. We believe in balancing a conservative focus on absolute returns while remaining nimble as markets evolve. Ovation prefers to focus on principal protection and downside mitigation.


					

The niche markets where we focus are generally smaller in size and the need for operational expertise makes them difficult for larger financial institutions to source and service. Ovation believes it has advantaged access, evaluation or origination capabilities in these markets. Ovation’s investment selection emphasizes cash flow, collateral, short duration, and the ability to re-price. There is no mandate to benchmark to any index; thereby creating an artificial constraint that may restrict Ovation’s ability to achieve its stated objectives.

					

While many of these niche markets have existed for more than 10 years, and have a history of generating attractive returns, the disruption and subsequent fragmentation of the broader credit markets since 2008 has increased the relative isolation of these niche markets versus public credit investments (corporate high grade and high yield bonds, e.g.). Bank consolidation and increased regulation has resulted in a concentration of capital availability to only the larger borrowers through the issuance of public bonds or syndicated loans. The market for public credit is highly liquid and can be easily accessed by nearly all investors globally. As a result, the substantial in-flow of capital into public credit markets has lowered returns to investors.
					

Ovation believes the assets in the private credit and specialty finance markets may offer a better risk/return profile to their public counterparts. These assets may include (but are not limited to) tax lien loans, municipal tax liens, first lien loans backed by real estate, insurance-backed assets, non-performing debt, equipment leases, small business loans, and receivables finance.


					















DISCLOSURE


HISTORICAL RETURNS
Past performance is not indicative of future results, and there can be no assurance that any objective will will be met. Nothing contained herein should be deemed to be a prediction or projection of future performance of any portfolio.

FORWARD LOOKING/TARGET RETURNS
Certain information contained herein constitutes “forward-looking statements,” which can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “target,” “project,” “estimate,” “intend,” “continue” or “believe,” or the negatives thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology.  Due to various risks and uncertainties, actual events or results or the actual performance of any portfolio may differ materially from those reflected or contemplated in such forward-looking statements.
Target returns are subject to inherent limitations.  One limitation is that the returns do not take into account the impact that market and economic risks, such as defaults, pre-payments, and reinvestment rates, may have on actual trading.  In addition, target returns are subject to risks and uncertainties that may change at any time, and, therefore, our actual results may differ materially from those we expected.   In no circumstances should the expected returns be regarded as a representation, warranty or prediction that any portoflio will reflect any particular performance or that it will achieve or is likely to achieve any particular result or that investors will be able to avoid losses, including total losses of their investment.  Inherent in any investment is the potential for loss.  While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and, of course, it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results.

About Ovation







Boutique Firm.Innovative Ideas.














Ovation focuses on sourcing and structuring attractive private market investments. We work to reduce risk through strong collateral positions and secure, contractual cash flows.




Ovation began during the ‘Great Recession’ as a private investment vehicle funded by its co-founders and General Partners - Mike Rovner and Jeff Serra.  At a time when mainstream income investments were producing minimal returns, Jeff and Mike sought to leverage their financial services expertise to source income-generating opportunities with attractive yields and little-to-no correlation to the public markets.  Their approach emphasized principal protection, low volatility, and consistent income.    

		

Since 2010, driven by steady returns and a conservative approach, Ovation’s investor ranks have expanded. Today we are responsible for more than $500 million of assets under management across a variety of private credit and specialty finance asset categories. These assets may include (but are not limited to) tax lien transfers, real estate, single family rentals, auto dealer finance, equipment finance, insurance backed assets, non-performing debt, receivables finance, and small business loans. We strive to reduce complexity for our investors and manage these assets in a simple multi-strategy fund, the Ovation Alternative Income Fund (AIF).

While Ovation’s team and assets have grown over the years, a few things have remained unchanged.   Ovation’s founders are still among its largest investors, the firm remains focused on niche asset categories where expertise matters, and we continue to emphasize principal protection, low volatility, and consistent income.

Management Team





The Ovation Alternative Income Fund, LP (“AIF”) is a diversified, multi-strategy fund that primarily invests in income-producing private credit and specialty finance assets with meaningful collateral and contractual cash flows. Ovation believes that, through opportunistic strategy allocation and diversification, AIF can achieve its objectives to preserve investor capital and provide annual returns to investors between 10-14% after fees and expenses. There can be no assurance, however, that the Fund’s investment objectives will be achieved.


Ovation will diversify AIF across strategies including (but not limited to) tax lien loans, municipal tax liens, first lien loans backed by real estate, insurance-backed assets, non-performing debt, equipment leases, small business loans, and receivables finance. Each of these assets requires specialized due diligence, origination, and servicing expertise that Ovation believes is uncommon in the asset management industry.

Ovation believes the resulting AIF portfolio would be difficult to replicate and should provide these benefits to investors:
            
Portfolio Diversification. Income–producing private investments have historically been less correlated with public markets.

  Current cash flow. A substantial portion of the total return of these investments is current cash flow distributable to investors.

  Shorter duration. Most of the Fund’s underlying assets amortize over 6-60 months.  Average duration will be less than three years.
  Lower Fee Burden. At the target 10-14% net-return range to investors, the AIF fee structure averages 30% less than a typical “2 and 20” fund.
  Meaningful Collateral. The fund primarily targets asset-backed investments with low loan-to-values (“LTVs”).

* This undertaking does not affect any limits Section 102(a) of the National Securities Markets
Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to
require information. As a result, if the securities that are the subject of this Form D are "covered securities" for purposes
of NSMIA, whether in all instances or due to the nature of the offering that is the subject of this Form D, States cannot
routinely require offering materials under this undertaking or otherwise and can require offering materials only to the
extent NSMIA permits them to do so under NSMIA's preservation of their anti-fraud authority.
