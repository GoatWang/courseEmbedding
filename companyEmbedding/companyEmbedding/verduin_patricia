ST. LOUIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON) announced today the appointment of Patricia 
      Verduin, Ph.D., to the company’s board of directors. Dr. Verduin is vice

      leading research at top companies and organizations will enable her to 
      provide valuable insight to our board on a variety of matters, including 
      how we continue to deliver a broad range of innovative solutions to help 
      nourish our growing world.”
    

      Dr. Verduin’s appointment is effective immediately, and she will stand 
      for election to the board at the 2016 annual meeting of shareowners. She 
      will serve on the science and technology committee and sustainability
