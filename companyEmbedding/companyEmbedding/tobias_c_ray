Demand for primary health care services is rising: with the retirement of older professionals and an unwillingness amongst younger professionals to re-locate to remote areas, there is a shortage of physicians, especially in rural areas.It was to meet these challenges that the project “PrimCareIT – Counteracting brain drain and professional isolation of health professionals in remote primary health care through tele-consultation and tele-mentoring to strengthen social conditions in remote BSR”, was initiated. Please find out more about our activities and first results.Team members: Tobias C. Larsson, PhDExDin - More effective analysis within medical imaging using collaboration based on networking structureAugust 2012  –  March 2015Medical imaging is facing major challenges. The demographic and geographic structure needs to be addressed with new approaches and services. Digitalisation has been ongoing for over 10 years, but there is still great potential to be exploited in sharing capacity and expertise. This project focuses on this potential.The project will analyze more effective forms of collaboration, working in networks. The issue is complex in nature as it spans over different health care providers, specialties and processes. It also covers a number of areas such as technology, patient safety, legal and regulatory requirements.Team members: Tobias C.

I am working with a construction equipment company and their customer network. This group are facing a decision about whether to change their road construction approach to include a new method. I am developing support to help them to consider sustainability and the relationship of sustainability to other considerations while making this decision. This support is a mock-up (~prototype) and the purpose of developing it is to also learn about how might support aid the consideration of sustainability in these types of situations.(This is my first entry in the new LinkedIn project format, so please excuse anything I mess up!)Team members: Tobias C. Larsson, PhD, Goran Broman, Rachael Gould, Tony Thompson, Sophie Hallstedt, Merlina MissimerDesign for WellbeingStarting January 2004Design for Wellbeing redirects the focus of product development from technology-based development, via needs-based development, to participative product development and innovation. By adapting a multidisciplinary approach, involving health sciences and engineering disciplines, we are able to manage the entire development cycle from an initial understanding of users’ needs to studies of finished products in use.Design for Wellbeing is carried out in the form of research projects, application studies and student projects, building on experiences from research and education projects. The courses are project-based and team-structured, and students work closely with corporate partners on real-world innovation projects. Design for Wellbeing is an ideal framework for collaboration across distance, disciplines and disabilities.Team members: Tobias C. Larsson, PhD, Andreas Larsson, Larry LeiferMaster's in Sustainable Product-Service System InnovationStarting August 2010Industry needs people who understand what the world wants: innovative products and services delivered in the most sustainable way possible. At BTH, we believe that combining an overarching approach to socio-ecological sustainability with a disciplined approach to meeting market and human needs through product-service systems is the way of the future, and we are doing our part to show the way. By closely collaborating with our industrial partners, we are preparing people to be the next generation of innovators by bringing together engineering, innovation, and sustainability competence through this unique master's program.Team members: Tobias C.

Larsson, PhDThe Role of Additive Manufacturing Technology in job creation: an exploratory case study of suppliers of Additive Manufacturing in SwedenElsevier B.V.2014This paper investigates how Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies, as a process innovation, may contribute to a job creation. Further, the various mechanisms in which AM may contribute to an increase in job creation as well as the types of jobs are analysed. The analysis also goes beyond AM technologies and incorporates other non-technological factors which foster job creation, i.e. higher wages in BRIC countries, lower quality in BRIC countries, and a rising demand for western-made products. The analysis is based on a case study and the data collected was through interviews with three prominent actors within the AM technologies field in Sweden: technology developers, leading suppliers and users. The main findings indicate that AM (i) contributes to job creation in both the manufacturing sector and in the service sector, (ii) does not bring back mass production jobs from emerging economies such as BRIC, (iii) contributes to job creation in product development stages (e.g. rapid prototyping), and (iv) contributes to job creation in production stages of low-volume batches mainly of complex products. The findings also suggest there are barriers for full exploitation of AM in several areas, including education systems.Authors: Tobias C.

Larsson, PhD, Koteshwar Chirumalla, Andreas Larsson, Marco BertoniManufacturing Renaissance: Return of manufacturing to western countriesTaylor & FrancisManufacturing Renaissance, i.e. return of manufacturing to west, has been recently observed. This paper analyses the main reasons behind such a newly observed pattern. Four reasons have been identified as the driver of Manufacturing Renaissance, while the paper goes deeply on one of them that centers on the new manufacturing technologies like Additive Manufacturing (AM), or 3D Printing. Next, the location of manufacturing will be justified to be in located in west, relying on the established theory that has been able to explain the location of manufacturing, i.e. Product Life Cycle Model (PLC).Authors: Tobias C. Larsson, PhD, Babak Kianian, Mohammad (Sam) TavassoliDevelopment of product-service systems: challenges and opportunities for the manufacturing firmJournal of Engineering Design, Vol 20, Issue 4, 2009July 2009Product-Service Systems (PSS) raise interesting opportunities for the manufacturing firm as the function is provided to meet customer needs rather than the physical hardware itself. PSS offerings based on the manufacturer's knowledge about the product and the technology can increase its status as problem-solver and solution-provider, reduce life cycle cost and produce high revenue. However, PSS including, e.g. hardware, services, software and electronics are efficient and competitive only if developed for the specific purpose with features such as easy to maintain, upgradeable, with built-in sensors for collecting in-use and service data, and easy to use. This changes the requirements on the manufacturing firm's development process. Looking back historically, the last century gives an interesting changing landscape of the rationale for the product-development methods used in manufacturing firms. This article, based on the previous research in the product- and service-development fields, and on empirical results from studies at several manufacturing firms, looks into how the engineering work is affected by PSS and how it can be enhanced for PSS, especially in terms of required competencies and other capabilities. It results in recommendations for a new, functional product-development process.Authors: Tobias C.
