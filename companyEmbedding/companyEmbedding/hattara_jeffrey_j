Veritec names Jeffrey J. Hattara president, CEO

                    CET
                    











































US-based Veritec has appointed Jeffrey J. Hattara as its new president and CEO. Hattara will replace Van Tran who will become the company\'s executive chairman of the board. 
Most recently, Hattara was president and CEO of Datacard Goup, which provides the world’s secure ID and card personalisation services. The appointment comes at a time when Veritec is preparing to launch a number of new products for Identity, PhoneCodes, Mobile Banking and 2D-Bardcode services using the company’s patented technologies. Veritec has patented the PhoneCodes products that allow users via the internet or by using mobile phones to purchase, send or receive a gift card, ticket, coupon, receipt or transfer of money.
