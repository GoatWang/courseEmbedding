History[edit]
See also: Nash Finch Company
The chain was founded in 1917 as the Grand Rapids Wholesale Grocery Company and assumed the Spartan Stores name in 1957. For most of its history, Spartan was a cooperative. Spartan changed to for profit in the 1970s and was first traded on the NASDAQ in August 2000.
In 2005, Spartan Stores, Inc. entered into a purchase agreement to acquire certain operating assets of D&W Food Centers, Inc.[4]
In 2013, Spartan Stores and Nash Finch merged and formed SpartanNash company. The official name change was to occur May 2014 but a new site with the official new name and logo opened in November 2013.[5] Under terms of the $1.3 billion deal, each Nash share would convert to 1.2 shares of Spartan Stock. Spartan retained 57.7% of the combined company while Nash owns 42.3% of the approximately 38 million outstanding stock shares. Integration and transaction closing-related costs of approximately $17 million to $18 million will be recorded in the quarter ending December 28, 2013.[6]
In March 2017. it was announced that David Staples will replace Dennis Edison as Chief Executive Officer of SpartanNash. Edison will continue as the chairman of the company's board of directors after he retires as CEO in late May.[7]
Expansion into retail[edit]
Spartan's retail operations started as independent grocery chains. However, in 1999, it bought the Family Fare, Great Day, Glen's, Ashcraft's, and Prevo's supermarket chains from their respective owners. To simplify advertising, the brands were consolidated into two: Family Fare in the south and Glen's in the north, each being the majority in its respective region.

In 2000, Spartan Stores merged with the Seaway Foodtown company whose operations included 47 Food Town Supermarkets and 26 The Pharm deep-discount drugstores. After the merger, the Food Town stores operated under their own banners, but heavy competition in areas where Food Town and The Pharm operated meant lower profits, and these stores negatively impacted the company's resources. Between 2000 and 2003, the company closed or sold eight Food Town Supermarkets and five The Pharm drugstores. In 2003, with an unmanageable debt load, Spartan Stores announced it would sell or close the 39 remaining Food Town stores and restructure the company.
In December 2005, Spartan Stores announced plans to purchase D&W Food Centers. The transaction closed at the end of March 2006. Ten of the twenty stores purchased retained the D&W banner, six others converted to the Family Fare banner, and the remaining four closed permanently.
In 2006, the company acquired through liquidation, five defunct Carter's Foods for which the company has not announced plans. It acquired the 20-store Felpausch chain of Hastings, Michigan in 2007 and has renovated one former store, in Williamston, Michigan, to the D&W Fresh Market banner and several others to the Family Fare banner.[8]
In April 2008, Spartan announced that "certain assets" from 12 of the 14 remaining Pharm stores will be sold to Rite Aid. The remaining two stores will be sold in separate transactions. Industry experts said Rite Aid would likely keep the stores open and convert them to its own format and brand.[9] The sale completed in late May 2008.
In October 2008, Spartan announced it would be purchase VGs Grocery and Pharmacy stores in Michigan.[10] In late January 2011, the company converted the Felpausch store in Grand Ledge, Michigan, to a Family Fare store. Other stores, including several Glen's Markets in Northern Michigan, began undergoing conversion to the Family Fare name.[11]
Spartan Stores announced its acquisition of Nash Finch Company, based in Edina, Minnesota in 2013.[12]
Grocery retail stores[edit]
Prior to 2013

Family Fare: purchased in March 1999.
Glen's Markets: purchased in May 1999. Starting in 2013, SpartanNash began renovating Glen's stores while concurrently converting them to the Family Fare and D&W names;[13][14] the last converted in 2014[15]
D&W Fresh Market: purchase announced in December 2005 and completed in March 2006.
VG's Grocery: 11 stores (10 Pharmacies and 3 Quick Stops) in Eastern Michigan, purchased in December 2008. VG's was previously Spartan's largest independent distribution customer. In 2009, a location in New Baltimore closed; locations in Burton, Shelby Township, and Flint closed in December 2013.[16] The Waterford location was sold in March 2014;[17] The Pontiac location also closed in 2014.

All three Sunmart locations in Lincoln, Nebraska were closed over a short period of time by SpartanNash: in March and October 2014, and February 2015. A Hastings, Nebraska store was also closed in 2014, and SpartanNash performed a $1 million renovation on a Sunmart in Kearney, rebranding it as Family Fresh Market.[20]
Former grocery retail stores[edit]

Food Town: 45 Supermarkets in Ohio and Southeast Michigan acquired, along with 14 The Pharm drugstores from the Seaway Foodtown company of Maumee, Ohio in August 2000. These stores were originally operated under their acquired name, but in 2003, Spartan Stores announced that they were selling or closing all the Foodtown stores and dropping the Foodtown name from their roster of brands. Seventeen of the stores were sold to the Kroger Company; nine to independent operators and 13 were closed.
The Pharm: Thirteen stores (pharmacies) in Ohio, and one store (pharmacy), in Southeast Michigan 26 The Pharm stores were owned and operated by Seaway Foodtown at the time of the Seaway Food Town/Spartan merger.

History[edit]
See also: Nash Finch Company
The chain was founded in 1917 as the Grand Rapids Wholesale Grocery Company and assumed the Spartan Stores name in 1957. For most of its history, Spartan was a cooperative. Spartan changed to for profit in the 1970s and was first traded on the NASDAQ in August 2000.
In 2005, Spartan Stores, Inc. entered into a purchase agreement to acquire certain operating assets of D&W Food Centers, Inc.[4]
In 2013, Spartan Stores and Nash Finch merged and formed SpartanNash company. The official name change was to occur May 2014 but a new site with the official new name and logo opened in November 2013.[5] Under terms of the $1.3 billion deal, each Nash share would convert to 1.2 shares of Spartan Stock. Spartan retained 57.7% of the combined company while Nash owns 42.3% of the approximately 38 million outstanding stock shares. Integration and transaction closing-related costs of approximately $17 million to $18 million will be recorded in the quarter ending December 28, 2013.[6]
In March 2017. it was announced that David Staples will replace Dennis Edison as Chief Executive Officer of SpartanNash. Edison will continue as the chairman of the company's board of directors after he retires as CEO in late May.[7]
Expansion into retail[edit]
Spartan's retail operations started as independent grocery chains. However, in 1999, it bought the Family Fare, Great Day, Glen's, Ashcraft's, and Prevo's supermarket chains from their respective owners. To simplify advertising, the brands were consolidated into two: Family Fare in the south and Glen's in the north, each being the majority in its respective region.

In 2000, Spartan Stores merged with the Seaway Foodtown company whose operations included 47 Food Town Supermarkets and 26 The Pharm deep-discount drugstores. After the merger, the Food Town stores operated under their own banners, but heavy competition in areas where Food Town and The Pharm operated meant lower profits, and these stores negatively impacted the company's resources. Between 2000 and 2003, the company closed or sold eight Food Town Supermarkets and five The Pharm drugstores. In 2003, with an unmanageable debt load, Spartan Stores announced it would sell or close the 39 remaining Food Town stores and restructure the company.
In December 2005, Spartan Stores announced plans to purchase D&W Food Centers. The transaction closed at the end of March 2006. Ten of the twenty stores purchased retained the D&W banner, six others converted to the Family Fare banner, and the remaining four closed permanently.
In 2006, the company acquired through liquidation, five defunct Carter's Foods for which the company has not announced plans. It acquired the 20-store Felpausch chain of Hastings, Michigan in 2007 and has renovated one former store, in Williamston, Michigan, to the D&W Fresh Market banner and several others to the Family Fare banner.[8]
In April 2008, Spartan announced that "certain assets" from 12 of the 14 remaining Pharm stores will be sold to Rite Aid. The remaining two stores will be sold in separate transactions. Industry experts said Rite Aid would likely keep the stores open and convert them to its own format and brand.[9] The sale completed in late May 2008.
In October 2008, Spartan announced it would be purchase VGs Grocery and Pharmacy stores in Michigan.[10] In late January 2011, the company converted the Felpausch store in Grand Ledge, Michigan, to a Family Fare store. Other stores, including several Glen's Markets in Northern Michigan, began undergoing conversion to the Family Fare name.[11]
Spartan Stores announced its acquisition of Nash Finch Company, based in Edina, Minnesota in 2013.[12]
Grocery retail stores[edit]
Prior to 2013

Family Fare: purchased in March 1999.
Glen's Markets: purchased in May 1999. Starting in 2013, SpartanNash began renovating Glen's stores while concurrently converting them to the Family Fare and D&W names;[13][14] the last converted in 2014[15]
D&W Fresh Market: purchase announced in December 2005 and completed in March 2006.
VG's Grocery: 11 stores (10 Pharmacies and 3 Quick Stops) in Eastern Michigan, purchased in December 2008. VG's was previously Spartan's largest independent distribution customer. In 2009, a location in New Baltimore closed; locations in Burton, Shelby Township, and Flint closed in December 2013.[16] The Waterford location was sold in March 2014;[17] The Pontiac location also closed in 2014.

2013 Nash Finch Merger
With the Spartan Stores and Nash Finch Company merger in November 2013 the following stores were added:

Econofoods: 9 locations in Minnesota and Wisconsin.
Family Fresh Market: 1 location in Minnesota.
Family Thrift Center: 4 locations in South Dakota.
Germantown Fresh Market: Germantown, OH.
No Frills Supermarkets & Bag'n Save: 29 locations in Iowa and Nebraska.

Prairie Market: 1 location in South Dakota.
Sun Mart Foods: 19 locations in Nebraska, North Dakota, Minnesota, and Colorado.
Supermercado Nuestra Familia: 2 locations in Nebraska.
Wholesale Food Outlet: 1 location in Iowa.

In August 2014, the company began rebranding select Sun Mart locations in West Fargo, ND and Dickinson, ND to the Family Fare Supermarkets format.[18] Two additional Fargo, ND stores and a Moorhead, MN store followed in October 2014.[19]
All three Sunmart locations in Lincoln, Nebraska were closed over a short period of time by SpartanNash: in March and October 2014, and February 2015. A Hastings, Nebraska store was also closed in 2014, and SpartanNash performed a $1 million renovation on a Sunmart in Kearney, rebranding it as Family Fresh Market.[20]
Former grocery retail stores[edit]

Food Town: 45 Supermarkets in Ohio and Southeast Michigan acquired, along with 14 The Pharm drugstores from the Seaway Foodtown company of Maumee, Ohio in August 2000. These stores were originally operated under their acquired name, but in 2003, Spartan Stores announced that they were selling or closing all the Foodtown stores and dropping the Foodtown name from their roster of brands. Seventeen of the stores were sold to the Kroger Company; nine to independent operators and 13 were closed.
The Pharm: Thirteen stores (pharmacies) in Ohio, and one store (pharmacy), in Southeast Michigan 26 The Pharm stores were owned and operated by Seaway Foodtown at the time of the Seaway Food Town/Spartan merger. Over the years, many stores closed and the last 14 were sold in 2008: 12 stores to Rite-Aid; and 2 stores to independent operators.
Felpausch Food Centers: Purchased in early 2007. Spartan re-branded all the Felpausch locations except Kimball and, Leslie (Value Land) as D&W or Family Fare.

History[edit]
See also: Nash Finch Company
The chain was founded in 1917 as the Grand Rapids Wholesale Grocery Company and assumed the Spartan Stores name in 1957. For most of its history, Spartan was a cooperative. Spartan changed to for profit in the 1970s and was first traded on the NASDAQ in August 2000.
In 2005, Spartan Stores, Inc. entered into a purchase agreement to acquire certain operating assets of D&W Food Centers, Inc.[4]
In 2013, Spartan Stores and Nash Finch merged and formed SpartanNash company. The official name change was to occur May 2014 but a new site with the official new name and logo opened in November 2013.[5] Under terms of the $1.3 billion deal, each Nash share would convert to 1.2 shares of Spartan Stock. Spartan retained 57.7% of the combined company while Nash owns 42.3% of the approximately 38 million outstanding stock shares. Integration and transaction closing-related costs of approximately $17 million to $18 million will be recorded in the quarter ending December 28, 2013.[6]
In March 2017. it was announced that David Staples will replace Dennis Edison as Chief Executive Officer of SpartanNash. Edison will continue as the chairman of the company's board of directors after he retires as CEO in late May.[7]
Expansion into retail[edit]
Spartan's retail operations started as independent grocery chains. However, in 1999, it bought the Family Fare, Great Day, Glen's, Ashcraft's, and Prevo's supermarket chains from their respective owners. To simplify advertising, the brands were consolidated into two: Family Fare in the south and Glen's in the north, each being the majority in its respective region.

In 2000, Spartan Stores merged with the Seaway Foodtown company whose operations included 47 Food Town Supermarkets and 26 The Pharm deep-discount drugstores. After the merger, the Food Town stores operated under their own banners, but heavy competition in areas where Food Town and The Pharm operated meant lower profits, and these stores negatively impacted the company's resources. Between 2000 and 2003, the company closed or sold eight Food Town Supermarkets and five The Pharm drugstores. In 2003, with an unmanageable debt load, Spartan Stores announced it would sell or close the 39 remaining Food Town stores and restructure the company.
In December 2005, Spartan Stores announced plans to purchase D&W Food Centers. The transaction closed at the end of March 2006. Ten of the twenty stores purchased retained the D&W banner, six others converted to the Family Fare banner, and the remaining four closed permanently.
In 2006, the company acquired through liquidation, five defunct Carter's Foods for which the company has not announced plans. It acquired the 20-store Felpausch chain of Hastings, Michigan in 2007 and has renovated one former store, in Williamston, Michigan, to the D&W Fresh Market banner and several others to the Family Fare banner.[8]
In April 2008, Spartan announced that "certain assets" from 12 of the 14 remaining Pharm stores will be sold to Rite Aid. The remaining two stores will be sold in separate transactions. Industry experts said Rite Aid would likely keep the stores open and convert them to its own format and brand.[9] The sale completed in late May 2008.
In October 2008, Spartan announced it would be purchase VGs Grocery and Pharmacy stores in Michigan.[10] In late January 2011, the company converted the Felpausch store in Grand Ledge, Michigan, to a Family Fare store. Other stores, including several Glen's Markets in Northern Michigan, began undergoing conversion to the Family Fare name.[11]
Spartan Stores announced its acquisition of Nash Finch Company, based in Edina, Minnesota in 2013.[12]
Grocery retail stores[edit]
Prior to 2013

Family Fare: purchased in March 1999.
Glen's Markets: purchased in May 1999. Starting in 2013, SpartanNash began renovating Glen's stores while concurrently converting them to the Family Fare and D&W names;[13][14] the last converted in 2014[15]
D&W Fresh Market: purchase announced in December 2005 and completed in March 2006.
VG's Grocery: 11 stores (10 Pharmacies and 3 Quick Stops) in Eastern Michigan, purchased in December 2008. VG's was previously Spartan's largest independent distribution customer. In 2009, a location in New Baltimore closed; locations in Burton, Shelby Township, and Flint closed in December 2013.[16] The Waterford location was sold in March 2014;[17] The Pontiac location also closed in 2014.

2013 Nash Finch Merger
With the Spartan Stores and Nash Finch Company merger in November 2013 the following stores were added:

Econofoods: 9 locations in Minnesota and Wisconsin.
Family Fresh Market: 1 location in Minnesota.
Family Thrift Center: 4 locations in South Dakota.
Germantown Fresh Market: Germantown, OH.
No Frills Supermarkets & Bag'n Save: 29 locations in Iowa and Nebraska.

Prairie Market: 1 location in South Dakota.
Sun Mart Foods: 19 locations in Nebraska, North Dakota, Minnesota, and Colorado.
Supermercado Nuestra Familia: 2 locations in Nebraska.
Wholesale Food Outlet: 1 location in Iowa.

In August 2014, the company began rebranding select Sun Mart locations in West Fargo, ND and Dickinson, ND to the Family Fare Supermarkets format.[18] Two additional Fargo, ND stores and a Moorhead, MN store followed in October 2014.[19]
All three Sunmart locations in Lincoln, Nebraska were closed over a short period of time by SpartanNash: in March and October 2014, and February 2015. A Hastings, Nebraska store was also closed in 2014, and SpartanNash performed a $1 million renovation on a Sunmart in Kearney, rebranding it as Family Fresh Market.[20]
Former grocery retail stores[edit]

Food Town: 45 Supermarkets in Ohio and Southeast Michigan acquired, along with 14 The Pharm drugstores from the Seaway Foodtown company of Maumee, Ohio in August 2000. These stores were originally operated under their acquired name, but in 2003, Spartan Stores announced that they were selling or closing all the Foodtown stores and dropping the Foodtown name from their roster of brands. Seventeen of the stores were sold to the Kroger Company; nine to independent operators and 13 were closed.
The Pharm: Thirteen stores (pharmacies) in Ohio, and one store (pharmacy), in Southeast Michigan 26 The Pharm stores were owned and operated by Seaway Foodtown at the time of the Seaway Food Town/Spartan merger. Over the years, many stores closed and the last 14 were sold in 2008: 12 stores to Rite-Aid; and 2 stores to independent operators.
Felpausch Food Centers: Purchased in early 2007. Spartan re-branded all the Felpausch locations except Kimball and, Leslie (Value Land) as D&W or Family Fare.

Michigan grocer 'excited' about deal with Amazon

            By Shandra Martinez





SpartanNash headquarters in Byron Township. Courtesy photo 
BYRON TOWNSHIP, MI -- A Michigan grocer is helping the world's largest online retailer expand into grocery.
Amazon.com Inc. is contracting with SpartanNash Co. to supply products to the e-commerce giant's distribution centers.
Dave Staples, SpartanNash' chief operating officer, spoke about the arrangement with investors during a recent conference call to discuss the company's fiscal 2016 first quarter earnings.
"We are excited about our relationship with Amazon," Staples said. "While still a relatively new account, the volume has been greater than we expected and we believe that it has significant growth potential."
SpartanNash operates about 160 stores across 10 states: North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Colorado, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana and Ohio. But the majority of the Byron Township-headquartered corporation's nearly $8 billion business is supplying independent grocers and small chains. 
"This relationship is a great example of our commitment to pursuing solutions for difficult logistic issues, and we continue to look at opportunities to grow sales with other non-traditional customers," Staples said.
The work for Amazon includes supplying products to the company's distribution centers for them to sell. Staples said work for the Seattle online giant fits into the company's normal distribution model, although the mix of products are different from what is supplied to other wholesale customers.
He said SpartanNash is primarily supporting Amazon's Prime Now's same-day deliveries, but is beginning to expand into Amazon's recently announced Fresh service that will deliver perishables to customers' doors. The  products currently supplied by SpartanNash fall under the "dry and chill," category, Staples said.
"I think our reputation with them has expanded and that's how the Fresh group has gotten interested," Staples said. 
SpartanNash CEO Dennis Eidson mentioned the arrangement during the previous earnings call in February. A company spokeswoman declined to provide any additional information at the time. 
During the call, the company leaders also announced plans to rebanner eight Omaha area stores to Family Fare. As part of the process, three stores in the region were recently shuttered.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
See also: Nash Finch Company
The chain was founded in 1917 as the Grand Rapids Wholesale Grocery Company and assumed the Spartan Stores name in 1957. For most of its history, Spartan was a cooperative. Spartan changed to for profit in the 1970s and was first traded on the NASDAQ in August 2000.
In 2005, Spartan Stores, Inc. entered into a purchase agreement to acquire certain operating assets of D&W Food Centers, Inc.[4]
In 2013, Spartan Stores and Nash Finch merged and formed SpartanNash company. The official name change was to occur May 2014 but a new site with the official new name and logo opened in November 2013.[5] Under terms of the $1.3 billion deal, each Nash share would convert to 1.2 shares of Spartan Stock. Spartan retained 57.7% of the combined company while Nash owns 42.3% of the approximately 38 million outstanding stock shares. Integration and transaction closing-related costs of approximately $17 million to $18 million will be recorded in the quarter ending December 28, 2013.[6]
In March 2017. it was announced that David Staples will replace Dennis Edison as Chief Executive Officer of SpartanNash. Edison will continue as the chairman of the company's board of directors after he retires as CEO in late May.[7]
Expansion into retail[edit]
Spartan's retail operations started as independent grocery chains. However, in 1999, it bought the Family Fare, Great Day, Glen's, Ashcraft's, and Prevo's supermarket chains from their respective owners. To simplify advertising, the brands were consolidated into two: Family Fare in the south and Glen's in the north, each being the majority in its respective region.

In 2000, Spartan Stores merged with the Seaway Foodtown company whose operations included 47 Food Town Supermarkets and 26 The Pharm deep-discount drugstores. After the merger, the Food Town stores operated under their own banners, but heavy competition in areas where Food Town and The Pharm operated meant lower profits, and these stores negatively impacted the company's resources. Between 2000 and 2003, the company closed or sold eight Food Town Supermarkets and five The Pharm drugstores. In 2003, with an unmanageable debt load, Spartan Stores announced it would sell or close the 39 remaining Food Town stores and restructure the company.
In December 2005, Spartan Stores announced plans to purchase D&W Food Centers. The transaction closed at the end of March 2006. Ten of the twenty stores purchased retained the D&W banner, six others converted to the Family Fare banner, and the remaining four closed permanently.
In 2006, the company acquired through liquidation, five defunct Carter's Foods for which the company has not announced plans. It acquired the 20-store Felpausch chain of Hastings, Michigan in 2007 and has renovated one former store, in Williamston, Michigan, to the D&W Fresh Market banner and several others to the Family Fare banner.[8]
In April 2008, Spartan announced that "certain assets" from 12 of the 14 remaining Pharm stores will be sold to Rite Aid. The remaining two stores will be sold in separate transactions. Industry experts said Rite Aid would likely keep the stores open and convert them to its own format and brand.[9] The sale completed in late May 2008.
In October 2008, Spartan announced it would be purchase VGs Grocery and Pharmacy stores in Michigan.[10] In late January 2011, the company converted the Felpausch store in Grand Ledge, Michigan, to a Family Fare store. Other stores, including several Glen's Markets in Northern Michigan, began undergoing conversion to the Family Fare name.[11]
Spartan Stores announced its acquisition of Nash Finch Company, based in Edina, Minnesota in 2013.[12]

Seventeen of the stores were sold to the Kroger Company; nine to independent operators and 13 were closed.
The Pharm: Thirteen stores (pharmacies) in Ohio, and one store (pharmacy), in Southeast Michigan 26 The Pharm stores were owned and operated by Seaway Foodtown at the time of the Seaway Food Town/Spartan merger.

History[edit]
See also: Nash Finch Company
The chain was founded in 1917 as the Grand Rapids Wholesale Grocery Company and assumed the Spartan Stores name in 1957. For most of its history, Spartan was a cooperative. Spartan changed to for profit in the 1970s and was first traded on the NASDAQ in August 2000.
In 2005, Spartan Stores, Inc. entered into a purchase agreement to acquire certain operating assets of D&W Food Centers, Inc.[4]
In 2013, Spartan Stores and Nash Finch merged and formed SpartanNash company. The official name change was to occur May 2014 but a new site with the official new name and logo opened in November 2013.[5] Under terms of the $1.3 billion deal, each Nash share would convert to 1.2 shares of Spartan Stock. Spartan retained 57.7% of the combined company while Nash owns 42.3% of the approximately 38 million outstanding stock shares. Integration and transaction closing-related costs of approximately $17 million to $18 million will be recorded in the quarter ending December 28, 2013.[6]
In March 2017. it was announced that David Staples will replace Dennis Edison as Chief Executive Officer of SpartanNash. Edison will continue as the chairman of the company's board of directors after he retires as CEO in late May.[7]
Expansion into retail[edit]
Spartan's retail operations started as independent grocery chains. However, in 1999, it bought the Family Fare, Great Day, Glen's, Ashcraft's, and Prevo's supermarket chains from their respective owners. To simplify advertising, the brands were consolidated into two: Family Fare in the south and Glen's in the north, each being the majority in its respective region.

In 2000, Spartan Stores merged with the Seaway Foodtown company whose operations included 47 Food Town Supermarkets and 26 The Pharm deep-discount drugstores. After the merger, the Food Town stores operated under their own banners, but heavy competition in areas where Food Town and The Pharm operated meant lower profits, and these stores negatively impacted the company's resources. Between 2000 and 2003, the company closed or sold eight Food Town Supermarkets and five The Pharm drugstores. In 2003, with an unmanageable debt load, Spartan Stores announced it would sell or close the 39 remaining Food Town stores and restructure the company.
In December 2005, Spartan Stores announced plans to purchase D&W Food Centers. The transaction closed at the end of March 2006. Ten of the twenty stores purchased retained the D&W banner, six others converted to the Family Fare banner, and the remaining four closed permanently.
In 2006, the company acquired through liquidation, five defunct Carter's Foods for which the company has not announced plans. It acquired the 20-store Felpausch chain of Hastings, Michigan in 2007 and has renovated one former store, in Williamston, Michigan, to the D&W Fresh Market banner and several others to the Family Fare banner.[8]
In April 2008, Spartan announced that "certain assets" from 12 of the 14 remaining Pharm stores will be sold to Rite Aid. The remaining two stores will be sold in separate transactions. Industry experts said Rite Aid would likely keep the stores open and convert them to its own format and brand.[9] The sale completed in late May 2008.
In October 2008, Spartan announced it would be purchase VGs Grocery and Pharmacy stores in Michigan.[10] In late January 2011, the company converted the Felpausch store in Grand Ledge, Michigan, to a Family Fare store. Other stores, including several Glen's Markets in Northern Michigan, began undergoing conversion to the Family Fare name.[11]
Spartan Stores announced its acquisition of Nash Finch Company, based in Edina, Minnesota in 2013.[12]
Grocery retail stores[edit]
Prior to 2013

Family Fare: purchased in March 1999.
Glen's Markets: purchased in May 1999. Starting in 2013, SpartanNash began renovating Glen's stores while concurrently converting them to the Family Fare and D&W names;[13][14] the last converted in 2014[15]
D&W Fresh Market: purchase announced in December 2005 and completed in March 2006.
VG's Grocery: 11 stores (10 Pharmacies and 3 Quick Stops) in Eastern Michigan, purchased in December 2008. VG's was previously Spartan's largest independent distribution customer. In 2009, a location in New Baltimore closed; locations in Burton, Shelby Township, and Flint closed in December 2013.[16] The Waterford location was sold in March 2014;[17] The Pontiac location also closed in 2014.

All three Sunmart locations in Lincoln, Nebraska were closed over a short period of time by SpartanNash: in March and October 2014, and February 2015. A Hastings, Nebraska store was also closed in 2014, and SpartanNash performed a $1 million renovation on a Sunmart in Kearney, rebranding it as Family Fresh Market.[20]
Former grocery retail stores[edit]

Food Town: 45 Supermarkets in Ohio and Southeast Michigan acquired, along with 14 The Pharm drugstores from the Seaway Foodtown company of Maumee, Ohio in August 2000. These stores were originally operated under their acquired name, but in 2003, Spartan Stores announced that they were selling or closing all the Foodtown stores and dropping the Foodtown name from their roster of brands. Seventeen of the stores were sold to the Kroger Company; nine to independent operators and 13 were closed.
The Pharm: Thirteen stores (pharmacies) in Ohio, and one store (pharmacy), in Southeast Michigan 26 The Pharm stores were owned and operated by Seaway Foodtown at the time of the Seaway Food Town/Spartan merger. Over the years, many stores closed and the last 14 were sold in 2008: 12 stores to Rite-Aid; and 2 stores to independent operators.
Felpausch Food Centers: Purchased in early 2007. Spartan re-branded all the Felpausch locations except Kimball and, Leslie (Value Land) as D&W or Family Fare.

History[edit]
See also: Nash Finch Company
The chain was founded in 1917 as the Grand Rapids Wholesale Grocery Company and assumed the Spartan Stores name in 1957. For most of its history, Spartan was a cooperative. Spartan changed to for profit in the 1970s and was first traded on the NASDAQ in August 2000.
In 2005, Spartan Stores, Inc. entered into a purchase agreement to acquire certain operating assets of D&W Food Centers, Inc.[4]
In 2013, Spartan Stores and Nash Finch merged and formed SpartanNash company. The official name change was to occur May 2014 but a new site with the official new name and logo opened in November 2013.[5] Under terms of the $1.3 billion deal, each Nash share would convert to 1.2 shares of Spartan Stock. Spartan retained 57.7% of the combined company while Nash owns 42.3% of the approximately 38 million outstanding stock shares. Integration and transaction closing-related costs of approximately $17 million to $18 million will be recorded in the quarter ending December 28, 2013.[6]
In March 2017. it was announced that David Staples will replace Dennis Edison as Chief Executive Officer of SpartanNash. Edison will continue as the chairman of the company's board of directors after he retires as CEO in late May.[7]
Expansion into retail[edit]
Spartan's retail operations started as independent grocery chains. However, in 1999, it bought the Family Fare, Great Day, Glen's, Ashcraft's, and Prevo's supermarket chains from their respective owners. To simplify advertising, the brands were consolidated into two: Family Fare in the south and Glen's in the north, each being the majority in its respective region.

In 2000, Spartan Stores merged with the Seaway Foodtown company whose operations included 47 Food Town Supermarkets and 26 The Pharm deep-discount drugstores. After the merger, the Food Town stores operated under their own banners, but heavy competition in areas where Food Town and The Pharm operated meant lower profits, and these stores negatively impacted the company's resources. Between 2000 and 2003, the company closed or sold eight Food Town Supermarkets and five The Pharm drugstores. In 2003, with an unmanageable debt load, Spartan Stores announced it would sell or close the 39 remaining Food Town stores and restructure the company.
In December 2005, Spartan Stores announced plans to purchase D&W Food Centers. The transaction closed at the end of March 2006. Ten of the twenty stores purchased retained the D&W banner, six others converted to the Family Fare banner, and the remaining four closed permanently.
In 2006, the company acquired through liquidation, five defunct Carter's Foods for which the company has not announced plans. It acquired the 20-store Felpausch chain of Hastings, Michigan in 2007 and has renovated one former store, in Williamston, Michigan, to the D&W Fresh Market banner and several others to the Family Fare banner.[8]
In April 2008, Spartan announced that "certain assets" from 12 of the 14 remaining Pharm stores will be sold to Rite Aid. The remaining two stores will be sold in separate transactions. Industry experts said Rite Aid would likely keep the stores open and convert them to its own format and brand.[9] The sale completed in late May 2008.
In October 2008, Spartan announced it would be purchase VGs Grocery and Pharmacy stores in Michigan.[10] In late January 2011, the company converted the Felpausch store in Grand Ledge, Michigan, to a Family Fare store. Other stores, including several Glen's Markets in Northern Michigan, began undergoing conversion to the Family Fare name.[11]
Spartan Stores announced its acquisition of Nash Finch Company, based in Edina, Minnesota in 2013.[12]
Grocery retail stores[edit]
Prior to 2013

Family Fare: purchased in March 1999.
Glen's Markets: purchased in May 1999. Starting in 2013, SpartanNash began renovating Glen's stores while concurrently converting them to the Family Fare and D&W names;[13][14] the last converted in 2014[15]
D&W Fresh Market: purchase announced in December 2005 and completed in March 2006.
VG's Grocery: 11 stores (10 Pharmacies and 3 Quick Stops) in Eastern Michigan, purchased in December 2008. VG's was previously Spartan's largest independent distribution customer. In 2009, a location in New Baltimore closed; locations in Burton, Shelby Township, and Flint closed in December 2013.[16] The Waterford location was sold in March 2014;[17] The Pontiac location also closed in 2014.

History[edit]
See also: Nash Finch Company
The chain was founded in 1917 as the Grand Rapids Wholesale Grocery Company and assumed the Spartan Stores name in 1957. For most of its history, Spartan was a cooperative. Spartan changed to for profit in the 1970s and was first traded on the NASDAQ in August 2000.
In 2005, Spartan Stores, Inc. entered into a purchase agreement to acquire certain operating assets of D&W Food Centers, Inc.[4]
In 2013, Spartan Stores and Nash Finch merged and formed SpartanNash company. The official name change was to occur May 2014 but a new site with the official new name and logo opened in November 2013.[5] Under terms of the $1.3 billion deal, each Nash share would convert to 1.2 shares of Spartan Stock. Spartan retained 57.7% of the combined company while Nash owns 42.3% of the approximately 38 million outstanding stock shares. Integration and transaction closing-related costs of approximately $17 million to $18 million will be recorded in the quarter ending December 28, 2013.[6]
In March 2017. it was announced that David Staples will replace Dennis Edison as Chief Executive Officer of SpartanNash. Edison will continue as the chairman of the company's board of directors after he retires as CEO in late May.[7]
Expansion into retail[edit]
Spartan's retail operations started as independent grocery chains. However, in 1999, it bought the Family Fare, Great Day, Glen's, Ashcraft's, and Prevo's supermarket chains from their respective owners. To simplify advertising, the brands were consolidated into two: Family Fare in the south and Glen's in the north, each being the majority in its respective region.

In 2000, Spartan Stores merged with the Seaway Foodtown company whose operations included 47 Food Town Supermarkets and 26 The Pharm deep-discount drugstores. After the merger, the Food Town stores operated under their own banners, but heavy competition in areas where Food Town and The Pharm operated meant lower profits, and these stores negatively impacted the company's resources. Between 2000 and 2003, the company closed or sold eight Food Town Supermarkets and five The Pharm drugstores. In 2003, with an unmanageable debt load, Spartan Stores announced it would sell or close the 39 remaining Food Town stores and restructure the company.
In December 2005, Spartan Stores announced plans to purchase D&W Food Centers. The transaction closed at the end of March 2006. Ten of the twenty stores purchased retained the D&W banner, six others converted to the Family Fare banner, and the remaining four closed permanently.
In 2006, the company acquired through liquidation, five defunct Carter's Foods for which the company has not announced plans. It acquired the 20-store Felpausch chain of Hastings, Michigan in 2007 and has renovated one former store, in Williamston, Michigan, to the D&W Fresh Market banner and several others to the Family Fare banner.[8]
In April 2008, Spartan announced that "certain assets" from 12 of the 14 remaining Pharm stores will be sold to Rite Aid. The remaining two stores will be sold in separate transactions. Industry experts said Rite Aid would likely keep the stores open and convert them to its own format and brand.[9] The sale completed in late May 2008.
In October 2008, Spartan announced it would be purchase VGs Grocery and Pharmacy stores in Michigan.[10] In late January 2011, the company converted the Felpausch store in Grand Ledge, Michigan, to a Family Fare store. Other stores, including several Glen's Markets in Northern Michigan, began undergoing conversion to the Family Fare name.[11]
Spartan Stores announced its acquisition of Nash Finch Company, based in Edina, Minnesota in 2013.[12]
Grocery retail stores[edit]
Prior to 2013

Family Fare: purchased in March 1999.
Glen's Markets: purchased in May 1999. Starting in 2013, SpartanNash began renovating Glen's stores while concurrently converting them to the Family Fare and D&W names;[13][14] the last converted in 2014[15]
D&W Fresh Market: purchase announced in December 2005 and completed in March 2006.
VG's Grocery: 11 stores (10 Pharmacies and 3 Quick Stops) in Eastern Michigan, purchased in December 2008. VG's was previously Spartan's largest independent distribution customer. In 2009, a location in New Baltimore closed; locations in Burton, Shelby Township, and Flint closed in December 2013.[16] The Waterford location was sold in March 2014;[17] The Pontiac location also closed in 2014.

2013 Nash Finch Merger
With the Spartan Stores and Nash Finch Company merger in November 2013 the following stores were added:

Econofoods: 9 locations in Minnesota and Wisconsin.
Family Fresh Market: 1 location in Minnesota.
Family Thrift Center: 4 locations in South Dakota.
Germantown Fresh Market: Germantown, OH.
No Frills Supermarkets & Bag'n Save: 29 locations in Iowa and Nebraska.
Pick'n Save: 1 location in Ohio.
Prairie Market: 1 location in South Dakota.
Sun Mart Foods: 19 locations in Nebraska, North Dakota, Minnesota, and Colorado.
Supermercado Nuestra Familia: 2 locations in Nebraska.
Wholesale Food Outlet: 1 location in Iowa.

In August 2014, the company began rebranding select Sun Mart locations in West Fargo, ND and Dickinson, ND to the Family Fare Supermarkets format.[18] Two additional Fargo, ND stores and a Moorhead, MN store followed in October 2014.[19]
All three Sunmart locations in Lincoln, Nebraska were closed over a short period of time by SpartanNash: in March and October 2014, and February 2015. A Hastings, Nebraska store was also closed in 2014, and SpartanNash performed a $1 million renovation on a Sunmart in Kearney, rebranding it as Family Fresh Market.[20]
Former grocery retail stores[edit]

Food Town: 45 Supermarkets in Ohio and Southeast Michigan acquired, along with 14 The Pharm drugstores from the Seaway Foodtown company of Maumee, Ohio in August 2000. These stores were originally operated under their acquired name, but in 2003, Spartan Stores announced that they were selling or closing all the Foodtown stores and dropping the Foodtown name from their roster of brands. Seventeen of the stores were sold to the Kroger Company; nine to independent operators and 13 were closed.
The Pharm: Thirteen stores (pharmacies) in Ohio, and one store (pharmacy), in Southeast Michigan 26 The Pharm stores were owned and operated by Seaway Foodtown at the time of the Seaway Food Town/Spartan merger. Over the years, many stores closed and the last 14 were sold in 2008: 12 stores to Rite-Aid; and 2 stores to independent operators.
Felpausch Food Centers: Purchased in early 2007. Spartan re-branded all the Felpausch locations except Kimball and, Leslie (Value Land) as D&W or Family Fare.

BYRON CENTER — Despite a first quarter revenue decline, executives at grocery retailer and food distributor SpartanNash Co. say they’re hungry for new business opportunities and possibly acquisitions.
Speaking with analysts on a quarterly conference call Thursday, executives at the Byron Center-based company said they were “generally pleased” with the first quarter performance and believe there’s significant opportunity to continue growing the business as deals heat up in the industry.
“I think (M&A) was healthy over the last couple of years, and I think it remained healthy going into this year, and there is opportunity that we will continue to explore,” said Christopher Meyers, SpartanNash’s executive vice president and CFO. “But we want to make sure that whatever we do is a good deal.”
Additionally, SpartanNash (Nasdaq: SPTN) says it’s in the early stages of a new distribution partnership with online retailer Amazon.com Inc.
Executive Vice President and CFO David Staples told analysts that selling products to Amazon is a natural expansion for SpartanNash, which already sells food through a variety of channels, such as retail stores and to the military.
“We are distributing products to (Amazon’s) distribution centers for them to sell,” Staples said. “So they fit into that normal model. … We are servicing the Prime Now predominantly, but also beginning to grow into the (food and staple delivery option) Fresh a little bit.”
Staples described the work with Amazon as “a great relationship.”
While SpartanNash executives remain bullish on further opportunities, analysts on the call pointed out that the major driver for the company in the first quarter came from the distribution segment.
CEO Dennis Eidson said he doesn’t minimize the company’s lack of top-line growth but the focus remains on integrating SpartanNash’s various business units and concentrating on logistics issues.
“We’ve really put a lot of effort into this network,” Eidson said. “And when I talk about the network, we're really talking about a combination of our food distribution and military network to really begin to look at it more as one overall network dedicated to continuing to offer solutions to very complicated logistics issues. And we’ve elevated our thinking along those lines, and we’ve really pushed the business hard along those lines.”
Additionally, executives at the company see further growth opportunities as SpartanNash continues its expansion into the Omaha, Neb. market over the rest of the year.
SpartanNash reported $2.28 billion in first quarter sales, down from $2.31 billion in the same period in 2015.
Adjusted earnings were $20.4 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, compared to $16.6 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago.
As the company looks forward for the rest of the year, executives say that despite some uncertainty when it comes to regional challenges and overall macro-economic hurdles, the outlook for the remainder of 2016 is largely positive.
"We are cautiously optimistic about the remainder of the year given the deflationary environment and economic pressures in certain regions,” Eidson said in a statement. “We continue to focus on our western retail operations and will fully launch our Family Fare brand in Omaha during the second half of the year. This will include enhancing our merchandising, pricing and promotional strategies, including expanding our organic and private label product offerings and driving greater customer engagement through our loyalty program.”

SpartanNash Q2 Success Reflects Merger 'Synergy'
Company exceeds earnings guidance; same-store sales flat

August 14, 2014, 02:27 pm



 



SpartanNash Co.'s consolidated net sales for the second quarter ending July 12 increased 178 percent to $1.8 billion, compared to $651.1 million last year, primarily due to $1.2 billion in sales generated as a result of last November's merger of Spartan Stores with Nash Finch Co.
Reported operating earnings increased 115.3 percent to $32.6 million, compared to $15.2 million for the prior year quarter, primarily due to contributions from the merger with Nash Finch. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of low inflation, increased integration, restructuring and asset impairment charges, additional LIFO expense and a pension settlement accounting charge.
“We are pleased to have exceeded our adjusted earnings guidance for the second quarter,” said Dennis Eidson, SpartanNash president and CEO. “The earnings upside was driven primarily by continued favorable synergy realization and our retail segment. While the quarter started off slowly due to the later timing of Easter, sales trends improved as the quarter progressed and the retail division achieved positive comparable store sales over the back half of the second quarter despite some softening in the consumer environment. We have also made significant progress with our merger integration efforts and remain committed to providing excellent service and value to all of our retail, food distribution and military customers.”
Running the Numbers
Adjusted earnings from continuing operations for the second quarter were $19.1 million, or 50 cents per diluted share, compared to $10.2 million, or 46 cents per diluted share last year. Gross profit margin for Q2 was 14.7 percent compared to 20.5 percent in the prior year. The change in gross profit margin rate primarily reflects the change in the segment mix of operations due to the merger and the impact of continued low inflation.
Net sales for the food distribution segment increased 182.4 percent to $767.9 million in Q2 from $271.9 million for the year-ago period. The increase in sales was due to $501.4 million in sales from Nash Finch, partially offset by the negative effect of the change in timing of the Easter holiday and the reduction in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
Net sales for the retail segment increased 42.4 percent to $539.8 million in Q2, from $379.2 million a year ago, primarily due to $184.9 million in sales generated as a result of the merger and new and remodeled stores. Comparable store sales, excluding fuel, were flat to the prior year, primarily due to the later timing of Easter, which adversely affected the results by approximately 80 basis points and the impact of the cutbacks in SNAP benefits. In addition, retail sales reflect $17.1 million in fewer sales due to the store closures.
During the second quarter, the company completed three major remodels and began construction on two new stores. Additionally, two supermarkets were sold to distribution customers and one underperforming supermarket was closed. SpartanNash ended the quarter with 166 corporate-owned stores and 30 fuel centers.
Net sales for the company’s military segment were $502.4 million and operating earnings were $6.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2014.
