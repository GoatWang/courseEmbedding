Ideal Power Products Being Utilized to Form a Hybrid Microgrid for Island Business

200 Kilowatt / 300 Kilowatt Hour Solar-Plus-Storage System Enables Off-Grid Building to Reduce Reliance on Diesel Fuel Through Cost-Effective Renewable Power
AUSTIN, Texas, June  22, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ideal Power Inc., (NASDAQ:IPWR), an inventive power conversion technology company, today announced its products will serve in a collaborative hybrid microgrid project that will provide power to a commercial facility on the island of Saint Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Like many buildings in the Caribbean, this facility is completely disconnected from the central power grid and has relied exclusively on diesel generators for power 24 hours a day. With the deployment of Ideal Power’s six Stabiliti™ 30C3 multiport power conversion systems that integrate solar photovoltaic and batteries, with the existing diesel generators, the facility will be able to reduce fuel and energy costs, and cut greenhouse gas emissions by harnessing the power of the sun to power the facility.
The cost of electricity on the Caribbean islands averages about 50 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) – about three to five times that of the mainland United States. Decades of persistently high electricity prices, coupled with poor power quality and frequent grid outages have contributed to the region’s high cost of business and undercut growth in many Caribbean economies. Renewable energy technologies hold much promise for the region by bringing a diversification of energy sources and substantial cost reductions. “Our technology is enabling the deployment of clean, cost-effective and efficient power generation in areas where there is no reliable grid available,” said Dan Brdar, CEO of Ideal Power. “Thanks to our multiport technology, our six power conversion units will run in parallel to integrate solar, storage and diesel into a hybrid microgrid that will support cost effective power generation around the clock.” In an effort to transition to cost-effective sustainable power solutions, the Saint Croix-based commercial facility has called upon innovative energy partners to lead a next-generation solar-plus-storage project that encompasses six 33 kilowatt (kW) photovoltaic solar arrays, three 135 kW diesel generators and a 300 kWh battery. The integration of the solar and diesel power systems is made possible through six Stabiliti units, a compact solution that efficiently enables bi-directional power flow between solar, storage and diesel, all in one box. The hybrid microgrid is part of the facility’s environmentally progressive design, boasting high efficiency heating, ventilation and air conditioning, 100% LED lighting, and now, solar power generation. “This project represents a very smart move by an off-grid business,” said John Merritt, ‎director of applications engineering at Ideal Power. “Shifting to clean energy will offset costs and enable the business to focus on providing the best experience for its customers. We are optimistic that more island businesses and residences will see the potential of renewable energy systems to boost energy conservation and save on costs.” About Ideal Power Inc.Ideal Power (NASDAQ:IPWR) is a power conversion technology company that delivers efficient and compact solutions to system integrators and project developers to connect distributed energy resources to the grid. Ideal Power’s products offer enhanced performance for battery-enabled applications at a competitive cost, backed by first-rate customer service. With its patented power conversion technology, Ideal Power supports a broad set of growing markets, including solar photovoltaics, battery energy storage, mobile power and microgrids.

                        Why Us
                    


Transformative Innovation in the Power Conversion IndustryBy harnessing the power of software and semiconductor technology, we have developed a power conversion system technology that uses transformerless isolation, eliminating the bulky and inefficient components that have been the mainstay of power conversion for decades. This new approach results in power conversion systems that are smaller, lighter, more reliable and more efficient than conventional technologies, dramatically reducing installed costs.Next Generation Technology for the Clean Energy EconomyIn addition to the ongoing development of our current products, we have received patents for a new bidirectional silicon power switch design, the B-TRAN, which will further improve our competitive advantage in weight, size, cost reductions and efficiency.Powered by Creative ThinkingIdeal Power has been granted more than 40 patents in the U.S., Europe, China and other countries around the globe, with additional patents pending. We continue to aggressively pursue intellectual property protection for our current and future technologies to maintain our leadership position in the industry.

Energy StorageEnabling Technology to Cap Peak DemandBecause our products pair well with all leading battery technologies, they optimize the performance of battery storage and provide the best value on the market for peak demand management applications.Maximizing the value of energy storage means stripping away unnecessary components and processes that waste power. With considerable size and weight advantages, our systems have lower shipping and installation costs compared to conventional technology. Our power conversion systems are unobtrusive with a compact footprint and near silent operation, making them the ideal choice for EPCs, developers and energy storage system integrators.Renewable IntegrationA Key Component of the Clean Energy InfrastructureAs society’s energy demand begins to outpace utilities’ peak generation capacity, there is an increasing need to incorporate new forms of renewable energy into the grid. Our grid resilient, multi-port technology is the most efficient way to enable the convergence of renewable and conventional energy to support growing energy demand.Microgrids & Critical PowerContributing to Global Energy Security and IndependenceOur grid resilient technology integrates solar PV and conventional generation with battery storage to deliver stable, flexible and reliable energy whether on-grid or off-grid. Compatible with both 50Hz and 60Hz environments, our systems enable energy applications from microgrids to grid support in a variety of global markets.

The Catalyst of Innovation is in our Core
By harnessing the power of software and semiconductor technology, Ideal Power has developed our patented Power Packet Switching Architecture (PPSA™) eliminating the bulky and inefficient passive components that have been the mainstay of power conversion for decades. This new approach results in power conversion systems that are smaller, lighter, more reliable and more efficient than conventional technologies, dramatically reducing installation costs while increasing return on investment.
 
 PPSA Whitepaper
Enabling Renewable Energy Revolution
The success of solar-plus-storage – which has gained recent traction and is expected to continue to grow – depends largely on effective inverter technologies as well. Solar-plus-storage in the commercial sector has the ability to reduce demand charge risk, minimize costs and enhance the resilience of a building’s power supply.
Because our products pair well with leading battery technologies, they optimize the performance of energy storage and provide the best value on the market for peak demand management, alternating current (AC) microgrids, direct current (DC) microgrids and backup power applications.
Our grid-resilient, bidirectional multiport technology is the most effective way to enable the convergence of renewable and conventional energy. Our technologies support variable energy demand, enabling energy from any port, to any port, as well as on or off the grid.
Product Line
30 kW Stabiliti™ Series Multiport Power Conversion SystemOrdering Model No. 30C3
The Stabiliti™ Series PCS is galvanically isolated, indoor/outdoor rated, and is the smallest PCS in its class.  The 30C3 model is a multiport hybrid power converter supporting bi-directional power flows between all three of its power ports (AC-DC-DC) enabling a variety of applications such as solar+storage, demand management, EV charging, backup power and microgrids.
