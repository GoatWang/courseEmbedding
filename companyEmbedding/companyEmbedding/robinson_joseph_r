Education[edit]
Robinson began his professional education at the College of Pharmacy of Columbia University in New York City which led to B.S. (1961) and M.S. (1963) degrees in pharmacy. During that period the Columbia College of Pharmacy (since discontinued) possessed on its faculty several rigorously trained and enthusiastic scientists, some of whom had received their graduate education at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. It was this influence that led to his taking his Ph.D. (in 1966) at the School of Pharmacy at Madison, where his major professor was Takeru Higuchi, informally though widely known as 'the father of physical pharmacy'.
Research[edit]
After joining the UW School of Pharmacy faculty as an assistant professor in 1966, Robinson’s early research was in physical organic chemistry, but he soon shifted his attention to issues of biopharmaceutics, pharmacokinetics, and the general field of drug delivery. He was promoted to full professor in 1973.
His first sustained research program in the drug delivery area concerned the eye, and indeed this interest in ocular drug delivery continued throughout his career. (He held the concomitant position of Professor, then Professor Emeritus, in the Department of Ophthalmology, Medical School, UW–Madison). Later research work included contributions on oral, parenteral, buccal, and vaginal drug delivery systems and mechanisms, with a strong emphasis on bioadhesion as a control phenomenon.
Academics[edit]
Besides his contributions to the primary literature of these fields of research, he served on editorial boards of sixteen journals, he was the editor of two journals, and he edited a half dozen books on drug delivery, most influentially perhaps his 1978 volume “Sustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems”. He held over two dozen patents on delivery systems, and founded two companies in order to transform his ideas into practice. He also served on the boards of directors of numerous pharmaceutical companies.
Robinson guided forty Ph.D. candidates and many post-doctoral associates. He also carried a professional (that is, undergraduate) teaching load, and was popular with pharmacy students, who on numerous occasions voted him their favorite instructor. His courses in the professional program were in the pharmaceutics area, and included routes and mechanisms of drug administration, dosage form design, formulation issues, and extended even to manufacturing processes.
Robinson played an influential role in the self-governing process of the School of Pharmacy, and was particularly effective, in recent years, in leading the faculty concentration in the drug delivery area to a definite emphasis on biomaterials research. Yet despite his own interest in making practical application of drug delivery concepts, he never ceased to insist, at both the professional and graduate levels, a sound basis in the scientific foundations of pharmacy was the most effective form of pharmaceutical education.
Awards[edit]
Professor Robinson received many professional honors throughout his career, including the Ebert Prize of the American Pharmaceutical Association (APhA) in 1989, the Takeru Higuchi Research Prize (APhA, 1997), the Dale E. Wurster Award from the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists in 1996, the Honorary Doctor of Science degree from the University of the Sciences (Philadelphia), 2003, Doctor Honoris Causa, Royal Danish School of Pharmacy, 1992, and the Nagai Award of the Japanese Pharmaceutical Association in 1990. He held the title Edward Kremers Emeritus Professor of Pharmacy in the School of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin–Madison.

Reported Cases

M&H University Shoppes, LLLP v. Great China Restaurant, Inc., et al. – obtained summary judgment in favor of the landlord in a complex commercial landlord-tenant action.

Camp v. Community Supports, Inc. et al. – defeated plaintiff's motion to amend complaint to add punitive damages against multiple corporate entities after oral argument in a complex wrongful death action. Denial of motion resulted in favorable settlement to the client.

Mariner Club v. Summit Contractors, Inc. – represented an owner in multimillion-dollar construction claim based on damages to a multifamily apartment complex as a result of water intrusion; contractor obtained summary judgment in November 2008 and owner appealed. Following submission of complex appellate briefs and oral argument, 1st DCA ultimately reversed the award of summary judgment and remanded the case back to trial court, resulting in a favorable settlement to the owner.

One South Orange, Ltd. v. Gino’s Pizza – Lead trial counsel on behalf of the owner of a historical commercial building in Downtown Orlando, against a tenant who alleged owner breached various terms of a long-term, commercial lease. At the conclusion of trial, court awarded owner with a favorable verdict which tenant ultimately appealed after tenant’s motion for new trial was denied. The parties ultimately resolved the post-trial and appellate issues, tenant vacated the building, and dismissed the appeal.

Bernardo v. Bowyer Singleton & Associates, Inc. – Lead trial counsel representing Bowyer Singleton & Associates, Inc., a reputable Orlando based engineering firm, in a highly publicized case involving an Orlando housing development which was built near a former World War II-era bombing range. Homeowners alleged that various types of weapons and equipment left behind by the United States Military at the conclusion of World War II, were discovered within the borders of the housing development. Consequently, homeowners alleged the value of their homes was significantly reduced due to the stigma associated with the bombing range. Prior to trial, Bowyer Singleton, was dismissed from the case, with prejudice, after the court granted their motion for summary judgment, and awarded litigation costs in their favor.

For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Conditions TreatedAneurysmAngina and Acute Coronary SyndromeAortic AneurysmAortic EctasiaAortic Valve DiseaseArrhythmiasAtrial FibrillationBenign TumorCardiomegalyCardiomyopathyChest PainCongestive Heart FailureCoronary Artery Disease (CAD)EndocarditisHeart Attack (Acute Myocardial Infarction)Heart DiseaseHeart MurmurHeart PalpitationsHeart Tumors, BenignHyperlipidemiaHypertensionHypertensive Chronic Kidney DiseaseHypertensive Heart DiseaseHypertensive Heart and Chronic Kidney DiseaseHypotensionLimb SwellingLimb Swelling Caused by Fluid OverloadMitral Valve DiseasePericardial DiseasePulmonary DiseasePulmonary HypertensionSyncopeThrombosisVascular DiseaseEducationMedical SchoolHoward Univ Coll Of MedGraduated in 1978Residency HospitalHowardCompleted in 1981Fellowship HospitalHowardCompleted in 1986Languages SpokenEnglishMemberships & Professional AffiliationsDr. Robinson does not have any memberships or affiliations listed.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
