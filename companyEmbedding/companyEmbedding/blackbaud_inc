Florida International University
“Whether you are an experienced coder or a first day user of Blackbaud products, the Learn program that's part of Blackbaud nonprofit training and its resources provide you with a wealth of information from which you can solve pressing issues within your organization.” - Philip Slama, Data Integrity Coordinator
 

The Baptist Foundation of Oklahoma

Blackbaud Inc. (NASDAQ:BLKB) is a supplier of software and services specifically designed for nonprofit organizations. Its products focus on fundraising, website management, CRM, analytics, financial management, ticketing, and education administration.[1][2][3][4][5]
Blackbaud's flagship product is a fundraising SQL database software, Raiser's Edge.[1] Revenue from the sale of Raiser’s Edge and related services accounted for thirty percent of Blackbaud’s total revenue in 2012.[1] Other products and services include Blackbaud Enterprise CRM, Financial Edge, Education Edge, Blackbaud NetCommunity, eTapestry, Luminate Online, Luminate CRM, Friends Asking Friends, Altru museum management software and Target Analytics.[1] In addition, Blackbaud offers consultancy services to nonprofit organizations.[1]
Blackbaud was founded in 1981 by Anthony Bakker.[1][6] The company is headquartered in Daniel Island, Charleston, South Carolina on a site shared with the Charleston Battery, a professional soccer club founded and owned by Bakker. It has additional offices in Cambridge, Massachusetts; Indianapolis, Indiana; Miami Beach, Florida; Alexandria, Virginia; San Diego, California; Austin, Texas; Emeryville, California; Washington, D.C.; Overland Park, Kansas; Lincoln, Nebraska; Toronto, Ontario; Glasgow, Scotland; London, England; Chesham, England; Sydney, Australia; and Almere, Netherlands.[1]

History[edit]
Blackbaud’s history traces back to 1981, when Blackbaud founder Anthony Bakker developed a computerized billing system for the Nightingale-Bamford School in Manhattan, New York City.[6][8] By 1982, Bakker’s expanded client list allowed him to quit his day job as a banker and he incorporated Blackbaud Microsystems.[6][8] Bakker’s new company was headquartered in New York City.[6][8] Blackbaud’s first product was Student Billing, an accounts receivable system geared toward private grade schools.[6] The company’s flagship product, The Raiser’s Edge, was developed from its Student Billing product.[6][8]
The company had 75 employees in 1989, when it decided to relocate from New York City due to high operational costs. Blackbaud relocated to Mount Pleasant, South Carolina with the help of a $750,000 business loan.[8] Of the company’s original 75 employees, 30 remained in a support and training office in New York City and 15 relocated to Blackbaud’s new South Carolina headquarters. In 1992, the company outgrew its Mount Pleasant headquarters and relocated to North Charleston, South Carolina.[8]
In 1994, Blackbaud converted its software offerings from DOS to Windows 95.[6][8] This decision led to a sales increase from $19 million in 1995 to $26 million in 1996.[6] During this time Blackbaud acquired multiple DOS-based competitors, including ACOMS of Burlington, Massachusetts; Master Systems Inc. of Pinole, California; and Blackbaud’s “chief challenger,” Master Software of Indianapolis, Indiana.[6][8] Blackbaud’s acquisition of Master Software doubled its customer base.[6]
In 1998, Blackbaud began using value-added resellers, which further expanded the company’s customer base.[6][9] In 2000, Robert Sywolski became CEO of Blackbaud.[9] Sywolski had previously served as CEO of North American operations for Cap Gemini, an international consulting firm.[6][9]
Blackbaud successfully completed its initial public offering in 2004. Sixteen months later, in November 2005, Marc Chardon replaced Sywolski as Blackbaud CEO.[10][11] Chardon had previously served as chief financial officer of Microsoft’s information worker group, which developed Microsoft Office among other products.[10][11]
In 2006, Blackbaud acquired Campagne Associates.[12][13] The company added both Target Software and Target Analysis Group in 2007.[14] Target Software developed large-scale database management solutions while the Target Analysis Group focused primarily on data mining for nonprofits.[14] Later that year, Blackbaud also acquired eTapestry, an online donor management tool.[15]
Blackbaud acquired Kintera in 2008.[16] In 2012, the company acquired Convio.[5][13]
In early 2013, Blackbaud announced that CEO Marc Chardon would leave the company by the end of that year.[17] Anthony Boor became Blackbaud’s interim CEO in August 2013.[18][19] Boor joined Blackbaud as the company’s chief financial officer in 2011.[19] He was credited with leading Blackbaud’s acquisition of Convio.[19]
In November 2013, Michael Gianoni was named the new president and CEO for Blackbaud.[7]
Products[edit]
Blackbaud creates software that helps nonprofits with CRM, marketing campaigns, fundraising and analytics.[20] The company has three customer relationship management (CRM) offerings: The Raiser's Edge, Blackbaud CRM and Luminate CRM.[21] Blackbaud CRM is a web-based platform that is the company's lead offering for larger organizations that need to handle complex tasks.[21][22] Luminate is Blackbaud's offering for mid-tier organizations and is fully integrated with Salesforce.com.[21][22]
Philanthropy[edit]
Blackbaud has an extensive corporate citizenship and philanthropy program. Volunteer for Vacation is an employee initiative, where the company gives paid vacation to employees who participate in volunteer community service.[23][24] The company's Reward your Passion initiative allows employees to apply for company-funded grants that help a charity of their choice.[24][25] In 2013, the company expanded its grant program to include locations beyond its Charleston, South Carolina headquarters.[26] Later that year, Blackbaud launched Business Doing Good, a website that is focused on providing information for small and medium-sized businesses to create their own corporate philanthropy programs.[27] The company also hosts volunteer fairs and other community service events throughout the year.[25]

History[edit]
Blackbaud’s history traces back to 1981, when Blackbaud founder Anthony Bakker developed a computerized billing system for the Nightingale-Bamford School in Manhattan, New York City.[6][8] By 1982, Bakker’s expanded client list allowed him to quit his day job as a banker and he incorporated Blackbaud Microsystems.[6][8] Bakker’s new company was headquartered in New York City.[6][8] Blackbaud’s first product was Student Billing, an accounts receivable system geared toward private grade schools.[6] The company’s flagship product, The Raiser’s Edge, was developed from its Student Billing product.[6][8]
The company had 75 employees in 1989, when it decided to relocate from New York City due to high operational costs. Blackbaud relocated to Mount Pleasant, South Carolina with the help of a $750,000 business loan.[8] Of the company’s original 75 employees, 30 remained in a support and training office in New York City and 15 relocated to Blackbaud’s new South Carolina headquarters. In 1992, the company outgrew its Mount Pleasant headquarters and relocated to North Charleston, South Carolina.[8]
In 1994, Blackbaud converted its software offerings from DOS to Windows 95.[6][8] This decision led to a sales increase from $19 million in 1995 to $26 million in 1996.[6] During this time Blackbaud acquired multiple DOS-based competitors, including ACOMS of Burlington, Massachusetts; Master Systems Inc. of Pinole, California; and Blackbaud’s “chief challenger,” Master Software of Indianapolis, Indiana.[6][8] Blackbaud’s acquisition of Master Software doubled its customer base.[6]
In 1998, Blackbaud began using value-added resellers, which further expanded the company’s customer base.[6][9] In 2000, Robert Sywolski became CEO of Blackbaud.[9] Sywolski had previously served as CEO of North American operations for Cap Gemini, an international consulting firm.[6][9]
Blackbaud successfully completed its initial public offering in 2004. Sixteen months later, in November 2005, Marc Chardon replaced Sywolski as Blackbaud CEO.[10][11] Chardon had previously served as chief financial officer of Microsoft’s information worker group, which developed Microsoft Office among other products.[10][11]
In 2006, Blackbaud acquired Campagne Associates.[12][13] The company added both Target Software and Target Analysis Group in 2007.[14] Target Software developed large-scale database management solutions while the Target Analysis Group focused primarily on data mining for nonprofits.[14] Later that year, Blackbaud also acquired eTapestry, an online donor management tool.[15]
Blackbaud acquired Kintera in 2008.[16] In 2012, the company acquired Convio.[5][13]
In early 2013, Blackbaud announced that CEO Marc Chardon would leave the company by the end of that year.[17] Anthony Boor became Blackbaud’s interim CEO in August 2013.[18][19] Boor joined Blackbaud as the company’s chief financial officer in 2011.[19] He was credited with leading Blackbaud’s acquisition of Convio.[19]
In November 2013, Michael Gianoni was named the new president and CEO for Blackbaud.[7]
Products[edit]
Blackbaud creates software that helps nonprofits with CRM, marketing campaigns, fundraising and analytics.[20] The company has three customer relationship management (CRM) offerings: The Raiser's Edge, Blackbaud CRM and Luminate CRM.[21] Blackbaud CRM is a web-based platform that is the company's lead offering for larger organizations that need to handle complex tasks.[21][22] Luminate is Blackbaud's offering for mid-tier organizations and is fully integrated with Salesforce.com.[21][22]
Philanthropy[edit]
Blackbaud has an extensive corporate citizenship and philanthropy program. Volunteer for Vacation is an employee initiative, where the company gives paid vacation to employees who participate in volunteer community service.[23][24] The company's Reward your Passion initiative allows employees to apply for company-funded grants that help a charity of their choice.[24][25] In 2013, the company expanded its grant program to include locations beyond its Charleston, South Carolina headquarters.[26] Later that year, Blackbaud launched Business Doing Good, a website that is focused on providing information for small and medium-sized businesses to create their own corporate philanthropy programs.[27] The company also hosts volunteer fairs and other community service events throughout the year.[25]

Blackbaud
A developer of business management software designed for the non-profit sector.
Speak with a Blackbaud provider





Incorporated in 1982 as Blackbaud MicroSystems, the company was originally located on Long Island and served the software needs of independent schools. Blackbaud’s first product, Student Billing (an accounts receivable program designed to run on a microcomputer), was written in 1981 for the Nightingale-Bamford School and led to the development of other accounting products and the decision to found Blackbaud. 
In recognition of Blackbaud’s relationship with independent schools, the name Blackbaud was coined from “blackboard” and “baud,” which is a computer term for the speed of data transmission. In 1992, the name of the company was shortened to Blackbaud, Inc.

Blackbaud Inc. (NASDAQ:BLKB) is a supplier of software and services specifically designed for nonprofit organizations. Its products focus on fundraising, website management, CRM, analytics, financial management, ticketing, and education administration.[1][2][3][4][5]
Blackbaud's flagship product is a fundraising SQL database software, Raiser's Edge.[1] Revenue from the sale of Raiser’s Edge and related services accounted for thirty percent of Blackbaud’s total revenue in 2012.[1] Other products and services include Blackbaud Enterprise CRM, Financial Edge, Education Edge, Blackbaud NetCommunity, eTapestry, Luminate Online, Luminate CRM, Friends Asking Friends, Altru museum management software and Target Analytics.[1] In addition, Blackbaud offers consultancy services to nonprofit organizations.[1]
Blackbaud was founded in 1981 by Anthony Bakker.[1][6] The company is headquartered in Daniel Island, Charleston, South Carolina on a site shared with the Charleston Battery, a professional soccer club founded and owned by Bakker. It has additional offices in Cambridge, Massachusetts; Indianapolis, Indiana; Miami Beach, Florida; Alexandria, Virginia; San Diego, California; Austin, Texas; Emeryville, California; Washington, D.C.; Overland Park, Kansas; Lincoln, Nebraska; Toronto, Ontario; Glasgow, Scotland; London, England; Chesham, England; Sydney, Australia; and Almere, Netherlands.[1]

History[edit]
Blackbaud’s history traces back to 1981, when Blackbaud founder Anthony Bakker developed a computerized billing system for the Nightingale-Bamford School in Manhattan, New York City.[6][8] By 1982, Bakker’s expanded client list allowed him to quit his day job as a banker and he incorporated Blackbaud Microsystems.[6][8] Bakker’s new company was headquartered in New York City.[6][8] Blackbaud’s first product was Student Billing, an accounts receivable system geared toward private grade schools.[6] The company’s flagship product, The Raiser’s Edge, was developed from its Student Billing product.[6][8]
The company had 75 employees in 1989, when it decided to relocate from New York City due to high operational costs. Blackbaud relocated to Mount Pleasant, South Carolina with the help of a $750,000 business loan.[8] Of the company’s original 75 employees, 30 remained in a support and training office in New York City and 15 relocated to Blackbaud’s new South Carolina headquarters. In 1992, the company outgrew its Mount Pleasant headquarters and relocated to North Charleston, South Carolina.[8]
In 1994, Blackbaud converted its software offerings from DOS to Windows 95.[6][8] This decision led to a sales increase from $19 million in 1995 to $26 million in 1996.[6] During this time Blackbaud acquired multiple DOS-based competitors, including ACOMS of Burlington, Massachusetts; Master Systems Inc. of Pinole, California; and Blackbaud’s “chief challenger,” Master Software of Indianapolis, Indiana.[6][8] Blackbaud’s acquisition of Master Software doubled its customer base.[6]
In 1998, Blackbaud began using value-added resellers, which further expanded the company’s customer base.[6][9] In 2000, Robert Sywolski became CEO of Blackbaud.[9] Sywolski had previously served as CEO of North American operations for Cap Gemini, an international consulting firm.[6][9]
Blackbaud successfully completed its initial public offering in 2004. Sixteen months later, in November 2005, Marc Chardon replaced Sywolski as Blackbaud CEO.[10][11] Chardon had previously served as chief financial officer of Microsoft’s information worker group, which developed Microsoft Office among other products.[10][11]
In 2006, Blackbaud acquired Campagne Associates.[12][13] The company added both Target Software and Target Analysis Group in 2007.[14] Target Software developed large-scale database management solutions while the Target Analysis Group focused primarily on data mining for nonprofits.[14] Later that year, Blackbaud also acquired eTapestry, an online donor management tool.[15]
Blackbaud acquired Kintera in 2008.[16] In 2012, the company acquired Convio.[5][13]
In early 2013, Blackbaud announced that CEO Marc Chardon would leave the company by the end of that year.[17] Anthony Boor became Blackbaud’s interim CEO in August 2013.[18][19] Boor joined Blackbaud as the company’s chief financial officer in 2011.[19] He was credited with leading Blackbaud’s acquisition of Convio.[19]
In November 2013, Michael Gianoni was named the new president and CEO for Blackbaud.[7]
Products[edit]
Blackbaud creates software that helps nonprofits with CRM, marketing campaigns, fundraising and analytics.[20] The company has three customer relationship management (CRM) offerings: The Raiser's Edge, Blackbaud CRM and Luminate CRM.[21] Blackbaud CRM is a web-based platform that is the company's lead offering for larger organizations that need to handle complex tasks.[21][22] Luminate is Blackbaud's offering for mid-tier organizations and is fully integrated with Salesforce.com.[21][22]
Philanthropy[edit]
Blackbaud has an extensive corporate citizenship and philanthropy program. Volunteer for Vacation is an employee initiative, where the company gives paid vacation to employees who participate in volunteer community service.[23][24] The company's Reward your Passion initiative allows employees to apply for company-funded grants that help a charity of their choice.[24][25] In 2013, the company expanded its grant program to include locations beyond its Charleston, South Carolina headquarters.[26] Later that year, Blackbaud launched Business Doing Good, a website that is focused on providing information for small and medium-sized businesses to create their own corporate philanthropy programs.[27] The company also hosts volunteer fairs and other community service events throughout the year.[25]

Blackbaud Inc. (NASDAQ:BLKB) is a supplier of software and services specifically designed for nonprofit organizations. Its products focus on fundraising, website management, CRM, analytics, financial management, ticketing, and education administration.[1][2][3][4][5]
Blackbaud's flagship product is a fundraising SQL database software, Raiser's Edge.[1] Revenue from the sale of Raiser’s Edge and related services accounted for thirty percent of Blackbaud’s total revenue in 2012.[1] Other products and services include Blackbaud Enterprise CRM, Financial Edge, Education Edge, Blackbaud NetCommunity, eTapestry, Luminate Online, Luminate CRM, Friends Asking Friends, Altru museum management software and Target Analytics.[1] In addition, Blackbaud offers consultancy services to nonprofit organizations.[1]

It has additional offices in Cambridge, Massachusetts; Indianapolis, Indiana; Miami Beach, Florida; Alexandria, Virginia; San Diego, California; Austin, Texas; Emeryville, California; Washington, D.C.; Overland Park, Kansas; Lincoln, Nebraska; Toronto, Ontario; Glasgow, Scotland; London, England; Chesham, England; Sydney, Australia; and Almere, Netherlands.[1]

History[edit]
Blackbaud’s history traces back to 1981, when Blackbaud founder Anthony Bakker developed a computerized billing system for the Nightingale-Bamford School in Manhattan, New York City.[6][8] By 1982, Bakker’s expanded client list allowed him to quit his day job as a banker and he incorporated Blackbaud Microsystems.[6][8] Bakker’s new company was headquartered in New York City.[6][8] Blackbaud’s first product was Student Billing, an accounts receivable system geared toward private grade schools.[6] The company’s flagship product, The Raiser’s Edge, was developed from its Student Billing product.[6][8]
The company had 75 employees in 1989, when it decided to relocate from New York City due to high operational costs. Blackbaud relocated to Mount Pleasant, South Carolina with the help of a $750,000 business loan.[8] Of the company’s original 75 employees, 30 remained in a support and training office in New York City and 15 relocated to Blackbaud’s new South Carolina headquarters. In 1992, the company outgrew its Mount Pleasant headquarters and relocated to North Charleston, South Carolina.[8]
In 1994, Blackbaud converted its software offerings from DOS to Windows 95.[6][8] This decision led to a sales increase from $19 million in 1995 to $26 million in 1996.[6] During this time Blackbaud acquired multiple DOS-based competitors, including ACOMS of Burlington, Massachusetts; Master Systems Inc. of Pinole, California; and Blackbaud’s “chief challenger,” Master Software of Indianapolis, Indiana.[6][8] Blackbaud’s acquisition of Master Software doubled its customer base.[6]
In 1998, Blackbaud began using value-added resellers, which further expanded the company’s customer base.[6][9] In 2000, Robert Sywolski became CEO of Blackbaud.[9] Sywolski had previously served as CEO of North American operations for Cap Gemini, an international consulting firm.[6][9]
Blackbaud successfully completed its initial public offering in 2004. Sixteen months later, in November 2005, Marc Chardon replaced Sywolski as Blackbaud CEO.[10][11] Chardon had previously served as chief financial officer of Microsoft’s information worker group, which developed Microsoft Office among other products.[10][11]
In 2006, Blackbaud acquired Campagne Associates.[12][13] The company added both Target Software and Target Analysis Group in 2007.[14] Target Software developed large-scale database management solutions while the Target Analysis Group focused primarily on data mining for nonprofits.[14] Later that year, Blackbaud also acquired eTapestry, an online donor management tool.[15]
Blackbaud acquired Kintera in 2008.[16] In 2012, the company acquired Convio.[5][13]
In early 2013, Blackbaud announced that CEO Marc Chardon would leave the company by the end of that year.[17] Anthony Boor became Blackbaud’s interim CEO in August 2013.[18][19] Boor joined Blackbaud as the company’s chief financial officer in 2011.[19] He was credited with leading Blackbaud’s acquisition of Convio.[19]
In November 2013, Michael Gianoni was named the new president and CEO for Blackbaud.[7]
Products[edit]
Blackbaud creates software that helps nonprofits with CRM, marketing campaigns, fundraising and analytics.[20] The company has three customer relationship management (CRM) offerings: The Raiser's Edge, Blackbaud CRM and Luminate CRM.[21] Blackbaud CRM is a web-based platform that is the company's lead offering for larger organizations that need to handle complex tasks.[21][22] Luminate is Blackbaud's offering for mid-tier organizations and is fully integrated with Salesforce.com.[21][22]
Philanthropy[edit]
Blackbaud has an extensive corporate citizenship and philanthropy program. Volunteer for Vacation is an employee initiative, where the company gives paid vacation to employees who participate in volunteer community service.[23][24] The company's Reward your Passion initiative allows employees to apply for company-funded grants that help a charity of their choice.[24][25] In 2013, the company expanded its grant program to include locations beyond its Charleston, South Carolina headquarters.[26] Later that year, Blackbaud launched Business Doing Good, a website that is focused on providing information for small and medium-sized businesses to create their own corporate philanthropy programs.[27] The company also hosts volunteer fairs and other community service events throughout the year.[25]

Blackbaud Inc. (NASDAQ:BLKB) is a supplier of software and services specifically designed for nonprofit organizations. Its products focus on fundraising, website management, CRM, analytics, financial management, ticketing, and education administration.[1][2][3][4][5]
Blackbaud's flagship product is a fundraising SQL database software, Raiser's Edge.[1] Revenue from the sale of Raiser’s Edge and related services accounted for thirty percent of Blackbaud’s total revenue in 2012.[1] Other products and services include Blackbaud Enterprise CRM, Financial Edge, Education Edge, Blackbaud NetCommunity, eTapestry, Luminate Online, Luminate CRM, Friends Asking Friends, Altru museum management software and Target Analytics.[1] In addition, Blackbaud offers consultancy services to nonprofit organizations.[1]
Blackbaud was founded in 1981 by Anthony Bakker.[1][6] The company is headquartered in Daniel Island, Charleston, South Carolina on a site shared with the Charleston Battery, a professional soccer club founded and owned by Bakker. It has additional offices in Cambridge, Massachusetts; Indianapolis, Indiana; Miami Beach, Florida; Alexandria, Virginia; San Diego, California; Austin, Texas; Emeryville, California; Washington, D.C.; Overland Park, Kansas; Lincoln, Nebraska; Toronto, Ontario; Glasgow, Scotland; London, England; Chesham, England; Sydney, Australia; and Almere, Netherlands.[1]

History[edit]
Blackbaud’s history traces back to 1981, when Blackbaud founder Anthony Bakker developed a computerized billing system for the Nightingale-Bamford School in Manhattan, New York City.[6][8] By 1982, Bakker’s expanded client list allowed him to quit his day job as a banker and he incorporated Blackbaud Microsystems.[6][8] Bakker’s new company was headquartered in New York City.[6][8] Blackbaud’s first product was Student Billing, an accounts receivable system geared toward private grade schools.[6] The company’s flagship product, The Raiser’s Edge, was developed from its Student Billing product.[6][8]
The company had 75 employees in 1989, when it decided to relocate from New York City due to high operational costs. Blackbaud relocated to Mount Pleasant, South Carolina with the help of a $750,000 business loan.[8] Of the company’s original 75 employees, 30 remained in a support and training office in New York City and 15 relocated to Blackbaud’s new South Carolina headquarters. In 1992, the company outgrew its Mount Pleasant headquarters and relocated to North Charleston, South Carolina.[8]
In 1994, Blackbaud converted its software offerings from DOS to Windows 95.[6][8] This decision led to a sales increase from $19 million in 1995 to $26 million in 1996.[6] During this time Blackbaud acquired multiple DOS-based competitors, including ACOMS of Burlington, Massachusetts; Master Systems Inc. of Pinole, California; and Blackbaud’s “chief challenger,” Master Software of Indianapolis, Indiana.[6][8] Blackbaud’s acquisition of Master Software doubled its customer base.[6]
In 1998, Blackbaud began using value-added resellers, which further expanded the company’s customer base.[6][9] In 2000, Robert Sywolski became CEO of Blackbaud.[9] Sywolski had previously served as CEO of North American operations for Cap Gemini, an international consulting firm.[6][9]
Blackbaud successfully completed its initial public offering in 2004. Sixteen months later, in November 2005, Marc Chardon replaced Sywolski as Blackbaud CEO.[10][11] Chardon had previously served as chief financial officer of Microsoft’s information worker group, which developed Microsoft Office among other products.[10][11]
In 2006, Blackbaud acquired Campagne Associates.[12][13] The company added both Target Software and Target Analysis Group in 2007.[14] Target Software developed large-scale database management solutions while the Target Analysis Group focused primarily on data mining for nonprofits.[14] Later that year, Blackbaud also acquired eTapestry, an online donor management tool.[15]
Blackbaud acquired Kintera in 2008.[16] In 2012, the company acquired Convio.[5][13]
In early 2013, Blackbaud announced that CEO Marc Chardon would leave the company by the end of that year.[17] Anthony Boor became Blackbaud’s interim CEO in August 2013.[18][19] Boor joined Blackbaud as the company’s chief financial officer in 2011.[19] He was credited with leading Blackbaud’s acquisition of Convio.[19]
In November 2013, Michael Gianoni was named the new president and CEO for Blackbaud.[7]
Products[edit]
Blackbaud creates software that helps nonprofits with CRM, marketing campaigns, fundraising and analytics.[20] The company has three customer relationship management (CRM) offerings: The Raiser's Edge, Blackbaud CRM and Luminate CRM.[21] Blackbaud CRM is a web-based platform that is the company's lead offering for larger organizations that need to handle complex tasks.[21][22] Luminate is Blackbaud's offering for mid-tier organizations and is fully integrated with Salesforce.com.[21][22]
Philanthropy[edit]
Blackbaud has an extensive corporate citizenship and philanthropy program. Volunteer for Vacation is an employee initiative, where the company gives paid vacation to employees who participate in volunteer community service.[23][24] The company's Reward your Passion initiative allows employees to apply for company-funded grants that help a charity of their choice.[24][25] In 2013, the company expanded its grant program to include locations beyond its Charleston, South Carolina headquarters.[26] Later that year, Blackbaud launched Business Doing Good, a website that is focused on providing information for small and medium-sized businesses to create their own corporate philanthropy programs.[27] The company also hosts volunteer fairs and other community service events throughout the year.[25]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
