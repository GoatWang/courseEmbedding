Fred HassanAvon Products has confirmed that its non-executive chairman, Fred Hassan, has resigned from the board of directors, while announcing his replacement with immediate effect.
 


 
Doug Conant, who already serves on the boards of Avon as well as the AmericsourceBergen Corporation will replace Hassan with immediate effect, as Hassan departs after spending just four months in the position.Conant served as CEO at Campbell Soup Company for more than 10 years, until 2011, and before that had risen to the position of president at Nabisco Food Company, while also leading his own executive leadership consultancy ConantLeadership.Hassan step down due to work load“My other professional commitments have intensified, requiring more focus. So I have decided it is in the best interest of Avon for one of my Board colleagues to take on the Chairmanship," Hassan said.He had been bought into support Avon CEO Sheri McCoy as she eased into her new role, having replaced outgoing CEO Andrea Jung at the beginning of last year.However, Hassan’s other executive commitments include serving as a non-executive chariman of Bausch + Lomb, managing director and partner at Warburg Pincus, as well as serving on the board of Time Warner.Conant takes on big challengesConant is now expected to continue to play a significant role in Avon’s turnaround plans, as the company continues to struggle in the face of falling sales, an on-going international bribery investigation and a restructuring program that will see it pull out of a number of smaller markets, including Ireland.  


Avon also announced the appointment of its existing chief financial officer, Kimberly Ross, to the board of directors, a position she will take up from May 2nd.The company said this appointment was necessary in order to maintain the minimum number of directors on the board, while confirming that Ross would step down once a new independent director has been recruited and appointed.

He was named vice president of information management for Duke Energy North America in January 2003, and named vice president of information technology for Duke Power in November 2003. Wyatt was named to his current position in the Franchised Electric and Gas – Operations organization in April 2006. The Winston-Salem, N.C., native earned a bachelor of science degree in computer science from North Carolina State University. 
Patrick Ye, Duke University 2010, Biomedical Engineering
Patrick Ye, a native of Westmont, Illinois, is a senior majoring in biomedical engineering. He is a member of the Tau Beta Pi engineering honors society. His research interest focuses on Parkinson’s disease and whether a linear relationship exists between the amount of hand tremor in patients and the interpulse intervals of the deep brain stimulation trains used for treatment. Should a relationship be found, an optimal stimulation strategy could be determined and used to maximize therapy. Currently, Patrick is creating a genetic algorithm to selectively stimulate the pudendal nerve to better restore urinary function. He was also the leader of a recent Engineers Without Borders project to design and built a much-needed bridge in rural Bolivia.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
