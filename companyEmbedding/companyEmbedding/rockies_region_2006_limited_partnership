	ROCKIES REGION 2006 LIMITED PARTNERSHIP






	NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	March 31, 2012




	(unaudited)













	Note 1−


	General and Basis of Presentation









	Rockies Region 2006 Limited Partnership (the “Partnership” or the “Registrant”) was organized in 2006 as a limited partnership, in accordance with the laws of the State of West Virginia, for the purpose of engaging in the exploration and development of natural gas and crude oil properties. Business operations commenced upon closing of an offering for the private placement of Partnership units. Upon funding, the Partnership entered into a Drilling and Operating Agreement (“D&O Agreement”) with the Managing General Partner which authorizes Petroleum Development Corporation (“PDC”), which conducts business under the name PDC Energy, to conduct and manage the Partnership's business. In accordance with the terms of the Limited Partnership Agreement (the “Agreement”), the Managing General Partner is authorized to manage all activities of the Partnership and initiates and completes substantially all Partnership transactions.









	As of


	March 31, 2012


	, there were


	2,017


	 limited partners in the Partnership (“Investor Partners”). PDC is the designated Managing General Partner of the Partnership and owns a 37% Managing General Partner ownership in the Partnership. According to the terms of the Agreement, revenues, costs and cash distributions of the Partnership are allocated 63% to the Investor Partners, which are shared pro rata, based upon the number of units in the Partnership, and 37% to the Managing General Partner. The Managing General Partner may repurchase Investor Partner units under certain circumstances provided by the Agreement, upon request of an individual Investor Partner. Through


	March 31, 2012


	, the Managing General Partner has repurchased 30.5 units of Partnership interests from the Investor Partners at an average price of $6,812 per unit. As of


	March 31, 2012


	, the Managing General Partner owns 37.43% of the Partnership.









	In the Managing General Partner's opinion, the accompanying interim unaudited condensed financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair statement of the Partnership's financial statements for interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Accordingly, pursuant to such rules and regulations, certain notes and other financial information included in the audited financial statements have been condensed or omitted. The information presented in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Partnership's audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Partnership's


	2011


	 Form 10-K. The Partnership's accounting policies are described in the


	Notes to Financial Statements


	 in the Partnership's


	2011


	 Form 10-K and updated, as necessary, in this Form 10-Q. The results of operations for the


	three months ended March 31, 2012


	, and the cash flows for the same period, is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any other future period.









	Certain reclassifications have been made to correct the prior period disclosures to conform to the current year presentation, specifically related to the fair value level classification of certain derivative instruments. The reclassification had no impact on the Partnership's previously reported financial position, cash flows, net income or partners' equity. See Note 4,


	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures


	, for additional information regarding the fair value classification of the Partnership's derivative instruments.











	Note 2−


	Recent Accounting Standards









	Recently Adopted Accounting Standards









	Fair Value Measurement









	On May 12, 2011, the FASB issued changes related to fair value measurement. The changes represent the converged guidance of the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") (collectively the "Boards") on fair value measurement. Many of the changes eliminate unnecessary wording differences between International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") and U.S. GAAP. The changes expand existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements categorized in Level 3 by requiring (1) a quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions used in the measurement, (2) a description of the valuation processes in place and (3) a narrative description of the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and the interrelationships between those inputs. In addition, the changes also require the categorization by level in the fair value hierarchy of items that are not measured at fair value in the statement of financial position whose fair value must be disclosed. These changes are to be applied prospectively and are effective for public entities during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of these changes did not have a significant impact on the Partnership's financial statements.

	Transactions with Managing General Partner









	The Managing General Partner transacts business on behalf of the Partnership under the authority of the D&O Agreement. Revenues and other cash inflows received by the Managing General Partner on behalf of the Partnership are distributed to the Partners net of (after deducting) corresponding operating costs and other cash outflows incurred on behalf of the Partnership. The fair value of the Partnership's portion of open derivative instruments is recorded on the condensed balance sheets under the captions “Due from Managing General Partner-derivatives,” in the case of net unrealized gains and “Due to Managing General Partner-derivatives,” in the case of net unrealized losses.









	The following table presents transactions with the Managing General Partner reflected in the condensed balance sheet line item - “Due from (to) Managing General Partner-other, net,” which remain undistributed or unsettled with the Partnership's investors as of the dates indicated.

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures









	Derivative Financial Instruments




	Determination of fair value.


	The Partnership's fair value measurements are estimated pursuant to a fair value hierarchy that requires the Partnership to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date, giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable data (Level 3). In some cases, the inputs used to measure fair value might fall in different levels of the fair value hierarchy. The lowest level input that is significant to a fair value measurement in its entirety determines the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy. Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability, and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are defined as:




	Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.









	Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability, including (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, (ii) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, (iii) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and (iv) inputs that are derived from observable market data by correlation or other means. Includes the Partnership's fixed-price swaps and basis swaps.









	Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, including situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. Includes the Partnership's natural gas collars.









	Derivative Financial Instruments.


	  The Managing General Partner measures the fair value of the Partnership's derivative instruments based on a pricing model that utilizes market-based inputs, including but not limited to the contractual price of the underlying position, current market prices, natural gas and crude oil forward curves, discount rates such as the LIBOR curve for a similar duration of each outstanding position, volatility factors and nonperformance risk. Nonperformance risk considers the effect of the Managing General Partner's credit standing on the fair value of derivative liabilities and the effect of the Managing General Partner's counterparties' credit standings on the fair value of derivative assets. Both inputs to the model are based on published credit default swap rates and the duration of each outstanding derivative position.









	The Managing General Partner validates its fair value measurement through (1) the review of counterparty statements and other supporting documentation, (2) the determination that the source of the inputs are valid, (3) the corroboration of the original source of inputs through access to multiple quotes, if available, or other information and (4) monitoring changes in valuation methods and assumptions. While the Managing General Partner uses common industry practices to develop its valuation techniques, changes in the Managing General Partner's pricing methodologies or the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different fair values. While the Managing General Partner believes its valuation method is appropriate and consistent with those used by other market participants, the use of a different methodology, or assumptions, to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value.









	The Managing General Partner has evaluated the credit risk of the counterparties holding the derivative assets, which are primarily financial institutions who are also major lenders in the Managing General Partner's corporate credit facility agreement, giving consideration to amounts outstanding for each counterparty and the duration of each outstanding derivative position. Based on the Managing General Partner's evaluation, the Managing General Partner has determined that the impact of the risk of nonperformance of the Managing General Partner's counterparties on the fair value of the Partnership's derivative instruments is insignificant.

	(1) The Partnership reclassified its CIG-based basis swaps and crude oil fixed-price swaps from Level 3 to Level 2 (decreasing the previously reported net liability at the beginning of the period by $3.8 million). The amounts presented reflect these reclassifications and conform to current period presentation.









	The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Partnership's derivative contracts is the implied volatility curve, and is provided by a third party vendor. A significant increase or decrease in the implied volatility, in isolation, would have a directionally similar effect resulting in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement of the Partnership's Level 3 derivative contracts.

	Derivative Counterparties.


	 The Managing General Partner makes use of over-the-counter derivative instruments that enable the Partnership to manage a portion of its exposure to price volatility from producing natural gas and crude oil. These arrangements expose the Partnership to the credit risk of nonperformance by the counterparties. The Managing General Partner primarily uses financial institutions, who are also major lenders in the Managing General Partner's credit facility agreement, as counterparties to its derivative contracts. To date, the Managing General Partner has had no counterparty default losses. The Managing General Partner has evaluated the credit risk of the Partnership's derivative assets from counterparties using relevant credit market default rates, giving consideration to amounts outstanding for each counterparty and the duration of each outstanding derivative position. Based on this evaluation, the Managing General Partner has determined that the impact of the risk of nonperformance of the counterparties on the fair value of the Partnership's derivative instruments was not significant.

	Environmental









	Due to the nature of the oil and gas industry, the Partnership is exposed to environmental risks. The Managing General Partner has various policies and procedures in place to prevent environmental contamination and mitigate the risks from environmental contamination. The Managing General Partner conducts periodic reviews to identify changes in the Partnership's environmental risk profile. Liabilities are accrued when environmental remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. During the three months ended


	March 31, 2012


	, the Managing General Partner identified for the Partnership additional environmental remediation efforts of approximately $32,000 necessary to complete existing projects. As of


	March 31, 2012


	, the Partnership had accrued environmental remediation liabilities for two of the Partnership's well pads involving eight wells in the amount of approximately $55,000, which is included in line item captioned “Accounts payable and accrued expenses” on the condensed balance sheet. As of


	December 31, 2011


	, the Partnership had accrued total environmental remediation liabilities for two of the Partnership's Piceance Basin well pads involving eight wells in the amount of approximately $23,000. The Managing General Partner is not currently aware of any environmental claims existing as of


	March 31, 2012


	, which have not been provided for or would otherwise have a material impact on the Partnership's condensed financial statements. However, there can be no assurance that current regulatory requirements will not change or unknown past non-compliance with environmental laws will not be discovered on the Partnership's properties.

	Divestitures and Discontinued Operations









	During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Managing General Partner developed a plan to divest the Partnership's North Dakota assets. The plan included 100% of the Partnership's North Dakota assets, consisting of producing wells and related facilities. The plan received the Managing General Partner's Board of Directors' approval and, in December 2010, the Managing General Partner effected a letter of intent with an unrelated third party. In February 2011, the Managing General Partner executed a purchase and sale agreement and subsequently closed with the same unrelated party. The Partnership received approximately $5.7 million for these assets resulting in a gain on sale of $3.5 million. Following the sale to the unrelated party, the Partnership does not have significant continuing involvement in the operations of or cash flows from these assets; accordingly, the results of operations related to the North Dakota assets have been reported as discontinued operations in the condensed statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2011.




	The table below presents statement of operations data related to the Partnership's discontinued operations of the Partnership's North Dakota assets. While the reclassification of revenues and expenses related to discontinued operations for the prior periods had no impact upon previously reported net earnings, the statement of operations data present the revenues and expenses that were reclassified from the specified statement of operations line items to discontinued operations. There was no activity recorded for discontinued operations for the three months ended

	ROCKIES REGION 2006 LIMITED PARTNERSHIP




	NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	March 31, 2012




	(unaudited)





















	Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations











	Partnership Overview









	Rockies Region 2006 Limited Partnership engages in the development, production and sale of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil. The Partnership began natural gas and crude oil operations in September 2006 and operates 86 gross (85.2 net) productive wells located in the Rocky Mountain Region in the state of Colorado. The Partnership drilled four additional wells determined to be dry holes; one developmental dry hole and three exploratory dry holes in the Wattenberg Field in Colorado. The Partnership drilled five (4.5 net) producing wells in North Dakota and two exploratory dry holes in North Dakota. In February 2011, the Partnership sold the Partnership's North Dakota assets. The Managing General Partner markets the Partnership's natural gas and crude oil production to commercial end users, interstate or intrastate pipelines, local utilities and petroleum refiners or marketers, primarily under market sensitive contracts in which the price of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil sold varies as a result of market forces. PDC does not charge a separate fee for the marketing of the natural gas, NGLs and crude oil because these services are covered by the monthly well operating charge. PDC, on behalf of the Partnership in accordance with the D&O Agreement, is authorized to enter into multi-year fixed price contracts or utilize derivatives, including collars, swaps or basis protection swaps, in order to offset some or all of the commodity price variability for particular periods of time. Seasonal factors, such as effects of weather on prices received and costs incurred, and availability of pipeline capacity, owned by PDC or other third parties, may impact the Partnership's results. In addition, both sales volumes and prices tend to be affected by demand factors with a seasonal component.









	Recent Developments









	PDC Sponsored Drilling Program Acquisition Plan









	PDC, the managing general partner of various public limited partnerships, has disclosed its intention to pursue, beginning in the fall of 2010 and extending through 2013, the acquisition of the limited partnership units, other than those held by PDC or its affiliates, held by limited partners (“non-affiliated investor partners”), in certain limited partnerships that PDC had previously sponsored, including this Partnership (the “Acquisition Plan”). For additional information regarding the Acquisition Plan, refer to prior disclosure included in PDC's filings made with the SEC and presentations on PDC's website. However, such information shall not, by reason of this reference, be deemed to be incorporated by reference in, or otherwise be deemed to be part of, this report. Under the Acquisition Plan, any existing or future merger offer will be subject to the terms and conditions of the related merger agreement, and such agreement will likely contemplate the partnership being merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of PDC. Each such merger will also be subject to, among other things, PDC having sufficient available capital, the economics of the merger and the approval by a majority of the limited partnership units held by the non-affiliated investor partners of such limited partnership. Consummation of any proposed merger of a limited partnership under the Acquisition Plan will result in the termination of the existence of that partnership and each non-affiliated investor partner will receive the right to receive a cash payment for their limited partnership units in that partnership and will no longer participate in that partnership's future earnings or the Partnership's economic benefit.









	During 2010 and 2011, PDC purchased twelve partnerships for an aggregate amount of $107.7 million. The feasibility and timing of any future cash purchase offer by PDC to any additional partnership, including this Partnership, depends on that partnership's suitability in meeting a set of criteria that includes, but is not limited to, the following: age and productive-life stage characteristics of the partnership's well inventory; favorability of economics for additional development in the Wattenberg Field, including commodity prices; and SEC reporting compliance status and timing and ability to achieve all necessary SEC approvals required to commence a merger and repurchase offer. On December 21, 2011, PDC and its wholly-owned merger subsidiary were served with an alleged class action on behalf of certain former partnership unit holders, related to eleven partnership repurchases completed by mergers in 2010 and 2011.  The action was filed in United States ("U.S.") District Court for the Central District of California, and is titled


	Schulein v. Petroleum Development Corp


	.  The complaint alleges a claim that the proxy statements issued in connection with the mergers were inadequate, and a state law breach of fiduciary duty claim.  On February 10, 2012, PDC filed a motion to dismiss or in the alternative to stay. The motion was argued on April 2, 2012. The Court has not filed a ruling at this time. The case is set for a scheduling conference on June 11, 2012.  The Managing General Partner believes the suit is without merit and intends to defend it vigorously. There is no assurance that any potential proposed repurchase offer to any other of PDC's various public limited partnerships, including this Partnership, will occur.

	Additional Development Plan









	The Managing General Partner has begun executing its plan for the Partnership's Wattenberg Field wells which may provide for additional reserve development of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil production (the “Additional Development Plan”). The Additional Development Plan consists of the Partnership's refracturing of wells currently producing in the Codell formation and/or recompletion in the Niobrara or Codell formation which is currently not producing. Refracturing activities consist of a second hydraulic fracturing treatment in a current production zone, while recompletion activities consist of an initial hydraulic fracturing treatment in a new production zone, all within an existing well bore. Historically, refracturing and recompletion activities have resulted in an increase in both liquids and natural gas production.









	Additional development of Wattenberg Field wells, which may provide for additional reserve development and production, generally occurs five to ten years after initial well drilling so that well resources are optimally utilized. This additional development would be expected to occur based on a favorable general economic environment and commodity price structure. The Managing General Partner has the authority to determine whether to refracture or recomplete the individual wells and to determine the timing of any additional development activity. The timing of the refracturing or recompletion can be affected by the desire to optimize the economic return by additional development of the wells when commodity prices are at levels that are believed to provide the highest rate of return to the Partnership. On average, the production resulting from PDC's refracturings or recompletions have increased production; however, not all refracturings or recompletions have been economically successful and similar future refracturing or recompletion activities may not be economically successful. If the additional development work is performed, the Partnership will bear the direct costs of refracturing or recompletion, and the Investor Partners and the Managing General Partner will each pay their proportionate share of costs based on the ownership sharing ratios of the Partnership from funds retained by the Managing General Partner from cash available for distributions. The Managing General Partner considers the cash available for distributions to be the Partnership's net cash flows provided by operating activities less any net cash used in capital activities.




	The Limited Partnership Agreement (the “Agreement”) permits the Partnership to borrow funds or receive advances from the Managing General Partner, its affiliates or unaffiliated persons, for Partnership activities. At this time, the Managing General Partner does not anticipate electing to fund the initial Additional Development Plan's well refracturings or recompletions, nor any subsequent refracturings or recompletions, through bank borrowing. In the event that the Partnership's refracturing or recompletion activities are funded in part through borrowing, potential cash available for distributions derived from production increases provided by this additional development of the Partnership's Wattenberg Field wells may not be sufficient to repay the Partnership's borrowing financial obligations, which will include principal and interest. Borrowings, if any, will be non-recourse to the Investor Partners; accordingly, the Partnership, not the Investor Partners, will be responsible for loan repayment. However, any bank borrowings may be collateralized by the Partnership's assets and may restrict distributions as long as there is a balance due on any loan.




	During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Managing General Partner began a program for its affiliated partnerships to begin accumulating cash from cash flows from operating activities to pay for future refracturing or recompletion costs. This program will materially reduce, up to 100%, cash available for distributions of the partnerships for a period of time not to exceed five years.




	Current estimated costs for these well refracturings or recompletions are between $180,000 and $260,000 per activity. As of


	March 31, 2012


	, this Partnership had scheduled to complete 116 additional development opportunities. Total withholding for these activities from the Partnership's cash available for distributions is estimated to be between $21.4 million and $23.8 million if all the activities are performed. The Managing General Partner will continually evaluate the timing of the additional development activities based on engineering data and a favorable commodity price environment in order to maximize the expected financial benefit of the additional well development. During the three months ended March 31, 2012, $225,000 of the $1,600,000 fund previously withheld from the Partnership's cash distributions pursuant to the Additional Development Plan were used to reimburse the Managing General Partner for the cost of initiating both recompletions and refracturings on two of the Partnership's wells.




	Both the number and timing of the additional development activities will be based on the availability of cash withheld from Partnership distributions. The Managing General Partner believes that, based on projected refracturing and recompletion costs and projected cash withholding, all scheduled Partnership additional development activity will be completed within a five year period. Any funds not used for refracturing, recompletion or other operational needs will be distributed to the Managing General Partner and Investor Partners based on their proportional ownership interest.

	Implementation of the Additional Development Plan has and will continue to reduce or eliminate Partnership distributions to the Managing General Partner and Investor Partners while the work is being conducted and paid for through the Partnership's funds. Depending upon the level of withholding and the results of operations, it is possible that the Managing General Partner and Investor Partners could have taxable income from the Partnership without any corresponding distributions in future years.


	Non-affiliated




	investor partners are urged to consult a tax advisor to determine all of the relevant federal, state and local tax consequences of the Additional Development Plan. The above discussion is not intended as a substitute for careful tax planning, and non-affiliated investor partners should depend upon the advice of their own tax advisors concerning the effects of the Additional Development Plan.









	Current Low Natural Gas Price Environment









	The natural gas market continues to be characterized by depressed prices. While the Partnership has derivative instruments in place for a majority of its expected natural gas production, sustained low natural gas prices would result in higher realized derivative gains upon settlement but also could have a material adverse effect as a result of lower natural gas sales, a reduction in the estimated quantity of proved reserves and the estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated from these reserves.









	Potential for Future Asset Impairments









	A further decrease in forward natural gas prices during 2012 could also result in significant impairment charges. The Partnership's Piceance Basin properties have significant natural gas reserves, representing 62% of the total proved natural gas reserves and 39% of the Partnership's total proved reserves at December 31, 2011, and are sensitive to declines in natural gas prices. These assets, which had a net book value of approximately $8.6 million at March 31, 2012, are at risk of impairment if future natural gas prices for the Partnership's Piceance production experience further long-term decline. The cash flow model the Partnership uses to assess properties for impairment includes numerous assumptions, such as the Managing General Partner's estimates of future oil and gas production and commodity prices, market outlook on forward commodity prices, operating and development costs. All inputs to the cash flow model must be evaluated at each date that the estimate of future cash flows for each producing basin is calculated. However, a significant decrease in long-term forward natural gas prices alone could result in a significant impairment of the Partnership's properties that are sensitive to declines in natural gas prices.




	 




	Partnership Operating Results Overview









	Natural gas, NGLs and crude oil sales decreased 42%, or $0.8 million, for the first


	three


	 months of 2012 compared to the first


	three


	 months of 2011, while sales volumes declined 26% period-to-period. The average sales price per Mcfe, excluding the impact of realized derivative gains, was $4.25 for the current year period compared to $5.44 for the same period a year ago. Realized derivative gains from natural gas sales contributed an additional $1.97 per Mcfe, or $0.5 million, to the total revenues for the first


	three


	 months of 2012 compared to an additional $0.26, or $0.1 million, from natural gas and crude oil sales for the first


	three


	 months of 2011. Comparatively, the total per Mcfe price realized, consisting of the average sales price and realized derivative gains, increased to $6.22 for the current year


	three


	 months from $5.70 for the same prior year period.









	In February 2011, the Partnership's North Dakota assets were sold for total proceeds to the Partnership of $5.7 million resulting in a gain of $3.5 million. The operating results of the North Dakota assets for the three month period ended


	March 31, 2011


	, are classified as discontinued operations. There was no activity recorded for discontinued operations for the three months ended


	March 31, 2012


	.

	Natural Gas, NGLs and Crude Oil Sales









	Natural Gas, NGLs and Crude Oil Pricing.


	 The Partnership's results of operations depend upon many factors, particularly the price of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil and the Managing General Partner's ability to market the Partnership's production effectively. Natural gas, NGLs and crude oil prices are among the most volatile of all commodity prices. These price variations have a material impact on the Partnership's financial results and capital expenditures. The Partnership has experienced a decline in the price of NGLs, mainly at Conway hub in Kansas where the Partnership's Wattenberg production is priced, primarily due to increased ethane volumes and the limited market for ethane. Natural gas and NGL prices vary by region and locality, depending upon the distance to markets, the availability of pipeline capacity and the supply and demand relationships in that region or locality. The combination of increased drilling activity and the lack of local markets has resulted in local market oversupply situations from time to time. Like most producers, the Partnership relies on major interstate pipeline companies to construct these pipelines to increase capacity, rendering the timing and availability of these facilities beyond the Partnership's control. Crude oil pricing is predominately driven by the physical market, supply and demand, the financial markets and national and international politics.









	The price the Partnership receives for its natural gas produced in the Rocky Mountain Region is based on a market basket of prices, which generally includes natural gas sold at, near or below CIG prices as well as other nearby region prices. The CIG Index, and other indices for production delivered to other Rocky Mountain pipelines, has historically been less than the price received for natural gas produced in the eastern regions, which is primarily New York Mercantile Exchange, or NYMEX, based. This negative differential has narrowed over the last few years. The negative differential between NYMEX and CIG averaged $0.12 and $0.28 for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.









	Three months ended March 31,

	For the


	three months ended March 31, 2012


	 compared to the same period in 2011, natural gas, NGLs and crude oil sales volumes, on an energy equivalency-basis, decreased 26%. Excluding the natural gas sales settlement identified in footnotes 2 and 4 of the Summary Operating Results table, natural gas, NGLs and crude oil production, on an energy equivalency-basis, decreased 23% due to normal production declines for this stage in the wells’ production life cycle.

	Natural gas, NGLs and crude oil sales decreased by 61%, 43% and 22%, respectively. The Partnership's natural gas sales decrease resulted from decreased commodity prices per Mcf of 47%, and lower Partnership natural gas production volumes of 26%, including the settlement identified in footnotes 2 and 4 of the


	Summary Operating Results


	 table. The decrease in NGLs sales was due to a decrease of 17% in NGLs production volumes and to a decrease in the average commodity price per Bbl of 30%. The crude oil sales decrease was due primarily to sales volume decreases of 30%, partially offset by an increase in the average commodity price per Bbl of 10% during the current


	three


	 month period.











	Commodity Price Risk Management, Net









	The Partnership uses various derivative instruments to manage fluctuations in natural gas prices. The Partnership has in place a variety of collars, fixed-price swaps and basis swaps on a portion of the Partnership's estimated natural gas production. The Partnership sells its natural gas at similar prices to the indices inherent in the Partnership's derivative instruments. As a result, for the volumes underlying the Partnership's derivative positions, the Partnership ultimately realizes a price related to its collars of no less than the floor and no more than the ceiling and, for the Partnership's commodity swaps, the Partnership ultimately realizes the fixed price related to its swaps.









	Commodity price risk management, net, includes realized gains and losses and unrealized mark-to-market changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments related to the Partnership's natural gas and crude oil production. See Note 4,

	March 31,


	 2011









	Realized gains of $0.5 million recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2012, were primarily the result of lower natural gas spot prices at settlement compared to the respective strike price of the Partnership's natural gas derivative positions. For the three months ended March 31, 2012, realized gains on natural gas, exclusive of basis swaps, were $0.9 million. These gains were offset in part by realized losses of $0.4 million on the Partnership's basis swap positions as the negative basis differential between NYMEX and CIG weighted average price was narrower than the strike price of the Partnership's basis swaps.









	Unrealized gains of $0.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012, were primarily related to the downward shift in the natural gas forward curve and its impact on the fair value of the Partnership's open positions, offset in part by the narrowing of the CIG basis forward curve. For the period ended March 31, 2012, unrealized gains on the Partnership's natural gas positions were $0.9 million, offset slightly by unrealized losses on the Partnership's CIG basis swaps.

	 Realized gains recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2011 were primarily the result of lower natural gas spot prices at settlement compared to the respective strike price of the Partnership’s natural gas derivative positions. Realized gains on natural gas settlements were $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011. These gains were offset in part by a $0.2 million loss on the Partnership’s CIG basis protection swaps as the negative basis differential between NYMEX and CIG was narrower than the strike price of the basis positions. The Partnership also realized a $0.1 million loss on its crude oil positions due to higher spot prices at settlement compared to the respective strike price.









	Unrealized losses during the three months ended March 31, 2011 were primarily related to the shifts in the forward curves and their impact on the fair value of the Partnership’s open positions. The significant shift upward in the crude oil curve resulted in an unrealized loss of $0.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2011. Likewise, the shifts upward in the natural gas and basis curves resulted in a total unrealized loss of $0.1 million.

	Natural Gas, NGLs and Crude Oil Production Costs









	Generally, natural gas, NGLs and crude oil production costs vary with changes in total natural gas, NGLs and crude oil sales and production volumes. Production taxes are estimates by the Managing General Partner based on tax rates determined using published information. These estimates are subject to revision based on actual amounts determined during future filings by the Managing General Partner with the taxing authorities. Production taxes vary directly with total natural gas, NGLs and crude oil sales. Transportation costs vary directly with production volumes. Fixed monthly well operating costs increase on a per unit basis as production decreases per the historical decline curve. In addition, general oil field services and all other costs vary and can fluctuate based on services required but are expected to increase as wells age and require more extensive repair and maintenance. These costs include water hauling and disposal, equipment repairs and maintenance, snow removal, environmental compliance and remediation, and service rig workovers.









	Three months ended March 31, 2012 as compared to three months ended March 31, 2011









	Production and operating costs for the three month period ended March 31, 2012 decreased by approximately $43,000 compared to the same period in 2011. Lease operating costs were unchanged between the periods as workovers, tubing repairs and non-recurring environmental remediation activities collectively were essentially the same. Revenue and volume-based costs were lower by approximately $27,000 in 2012 consistent with sales and production declines from 2011. Production and operating costs per Mcfe increased to $2.27 during 2012 from $1.79 in 2011 due to lower volumes partially offset by the decrease in costs.

	Production declines, noted in previous sections, contributed to the decreased DD&A expense of approximately $99,000 for the 2012 three month period compared to the same period in 2011. The DD&A expense rate per Mcfe increased to $2.77 for the 2012 three month period compared to $2.32 during the same period in 2011. The increase in the per Mcfe rates for the 2012 period is due to the effect of the net




	downward revision in the Partnership’s proved developed producing reserves as of December 31, 2011, partially offset by the settlement identified above in the Summary Operating Results table that increased DD&A expense by $16,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2011.




	 




	Discontinued Operations









	In December 2010, the Managing General Partner effected a letter of intent with an unrelated third party, which provided for the sale of 100% of the Partnership's North Dakota assets. In February 2011, the Managing General Partner closed with the same unrelated third party. Proceeds from the sale were $5.7 million resulting in a gain of $3.5 million. The Partnership had $0.2 million in revenues and $0.1 million in income from the North Dakota assets during the three months ended March 31, 2011. See Note 8,


	Divestiture and Discontinued Operations


	, to the Partnership's financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding the divestiture of the Partnership's North Dakota assets.











	Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources









	The Partnership's primary sources of cash for the


	three months ended March 31, 2012


	, were from funds provided by operating activities which include the sale of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil production and the net realized gains from the Partnership's derivative positions. In addition, during the three months ended March 31, 2011, the Partnership received $5.7 million in proceeds from the divestiture of the Partnership's North Dakota assets. These sources of cash were primarily used to fund the Partnership's operating costs, general and administrative activities and provided monthly distributions to the Investor Partners and PDC, the Managing General Partner. During the quarter ended


	March 31,


	 2012, $225,000 of the withheld funds were paid to the Managing General Partner to cover the cost of initiating both recompletions and refracturing of two of the Partnership's wells. For additional information, see Item 2,


	Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Recent Developments-Additional Development Plan


	.









	Fluctuations in the Partnership's operating cash flows are substantially driven by changes in commodity prices, in production volumes and in realized gains and losses from commodity positions. Commodity prices have historically been volatile and the Managing General Partner attempts to manage this volatility through derivatives. Therefore, the primary source of the Partnership's cash flow from operations becomes the net activity between the Partnership's natural gas, NGLs and crude oil sales and realized natural gas and crude oil derivative gains and losses. However, the Partnership does not engage in speculative positions, nor does the Partnership hold derivative instruments for 100% of the Partnership's expected future production from producing wells and therefore may still experience significant fluctuations in cash flows from operations. As of


	March 31,


	 2012, the Partnership had natural gas derivative positions in place covering all of the expected natural gas production for the remainder of 2012, at an average price of $5.05 per Mcf. However, the Partnership has no NGL or crude oil derivatives. See


	Results of Operations


	 for further discussion of the impact of prices and volumes on sales from operations and the impact of derivative activities on the Partnership's revenues.









	The Partnership's future operations are expected to be conducted with available funds and revenues generated from natural gas, NGLs and crude oil production activities and commodity derivatives. Natural gas, NGLs and crude oil production from the Partnership's existing properties are generally expected to continue a gradual decline in the rate of production over the remaining life of the wells. Therefore, the Partnership anticipates a lower annual level of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil production and, in the absence of significant price increases or additional reserve development, lower revenues. The Partnership also expects cash flows from operations to decline if commodity prices remain at current levels or decrease in the future. Under these circumstances decreased production would have a material negative impact on the Partnership's operations and may result in reduced cash distributions to the Managing General Partner and Investor Partners through the remainder of


	2012


	 and beyond, and may substantially reduce or restrict the Partnership's ability to participate in the additional development activities which are more fully described in Item 2,


	Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Recent Developments−Additional Development Plan


	.

	Although the Agreement permits the Partnership to borrow funds on its behalf for Partnership activities, the Managing General Partner does not anticipate electing to fund through bank borrowings any portion of the Partnership's refracturing and recompletion activities. These refracturings and recompletions are began in 2012. Partnership borrowings, should any occur, will be non-recourse to the Investor Partners; accordingly, the Partnership, not the Investor Partners, will be responsible for repaying the loan.











	Working Capital









	The Partnership had working capital of $4.2 million at


	March 31, 2012


	, compared to working capital of $3.9 million at December 31, 2011, an increase of $0.3 million. The increase was primarily due to the following changes:


















	•






	Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $0.2 million between


	March 31, 2012


	, and December 31, 2011.
















	•






	Accounts receivable decreased by $0.1 million between


	March 31, 2012


	, and December 31, 2011.
















	•






	Realized and unrealized derivative gains receivable increased by $0.7 million between


	March 31, 2012


	, and December 31, 2011.
















	•






	Due to Managing General Partner-other, net, excluding natural gas, NGLs and crude oil sales received from third parties and realized derivative gains, increased by $0.1 million between


	March 31, 2012


	, and December 31, 2011.













	Working capital is expected to increase due to the Partnership’s anticipated withholding of cash from the Managing General Partner and Investor Partners, on a pro-rata basis, for the initial refracturing activities. The balance of the withholdings, which began in the fourth quarter of 2010, is $1,495,000 as of March 31, 2012. Cash decreased as the funds were utilized in payment of development activities during 2012. Funding for the Additional Development Plan will be provided by the withholding of distributable cash flows from the Managing General Partner and Investor Partners on a percentage of Partnership ownership pro-rata basis. Working capital is expected to similarly fluctuate by increasing during periods of Additional Development Plan funding and by decreasing during periods when payments are made for refracturing or recompletion activities.









	Cash Flows









	Cash Flows from Operating Activities









	The Partnership's cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily impacted by commodity prices, production volumes, realized gains and losses from its derivative positions, operating costs and general and administrative expenses. See


	Results of Operations


	 above for an additional discussion of the key drivers of cash flows provided by operating activities.









	The price the Partnership receives on its natural gas sales is impacted by the Managing General Partner's transportation, gathering and processing agreements. The Partnership currently uses the "net-back" method of accounting for these arrangements related to the Partnership's natural gas sales. The Partnership sells natural gas at the wellhead and collects a price and recognizes revenues based on the wellhead sales price since transportation costs downstream of the wellhead are incurred by the purchaser and reflected in the wellhead price. The net-back method results in the recognition of a sales price that is below the indices for which the production is based.









	Net cash provided by operating activities was $0.9 million for the


	three months ended March 31, 2012


	, compared to $1.9 million for the comparable period in


	2011


	. The decrease of $1.0 million in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to the following:


















	•






	A decrease in natural gas, NGLs and crude oil sales receipts of $1.4 million, or 53%, and





















	•






	A decrease in production costs and direct costs - general and administrative payments of $0.4 million.












	Cash Flows from Investing Activities









	The Partnership, from time-to-time, invests in equipment which supports treatment, delivery and measurement of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil or environmental protection. These amounts totaled $0.4 million and $0.1 million for the


	three months ended March 31, 2012


	 and


	2011


	, respectively. Substantially all of the 2012 investment is attributable to activities pursuant to the Additional Development Plan.

	In February 2011, the Managing General Partner executed a purchase and sale agreement for the Partnership's North Dakota assets and subsequently closed with the same unrelated third party. Proceeds from the sale were $5.7 million.











	Cash Flows from Financing Activities









	The Partnership initiated monthly cash distributions to investors in May 2007 and has distributed $80.2 million through


	March 31, 2012


	. The table below presents cash distributions to the Partnership's investors. Distributions to the Managing General Partner represent amounts distributed to PDC for the Managing General Partner's 37% general partner interest in the Partnership.

	The decrease in total distributions for 2012 as compared to 2011 is primarily due to the decrease in cash flows from operating activities during 2012, offset in part by funds held by the Managing General Partner for the Additional Development Plan in 2011. During the quarter ended March 31, 2012, on a pro-rata basis, based on percentage of ownership in the Partnership, the Managing General Partner retained $83,250 and $141,750 from the Managing General Partner and Investor Partners’ share of cash available for distributions, respectively, to reimburse the Managing General Partner for the cost of initiating both recompletions and refracturings on two of the Partnership's wells.

	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements









	As of


	March 31, 2012


	, the Partnership had no existing off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules, which have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Partnership's financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures









	As of


	March 31, 2012


	, PDC, as Managing General Partner on behalf of the Partnership, carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Managing General Partner's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Partnership's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). This evaluation considered the various processes carried out under the direction of the Managing General Partner's disclosure committee in an effort to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the SEC reports that the Partnership files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Partnership's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely discussion regarding required disclosure.









	Based on the results of this evaluation, the Managing General Partner's Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Partnership's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of


	March 31, 2012


	.

Explanatory
Note

 

The
purpose of this Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A (the
“Amendment”) is to amend Rockies Region 2006 Limited
Partnership’s (the “Partnership’s” or
“Registrant’s”) Part II, Item 9A(T), Controls
and Procedures to fully comply with Rule 308(T) of Regulation
S-K and to revise Part IV, Item 15, Exhibits−Exhibit
99.2 to comply with Item 1202(a)(8) of Regulation
S-K.  This report amends the Partnership’s
previously filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2009, filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, or SEC, on March 31, 2010 (the “Original Form
10-K”).  Petroleum Development Corporation
(“PDC”), which conducts business under the name PDC
Energy, is the Managing General Partner of the
Partnership.

 

The
reasons for this amendment are more fully described
below:

 




 



(1)



The
Partnership is revising the Original Form 10-K to include in this
Amendment Item 9A(T)(b), Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting, which includes the Managing
General Partner’s statement that the Partnership’s
internal control over financial reporting was effective at December
31, 2009. Additionally, related disclosures that identify the
framework used by the Managing General Partner to so evaluate the
effectiveness of the Partnership’s internal controls, have
been included in this Amendment.  This report was
inadvertently omitted from the Original Form 10-K.




 




 



(2)



The
Partnership is filing a revised reserve report of the
Partnership’s third-party petroleum engineering
firm.  The report of Ryder Scott Company, L.P.
(“Ryder Scott”) as of December 31, 2009 was included as
Exhibit 99.2 to the Original Form 10-K.  The original
report did not include the average price used in the annual
reserves calculation and included a statement limiting the use of
the report to Rockies Region 2006 Limited
Partnership.  The report of Ryder Scott included as the
Amendment’s Exhibit 99.2, now includes the average price used
in the annual reserve calculation and does not contain any language
limitation on the use of the report.




 




 



(3)



New
certifications on behalf of the Partnership by the Managing General
Partner’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
are being filed as exhibits to this Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A
under Part IV, Item 15, Exhibits .




 

There are
no other changes to the Original Form 10-K other than those
outlined above. This Amendment does not reflect events occurring
after the filing of the Original Form 10-K, nor does it modify or
update disclosures therein in any way other than as required to
reflect the amendment set forth in the following index and report
sections included in this Amendment.

Item
9A(T).    Controls and Procedures

 

The
Partnership has no direct management or officers.  The
management, officers and other employees that provide services on
behalf of the Partnership are employed by the Managing General
Partner.

 

2008
Material Weakness

 

As
discussed in the Management’s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting included in the Partnership’s
2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Partnership did not maintain
effective internal controls over financial reporting as of December
31, 2008, over transactions that are directly related to and
processed by the Partnership, in that the Partnership failed to
maintain sufficient documentation to adequately assess the
operating effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting.  More specifically, the Partnership’s
financial close and reporting narrative failed to adequately
describe the process, identify key controls and assess segregation
of duties.  This material weakness has been remediated as
of December 31, 2009.

 

(a)  
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

As of
December 31, 2009, PDC, as Managing General Partner on behalf of
the Partnership, carried out an evaluation, under the supervision
and with the participation of the Managing General Partner's
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of the Partnership's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e).  This
evaluation considered the various processes carried out under the
direction of the Managing General Partner’s Disclosure
Committee in an effort to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the Partnership in the SEC reports the Partnership
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the
SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Partnership’s management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

 

Based upon
the evaluation, the Managing General Partner’s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
Partnership’s disclosure controls and procedures were
effective as of December 31, 2009.

 

(b)  
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

 

Management
of PDC, the Managing General Partner of the Partnership, is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting.  Internal control over
financial reporting is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) as a process designed by, or under the supervision of,
the issuer’s principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by
the issuer’s board of directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and
includes those policies and procedures that:

 




 



(1)



Pertain to
the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the issuer;




 




 



(2)



Provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the issuer; and




 




 



(3)



Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the issuer’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements of the issuer.




 

 

- 2
-

  

 

 

Because of
its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 

Management
of the Managing General Partner has assessed the effectiveness of
the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2009, based upon the criteria established in
“Internal Control - Integrated Framework” issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.  Based on this evaluation, management of the
Managing General Partner concluded that the Partnership maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2009.

 

This 2009
Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report
of the Partnership’s independent registered public accounting
firm regarding internal control over financial reporting pursuant
to Item 308T(a)(4) of Regulation S-K.

 

 

(c)  
Remediation of Material Weakness in Internal
Control

 

PDC, the
Managing General Partner, with participation from the Audit
Committee of its Board of Directors, addressed the material
weakness disclosed in the Partnership’s 2008 Annual Report on
Form 10-K.  The Managing General Partner believes that
the effective implementation of changes in internal controls over
financial reporting outlined below remediated this known material
weakness as of December 31, 2009.

 

The
Partnership made the following changes in its internal control over
financial reporting of the Partnership (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)
during 2009.

 




 



●



In the
second quarter, the Partnership developed and implemented a plan to
improve controls over certain key financial statement spreadsheets
that support all significant balance sheet and income statement
accounts.  The Partnership also created and documented a
procedural framework to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the
Partnership’s derivative activities.  Additionally,
the Partnership has completed the development of a revised
financial close and reporting narrative that adequately describes
the process, identifies key controls and assesses segregation of
duties.




 




 



●



In the
third quarter, the Partnership developed documentation that
describes the business processes and identifies key controls for
internal control over financial reporting that assisted the
Managing General Partner in adequately assessing internal control
over financial reporting for the Partnership.  In
addition, the Partnership developed documentation and procedures to
adequately assess segregation of duties.  The controls
and procedures were tested prior to December 31,
2009.  At present, the Partnership has not quantified the
total cost of this initiative; however, the majority of this cost
is expected to be paid by the Managing General Partner.

(d)  
Other Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

 

During
2009, PDC made the following changes in PDC’s internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that have
materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect
the Partnership’s internal control over financial
reporting:

 




 



●



Effective
July 1, 2009, as part of PDC’s broader financial reporting
system, PDC implemented a new partnership investor distribution
accounting module replacing the existing accounting
software.  PDC has taken the necessary steps to monitor
and maintain appropriate internal controls during this period of
change.  These steps included procedures to preserve the
integrity of the data converted and a review by the business owners
to validate data converted.  Additionally, PDC provided
training related to the business process changes and the financial
reporting system software to individuals using the financial
reporting system to carry out their job responsibilities, as well
as those who rely on the financial information.  PDC
anticipates that the implementation of this module will strengthen
the overall systems of internal controls due to enhanced automation
and integration of related processes.  PDC is modifying
the design and documentation of internal control process and
procedures relating to the new module to supplement and complement
existing internal control over financial reporting.  The
system changes were undertaken to integrate systems and consolidate
information and were not undertaken in response to any actual or
perceived deficiencies in PDC’s internal control over
financial reporting.  Testing of the controls related to
these new systems was included in the scope of PDC’s
assessment of its internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2009.




 

The
Managing General Partner continues to evaluate the ongoing
effectiveness and sustainability of the changes PDC made in
internal control over financial reporting, and as a result of the
ongoing evaluation, may identify additional changes to improve
internal control over financial reporting.  Further
information regarding the material weakness of the Partnership
referenced above may be found in the Partnership’s Annual
Report on 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 under Item
9A(T), Controls and Procedures − Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regarding this
Partnership's business, financial condition and results of
operations. PDC Energy, Inc. (“PDC”) is the Managing
General Partner of this Partnership. All statements other than
statements of historical facts included in and incorporated by
reference into this report are “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions
of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words
such as expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, seeks,
estimates and similar expressions or variations of such words are
intended to identify forward-looking statements herein. These
statements may relate to, among other things: future production
(including the components of such production), sales, expenses,
cash flows, and liquidity; estimated crude oil, natural gas and
natural gas liquids ("NGLs") reserves; anticipated capital
expenditures and projects; availability of additional midstream
facilities and services, timing of that availability and related
benefits to this Partnership; the impact of high line pressures;
and the Managing General Partner's future strategies, plans and
objectives.

 

The above
statements are not the exclusive means of identifying
forward-looking statements herein. Although forward-looking
statements contained in this report reflect the Managing General
Partner's good faith judgment, such statements can only be based on
facts and factors currently known to the Managing General Partner.
Consequently, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to
risks and uncertainties, including known and unknown risks and
uncertainties incidental to the development, production and
marketing of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, and actual outcomes
may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in
the forward-looking statements .

 

Important
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited
to:

  




 



 





•



availability
of future cash flows to enable this Partnership to continue as a
going concern, for investor distributions or funding of development
activities;





 



 





•



changes in
worldwide production volumes and demand, including economic
conditions that might impact demand;





 



 





•



volatility
of commodity prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs and the
risk of an extended period of depressed prices;





 



 





•



the impact
of governmental policies and/or regulations, including changes in
environmental and other laws, the interpretation and enforcement
related to those laws and regulations, liabilities arising
thereunder and the costs to comply with those laws and
regulations;





 



 





•



declines in
the value of this Partnership's crude oil, natural gas and NGLs
properties resulting in further impairments;





 



 


 





•



changes in
estimates of proved reserves;


 





 



 


 





•



inaccuracy
of reserve estimates and expected production rates;


 






 



 


 





•



potential
for production decline rates from this Partnership's wells being
greater than expected;


 





 



 





•



timing and
extent of this Partnership's success in further developing and
producing this Partnership's reserves;





 



 


 





•



the
Managing General Partner's ability to secure supplies and services
at reasonable prices;


 





 



 





•



availability
of sufficient pipeline, gathering and other transportation
facilities and related infrastructure to process and transport this
Partnership's production, and the impact of these facilities and
regional capacity on the prices this Partnership receives for its
production;





 



 


 





•



timing and
receipt of necessary regulatory permits;


 





 



 


 





•



risks
incidental to the operation of crude oil and natural gas
wells;


 





 



 


 





•



future cash
flows, liquidity and financial condition;

within the oil and gas industry;


 






 



 





•

the Managing General Partner in marketing this Partnership's crude
oil, natural gas and NGLs;

to such events and the Managing General Partner's ability to insure
adequately against such events;





 



 


 





•

pending or future litigation;


 






 



 


 





•

relating to asset dispositions that may be unfavorable to this

filings with the SEC for further information on risks and
uncertainties that could affect this Partnership's business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Readers

statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. This
Partnership undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking

ROCKIES
REGION 2006 LIMITED PARTNERSHIP 

NOTES TO
UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

September
30, 2016

(unaudited)

 

 


Note 1 -
General and Basis of Presentation

 

Rockies
Region 2006 Limited Partnership (this “Partnership” or
the “Registrant”) was organized in 2006 as a limited
partnership, in accordance with the laws of the State of West
Virginia, for the purpose of engaging in the exploration and
development of crude oil and natural gas properties. Business
operations commenced upon closing of an offering for the private
placement of Partnership units. Upon funding, this Partnership
entered into a Drilling and Operating Agreement (“D&O
Agreement”) with the Managing General Partner which
authorizes PDC to conduct and manage this Partnership's business.
In accordance with the terms of the Limited Partnership Agreement
(the “Agreement”), the Managing General Partner is
authorized to manage all activities of this Partnership and
initiates and completes substantially all Partnership
transactions.

 

As of
September 30, 2016 , there were 1,974 limited partners
("Investor Partners") in this Partnership. PDC is the designated
Managing General Partner of this Partnership and owns a 37%
Managing General Partner ownership in this Partnership. According
to the terms of the Agreement, revenues, costs and cash
distributions of this Partnership are allocated 63% to the Investor
Partners, which are shared pro rata based upon the number of units
in this Partnership, and 37% to the Managing General Partner. The
Managing General Partner may repurchase Investor Partner units
under certain circumstances provided by the Agreement, upon request
of an individual Investor Partner. Through September 30, 2016
, the Managing General Partner had repurchased 164 units of
Partnership interest from the Investor Partners at an average price
of $2,351 per unit. As of September 30, 2016 , the Managing
General Partner owned 39% of this Partnership, including the
repurchased interest. The Managing General Partner made no limited
partner unit repurchases during the three months ended
September 30, 2016 .

 

In the
Managing General Partner's opinion, the accompanying condensed
financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only
normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair statement of
this Partnership's results for interim periods in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America ("U.S. GAAP") and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and
Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. Accordingly, pursuant to
such rules and regulations, certain notes and other financial
information included in the audited financial statements have been
condensed or omitted. The December 31, 2015 condensed balance sheet
data was derived from financial statements audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent registered public
accounting firm, as indicated in their report filed with the SEC on
March 25, 2016, but does not include disclosures required by U.S.
GAAP. The information presented in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q should be read in conjunction with this Partnership's audited
financial statements and notes thereto included in this
Partnership's 2015 Form 10-K. This Partnership's accounting
policies are described in the Notes to Financial Statements in this
Partnership's 2015 Form 10-K and updated, as necessary, in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results of operations and cash
flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are
not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the
full year or any future period.

 


Note 2 -
Going Concern

 

This
Partnership has historically funded its operations with cash flows
from operations. This Partnership’s most significant cash
outlays have related to its operating expenses, capital program and
distributions to partners. This Partnership's revenue is primarily
influenced by crude oil sales. The commodity price for crude oil
generally remained strong from this Partnership's inception into
the fourth quarter of 2014. However, crude oil prices decreased
significantly during 2015 and continued to be depressed during the
first six months of 2016 with some improvement during the three
months ended September 30, 2016 . Although this Partnership's
production increased 24% during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior year
period, as a result of the lower commodity prices, this Partnership
generated modest revenue of $628,000 during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 . Further, there was no improvement in this
Partnership's liquidity during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 as cash flows generated from crude oil,
natural gas and NGLs sales were utilized for operating activities
and capital expenditures.

 

This
Partnership's strained liquidity position resulting from declining
commodity prices raises substantial doubt about its ability to
continue as a going concern. Due to the significant decrease in
liquidity experienced in 2015 that has continued into 2016 and
anticipated future capital expenditures required to remain in
compliance with certain regulatory requirements and to satisfy
asset retirement obligations, the Managing General Partner believes
that cash flows from operations will be insufficient to meet this
Partnership’s obligations. The price of crude oil during the
three months ended September 30, 2016 has shown improvement over
pricing experienced during the first half of 2016. This level of
price improvement alone is not likely to be sufficient to alleviate

regarding this Partnership’s ability to meet its obligations.
One of this Partnership's most significant obligations is to the
Managing General Partner, a portion of which is currently past due,
for reimbursement of costs paid on behalf of this Partnership by
the Managing General Partner. Such amounts are generally paid to
third parties for general and administrative expenses and equipment
and operating costs, as well as monthly operating fees payable to
the Managing General Partner. Beginning in the second quarter of
2015 and continuing during the nine months ended September 30,
2016 , this Partnership made no quarterly cash distributions to the
Managing General Partner or Investor Partners.

 

The
ability of this Partnership to continue as a going concern is
dependent upon its ability to attain a level of cash flows from
operations sufficient to fund current and future obligations and to
allow for distributions to limited partners. Greater cash flow
would most likely occur from improved commodity pricing and, to a
lesser extent, a sustained increase in production. However,
historically, as a result of the normal production decline in a
well's production life cycle, this Partnership has not experienced
a sustained increase in production without capital
expenditures.

 

The
Managing General Partner is considering various options to mitigate
risks that raise substantial doubt about this Partnership’s
ability to continue as a going concern, including, but not limited
to, deferral of payment of certain obligations (the majority of
which are due to the Managing General Partner), continued
suspension of distributions to partners, partial or complete sale
of assets and the shutting-in of wells. However, there can be no
assurance that this Partnership will be able to mitigate such
conditions. Failure to do so could result in a partial asset sale
or some form of bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution of this
Partnership.

 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of
operations, realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities
and commitments in the normal course of business. The financial
statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if this
Partnership is unable to continue as a going concern.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards

 

In May
2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") and the
International Accounting Standards Board issued their converged
standard on revenue recognition that provides a single,
comprehensive model that entities will apply to determine the
measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized. The
underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to
depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount
that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those
goods or services. The standard outlines a five-step approach to
apply the underlying principle: (1) identify the contract with the
customer, (2) identify the separate performance obligations in the
contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the
transaction price to separate performance obligations and (5)
recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is
satisfied. In March 2016, the FASB issued an update to the standard
intended to improve the operability and understandability of the
implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations
when recognizing revenue. The revenue standard is effective for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017,
including interim periods within that reporting period. The revenue
standard can be adopted under the full retrospective method or
simplified transition method. Entities are permitted to adopt the
revenue standard early, beginning with annual reporting periods
after December 15, 2016. The Managing General Partner of this
Partnership is currently evaluating the impact these changes may
have on this Partnership's financial statements.

 

In August
2014, the FASB issued a new standard related to the disclosure of
uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going
concern. The new standard will explicitly require management to
assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern every
reporting period and to provide related footnote disclosures in
certain circumstances. The new standard will be effective for all
entities in the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016,
with early adoption permitted. This Partnership expects to adopt
this standard in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adoption of this
standard is not expected to have a significant impact on this
Partnership's financial statements.

 

In August
2016, the FASB issued an accounting update on statements of cash
flows to address diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts
and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of
cash flows. The update addresses eight specific cash flow issues
with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.
The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early
adoption permitted. The Managing

General Partner or Investor Partners as cash flows generated from
crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales were utilized for operating
activities and capital expenditures. Cash distributions during the
nine months ended September 30, 2015 include $767 related to cash
distributions for Investor Partner units repurchased by
PDC.




 


Note 5 -
Fair Value Measurements

 

This
Partnership's fair value measurements were estimated pursuant to a
fair value hierarchy that requires this Partnership to maximize the
use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs when measuring fair value. The valuation hierarchy is based
upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or
liability as of the measurement date, giving the highest priority
to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest
priority to unobservable data (Level 3). In some cases, the inputs
used to measure fair value might fall in different levels of the
fair value hierarchy. In these cases, the lowest level input that
is significant to a fair value measurement in its entirety
determines the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy.
Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value
measurement in its entirety requires judgment, considering factors
specific

to the
asset or liability, and may affect the valuation of the assets and
liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy
levels. The carrying value of the financial instruments included in
current assets and current liabilities approximate fair value due
to the short-term maturities of these instruments.

 

The
Managing General Partner utilizes fair value, on a non-recurring
basis, to perform impairment testing on this Partnership's crude
oil and natural gas properties by comparing net capitalized costs,
or carrying value, to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows.
If net capitalized costs exceed undiscounted future net cash flows,
the measurement of impairment is based on estimated fair value and
is measured by the amount by which the net capitalized costs exceed
their estimated fair value.

 


Note 6 -
Commitments and Contingencies

 

Legal
Proceedings

 

Neither
this Partnership nor PDC, in its capacity as the Managing General
Partner of this Partnership, are party to any pending legal
proceeding that PDC believes would have a materially adverse effect
on this Partnership's business, financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity.

 

Environmental

 

Due to the
nature of the oil and gas industry, this Partnership is exposed to
environmental risks. The Managing General Partner has various
policies and procedures in place to prevent environmental
contamination and mitigate the risks from environmental
contamination. The Managing General Partner conducts periodic
reviews to identify changes in this Partnership's environmental
risk profile. Liabilities are accrued when environmental
remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably
estimated. These liabilities are reduced as remediation efforts are
completed or are adjusted as a consequence of subsequent periodic
reviews.

 

During the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 , as a result of
the Managing General Partner's periodic review, no new
environmental remediation projects were identified and this
Partnership's expense for environmental remediation efforts was not
significant. This Partnership had no liabilities for environmental
remediation efforts as of September 30, 2016 or
December 31, 2015 .

 

The
Managing General Partner is not currently aware of any
environmental claims existing as of September 30, 2016 which
have not been provided for or would otherwise have a material
impact on this Partnership's condensed financial statements;
however, there can be no assurance that current regulatory
requirements will not change or that unknown past non-compliance
with environmental laws or other potential sources of liability
will not be discovered on this Partnership's properties.

 

In August
2015, the Managing General Partner received a Clean Air Act Section
114 Information Request (the "Information Request") from the United
States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"). The Information
Request sought, among other things, information related to the
design, operation, and maintenance of certain production facilities
in the Denver-Julesburg Basin of Colorado. The Information Request
focused on historical operation and design information for 46
production facilities, of which one relates to this Partnership,
and asked that the Managing General Partner conduct sampling and
analyses at the identified 46 facilities. The Managing General
Partner responded to the Information Request in January 2016. The
Managing General Partner continues to meet with the EPA and provide
additional information, but cannot predict the outcome of this
matter at this time.

 

In
addition, in December 2015, the Managing General Partner received a
Compliance Advisory pursuant to C.R.S. § 25-7-115(2) from the
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment's Air Quality
Control Commission's Air Pollution Control Division alleging that
the Managing General Partner had failed to design, operate, and
maintain certain condensate collection, storage, processing and
handling operations to minimize leakage of volatile organic
compounds to the maximum extent possible at 65 facilities
consistent with applicable standards under Colorado law. Certain of
this Partnership's wells were included in this list of 65
facilities. The Managing General Partner is working with the agency
to address the allegations, but cannot predict the outcome of this
matter at this time.

The
current portion of the asset retirement obligations relates to
wells that are producing minimal or no hydrocarbons and are
expected to be plugged and abandoned within the next 12
months.

 

This
Partnership's estimated asset retirement obligation liability is
based on historical experience in plugging and abandoning wells,
estimated economic lives, estimated plugging and abandonment cost
and federal and state regulatory requirements. The liability is
discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate estimated at
the time the liability is incurred or revised. In periods
subsequent to initial measurement of the liability, this
Partnership must recognize period-to-period changes in the
liability resulting from the passage of time, revisions to either
the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows or
changes in inflation factors and changes to this Partnership's
credit-adjusted risk-free rate as market conditions
warrant.

Impairment of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties
