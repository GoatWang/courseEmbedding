DBRS Confirms All Classes of WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2014-C25, Stable Trends


December 2, 2016







DBRS, Inc. (DBRS) has today confirmed the ratings for all classes of Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2014-C25 issued by WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2014-C25 as follows:

-- Class A-1 at AAA (sf) 
-- Class A-2 at AAA (sf) 
-- Class A-3 at AAA (sf) 
-- Class A-4 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-5 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-S at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-SB at AAA (sf)
-- Class X-A at AAA (sf) 
-- Class X-B at AAA (sf)
-- Class X-C at AAA (sf)
-- Class X-D at AAA (sf)
-- Class X-E at AAA (sf) 
-- Class B at AA (low) (sf) 
-- Class C at A (low) (sf) 
-- Class PEX at A (low) (sf)
-- Class D at BBB (low) (sf) 
-- Class E at BB (sf) 
-- Class F at B (sf) 

All trends are Stable. Up to the full certificate balance of the Class A-S, Class B and Class C certificates may be exchanged for Class PEX certificates and vice versa.

The rating confirmations reflect the overall stable performance of the transaction, which has experienced a collateral reduction of 0.9% since closing as a result of scheduled loan amortization. At issuance, the pool consisted of 59 fixed-rate loans secured by 73 commercial and multifamily properties. As at the November 2016 remittance, all loans remain in the pool with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $868.2 million. According to the most recent year-end reporting, the pool reported a weighted-average (WA) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.83 times (x) and a WA debt yield of 10.3%. At issuance, the DBRS WA DSCR and debt yield for the pool were 1.61x and 9.0%, respectively. Per YE2015 financials, the top 15 loans reported a WA DSCR of 1.86x and a WA net cash flow (NCF) increase of 12.2% over the DBRS underwritten cash flows.

As at the November 2016 remittance, there are no loans in special servicing and six loans are on the servicers watchlist, representing 10.5% of the current pool balance. Of these six loans, two have been flagged for deferred maintenance concerns generally minor in nature, one was flagged for a casualty event that is being addressed and another loan, representing 0.6% of the pool balance, has been watchlisted because of a market-driven performance decline (see below). The two other loans (both secured by apartment complexes in Warrensville Heights, Ohio, and owned by the same sponsor) have reported cash flow declines from the DBRS UW figures of -23.9% and -27.4% as at YE2015 resulting from increased operating expenses, as occupancy and rental rates have remained stable. Both loans have reported an improvement with the Q2 2016 annualized financials.

The two largest loans in the pool, representing 23.0% of the total pool balance, are secured by large regional malls operated by Simon Property Group and are highlighted below.

The St. Johns Town Center loan (Prospectus ID#1; 11.5% of the current pool balance) is secured by a 1.4 million square foot (sf) regional mall located in Jacksonville, Florida, and is considered to be the pre-eminent shopping destination in the city. As at September 2016, mall occupancy remains strong at 98.1% with an average rental rate of $29.83 per square foot (psf)  figures comparable with 99.3% and $27.04 psf at issuance, respectively. The slight decrease in occupancy is attributable to the premature departure of Forever 21 (1.5% of the net rentable area (NRA)) in March 2016, which was noted as a surprise as the store appeared to be popular with shoppers. This space currently represents the largest vacancy at the mall, and according to local news reports, Apple is planning to move into this space from its smaller unit at the mall, with a $3.5 million build-out planned. In addition, several large tenants have recently executed five-year lease renewals, including Jo-Ann Fabrics, Ross Dress for Less, DSW Shoe Warehouse and Barnes & Noble. Tenant rollover remains minimal in the next 12 months. The loan, which is interest only (IO) for the full term, reported a Q3 2016 whole-loan DSCR of 2.43x, an improvement over 2.32x at YE2015, and represents an annualized NCF increase of +20.5% over the DBRS UW figures. 

At issuance, DBRS assigned an investment-grade shadow rating to this loan. DBRS has today confirmed that the performance of this loan remains consistent with investment-grade loan characteristics.

The Colorado Mills loan (Prospectus ID#2; 11.5% of the current pool balance) is secured by a 1.1 million sf regional mall located in Lakewood, Colorado, a Denver suburb. The subject is the largest mall statewide with the most in-line space and contains a mix of regular and outlet space tenants as well as some non-traditional tenants, such as an indoor trampoline park and an indoor putting green park. Mall occupancy has recently declined to 85.2% as a result of Sports Authority (4.0% of the NRA) vacating its 43,500 sf anchor space in July 2016; however, this space is being assumed by Dicks Sporting Goods with an April 1, 2017 planned opening date, as per the online mall directory. There is considerable upcoming tenant rollover as United Artists Theatre (7.5% of the NRA), JumpStreet (3.7% of the NRA) and Saks Off 5th (2.5% of the NRA) have leases maturing in the second half of 2017. Junior anchor Burlington Coat Factory recently executed a five-year renewal through 2021 at a similar rental rate. The loan reported a Q2 2016 whole-loan DSCR of 2.08x on an amortizing basis, in line with YE2015, and represents an annualized NCF increase of 16.1% over the DBRS UW figures. The loan has a remaining IO term of 11 months.

The loans sponsor, Simon Property Group, is currently developing another outlet mall, the 320,000 sf Denver Premium Outlets located 21 miles north of the subject with a planned opening in October 2017. DBRS believes the impact to the subject will be minimal, as the new mall will be located much farther out and will not have the large population and existing infrastructure surrounding the subject, which benefits from being closely located to Interstate 70 and Highway 6.

The Cornerstone Apartments loan (Prospectus ID#38; 0.6% of the current pool balance) is secured by a 120-unit multifamily complex located in Midland, Texas. The loan has been placed on the servicers watchlist as a result of a decline in property performance resulting from the decline in the energy-based local economy. As at June 2016, the property was 82.5% occupied with an average rental rate of $712 per unit, a decline from 97.5% and $774 per unit at issuance, respectively. The current vacancy rate is in line with the 16.2% vacancy rate reported by Reis for similar vintage properties in the Midland-Odessa market. The March 2016 property inspection revealed that lowered rents, move-in incentives and solid long-term management have prevented an even larger occupancy decline. During the inspection, it was noted that the neighboring residential complex was 52% vacant at the time. The Q2 2016 DSCR of 1.22x reflects an NCF decline of 32.3% from the DBRS UW figures. With collateral performance dependent on a recovery in the local economy, the loan is expected to perform at a similar level in the medium term.

The ratings assigned to the Classes C, E, F and PEX certificates materially deviate from the higher ratings implied by the quantitative model. DBRS considers a material deviation to be a rating differential of three or more notches between the assigned rating and the rating implied by the quantitative model that is a substantial component of a rating methodology; in this case, the rating reflects the sustainability of loan performance trends not demonstrated.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
