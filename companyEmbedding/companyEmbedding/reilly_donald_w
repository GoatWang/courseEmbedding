Dupont Company and then by Stone & Webster Engineering Corporation (now Shaw Stone & Webster Construction), Don worked on and managed construction projects building laboratories, dams and power facilities in Delaware, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. He married the late Claire Lachmar, with whom he had two children, Stephen Moran Reilly and Julie Anne Reilly. Asked by Stone & Webster to take over management of the rebuilding of Chong Pyong Hydroelectric Dam northeast of Seoul, he moved with his family to Korea in the early 1960's. At the completion of that project in 1965 he was recruited by the U.S. State Department's Agency for International Development (USAID), for whom he worked until 1987, managing engineering and economic development projects in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Africa, and serving as Deputy Director and then Director of the USAID Technical Resources for Africa Office in Washington, D.C. Don's first marriage ended in 1970; in 1982 he married his wife of 27 years, Julie Harbaugh, a native of St. Louis MO, and they moved together to Washington, D.C. First working out of USAID's regional office in Nairobi and then USAID headquarters in Washington, D.C., he was a key player in projects battling drought, locust infestations and famine in Africa-all part of USAID's fight against starvation in Africa in the 1980's. In 1987 the agency honored Don with the USAID Outstanding Career Achievement Award for two decades of engineering and humanitarian work in Asia and Africa. At the time, asked what he considered his most satisfying and challenging work, he talked about the innovative irrigation system he designed that helped to raise both crops and hope in one of the world's driest areas-Afghanistan, coincidentally his all-time favorite post. That irrigation system--in ruins after the 1979 Soviet invasion-was partially restored, a restoration project on which Don was asked to participate but forced to decline due to the demands of his cancer treatment. He retired from USAID in 1987, and he and Julie moved back to the Midwest, settling in Ballwin MO. During the next 10 years he consulted to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), various private corporations and the United Nations. A lover of the outdoors, Don enjoyed running, hiking, rock climbing, sailing and camping. He was an expert marksman with a lifelong interest in guns and rifles and a passion for their correct handling, maintenance, preservation and safe use. Always looking to the heavens, the stars and constellations, he enjoyed astronomy, dark skies and black holes, interests he shared with fellow members of The St. Louis Astronomical Society. A lifelong "aviation nut" he (in mild competition with Wayne & Sue Beer) could identify any aircraft, and he achieved a long-time goal when he was able to attend the Experimental Aircraft Association's (EAA) Oshkosh Air Show and share this passion with "the Doolittle Road Community," with whom he and Julie camped during the show every summer for many years. He read widely and continually, with particular interest in World War II, military history, politics, international affairs, science and everything else. He enjoyed movies, and--while he did enjoy watching them--he reveled even more in discussing (debating) them with fellow movie buffs. He could fix or "jury rig" anything, craft amazing objects and artifacts, build things that were "hell for strong," and constantly amaze with his skill and creativity. One area in which he had questions throughout his life was "religion." When asked about his "religious affiliation" Don would respond: "When I was growing up my parents considered themselves Lutherans. My sister converted to the Roman Catholic religion when she married and 'dragged me' along to her pre-marriage catechism classes. In North Carolina we belonged to a Methodist church and I taught Bible Study

classes to teenagers. My various jobs took me to places where I was exposed to eastern religions and to the Muslim faith. I have read The Great Religions of the World several times. I know that, throughout history, religion has been at the root of many of the world's conflicts and wars and "man's inhumanity to man." Why can't we all just 'do unto others'?" Don loved life, family and friends; dogs (cats liked him); his back porch (which he designed and built) and backyard (particularly when Oreo, Max, Melanie, Tillie, Neka or other 4-footed friends were visiting); travel (especially to visit friends Dick & Mary Scott in Estes Park, Colorado; Bill & Kitty Mossman on Vacation Lane in Ludington, Michigan; the Beers in northern Minnesota; the Schaufs and Ponder(osa) at Bison Creek Ranch in East Glacier Park, Montana); Heidi & Craig MacQueen and all the critters at Meadow View Ranch; nature and the out-of-doors; camping and campfires (especially with Joe, John & Mark-his "WW III" camping buddies); beer (preferably the cheap brands) ... the list goes on and on. He will be remembered for many things, and everyone whose life he touched has unique and individual memories. However, it is probably true that everyone who knew him will remember him as the man of continual and persistent and "won't go away" questions. Does he now have all his answers?

In a world that has an abundance of of bull, I think Don was the real thing. The time I spent with him was brief but he always made me feel like he liked me and I certainly liked him.

My deepest sympathy to the family. Claire and Steven and Julie
came to stay with my family in Long Beach, California on their
way to South Korea when Donald was put in charge of the dam project.
I hope everyone is doing well and again my deepest sympathy.

Julie   I am so sorry for your loss.  I too am widowed.  Yesterday it was 2 yrs  since I lost my husband of 30 yrs.  It  is all fresh in my mind so if you would like to talk --  please email me!     I know at first many people are telling you this, so  keep it in mind.  I would love to hear from you anyway to just talk about the old days on Juniata and the old group we ran with.      Take care and tell Martha HI for me too!!!        Judi Stockmann - formerly at 3940 Juniata ...  hope you remember me!!  lol  I remember you!!  HUGS!!!

Don changed everyone whose life he touched.  I feel so blest to have known him and his special zest and appreciation for life. Holding memories of him in my heart.  Holding Julie in my heart and prayers.




			
				
				Posted by: Janet Dunlap - St. Louis,  MO   Dec 27, 2009
			










Don's blue eyes would sparkle when he contemplated the current fishing plans with Alexander or backyard camping with Nicolas or the shared collection of matchbox cars with Patrick.  He talked glowingly of the Ludington, Michigan, trips, hanging out with Lucas and Zander.  Don's love and nurturing is his finest legacy.




			
				
				Posted by: Ruth Harbaugh - Camas,  MO   Dec 05, 2009
			










Palo Duro Canyon, Montana, air shows, museums, adventure--that was Don. Non-fiction with heft but no fiction--that was Don.    Jigsaw puzzles, camping, dogs, endless inventive projects--that was Don.  We should all be so complex and so missed.




			
				
				Posted by: Hank Harbaugh - Camas,  WA   Dec 04, 2009
			










Dear Julie,     I was so saddened to see Don's obituary today.  I'm sorry for your loss. Please know you and your family are in my thoughts and prayers.




			
				
				Posted by: Ginnie Piper Grant - Chicago,  IL   Nov 30, 2009
			










Don was so very unique it is difficult to find the words to describe him.  I do know he loved salads, the more onions the better, dogs of all shapes and sizes, Goodwill, projects and his family, not necessarily in that order.  He called me Marf.  I will miss him but, oh my, will I remember him!




			
				
				Posted by: Martha Harbaugh - Saint Louis,  MO   Nov 27, 2009
			










A beautiful and informative description of Don and his life accomplishments and struggles. He is and will be deeply missed. I cherish the gift of knowing him and loving him and his gentle way of being.   I did see my name, so you know I read the whole thing! I wish I could have been of more help at the end for him and for you Julie!  Love always, Joan Mass
