                    The History of North Port  from North Port County Government

Incorporated in 1959, the City of North Port, Florida occupies 103 square miles of southeast Sarasota County midway between the cities of Sarasota and Fort Myers, near the Gulf of Mexico. North Port is one of the largest Florida cities in land area but is only 10 percent populated. The City began with a population of 178 and was originally known as North Port Charlotte. The name was later shortened to North Port, which helped to create an individual city identity. Since 1980, North Port's population has grown 120%, making it one of the fastest growing cities in Florida. According to the Bureau of Economic and Business Research, as of 2007 the city's population was 53,732. 

Why is North Port, Florida attracting families and business from all over at such an accelerated pace? Its beauty, convenience, economic development, job opportunities, some of the lowest property taxes in the southwest Florida region and a top notch public education infrastructure including a state of the art high school and middle school as well as a community college less than 5 miles away and 3 four-year institutions within a 60-mile radius. 

North Port has an unspoiled natural environment where wildlife flourishes among 95 miles of freshwater canals. It is also the only city in Florida that contains a state forest (Myakka State Forest) within its corporate boundaries. North Port offers a multitude of recreational opportunities such as golfing, fishing, horseback riding, canoeing and more. North Port encompasses fourteen miles of Interstate I-75 within its boundaries. It has two international airports within 45 minutes making, the City accessible to most major markets. Although, North Port is inland, its weather is influenced by the Gulf of Mexico. The average annual temperature of 76 degrees makes year-round living a pleasure, and the City is host to many seasonal residents as well.
