Huntington Place is the Place to be!



                                The apartment building I am in isn't in the best shape or condition, however the management and maintenance staff are always on top of it and take care of whatever you need done, whether it be new screen doors or a garbage disposal. 
The entire staff are incredibly kind and helpful! The apartments are spacious and not expensive for the space available. $530 a month for a two bedroom is a great deal. The living room is huge and the bedrooms aren't closet sized, that's for sure. They allow dogs in a few buildings and cats in all buildings for a small fee.

Huntington Place is the Place to be!



                                The apartment building I am in isn't in the best shape or condition, however the management and maintenance staff are always on top of it and take care of whatever you need done, whether it be new screen doors or a garbage disposal. 
The entire staff are incredibly kind and helpful! The apartments are spacious and not expensive for the space available. $530 a month for a two bedroom is a great deal. The living room is huge and the bedrooms aren't closet sized, that's for sure. They allow dogs in a few buildings and cats in all buildings for a small fee.

Huntington Place is the Place to be!



                                The apartment building I am in isn't in the best shape or condition, however the management and maintenance staff are always on top of it and take care of whatever you need done, whether it be new screen doors or a garbage disposal. 
The entire staff are incredibly kind and helpful! The apartments are spacious and not expensive for the space available. $530 a month for a two bedroom is a great deal. The living room is huge and the bedrooms aren't closet sized, that's for sure. They allow dogs in a few buildings and cats in all buildings for a small fee.
