Team of angel investors to fund PerioSciences LLC

In a sign that various Texas angel networks are starting to collaborate and share deals, four groups of wealthy investors in and near Dallas-Fort Worth have banded together to help commit more than $1.78 million into PerioSciences LLC, a Dallas supplier of antioxidant toothpastes, mouth rinses and anti-inflammatory oral gels.
Dallas-based Green Park & Golf Ventures LLC, a business arm of two well-to-do area families, committed about $352,750. Also committing were members of Dallas’ North Texas Angel Network (around $365,000), Fort Worth’s Cowtown Angels ($310,000), the newly-formed Tyler Texas Angel Network ($50,000), 25 or so dentists who are both shareholders in PerioSciences and who help sell its products ($275,000) and an assortment of other wealthy individuals ($430,484).





 


Investors say the decision to invest in PerioSciences was easy because of its founder and CEO, Russell Moon, who in May 2005 made his fortune by helping sell SkinCeuticals Inc. to the French cosmetics giant L’Oreal SA on undisclosed terms.
Like PerioSciences, SkinCeuticals’ antioxidant products fight what are known as “free radicals,” unstable molecules in the body which wreak havoc on cells, causing tissue damage, damaging the mouth and making the body break down as it ages.
While SkinCeuticals’ products use antioxidants to help protect and rejuvenate skin in the battle with free radicals, PerioSciences employs them to keep teeth, gums, the tongue, mucous lining of the cheeks and lips looking and feeling their best.
PerioSciences sells its wares through dentists and medical spas, and its products aren’t cheap. The company’s star offering, a dental gel called PerioSciences AO ProVantage, has a suggested retail price of $43 for a roughly 65-day supply. “We’re definitely premium,” Moon said. “We’re not trying to compete with the $6 Colgates.”
Moon invested about $3.1 million of his own money getting PerioSciences started, with that cash helping fund research, file patent applications and other costs. He declined to reveal a revenue number for PerioSciences, but said sales this year should be 500 percent more than in 2011.

With some 500 dental offices having ordered PerioSciences products, Moon will need more sales people, along with help in marketing, back office support, accounting and the like. He believes PerioSciences’ 12-person staff will double or triple in size over the next 12 months, with the cost of that partly funded by the round of financing the business received. PerioSciences should turn cash flow positive next year.




 


Investor groups work together
Just a few years ago, a North Texas entrepreneur like Moon would have needed to beat a bunch of bushes to rustle up a $1.8 million investment — assuming he could have found it at all. Venture capital has been scarce in North Texas for more than a decade, and besides, most VCs (with some exceptions) generally want to put at least $3 million to $5 million into a given deal. Angel investors, even in groups, would only pony up a few hundred grand.
But in 2012, DFW not only features more angel groups, but those groups are doing something that didn’t happen much in the past: Talking to each other. PerioSciences’ backers not only helped line up other investors that they knew, they shared the background research and other due diligence they’d done on the company and its management team.
“There’s no reason (for angel groups) to be exclusive,” said Darlene Ryan, executive director of TECH Fort Worth. “They want to get deals funded, and (work) with other friendly angel groups.”
PerioSciences is the first investment made by the Cowtown Angels, a program of the tech incubator that Ryan runs. She wasn’t exactly a stranger to the North Texas Angel Network, or NTAN, as she helped that Dallas group get off the ground around five years ago.
NTAN, in turn, helped get the Tyler Texas Angel Network into the PerioSciences mix. And the ultimate source for hooking up PerioSciences with the angel groups was Green Park & Golf Ventures.
“This is a nice little syndication to get Russell and his team expansion capital for sales, marketing and new product launches,” said Jim Lafferty, NTAN’s chairman. “This is a pretty cool deal. We’re proud of it.”
