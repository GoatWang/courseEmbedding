------------------------------------------------------
Jan. 8, 1993 – June 17, 2015

Keaton James Marek, a Kenmore native and political science major who graduated from George Washington University last month, died in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. He was 22.

Mr. Marek, who majored in political science and philosophy, was an intern at Rep. Brian Higgins' offices in Buffalo and Washington.

He loved to debate and have conversations about current issues. 

"He wanted to make the world a better place," said his mother Cynthia Marek.

Mr. Marek had been in the midst of job interviews and choosing where to move next. He enjoyed the big-city environment of D.C. and his hometown, where he interned at the Erie County Legislature and worked for Rich Product's catering service.

"He liked that blue-collar, the family, the more humble type of people that we have here in Buffalo," said Mrs. Marek. Her son took great pleasure in supporting groups he belonged to, like his fraternity Delta Tau Delta and sports teams.

"He loved his tribe," said Mrs. Marek. "He loved being part of Ken-West football. He was a very loyal person."

At Kenmore West High School, where he graduated in 2011, he won the 2010 Ken-West Football Joe Sardinia Memorial Award for his dedication, motivation and teamwork.

A member of the high school ecology club, he also volunteered for the Buffalo-Niagara Riverkeeper's semiannual Shoreline Sweep. He regularly donated blood to the Red Cross.

In college, he was on George Washington University's Blue Devils football and track teams. He also won the American Legion Award and the George Washington Board of Trustees scholarship.

"We were very proud of him," said Mrs. Marek. 

He is survived by his parents, Cynthia and James "Jake" Marek; his sister, Kelly; and two grandfathers, Joseph Marek Sr., and Ronald Buckanovich Sr.

The family plans a private memorial service.
