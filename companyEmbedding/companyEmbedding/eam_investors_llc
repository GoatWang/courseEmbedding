EAM Investors |  Philosophy









 









Investment Philosophy
Change Creates Opportunity
We define growth not by how a company has grown in the past, but rather how the company is positioned to grow in the future.  Our sole focus is finding the best "growth stocks of tomorrow."
 We find these opportunities by employing a behaviorally-based investment philosophy that seeks to exploit investor’s inefficient responses to changing information.  
	We believe this positions our investments for significant appreciation, as ultimately, investors recognize and reward a company’s accelerating earnings profile.  This focus on change positions our portfolios in companies that we 
	believe will become leaders of tomorrow. 


"We seek to capitalize on positive fundamental change
    by taking advantage of key behavioral biases and market inefficiencies."
     - Montie L. Weisenberger
 Managing Director & Portfolio Manager

EAM Investors |  Process










 










Investment Process
Change Creates Opportunity
Experience tells us it is essential to have a disciplined and objective stock selection process to identify favorable opportunities.  Our process is designed to create repeatable results for our clients and to build portfolios that deliver alpha consistently, adding value in three distinct areas: discovering opportunities consistently, analyzing changes effectively, and challenging our portfolios continually. 
Discover   |   Analyze   |   Challenge
 
Discover
Identifying the Signs and Symptoms of Positive Fundamental Change
Our systems are designed to consistently highlight opportunities in real-time that meet our investment philosophy.  The discovery process is built upon our founders’ years of experience in understanding, identifying, and capturing opportunities where companies are benefitting from positive fundamental change.
Back to top ›


Analyze
Understanding the Drivers of Change
We analyze each potential investment candidate to understand the clear and definable fundamental change that leads to sustainable earnings growth acceleration.  This fundamental change often positions the company to exceed expectations and leads to the potential to attain a higher multiple.  Accordingly, we focus our time on analyzing expectations and understanding how change may affect a company’s fundamentals in the future.
Back to top ›


Challenge
Minimizing Opportunity Costs, Enforcing Sell Disciplines, Driving Portfolios to Strength
 We believe that in dynamic and inefficient markets nothing can replace hard work and tenacity.  We do not rest upon past success.  We constantly employ our investment process to continually challenge our portfolios from the bottom-up.  
	Our goal is to position our clients' portfolios with the future in mind.

"At the core of our investment process is an unyielding and disciplined focus on 
identifying fundamental change, understanding the financial impact that change may bring, 
and making certain that we are looking at this new opportunity in a timely manner."
