Douglas F. Jenkins  - Prisoner of War Record

 






Douglas F. Jenkins was a Second Lieutenant in the Army during World War II. Douglas was captured by  Nazi Germany while serving in France. Douglas' capture was first reported to the International Committee of the Red Cross on January 9, 1945, and the last report was made on July 12, 1945. Based on these two reports, Douglas was imprisoned for at least 184 days (~7 months), one of the shorter durations of captivity recorded, the average being 363 days. Ultimately, Douglas was returned to military control, liberated or repatriated.

Insurance is a key component in helping you recover from accidents, disasters and lawsuits. At Jenkins, Douglas M, we have you covered. Our agents and support staff are here to give you the right insurance related advice based on your specific needs – helping you get the right coverage for you, your family and/or your business. While we can help you with almost any type of insurance, or guide you to the right partner of ours here are some of the key areas that most folk require insurance -

Home Insurance (including renters insurance, condo insurance) – every community and locality has specific needs. Some areas are more prone to fires, others to floods. Our agents understand the vagaries of homeowners insurance needed in the Portland, OR area and we can help you get great insurance coverage for – fire protection, flood insurance, insuring valuables, and even personal umbrella insurance – coverage that gives you additional peace of mind.
Auto Insurance – in the vast majority of states it is illegal to drive without at the very minimum liability insurance coverage for a vehicle you drive. But, the nuances are different from state to state and in some cases county and city rules may require special consideration. Our agents can help you navigate the different auto insurance coverages, riders and recommend carriers, pricing and adequate coverage based on your specific needs.
Business insurance – every business has different needs. While all businesses need some form of liability insurance; professional services need additional E&O, there are specific needs for each and every class of business - for example construction/contractors may need specific coverage based on the location (Portland, OR); and many blue collar businesses need special commercial auto insurance and workers compensation coverages.
Pick up the phone – call 503-221-4646, we would love to hear your story, give you some great insurance advice, and if you think we can get you some comparative quotes, we will use our expertise to your advantage.
