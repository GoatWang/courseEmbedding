Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

                          Stock prices used are the "total returns" stock price and will include
                          dividends, spinoffs, splits, and other adjustments.  Because of this, stock
                          prices shown here will likely not

How to Maintain and Protect Your Motorcycle Battery One of the most over-looked aspects of motorcycles is battery maintenance. For many, there is a time during the year you put your motorcycle away for storage for a few months. Or even let it sit inactive for a longer period of time. This can be a huge problem, as batteries don't respond well to inactivity. Motorcycle batteries that sit for longer periods of time will build up sulphation on the battery plates. The sulphation will cause your battery's run-time, performance, and life to noticeably decrease. In the more advanced stages, the battery can be difficult (or even impossible) to charge or start your motorcycle. However, you can prevent this from happening and ensure that your battery holds up after inactivity: Use an automatic battery charger/maintainer: These units plug into standard 120VAC outlets and provide your battery with a charge current. This will keep the battery fully charged and maintained so that sulphation never builds up. It also helps towards breaking up loose sulphation that already may be present. Automatic chargers like the BatteryMINDer by VDC or Battery Tender by Deltran are perfect for these applications. Both of these brands can maintain your batteries in ways that prevent damage to your battery. It is always recommended if you're using a maintainer on any wet battery to make sure you monitor the water level of the battery. These chargers are fully automatic and can be left connected to your battery all the time. Keep your motorcycle battery in top shape: There are many types of batteries, and the two most common types for motorcycles are conventional (wet) and dry AGM (absorbed glass mat) batteries. In some cases BMW motorcycles use Gel batteries. In these cases a specific Gel charger must be used as standard chargers will not work on Gel batteries. If you have a conventional battery, you'll need to keep an eye on your fluid levels and add distilled water as needed. You should also clean your terminals with cleaning chemicals and protect them with a corrosion preventative. Do not let your motorcycle battery freeze: Whenever you decide to store your bike's battery, be sure it's in a place that does not consistently fall below freezing. This is an extremely quick way to find yourself with a cracked battery. If you keep a battery maintainer connected to your battery, this also helps work towards keeping the battery from freezing. If you'd like to look a little more in-depth or see some recommendations, please check out our article on the subject. If you have any questions about battery maintenance and would like to speak with one of our battery specialists, please give us a call at 1-800-405-2121.   Keeping Your Motorcycle Battery in Top Condition Motorcycle batteries tend to last between 3 and 5 years before needing to be replaced as long as the batteries are properly maintained. As with any battery that sits for longer periods of time without being used such as sitting through the winter months, the battery naturally lose their charge over time & will build up sulphation on the battery plates. This is the number one reason for premature battery failure. In spite of various opinions once enough heavy sulphation builds up on the battery plates it is very difficult if not impossible to reverse this process. Thus the reason for using a battery maintainer so the sulphation process never starts to begin with and the battery is kept fully charged. If your motorcycle battery is going to sit unused for longer than a month it is always recommended to use any 1-2 amp fully automatic battery maintainer such as the Battery Tender or Battery Minder. There are two reasons for this: Keep sulphation from building up on the battery plates.Keep the battery fully charged. It is also advantageous to remove battery cables from the battery as this eliminates any possible draws from the battery. There are three types of motorcycle batteries. Wet, Gel, and AGM (Absorbed Glass Mat). Most manufacturers use Wet or AGM batteries. The biggest issue with Gel batteries is they charge at a lower rate then Wet or AGM batteries. Wet and AGM batteries have the same charging characteristics. If you're using a Gel battery, the charging system must be set up specifically for Gel batteries as with any battery maintainer which also must be set to do Gel batteries. A Wet battery's biggest draw back is the battery acid which can evaporate if it sits for longer periods of time, especially if connected to a battery maintainer for that time. If you have a Wet battery where you can check the fluid levels then you should always do so and keep the fluid levels topped off. The positive and negative connections on any battery should always be kept cleaned to ensure maximum transfer of electrical charge. There are special products that are made just for this type of maintenance, although using water and baking soda is effective for most people. By properly maintaining any battery you can greatly enhance battery life which can result in having a working battery for years to come.
