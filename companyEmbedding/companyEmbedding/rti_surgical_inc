Products & Implants

Regardless of what type of implant is chosen for surgery, we provide healthcare professionals with surgical solutions they can trust.





Cardiothoracic
RTI provides surgeons cardiothoracic and trauma metal cable, plating systems and a biologic implant. Cardiothoracic implants offer increased stability and flexibility for sternal closures, ranging from routine closures to complex, high-risk closures.

Extremities
RTI offers surgeons biologic options for soft tissue, wound and bone graft needs used in surgical procedures such as chronic wounds and filling of bone void defects. Shaped and sized to strict specifications in controlled clean rooms, implants are processed to ensure safety and efficacy.

Orthobiologics
Orthobiologics include biologic and synthetic-based moldable and flowable bone void fillers, chips and cubes and cellular allogeneic bone grafts. These safe, high-quality implants can be used to fill bone voids or for repairing fractures and skeletal defects.

Spine
RTI provides surgeons with a variety of biologic, metal and synthetic-based implants for use in spinal surgery. Implants include allograft and PEEK-OPTIMA® (from Invibio® Biomaterials Solutions) spacers along with spinal stabilization devices used primarily in cervical and thoracolumbar fusion procedures. RTI also has a comprehensive lateral product offering along with an innovative minimally-invasive thoracolumbar fixation system used to treat a broad range of spinal disorders. RTI pioneered the shaping of allograft tissue to specific sizes and configurations to make spine surgery more convenient for surgeons and give patients more options.

Company History


Company History





From a small tissue bank at the University of Florida to a global surgical implant company with four world-class manufacturing facilities, RTI Surgical (RTI) has a history of innovation. 






 

Tutoplast® Tissue Sterilization Process developed
January 1969
The Tutoplast Tissue Sterilization Process was developed to sterilize and preserve tissue for implantation. The Tutoplast Process inactivates pathogens and removes bacteria, and the low dose gamma irradiation ensures sterility of the final packaged product.  
 
 


 

Pioneer® Surgical Technology Formed
May 1992
Dr. Matthew Songer, an orthopedic surgeon, founded Pioneer in 1992 in Marquette, MI. Songer was not satisfied with the spinal cables on the market, which encouraged him to develop his own, a product we still distribute, called the Songer® Spinal Cable.
 
 


 

Tutogen Medical® formed
October 1992
In October 1992, Tutogen Medical (Tutogen) forms and builds its headquarters in Neunkirchen am Brand, Germany. Tutogen manufactures safe, high-quality xenograft and allograft implants for use in surgeries around the globe.  
 
 


 

Precision tooled allograft introduced
January 1996
The first allograft to be precision tooled, a threaded cortical dowel, was introduced by University of Florida Tissue Bank.
 
 


 

Tutogen expands to Florida
January 1998
Tutogen expands to the United States by moving its corporate headquarters to Progress Park in Alachua, Fla.  
 
 


 

Regeneration Technologies, Inc. begins operations
February 1998
RTI began operations as Regeneration Technologies in Alachua, Fla. In February 1998, the University of Florida Tissue Bank transferred its allograft processing operations, related equipment and technologies, distribution arrangements, and research and development activities to Regeneration Technologies. This spin off from the University of Florida (UF) is one of the most successful UF technology transfers to date.   
 
 


 

BioCleanse® Tissue Sterilization Process developed
March 2000
In March 2000, RTI made history in the allograft industry by developing its patented BioCleanse Sterilization Process. The BioCleanse Process is a low-temperature chemical sterilization process that inactivates or removes bacteria, fungi, spores and viruses from tissue without compromising the tissue’s biocompatibility or structural integrity.  
 
 


 

RTI listed on NASDAQ®
August 2000
RTI completed an initial public offering in August 2000 and began trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol RTIX.   
 
 


 

Assembled Implant Patent
August 2002
US Patent for assembled bone implants issued on August 6, 2002.
 
 


 

Regeneration Technologies merges with Tutogen to form RTI Biologics®
February 2008
In February 2008, Regeneration Technologies became a global company after merging with Tutogen, creating RTI Biologics, Inc. Both companies were located in Progress Park in Alachua, Fla. Following the merger, RTI became one of the leading providers of sterile biologic implants for surgeries, offering surgeons both allograft and xenograft implants.
 
 


 

RTI Biologics acquires Pioneer Surgical Technology to form RTI Surgical® 
July 2013
RTI acquired Marquette, Mich.-based Pioneer® Surgical Technology, Inc., a global manufacturer of metal and synthetic implants, becoming RTI Surgical. In July 2013, the acquisition resulted in an expanded product portfolio. Today, RTI provides surgeons with safe biologic, metal and synthetic-based implants.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
